a stingray weighing nearly 800lb has become the largest freshwater fish ever caught by rod and line
it was caught by american tv nature conservationist jeff corwin on the mae klong river in thailand earlier this week
after the catch mr jeff corwin tweeted : ' potential world record freshwater fish , giant stingray , 14ft x 8ft ! in thailand filming for abc 's ocean mysteries
' he added : ' according to national geographic , fishsiam and dr nantarika chansue , a leading stingray expert , this is likely to be the largest freshwater fish ever caught with a rod and reel
a specially - prepared pen was used to contain the ray while mr jeff corwin , fishermen and specialists examined it it is thought the previous record was held by british angler ian welch , who landed a giant stingray weighing between 590lbs and 770lbs in the same river in 2009 ' the larger specimens are always female and quite often pregnant , as was the case with this capture
the guinness book of world records lists the mekong giant catfish , weighing up to 660lbs , as the ' world 's largest freshwater fish ' .
