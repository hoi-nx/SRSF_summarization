a record has been set for the most snowfall in a day after a tiny italian village was dumped with 100 inches in 18 hours - forcing residents to ski between houses and climb out of second - floor windows
the village of capracotta , located in central italy around 125 miles east of rome , was hit with the polar blast on march 5 in a remarkable blizzard aggravated by powerful wind gusts
breaking a 1921 record set in silver lake , colorado , of 76 inches , incredible photos from inside the village show walls of snow carved out from the fronts of doors and shops
remarkably , the town is not located within the alps - its susceptibility to massive dumpings of snow lies in its unique geography and location
