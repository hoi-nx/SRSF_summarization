australia : they âve done it again
to watch them against new zealand was to watch expectation thrash hope
australia âs self - belief can not simply be transplanted into other cricketing cultures
michael clarke was the impressive leader of australia 's equally impressive cricket world cup triumph no team could stop the australian claiming yet another cricket world cup , this time on home soil less than two years ago everyone was having a good chuckle at homeworkgate and david warner
australia lost 4 - 0 in india , david warner swung for joe root , and mickey arthur was put out to pasture a fortnight before the ashes
while england creaked their way through a flattering 3 - 0 win that summer , convincing themselves that all was well with the world , australia âs new coach darren lehmann was thanking god for a schedule that would give his side a crack at instant revenge
australia âs nadirs are as low as anyone âs â they just last less long
it is inconceivable that they would tolerate , as england are in the process of doing , a period of failure that extends far beyond the dictionary definition of â transition â
for that , as much as anything , their latest cricket world cup win deserves an admiring nod
australia generally know when and how to peak
brad haddin , who claimed he felt uncomfortable about new zealand âs niceness during the build - up to the group game at auckland , was at the centre of things , as he often is
after guptill was bowled by glenn maxwell , brad haddin felt the need to clap his gloves in guptill âs face
then , after the dismissal of elliott , brad haddin and james faulkner sent him packing with various snarls and grimaces
brad haddin clapped in guptill 's face after the new zealand batsman was bowled during the final elliott ( left ) was also given a less - than - sporting send - off by brad haddin and james faulkner ( second right ) a meme doing the rounds used both this image and one of brendon mccullum shaking michael clarke âs hand at the end of his match - clinching 74 to compare and contrast the teams â attitudes
the immediate postscript of new zealand âs win over south africa in the semi-final was the sight of elliott comforting the stricken dale steyn , like andrew flintoff and brett lee all over again
australia , on the other hand , gurned their way through victory over india in sydney , with mitchell starc harrying suresh raina , and david warner applauding from the balcony after his fellow wallflower virat kohli dropped brad haddin
david warner , ( left ) spraying beer at the mcg after sunday 's victory , is well known for his brash attitude the australian ' behaviour harks back to the example set by the likes of merv hughes ( second right ) no australian cricket - lover i know enjoys this sort of thing , though some on twitter claim with some justification that the poms are in no position to talk : see the life and crimes of anderson
but england fans are also aware that anderson âs sledging contributed to their team âs unpopularity during the years when andy flower âs side was doing well
if there were neutrals out there who did nât want new zealand to win the final , they did nât immediately advertise the fact
now , he appears to be at it again , this time after he was denied the chance to hand over the cricket world cup to the australian team on the podium at the mcg on sunday
look out for the very short - term appointment of yet another england captain â¦ kevin pietersen ( left ) celebrated australia 's cricket world cup win with pal james faulkner best bib and tucker it âs easy to forget there were two australian captains at the cricket world cup : michael clarke â¦ and george bailey , who played one game , scored 55 against england , and ceded both the armband and his place in the side when michael clarke returned from injury
spies in australia tell us that , 18 hours after the cricket world cup final , a bleary - eyed george bailey appeared at a civic reception still wearing the fluorescent bib that appeared affixed to him for most of the tournament
