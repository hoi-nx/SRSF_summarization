gissendaner was convicted in a february 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban atlanta
details of the crime , as laid out at trial and provided by georgia attorney general sam olens , are as follows : kelly gissendaner and owen planned the murder for months
she later checked to make sure her husband was dead , then owen followed her in douglas gissendaner 's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that kelly gissendaner had left for him
owen set her husband 's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with kelly gissendaner
kelly gissendaner , meanwhile , went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband 's whereabouts
in the clemency application , gissendaner 's lawyers argued she was equally or less culpable than owen , who actually did the killing
gissendaner was willing to plead guilty , her current lawyers said , but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole
" her appeal lawyers also argued that gissendaner had expressed deep remorse for her actions , become a model inmate and grown spiritually
currently the only woman on georgia 's death row , gissendaner would be the second woman in the state 's history to be executed
sixty years after her execution , georgia 's parole board posthumously pardoned her after finding that " it was a grievous error to deny ( her ) clemency
