fault lines dating back hundreds of millions of years in oklahoma that have been recently reactivated could lead to a devastating quake in the state where many structures were not built to withstand major seismic activity , a report said
' the majority of the recent earthquakes in central oklahoma define reactivated ancient faults at shallow depths in the crust ' of less than 3.7 miles ( 6 km ) , said the report for the american geophysical union
however , usa today , reported that previous research has identified hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , as being behind 3,600 small earthquakes in oklahoma from 2009 - 2014
' any one of these fault zones that are producing magnitude 3 or 4 earthquakes could rupture into a larger earthquake
the 300 - million - year - old fault lines in oklahoma are being reactivated by multiple earthquakes in the state that scientists previously have said were linked to fracking - although the most recent research did not look at the energy extraction technique in november 2011 , oklahoma suffered a 5.6 - magnitude quake that damaged more than a dozen homes and several businesses ( here , a man examines bricks that fell from three sides of his in - law 's home in sparks after two earthquakes hit the area in less than 24 hours during the large 2011 quake )
