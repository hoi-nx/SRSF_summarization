pietersen has paved the way for a summer of potential embarrassment for the ecb after agreeing to rejoin surrey in an improbable bid to regain his test place
pietersen will be available for the county across all three formats but will focus on the four - day lv = county championship as he attempts to force his way back into the england team following his sacking a year ago
confirmation of his surrey return is expected on thursday
another remarkable news cycle for the english game began with pietersen telling test match special listeners he would do â anything â to play international cricket again
pietersen will return to surrey in the summer to play in the lv = county championship 29 - pietersen âs average in the 5 - 0 ashes drubbing in 2013 - 14 , the last series he played
â pietersen has hinted he could change his ipl contract in a bid to push for an england place both whitaker and ecb managing director paul downton â the man behind last year âs controversial sacking â have repeatedly insisted pietersen will never play for england again , a fate that appeared to have been sealed by the publication in october of his score - settling autobiography
but , emboldened by what he regarded as the first stage of a peace offering , pietersen took every opportunity to state his desire to play for england once more
after playing for the big bash league 's melbourne stars , pietersen has signed with the sunrisers hyderabad surrey were initially wary of resuming ties with a cricketer who turns 35 in june but pietersen has often been at his best when he has had a point to prove
and the prospect of a hatful of division two runs as surrey push for promotion prompted director of cricket alec stewart to bring him into a middle order alongside sri lankan veteran kumar sangakkara
but assuming he manages to extricate himself from his Â£ 200,000 ipl deal with sunrisers hyderabad , as well as a contract with st lucia zouks in the caribbean premier league , that means he could be available for most , if not all , of the county season
kumar sangakkara appeared to confirm pietersen 's return to surrey this season after sri lanka bowed out of the world cup with a convincing defeat by south africa the call from his many fans on social media for pietersen âs return would grow â especially if england fail to put a disastrous world cup behind them as they embark on an absurd programme of 17 tests in 10 months
on wednesday pietersen told test match special : â if i can do anything that can help me get back into it for england then it âs something i want to do
