" but we 're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time
our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users
but they also have a hidden , darker side which the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about
as part of a research project with alberto rizzoli , we have tried to understand what drives people to invest in smartwatches
however when we are in these meetings , our smartphone is buzzing away reminding us that our inbox is filling up
we may want to check these incoming messages , but know it would be rude to glance at our phone
when one of the first smartwatches came to market , the judge thought he had found the solution to this problem
we found that heavy smartwatch users valued how the devices helped them track information as it arrived while still appearing socially attentive
it also saved users the hassle of having to dig through their pockets or handbags to find a buzzing phone
we also noticed a worrying side to these new devices as heavy users of the watches incorporate them into their daily routines -- we call it the " phantom device effect
" they would compulsive check their watch not just for the time , but for a wide range of information
in some cases their new gizmo would become such an instinctive part of their life that even when not wearing one they would check their bare wrist
recent research has suggested that average smartphone users check their phone 150 times a day , starting just minutes after waking up
we used to worry that the average american watched television for six hours a day
now we accept as a matter of course the fact that we tied to our devices for most of the time we 're awake
in the work carl cederstrã¶m and i have done on the hidden dangers of wearables , a big big concern is privacy
as we pay more attention to our feed of personal biodata we 're likely to become more anxious about things that we may never have given a second thought to in the past
not walking your allotted steps in a day or finding you had a poor sleeping pattern at night can become a source of significant personal guilt or worry
as a result , we pour more attention into monitoring and controlling ourselves , giving us less time to do the things which actually make us happy
