high social status has its privileges - even in wild animals
researchers studying spotted hyenas in kenya found that high - ranking members of a clan live longer , are healthier and even have more offspring
the discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres - caps at the end of each strand of dna - regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species , including humans
researchers studied the status and health of spotted hyenas in kenya ( stock image )
they found high - ranking members of groups live longer and are healthier and these alpha females were also found to have more offspring
the discovery was made by analysing the lengths of telomeres lewin from msu 's zoology department said : ' if you want to see the hierarchy of spotted hyenas , throw down some fresh meat near them
telomeres are caps at the end of each strand of dna that protect chromosomes from deterioration
these biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species , including humans
high - ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers
these biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress in many species , including humans
high - ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers suggesting they were healthier
the alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres
these biomarkers are regarded as important signs of ageing and stress
high - ranking hyenas had longer telomeres than their peers and clan membership predicted telomere length of those that sat at the top of the hierarchy although the alpha females of each clan had the longest telomeres , the length was relative to each individual clan so telomeres could n't be used to identify leaders when on their own
