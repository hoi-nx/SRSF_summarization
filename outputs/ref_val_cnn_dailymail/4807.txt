now , for the first time , scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short - term seismic forecasting
they found that animals in peru - such as pumas and razor - billed curassow birds - ran for cover days before the event
researchers believe that the changes in behaviour may be linked to airborne ions
this still shows a razor - billed curassow led by dr rachel grant of anglia ruskin university , experts used data gathered from a series of motion - triggered cameras located in the yanachaga national park in peru
the research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 contamana earthquake that struck the region in 2011
however , within the 2 - day period in the run - up to the earthquake , they recorded five or fewer sightings
for five of the seven days immediately before the earthquake , no animal movements were recorded at all , which was incredibly unusual for the mountainous rainforest region
dr grant , a lecturer in animal and environmental biology , told mailonline that rodents seemed to be particularly sensitive and disappeared completely eight days before the quake
â the research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 contamana earthquake struck the region in 2011
a stock image showing rupture caused by a quake is shown scientists recorded the reflection of very low frequency radio waves above the area surrounding the epicentre of the peru earthquake
it is thought that positive airborne ions , which are known to be generated in large numbers at the earth âs surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build - up to an earthquake , trigger unusual animal behaviour
positive ions in the air lead to unpleasant side effects in animals and humans , such as â serotonin syndrome â
the scientists detected disturbances in the ionosphere - the layer of the earth 's atmosphere which contains a high concentration of ions and free electrons and is able to reflect radio waves - which started two weeks before the earthquake
a particularly large fluctuation was recorded eight days prior to the quake , coinciding with the second significant decrease in animal activity observed in the pre-earthquake period
prominent among the most likely causes for the unusual animal response are positive airborne ions , which are known to be generated in large numbers at the earth âs surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build - up to an earthquake

they expected the injection of positive airborne ions into the earth âs atmosphere before seismic activity to have a profound effect on mammals and birds - in particular those living on the ground and in burrows , and the study seems to prove this

this still from an in - situ camera shows a paca rodent during the control period of the experiment experts led by dr rachel grant of anglia ruskin university used data gathered from a series of motion - triggered cameras located in the yanachaga national park in peru ( marked on the map ) â as far as we know , this is the first time that motion triggered cameras have documented this phenomenon prior to an earthquake , â dr grant said
â the results are particularly interesting as we also found evidence of disturbances in the ionosphere in the area where the earthquake struck
â hence , the animals would have escaped to the valley below , where they were exposed to fewer positive airborne ions
