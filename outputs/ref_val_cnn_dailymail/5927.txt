three family members named in a $ 100million wrongful death lawsuit filed by the parents of a georgia teen who was found dead in a rolled - up gym mat have countersued with a $ 1million defamation suit
kenneth and jacquelyn johnson filed the wrongful death suit after their son kendrick was found dead in a rolled - up gym mat at lowndes high school in valdosta , georgia , in january of 2013
the suit lists 38 defendants and claims that brothers brian and bell as well as their father rick , an fbi agent , were behind the 17 - year - old 's death
it states the wrongful death suit lacks ' substantial justification ' and contains ' a complete absence of any justiciable issue in law or fact '
kendrick 's parents say the bells attacked him after their father instructed them to do so the countersuit also addresses the jacquelyn johnson family allegedly asking florida state university to take a football scholarship offer away from younger brother brian
it also says the boys acted on a ' parental command ' from their father to assault jacquelyn johnson the countersuit claims the johnsons interfered with brian 's chances to play football at florida state university a state autopsy ruled jacquelyn johnson 's death was an accident but his parents have always insisted foul play was involved and there was a cover - up by law enforcement authorities and school officials
