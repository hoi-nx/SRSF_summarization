a â deceitful â businesswoman has been left with a Â£ 100,000 bill for tricking her husband into believing he was the father of their son born after ivf treatment
â a lecturer who said his former wife deceived him into thinking her son born via ivf was his has won Â£ 100,000 after a court heard the boy , who is now nine years old , was conceived using another man 's sperm the man â a lecturer in his sixties who can not be named for legal reasons â thought the boy was his after the couple visited a fertility clinic
but the woman , who is in her 50s , had returned a few months later with an ex-boyfriend and was impregnated with his sperm
' i wanted my former wife , and her former boyfriend , to realise the consequences of their deceitful actions practised over almost six years
' her deceit was only revealed when , following their divorce , the man sought further contact with the boy
central london county court heard that the couple married in 2002 and two years later they went for ivf treatment in barcelona
the court heard that the man had looked after the child when the woman was working away from their london homes and had paid more than Â£ 80,000 in maintenance over the following years
the court heard the pair had a troubled marriage when they had ivf in 2004
they then fell out , so when the woman returned to the ivf clinic in 2005 , she took an ex-partner , whose sperm was used to conceive the woman said there had been no deceit , no fraud and no misrepresentation , but judge taylor found in favour of her ex-husband
judge taylor said she did not believe the woman 's testimony , adding that she had ' deliberately misrepresented ' the facts she said she was satisfied that the woman intended her ex-husband to believe that he was the boy âs father and rejected her suggestion that she believed the boy â may â not be his child
â the judge was told that the man had lost almost all contact with the boy , who is now nine
legal sources suggested she would have to pay a further Â£ 60,000 in costs
