an endoscopy revealed mp mike weatherley 's heartburn was in fact oesophageal cancer mp mike weatherley was out for dinner with friends when , inexplicably , he found himself struggling to swallow
â it felt as if the food was catching on the way down , â says the conservative member for hove and portslade in east sussex
â soup was fine but anything tougher , such as steak , would feel as if it was catching , â says mike weatherley , 57 , who is divorced and has three children aged 27 , 25 and 22
â his only complaint was the odd bit of heartburn
she also referred mike weatherley for an endoscopy , when a camera attached to a tube is fed down the throat
he had the investigation five weeks later which found he had a growth bulging across his oesophagus , the pipe that carries food from the mouth to the stomach
tests revealed it was cancer
â i felt as if the floor had dropped away , â he says
â oesophageal cancer is becoming increasingly common
â there is a very low survival rate for this cancer , â says tom stansfeld , health information officer at cancer research uk
â after ten years , there is only a 10 per cent survival rate , whereas with breast or testicular cancer the rate is 80 to 90 per cent
â one of the main problems is that people are nât aware of the symptoms , so the cancer is not picked up until it is too late
research for public health england found 70 per cent had no idea that food sticking in your throat could be a sign of oesophageal or stomach cancer ; 59 per cent were not aware persistent heartburn was a sign , too
in fact , heartburn is nât just a symptom of oesophageal cancer , it âs also the cause in most cases
heartburn occurs when the acidic contents of the stomach splash up the oesophagus ; being overweight encourages this , putting pressure on the stomach
heartburn is nât just a symptom of oesophageal cancer , it âs also the cause in most cases ( file picture ) oesophageal cancer is also linked to a diet low in fruit and vegetables , and to smoking and drinking â possibly because these irritate the cells that line the oesophagus
the problem is that many people , like mike weatherley , think heartburn is â just one of those things â
â public health england has launched a campaign encouraging people to visit their gp if they have heartburn most days for three weeks or more
between 1977 and 2011 , the number of cases soared - by 65 per cent in men and 26 per cent in women yet , mike weatherley believes the situation could be helped by improving access to gps
â i think that means people put off going and getting their symptoms checked , as i did
the stomach is then moved up and a section of the oesophagus that is left will be attached to it
mike weatherley âs biopsy was not conclusive , but the fact he had a mass there convinced surgeons it was best to remove most of his oesophagus
â i was happy to trust the surgeon âs advice , although i did nât realise just how major an operation it would be , â says mike weatherley
thank goodness i did nât , as if i had , i âd be dead now , â says mike weatherley bluntly
mike weatherley now wishes he had gone to his gp sooner as he might not have needed such major treatment
but often these people are nât referred with suspected cancer , as it might be heartburn , and they can wait for up to 18 weeks , â he says
for mike weatherley , life has changed
certain foods such as risotto or anything stodgy are off - limits as it can get caught in the new connection between his stomach and what remains of his oesophagus
mike weatherley is optimistic about the future and is standing down as an mp in may
