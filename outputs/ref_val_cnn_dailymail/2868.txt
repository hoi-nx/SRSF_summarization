jonjo o'neill has no doubts who he will be shouting for if two particular horses are galloping clear to the final fence in friday âs gold cup
one , irish - trained carlingford lough , owned by jp , ridden by soon - to - retire 19 - time champion jockey mccoy , will be carrying a hill of punters â money and a mountain of sentimental support
the other , holywell , a winner at the last two festivals and who showed his old sparkle when winning his warm - up race at kelso last month under mccoy , is jonjo o'neill âs main hope for a big win this week

but jonjo o'neill is clear where his support will lie
â i will be shouting for holywell
the arduous climb to the finishing post was the scene of the two - time champion jockey âs 1980 champion hurdle win on sea pigeon and , even more memorably , the heart - stopping surge to the line on 1986 gold cup - winning mare dawn run
jonjo o'neill might come over like a cross between father christmas and your favourite uncle but he has not risen to the top of the racing ladder by being soft - hearted
â richie will ride holywell and they get on really well
â holywell is one of jonjo o'neill 's main hope for a big win in the cheltenham gold cup mccoy ( right ) and o'neil ( left ) pictured with john mcmanus after winning the grand national while jonjo o'neill is determined to deny mccoy the big final festival send - off the jockey is hoping for , that does nât mean he is not desperate to provide him with a winner despite the blow of one of their big hopes , last year âs world hurdle winner more of that , missing the meeting
they have become more than just employer and employee and no one is better placed to assess mccoy than jonjo o'neill , a man who rode against a generation of former weighing room giants including ron barry , dessie hughes , john francome , peter scudamore and tommy carberry
jonjo o'neill is determined to deny mccoy the big final festival send - off the jockey is hoping for jonjo o'neill , who has trained 25 cheltenham festival winners , described mccoy as a freak that loves winning that is in stark contrast to dark days when the whole of november , a blank december and january yielded only 11 victories
that remains the jonjo o'neill ambition but one hampered , he feels , by the wrong perception he is jp âs private trainer
but it is holywell , winner of the 2013 pertemps hurdle and what is now the ultima business solutions handicap chase last year , who leads the jonjo o'neill charge
if he dashes the mccoy âs gold cup run , party pooper might be more appropriate .
