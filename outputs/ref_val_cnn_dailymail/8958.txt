my heart says it is new zealand to win this world cup final but in my head i have to go for australia , although not by a wide margin
the important thing for the event as a whole is that it has got the right final , involving the two best sides
i thought india were the one team who might just have a say but australia were too strong â both these sides fully deserve to be here
the reason they have both earned it is that they have played the full - on , modern brand of one - day cricket : powerful batting combined with wicket - taking bowling marshalled by two captains constantly looking to make things happen
it is the completely up - to - date version of 50 - over cricket â slightly different to what was seen from certain other teams we could mention
tim southee is relishing the prospect of facing australia in the world cup final on sunday aaron finch will hope to make an impact for australia in the world cup final everyone likes an underdog , and part of you wants to see the kiwis win because it would be great to have a new winner
they have played exhilarating cricket and you also get the sense that their whole country is really behind them
but my head is ruling the heart largely due to the home advantage of australia playing at the melbourne cricket ground
australia celebrate as they book their place in the final with a win over india in the semi-finals david warner thanks the crowd after winning the semi-final against india the ball has swung around in new zealand , but , with the drop - in pitch , that has not been so much the case at the melbourne cricket ground which , apart from anything else , is much larger than where they have been so far
daniel vettori will play his last ever odi for new zealand in the world cup final the 100,000 capacity melbourne cricket ground will provide a fitting venue for sunday 's showpiece i do not expect them to choke , but i think australia may be building up to a big performance
