batsman joe root feels england need to make a convincing statement that they belong in the world cup quarter - finals when they meet bangladesh and afghanistan in their final two group games
england must win both matches , against lower - ranked opponents , to have any chance of reaching the knockout stage
an early exit looms large after sunday 's nine - wicket defeat to sri lanka in wellington followed wide - margin beatings by co-hosts australia and new zealand
joe root has insisted that england must succeed in securing convincing victories in their next two games joe root snicks a ball down fine leg during england 's defeat by sri lanka in their previous world cup match that has piled the pressure on , albeit in two games joe root points out that england would have needed to win in any circumstance
' if you play those two games at the start of the competition you still have to win them , ' joe root said
' england 's hastened need to restore confidence is underlined by the fact that should they reach the last - eight they will now most likely play the highest - ranked team in pool b. that will almost certainly be either south africa or world champions india , who england did beat twice during the tri-series leading up to the world cup
' we do n't want to just scrape through - we want to put in some really good performances and put to bed some of the things we 've got wrong so far , ' joe root added
england captain morgan was left with plenty to ponder after suffering his third defeat of the world cup sangakkar and team - mate lahiru thirimanne shake hands with morgan after sri lanka 's nine - wicket wi ' we know that if we get through to the quarter - finals we 'll be in a position where we have nothing to lose
' joe root believes the gap between england and the best teams at the world cup is not as large as their heavy defeats would suggest
' joe root hit a career - best 121 from 108 balls against sri lanka but england 's bowlers could n't match his exploits steven finn and james taylor show their disappointment after england 's third loss of the tournament joe root stood up to be counted in the sri lanka defeat when the 24 - year - old became england 's young world cup centurion
his career - best 121 from 108 balls inspired england to a formidable 309 for six - the second successive match they had passed 300 - only for the bowlers to lack any penetration as twin tons from lahiru thirimanne and kumar sangakkara eased sri lanka to victory in 16 balls
' at the start of the day , if you 'd given us 310 we 'd have thought that a very good effort , ' joe root said
' the ease of sri lanka 's chase suggested england did not set their sights high enough and , while joe root admitted more risks can be taken with the bat , they had left sri lanka with a record chase at the ground
' we got out there , we played it as we saw it , there were periods when sri lanka bowled really well at us
