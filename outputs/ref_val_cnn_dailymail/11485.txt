two michigan police officers have been applauded for their kindness after buying a child car seat for a hard - up couple rather than issuing them a ticket
officers jason pavlige , 32 , and james hodges , 26 , of fruitport township , michigan responded to a call made by a mcdonald 's worker who was concerned that a baby was not properly secured in a car seat when her parents picked up some food from the restaurant
when the officers stopped the couple 's car , they found the 10 - month - old girl sitting in her mother 's lap while her father drove the vehicle
' rather than giving the couple a ticket , the officers decided on a different tact
' we spoke with each other and made the decision to go get them a car seat so we 'd know the kid was safe and that this issue would n't come up again , ' james hodges said
the two men pooled their money and , while jason pavlige stayed with the family , james hodges went to a local walmart to buy a new car seat for the baby
quick - thinking : after learning the family could not afford a car seat for their child , the two officers pooled their money and went to this walmart to buy a new seat before installing it for the shocked couple ' they did n't say much but were just very appreciative , ' james hodges said
the two officers did n't tell anyone about their good deed , which they carried out in february , but it came to light after a walmart employee called the police station to let their superiors know
' it 's just part of what police officers do on a daily basis
