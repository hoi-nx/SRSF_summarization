while scientists have theories about how fish first crawled onto land and breathed air , it 's a mystery as to how vertebrates evolved tongues instead of feeding using suction
but now , a slow - motion video of mudskippers eating shrimp may help reveal the evolutionary secret
it shows the creatures , which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground , taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue , allowing them to swallow food on land
it shows the creatures , which live in and out of water and forage for food on the ground ( pictured in a stock image ) taking a mouthful of water to act like a tongue , allowing them to swallow food on land experts believe the finding may shed light on how terrestrial tetrapods - four - legged vertebrates - with tongues evolved from fish between 400 and 250 million years ago
however , this method does nât work on land , so terrestrial vertebrates evolved tongues to move the food to the back of the throat
a team of researchers led by michel at the university of antwerp , belgium , captured slow - motion x-ray footage ( shown ) of atlantic mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water the video revealed that mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish ( stock image left ) with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians such as nexts ( right ) , meaning they could reveal a missing evolutionary link mudskippers are members of the gobies family , which is one of the largest fish families comprising more than 2,000 species
a team of researchers led by michel at the university of antwerp , belgium , captured slow - motion x-ray footage of atlantic mudskippers eating pieces of brown shrimp out of water
by watching the video , which was slowed down 50 times , the experts were able to see that the mudskippers carry water in their mouths
this means that mudskippers combine the sucking method of fish with the grabbing tongue action of amphibians , so they could reveal a missing evolutionary link
