why and how certain types of mushrooms glow has long confused scientists , but now they think they might have an answer
it appears that some fungi emit light to attract insects at night , which then spread their fungal spores around
scientists in brazil studied why certain species of mushroom glow
they found the ability helps them attract insects at night
these creatures will then move their fungal spores elsewhere
but the mushrooms are able to turn off the ability during the day
at night , the green glow attracts insects including beetles , flies , wasps and ants
' it appears that fungi make light so they are noticed by insects who can help the fungus colonize new habitats , ' said dr stevani of brazil 's instituto de quã­mica-universidade de sã£o paulo
n. gardneri is also called ' flor de coco , ' meaning coconut flower , by locals in brazil , where the mushroom can be found attached to leaves at the base of young palm trees in coconut forests
other fungi have other methods to disperse their spores like the common stinkhorn ( shown ) , which releases a foul smell to get flies to attract flies to make the findings , the researchers made sticky , fake mushrooms out of acrylic resin and lit them from inside with green led lights
' without them , cellulose would be stuck in its form , which would impact the whole carbon cycle on earth , ' said dr stevani
' i dare to say that life on earth depends on organisms like these
