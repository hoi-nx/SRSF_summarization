jenson button , newly wearing a wedding ring , can afford to smile even if some of the rituals of his long career in formula one will not be repeated at sunday âs australian grand prix
there is little chance of that tally being added to in his temperamental mclaren
mclaren 's jenson button is gearing up for his 16th season in formula one jenson button has recorded three victories in melbourne during his career but , aged 35 , just being here is the great boon
a 16th season beckons after he feared being dropped last year to make way for alonso , the incoming double world champion from ferrari
but he was kept on â the result of a boardroom fight between mclaren chairman dennis , who favoured magnussen partnering alonso , and fellow shareholder ojjeh , who supported whichever driver dennis did not want
â this is where i should be , â said jenson button in the paddock on thursday
â but as cruel irony would have it , alonso will miss this race after he banged his head in testing and magnussen has been called up to replace him in tandem with jenson button
jenson button poses with the nsx concept vehicle at a honda f1 grand prix press conference alonso âs accident in barcelona last month prompted a host of theories : among them that he had a fit before losing control or suffered an electric shock
jenson button , however , was concerned enough to examine the data of alonso âs car to satisfy himself there was nothing for him to fear
â yes , but not as fast as mclaren would like
jenson button , a glass - half - full sort of man , was realistic in his assessment of his team âs prospects
jenson button married his fiancee jessica michibata in a secret ceremony in hawaii in january â we definitely wo nât be fighting for a win here , â he said
â this prognosis is a bit dispiriting given the expectations generated by mclaren âs new partnership with mclaren
â we are a year behind the other manufacturers and the design is more aggressive to be a challenge to mercedes in the future , â added jenson button
â mclaren are the manufacturer who will take it to mercedes
â while jenson button brings his experience to bear , another british driver , stevens , is just starting out
â he has even less chance of scoring points than jenson button
