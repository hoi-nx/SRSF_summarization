the prescription company even gave the patients â email addresses , dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to firms and our disclosures yesterday included how undercover reporters were also able to buy private medical details â including names of people suffering from arthritis , diabetes , high blood pressure and even bladder problems â for just 19p each
