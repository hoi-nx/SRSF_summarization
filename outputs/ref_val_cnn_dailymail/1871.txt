oj is marked for death
the 67 - year - old disgraced gridiron great was recently threatened by a fellow inmate who is a member of the aryan nation , a white supremacist group in the nevada prison , and vowed that oj will never leave the prison alive
oj , 67 , and the tattooed - racist thug , who is 6 feet tall and over 250 pounds , got into a heated argument last week while waiting in line to get their medications
oj , who is housed in the minimum security tier - or section - of the prison has to stand in line with all of the other inmates for medications and meals from minimum to maximum security
' but this dude was not having it and told oj to take his ugly black a * * to back of the line and wait like everybody else
the gloves are off : oj 's altercation with white supremacist prisoner waugh began after simpson cut into the line to get his medicines first
blu was n't having it and pushed oj against the wall ' oj jumped in his face and yelled , " f * * * you man
i 'm gon na stay right here and your a * * ai n't gon na do nothing about it
" ' the guy pushed oj and yelled back : " get in line a * * hole and wait your turn
i 'm not gon na tell ya again
" ' oj fell against the wall and was able to catch himself before he fell to the floor but he was in a lot of pain because of his bad knee
after oj fell , the eyewitness continued , ' he struggled to his feet and went right back to get into this guy 's face and spit on him
' oj is still the same guy he was when he came here â feels like the world owes him something â and they are tired of it ' just one of the boys : oj , who is housed in the minimum security tier - or section - of the prison has to stand in line with all of the other inmates for medications and meals from minimum to maximum security ' everybody was yelling and pushing and then the guards , the sharp shooters , cocked their rifles , it sounded like a huge door metal slammed , and everyone dropped to the floor all at once
' the guards came down on the tier and cuffed the prisoner who was later identified as waugh and ordered oj to just go back to his cell immediately
they told oj that guy had a reputation of being a very brutal , violent guy , who has a lot of connections inside and outside of the prison
they were angry because how can oj spit in someone 's face and not be put in isolation like the other dude
painful : oj 's knee injuries are a result from his 11 - year career as a running back in the nfl
he does n't walk around the prison a lot like he used to but when he has to walk to get his meals in the commissary he walks with a new silver cane while grimacing in pain on display : oj 's knee injuries had such an impact on his health , attorney cochran , used his disability in his trial for the murder of wife simpson and her friend ron goldman , to convince the jury that he was not physically capable of the killings
at one point cochran instructed oj to stand and raise his suit pant leg to show the jury his multiple scars on his left knee to prove he was severely handicapped spitting in someone 's face is basically an assault and they were also saying he also should have been charged with inciting a riot ' oj has caused a lot of trouble for everybody , ' the eyewitness added , ' that 's why the inmates were trying to stop them from fighting
' insiders say oj was sent to the lovelock correctional center because it was a low - level security facility and they were trying to send him somewhere he could serve his time quietly and to prevent publicity
