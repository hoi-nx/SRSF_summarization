a london - based property agency is promising to find those seeking a house - share the perfect flatmate , with just two small conditions woven into their contracts ; they must be young ... and they must be rich
the owner of capital living , based in the city 's south-west , adam goff , describes his unique flat - sharing process as ' a selective living community for people who want to meet new people ' which might translate as ' hooking you up with posh flatmates , but only if you 're posh yourself '
indeed adam goff , 30 , offers more than just a room in one of his 22 properties , mostly victorian terraces in places such as clapham , balham and fulham
a room to rent with ' cool friends ' as part of the package : adam goff , 30 , founder of capital living aims to hook up ' young and rich ' professionals in his flatshares across london do you come here often ? all of the capital living properties come with open - plan kitchens to encourage flatmates to chat more freely for an average flat - fee of Â£ 1,050 a month , tenants can rest assured that their fellow flat - sharers will be somewhere between the ages of 21 to 39 with a flourishing career , often in the city , and a definite predisposition for partying
those who have seen the lives of london 's richest youngsters in hit television show made in chelsea are looking for something similar but do n't always know how to get it , says adam goff
the company treats potential tenants - or ' members ' as they call them - as if they were looking for a membership at an exclusive club such as soho house with couples banned for fear of killing a flat 's sociable atmosphere
welcome to the community ! capital living founder adam goff regularly throws parties for new tenants
the photo above shows ' members ' during a night out at london 's kensington roof gardens a cartoon on the company 's website tells the story of how mr adam goff was inspired to start his flat - share company by a miserable , friendless experience when he first moved to london from birmingham going solo : couples are banned from renting rooms in the houses for fear they 'll dampen the party mood parties , often a landlord 's worst nightmare , are actively encouraged with new tenants , often who 've never lived in london before , invited to the get - togethers
a recent night out saw adam goff , his three - strong team of employees and a raft of their tenants enjoying the charms of west end nightclub mahiki , a favourite with prince harry
originally from poole in dorset , chloe says that she was cynical about the ' flat - fee rent ' at first but was soon won over
' flat - hunting in london is a nightmare so i went for it and actually it 's been brilliant
of course there is the occasional house party but there is little chance of things getting out of hand because everyone has work on monday morning and if there is a bit of mess the house goes back to normal after a good clean from our cleaning team ! ' adam goff says that a lonely experience when he first moved to the city following a university course in birmingham prompted him to start the company with Â£ 16,000 in savings
although the flat - fee service is around Â£ 300 more expensive than your average room rental in , say , clapham , it 's a room that comes with a built - in social life plus a weekly cleaner and boring domestic essentials such as dishwasher tablets
although adam goff 's tenants are almost all at the beginning or mid-way through what promises to be a glittering career , he 's less accepting of ' trust - funders '
