but french photographer eric lafforgue was among the first visitors to be allowed to visit the north korea fishing village of jung pyong ri - a model community so remote it is not located on any maps
the rural outpost is part of a project to create homestays for tourists , allowing them a glimpse of life in north korea , albeit a very sanitised version of reality
photographer eric lafforgue experienced life in the beautiful north korea fishing village of jung pyong ri , which is opening the doors for tourists to witness rural life he stayed in a well - kept homestay , home of the chief of the village
there are only 23 families in the area , which is so remote it is not located on a map the decor inside included an assortment of plush toys , plants , coloured mats and photographs of the country 's leaders the village is open for homestays and is a far cry from the poverty surrounding it , with its air conditioned facilities and houses equipped with three televisions
described by eric lafforgue as an airbnb - style local property that tourists can visit , he also admits the conditions of a stay can be somewhat restrictive
eric lafforgue explains that the fleeting view from the bus windows is very different to what he finds at the homestay
my guide informs me that most tourists do not journey this far into the countryside , and that i may be the first european to ever visit this area
' it 's a good opportunity to show tourists a flattering image of rural life , the fragile pillar of the country 's economy , ' eric lafforgue said
' the beautiful portrayal of rural life provides the north korea government a flattering image to capitilise on
immediately , i fear i 'm in a north korea tourist trap , complete with actors portraying reality
' eric lafforgue stayed with the village chief , in a well - kept house , which , although it came complete with ensuite bathrooms , had a bed consisting of a futon on the floor
eric lafforgue describes the decor as ' kitschy ' , with huge plush toys , plastic flowers , large plant pots being watched by the propaganda portraits lining the walls

eric lafforgue spoke candidly to the chief of the village , who explained what life was like in the rural outpost , which was completely cut off from the retsof the ocuntry until the 1990s
' life is very hard in the winter and sometimes the food supply is low , ' the chief told eric lafforgue
