logan , left , pictured with her former rugby international husband kenny , right , shamed a twitter troll who told her to go back to the kitchen her father was an international footballer and she is married to a former rugby star
so when a troll tweeted that she should be a housewife rather than a tv sports presenter , logan was on safe ground hitting back
yesterday mrs logan , 41 , retweeted the sexist message , which appeared to have been sent to her by a web designer named glen hughes
writing using the twitter handle @ glenweblondon he said : â who asked your opinion f * * * * * * geezer bird get back to kitchen â this is freelance web designer and latent feminist glen â
within minutes , scores of mrs logan âs 372,000 followers had applauded her for drawing attention to the troll , who has since deleted his profile
â mrs logan , whose father terry yorath was a welsh international footballer and was part of the presenting team covering the world cup in brazil , replied : â occasionally you just need to deliver a little upper cut for your own sanity do nât you think ? â and hundreds of other twitter users offered their support to mrs logan , with one writing : â logan you are great , do nât worry about these silly people who do nât think before they speak
we are still navigating our way through the challenges that social media present but actually being abusive like that on twitter is no different to publishing it anywhere else
â it is not the first time mrs logan , who is the wife of former scotland rugby star kenny logan , has used social media to name and shame a troll
mrs logan , who is mother two nine - year - old twins reuben and lois , told essentials magazine : â people still think it âs a woman âs responsibility to organise everything
â mrs logan âs twitter came after international women âs day was celebrated on sunday
