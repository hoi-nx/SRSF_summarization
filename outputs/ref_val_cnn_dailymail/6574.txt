work and pensions secretary duncan smith insists the tory pitch to voters has to be about more than tax , immigration and crime to show they are driven by ' fairness , opportunity , and compassion ' mr duncan smith 's remarks echo the warning in 2002 from theresa may that the tories had become seen as the ' nasty party '
