a tory candidate has vowed to clear his name after he was recorded apparently plotting with a far - right group to win votes by stirring up religious tensions
amin , who is standing in a key marginal seat , is accused of asking the edl to say it was organising an inflammatory march against a local ' mega-mosque '
tory candidate amin has vowed to clear his name after he was recorded apparently plotting with a far - right group to win votes by stirring up religious tensions tory ministers yesterday urged him to stand down , but mr amin â who has been suspended from the party pending an inquiry â denied the claims and insisted he had been ' grossly misrepresented '
defence minister anna soubry said that if the allegations were true , mr amin should ' fess up and go now '
the party had high hopes for 40 - year - old mr amin , a muslim and an ex-army captain who has done three tours of duty in afghanistan
he was filmed telling edl leaders that he would also pay for the group 's supporters to canvass on his behalf former tory party chairman baroness warsi has apparently met mr amin on several occasions over the past seven years , and called on his expertise as one of the highest - ranking muslim soldiers
mr amin , who faces a disciplinary hearing tomorrow , was selected two years ago to fight the marginal seat of dudley
mr amin appears to have suggested last week to the edl 's former leader robinson and current chairman steve eddowes that they announce a ' second march about the mosque '
mr amin hatched a scheme to persuade the edl ( pictured ) to announce an inflammatory march against a new Â£ 18million ' mega-mosque ' but mr amin claimed last night that he never planned to ' behave in the way that was presented ' and that he was using the tactics he learned while negotiating between the us army and the taliban ' to improve community relations here in my own country between the edl and muslim communities '
but last night mr johnson , who is responsible for policing in dudley , said he had never discussed an edl demonstration with him .
