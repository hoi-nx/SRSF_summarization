horlock , 49 , from colchester , essex , is britain 's most prolific surrogate mother and is now hoping to have a 16th - and possibly 17th - baby miss horlock with her 13th surrogate baby ( left ) and with baby number nine in 2004 ( right ) baby number one in december 1995 - she became pregnant with her first child for another couple after reading a newspaper article about surrogacy she said : ' i 'm just a womb they 've hired to help them achieve their dream of being parents
' miss horlock , who lives in colchester , essex , with her partner of 16 years , paul , offered her services after being ' dumped ' by another couple midway through a cycle of fertility drugs
she approached the new couple on an internet surrogacy forum last monday and met them on friday night , before having the ivf treatment on saturday morning
' miss horlock also boasted that the ivf clinicians told the couple , who have n't been identified , that their surrogate had ' the best uterus in the world '
baby number five ( left ) was born in july 1999 , followed by baby number six ( right ) in october 2000 miss horlock pictured with her daughter , megan , 21 , she said having babies is ' addictive ' baby number seven ( left ) was born in january 2002 , followed by the arrival of baby eight ( right ) in april 2003 she has two daughters of her own , steffanie , 24 , and megan , 21 , and has given birth to 13 other children as a surrogate mother â including a set of twins and a set of triplets
' the thought i could be pregnant again is incredibly exciting â it 's the beginning of a journey with the couple which culminates in a magical moment when i give birth
miss horlock , who also owns a Â£ 350,000 , six - bedroom farmhouse in bordeaux , said : ' i 'll be 49 when i give birth , which is not so strange and well within the realms of getting pregnant naturally , let alone with ivf
when that fell through , it was ' almost fate ' that she could step in â although she did not even know how old the mother - to - be was before agreeing to carry her baby
49 - year - old miss horlock said : ' i love being pregnant , although i hope it 's just one this time ' miss horlock gave births to twins in february 1997 and triplets in march 2008 - she had other babies in march 1998 , july 1999 , october 2000 , january 2002 , april 2003 , june 2004 and april 2013 miss horlock said the meeting was ' incredibly emotional '
the embryos â which are biologically the couple 's â were put into miss horlock 's womb on saturday , and she flew home last night
for each pregnancy , she is paid expenses of between Â£ 7,000 and Â£ 15,000
' i will waive all my legal rights to the child , ' said miss horlock .
