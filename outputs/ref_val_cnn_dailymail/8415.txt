this is the first picture of a six - year - old boy whose hand was savagely hacked off by hired assassins who collect albino body parts for witchdoctors to turn into charms and potions for their rich clients
baraka cosmas was attacked on saturday evening by a group of men , who stormed into the home he shared with his parents in western tanzania
eighteen - month - old yohana was snatched from his home less than a month ago , while four - year - old pendo was taken at the end of december
the men who viciously attacked baraka cosmas at the weekend are likely to have been little more than petty criminals at worst , carrying out the bidding of a witchdoctor
hidden : many children are now kept in special schools , away from their families and behind protective walls children are being snatched from their beds as gangs of men roam southern malawi hunting as demand for albino body parts fuels a surge in attacks and murders leaving people in fear of their lives , the u.n. has said
the country , which borders tanzania in the west , has seen a horrific rise in the numbers attacked or killed since january
an uncle , among three men facing charges in malawi for the kidnapping of an 11 - year - old malawi girl in january , revealed he had been offered $ 6,500 for her body
it equates to 2,778,425 kwacha - a fortune in a country where the minimum wage is 551 a day
' the u.n. called on regional governments to ensure the criminals behind the attacks are prosecuted
' and when you hear these kind of details of gangs of men roaming around , literally hunting down people with albinism simply to make money by cutting off their limbs and killing them , you must question whether enough is being done
' so far , while few kdinappers and witchdoctors have ever been successfully tried for their role in the incidents , not one buyer has ever been prosecuted for their part in the albino trade
however , the government has announced a ban on witchdoctors - and last week , it was announced 32 had been arrested in the geita , the same area where yohana was killed last month
' the witch doctors were arrested in possession of different items , including potions and oil from an unknown source , ' police cheif joseph konyo told reporters - but did n't say whether they had been charged
at the same time as the arrests were announced , a court sentenced four men to death for their part in the 2008 murder of 22 - year - old zawadi mangidu
she had died after her legs and right hand were hacked off with an axe and machete after being attacked while eating dinner in her village - also in geita , north - west tanzania
convictions : four men were sentenced to death last week for their part in the murder of 22 - year - old zawadi mangidu , which came as the tanzania government began a crackdown on the shocking trade feul : but sentencing the men to death will not stop wealthy buyers approaching witchdoctors to make the potions - and offering huge amounts of money to collect the limbs of tanzania 's albinos and nassaro is far from the only family member to be implicated in the attacks and murders of tanzania 's albinos
these four cases perhaps point to how strong the lure of the money offered is - and , by default , to the wealth of those purchasing the potions and charms
