mp field has complained to green party leader natalie bennett over claims a green protester tried to take a photograph of him after he had a heart attack â to take a photo of someone who has just had a heart attack would be a despicable thing to do , â mr field told the mail on sunday
â some members of the green party are the kind of people who infiltrated the labour in merseyside years ago
green activists , including mr dow , led protests
â had i been closer , i would have taken a picture , â dow said mr field said : â i told the police i did not want the protesters to force the meeting to be stopped
â mr dow , a former labour member , last night confirmed he took his camera out when mr field collapsed but was told by a labour councillor not to take a picture
he said he complied but denied he was being â insensitive â as it was a public meeting
