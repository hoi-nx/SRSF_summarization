that is according to a group of scientists at ucl who spent four years studying the mental attitudes of 369 patients admitted to hospital with unstable angina and heart attacks
while it is widely known that optimism is linked to better heart health , this is the first study to look at the impact of a patient âs attitude after suffering a heart attack
the team said their findings could be linked to physical and psychological impacts of being optimistic , such as smoking and healthy eating
smoking has long been known to be a major risk factor for heart attack and angina , with an estimated 22,000 deaths each year from cardiovascular disease linked to smoking

these findings discovered that pessimistic patients were twice as likely to have depressive symptoms a year after suffering a heart attack or unstable angina
