secret service director clancy said on thursday that two agents who allegedly ' crashed ' into a white house barrier in early march while driving under the influence merely bumped into a barrel
' previous reports of a crash are inaccurate - there was no crash , ' clancy told a senate subcommittee during testimony on the agency 's budget request
' clancy also told senators that the secret service was doing everything in its power to ' recreate ' surveillance footage from the night in question that had already been erased by the time he learned of the incident
congress may never know whether two agents who crashed into a white house barrier in early march were driving under the influence because it 's secret service policy to erase tapes after 72 hours , a congressman has revealed house oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz , pictured here at a capitol hill hearing on tuesday , says lawmakers who were present for the secret service director 's explanation of why tapes were destroyed were stunned
' that does n't make any sense to us ' the newly minted secret service director 's testimony follows the chairman of the house oversight committee 's public disclosure on wednesday that it is secret service policy to delete footage of the white house after 72 hours
utah republican jason chaffetz said clancy offered up the policy on tuesday at a closed - door meeting as an explanation for why he could only offer congress video of the incident from two angles
' that 's just a stunning revelation that 72 hours after they make a tape they destroy it ? that does n't make any sense to us
' on tuesday at a white house hearing on his appropriations request clancy admitted that he did not know about the alleged drunk driving or crash , which interrupted a suspicious package investigation , until five days after it happened
' if it 's regular policy to destroy them after 72 hours , why did they have two of the tapes , and where are the rest of the tapes ? ' jason chaffetz had asked on wednesday
and the white house 's chief spokesman declined , when asked by daily mail online on thursday , to say whether he or the president felt it was ' appropriate ' for the secret service to delete surveillance footage with such frequency
clancy later informed senators that secret service kept tapes related to the bomb sweep and that was how it still had video of the agents banging into the barrel
' ' we understand it 's a concern , ' that additional tapes were wiped , clancy said , according to the washington examiner , and ' we 're doing everything we can to retrieve those images and to be as transparent as we can be
jason chaffetz told cbs that the videos he did see showed the agents coming just feet from hitting the suspected bomb , which turned out to be a non-threatening package
' in terms of were they drunk or inebriated , ca n't tell , ' jason chaffetz said , because the tapes did not show the agents exiting the government vehicle or driving home after the incident
