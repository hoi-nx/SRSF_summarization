harmony jones ' 10th birthday celebration last week was marred by a letter penned by a friend saying she could not make it to the party because harmony is black
the note , written in pink , blue and green markers , and sprinkled with spelling errors , read : ' maby i will not be able to come to your birthday sleepover , because my dad will not let me go because you are black not trying to be races [ sic ] , but my mom let me no [ sic ] happy birthday ! ' both harmony , who is african-american , and her unnamed friend , a 10 - year - old who is presumably white , attend highland oaks elementary school in memphis
' birthday girl : harmony , seen on the night of her birthday sleepover wearing hello kitty pajamas and a tiara , met the no - show friend at school harmony 's father , christopher jones , told the station wreg he was surprised and upset when he read the missive from his daughter 's school friend
but harmony jones , who also has a younger daughter , added that he does n't blame the other girl for her parents â apparent bigotry
