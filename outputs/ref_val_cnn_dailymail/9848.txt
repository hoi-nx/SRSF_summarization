scientists at svalbard have successfully used instruments to observe the total solar eclipse - in the hope of solving one of the sun âs biggest mysteries
for some reason , the corona of the sun - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - is a lot hotter than the surface , and no one is sure why
using an array of instruments they studied the sun 's corona , plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse
they hope to work out why the corona is 300 times hotter than the surface in a blog post , research student nathalia alzate from aberystwyth university , who is part of the team conducting the research , said that everything had gone as planned
time to look at our data ! â a total solar eclipse is the only time that the entire atmosphere of the sun can be observed
why is the sun âs corona - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - so much hotter than its surface ? that is one of greatest solar mysteries , but astronomers will be hoping to find an answer today - by observing the total solar eclipse from the north pole
the plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse , so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena
at svalbard , including fellow research student joe hutton from the university , measured radiation before , during and after the eclipse
they joined scientists from the us , czech republic and germany as part of the ' solar wind sherpas ' in svalbard , 100 per cent of the sun was covered by the moon ( start of the eclipse shown ) , but much further south in london , only about 85 per cent was obscured the scientists measured radiation before , during ( shown ) and after the eclipse
they used a high - tech particle camera developed by the cern@school programme to measure changes in radiation shown is an image of 1999 's solar elcipse from france , with the corona visible around the edges the team of scientists worked at an old observatory on svalbard , midway between continental norway and the north pole
they travelled to this region to ensure they saw totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse observations took place from the kjell henriksen observatory longyearbyen in svalbard , pictured
â a total eclipse gives us an unique opportunity to measure the corona of the sun is so much detail and collect data that will enable us to better understand this difference
' he also added that studying the corona could help protect satellite - based communication systems from solar storms , which can be affected by coronal mass ejections - huge eruptions of material - from the sun. the temperature of the sun 's surface ( shown ion this nasa image ) is known to be around 6,000 Â° c ( 10,800 â° f ) , but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000 â° c ( 1,800,000 Â° f ) , and even reaches 2,000,000 â° c ( 3,600,000 Â° f ) in some areas , a factor of about 300
