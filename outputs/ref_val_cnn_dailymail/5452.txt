change of heart : washington post columnist jonathan capehart wrote a piece this week , criticizing the labeling of brown as a symbol of the black lives matter movement when brown was shot in the st louis , missouri suburb of ferguson last summer , like many other african - americans , jonathan capehart was incensed by the seemingly senseless death of another young black teen
but in a new column for the washington post , jonathan capehart says he no longer believes brown is an appropriate symbol for the renewed civil rights movement in the u.s. and that white police officer darren wilson was justified in the shooting
when brown was shot dead on august 9 , 2014 , early reports said he was holding his hands in the air , surrendering , and asking darren wilson not to shoot
jonathan capehart says the release of federal investigations into the shooting , and the ferguson police department in general , this month have forced him to re-evaluate brown as a victim
that story line mainly stems from brown 's friend dorian johnson , who was walking with him the day he was shot
new evidence : jonathan capehart said the new federal investigation results show that white police officer darren wilson ( right ) was justified in killing brown ( left ) ' based on a lie ' : in the aftermath of the shooting , brown 's friend and witness dorian johnson ( center ) , said his hands were up in surrender when he was shot
but those statements were refuted in the official investigation , which reported that brown was running towards darren wilson when he was shot based on the investigation 's damning results , jonathan capehart says brown is now an ' inappropriate symbol ' for the black lives matter movement
' real issues : jonathan capehart says that though brown in an ' inappropriate symbol ' of the black lives matter movement , it should n't distract from the the very real issues that were sparked by his death ' but we must never allow ourselves to march under the banner of a false narrative on behalf of someone who would otherwise offend our sense of right and wrong
