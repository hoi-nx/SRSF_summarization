if we must imagine the fiery depths of hell , the mental image ca n't be far from these incredible images by karel tupy of ethiopia 's erta ale , the world 's oldest continuously active lava lake
photographer karel tupy , 35 , says he feared his camera would melt from the overwhelming heat of the lava as he captured the daunting scenes of the 150 - ft wide basalt volcano
' found in the badland desert area of the danakil in north - eastern ethiopia , erta ale 's famed lava lake formed around 1906 and is one of six in the world
the volcano 's name translates in the local afar tribe 's language as ' smoking mountain ' while the pit to its south is known by locals as ' the gateway to hell ' , an appropriate moniker given the luminous lava spitting lava and searing heat
karel tupy said the view is ' staggering ' , as lava inside the volcano is constantly moving , bubbling and bursting erta ale 's name translates as ' smoking mountain ' in the local afar language while the pit to its south is called ' the gateway to hell ' while locals are n't particularly welcoming to outsiders and the surrounding terrain is far from hospitable , tourists do make the journey to witness the natural phenomenon
' standing at the lip of the lava lake you can see why the locals see this as " the gateway to hell " , as the incandescent bubbling lava lake hisses like some badly burned porridge cauldron , overturning and occasionally belching molten lava
' a visitor mounts his camera on a tripod in a bit to capture the volcano in its full glory while a small group of tourists line the other side the ferocity of the volcano is clear as lava splashes up from a pool that is said to have formed around 1906 having gained his own access to the area , in which five people in a group of scientists and tourists were killed while others were taken as hostages in a 2012 attack claimed by the arduf ( arduf ) , karel tupy could n't agree more with dr jerram 's impression
' the photographer says while it 's vital to avoid contact with lava , obviously , it 's the fumes that can be the worry poor road access means the only way to efficiently get to the crater is via four - wheel - drive over rugged terrain a far less dramatic sight , the lava forms a hard , grey layer when it is given the chance to cool however , the environment gets far worse that what he experienced
