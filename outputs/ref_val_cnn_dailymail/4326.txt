a colorado woman accused of luring an expectant mother to a basement and cutting the baby from her belly will not be charged with murder
investigators say lane lured wilkins , 26 , to her longmont home march 18 with an ad on craigslist offering baby clothes
inside , police say , lane attacked wilkins and extracted her unborn baby girl
even though the baby girl died , legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide
naomi garcia , 11 , holds a sign in the direction of passing cars during a protest against dynel lane legal experts say a person can still be charged with homicide for an unborn child 's death under existing colorado law if the baby was alive outside the mother 's body and the act that led to its death also occurred there
lane is expected to be formally charged on friday .
