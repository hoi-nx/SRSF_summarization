washington house speaker boehner said army sgt. bergdahl is " innocent until proven guilty " after the united states military charged him with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy , but emphasized in an exclusive interview with cnn 's dana bash that he was more concerned about the circumstances of his release
bergdahl 's attorney also released a statement on wednesday , outlining his defense of the soldier and containing a two - page letter from bergdahl describing the torture he endured , which included months spent chained to a bed and further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage
shortly after the charges were announced , bergdahl 's attorneys released a lengthy statement that includes a letter sent to milley earlier this month outlining their defense of the soldier
" in light of the nearly five years of harsh captivity sgt. bergdahl endured , the purpose of his leaving his unit , and his behavior while a prisoner , it would be unduly harsh to impose on him the lifetime stigma of a court - martial conviction or an other than honorable discharge and to deny him veterans benefits , " attorney eugene r. fidell writes in the letter
the statement includes a two - page accounting from bergdahl of his time in captivity , in which he recounts months spent chained to a bed , then further years spent chained on all fours or locked in a cage
read the statement and bergdahl 's letter bergdahl said for years his body and health declined due to malnourishment , and sores on his wrists and ankles from the shackles grew infected
bergdahl was frequently beaten , at times with copper wire or a thick rubber hose , and forced to watch taliban videos , he said
" boehner said the " more troubling part " of bergdahl saga is the fact that the united states government traded five taliban fighters for bergdahl 's release , and that recent reports indicate one has returned to the battlefield
" obama " violated the law " in failing to alert congress before the prisoner swap occurred , boehner added
the decision comes nearly a year after bergdahl returned to the united states as part of a prisoner exchange and since the army began a formal investigation into his disappearance from his unit in eastern afghanistan in june 2009
the army concluded its investigation into the circumstances of bergdahl 's capture in december
but the circumstances of bergdahl 's departure from his base and how willingly he left have not been clear
" sen. lindsey graham , r - south carolina , meanwhile , lambasted the " unevenness " of obama 's swap of five taliban prisoners for bergdahl
" some members of bergdahl 's platoon have criticized him , labeling bergdahl a deserter
" i was pissed off then , and i am even more so now with everything going on , " former sgt. matt vierkant , a member of bergdahl 's platoon when he went missing on june 30 , 2009 , told cnn last year
" bergdahl deserted during a time of war , and his fellow united states lost their lives searching for him
" bergdahl was freed in may when president obama agreed to swap five taliban prisoners who had been detained in guantanamo bay to secure bergdahl 's freedom , sending those detainees to qatar
obama announced bergdahl 's release to fanfare in the white house rose garden , flanked by the army sergeant 's parents , bob and jani bergdahl
his hometown of hailey , idaho , had planned a parade to celebrate bergdahl 's homecoming but later canceled that celebration amid security concerns stemming from the unanswered questions surrounding his disappearance and the resulting controversy over his release
the five figures the united states exchanged to secure bergdahl 's release were khair ulla said wali khairkhwa , mullah mohammad fazl , mullah norullah nori , abdul haq wasiq and mohammad nabi omari
the detainee swap for bergdahl has become increasingly controversial in recent weeks after a report published by the office of director of national intelligence james clapper said one of the 17 intelligence agencies operating under its umbrella had judged that a prisoner released in the exchange had since contacted the taliban
