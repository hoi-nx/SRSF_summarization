coroner mary hassell , who claims she has been left in fear of violence after being falsely accused of anti-semitism a senior coroner has accused orthodox jews of bullying and intimidating her in an extraordinary row over the handling of dead bodies
mary hassell claims she and her staff have been left in fear of violence after being bombarded by hundreds of complaints about how they deal with deaths in devoutly religious communities
in a letter seen by the mail on sunday , she says she has been falsely accused of anti-semitism and warns the situation risks becoming â volatile â
she says that on one occasion the police had to be called when 60 orthodox jews refused to let undertakers take the body of a man whose body they wanted to pray over
mrs mary hassell believes other families in the london area she covers are â suffering â because she has to spend so much of her time dealing with the large number of orthodox jews , whose faith requires them to bury their dead quickly and prevents them undergoing autopsies
but the orthodox jews say they are being â traumatised â by the coroner âs disregard for their beliefs , forcing them to take unprecedented legal action against her
in a letter to her bosses at camden council , mrs mary hassell writes : â i look forward to hearing how you intend to support those who work within the service for which you have statutory responsibility , and protect them from bullying , intimidation and the threat of violence
