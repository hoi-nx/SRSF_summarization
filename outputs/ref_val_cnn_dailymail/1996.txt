carver will use his holland world cup stars to inflict yet more st james ' park misery on louis van gaal â and says the dutch missed a trick in not taking janmaat with him to old trafford
first , with barcelona in 1997 , he was the victim of tino asprilla âs famous hat - trick in a 3 - 2 loss in the champions league group stages
ten years later he was back with az alkmaar as they were beaten 4 - 2 in the last 16 of the uefa cup , turning the tie with a 2 - 0 victory back in holland
van gaal returns with manchester united on wednesday where he will come up against janmaat and tim krul , two of the players who helped holland to the semi-finals of the world cup last summer
carver described janmaat ( left ) as an ' exceptional player ' ahead of newcastle 's match the newcastle boss ( right ) was surprised manchester united did n't make a move for the impressive full back and carver said : â janmaat and tim krul have been very helpful in terms of how van gaal organises his teams
â meanwhile , carver admits that newcastle âs Â£ 5million capture of janmaat has proved one of the best pieces of business from last summer
tim krul ( left ) and janmaat have been giving carver insight into how van gaal sets his sides up the 25 - year - old was an ever - present in brazil and , with manchester united short of options on the right side of defence , carver is surprised van gaal did not rival them for his signature
â i think van gaal perhaps had more pressing issues to sort out because let 's not forget , when he came in he was talking about playing with three centre - backs , â said carver
we lost a top player in mathieu debuchy but replaced him with an exceptional player
and the former feyenoord star certainly talks highly of his former international boss
