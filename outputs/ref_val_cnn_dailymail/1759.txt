the built - in device , called the intelligent speed limiter , automatically detects road signs and cameras and slows the car down where necessary
this image shows the system display on the dashboard , where the maximum speed is set at 50mph ( 80km/h ) it does this by using a windscreen - mounted camera to monitor road signs and when the speed limit is lower than that maximum set speed
drivers have to manually set a maximum speed using controls on the steering wheel , so they might choose 70mph ( 113km/h ) for a motorway , for example
the speed limiter is essentially a variation of a cruise control setting and allows the driver to set a maximum speed for the car
the system , in the s-max car ( pictured ) is essentially a variation of a cruise control setting and allows the driver to set a maximum speed for the car if the on board technology detects a lower speed limit is in place , on a motorway for example , then it slows the car down to that speed ( illustrated ) and then increases it if and when the limit goes up again the intelligent speed limiter can be controlled via controls on the steering wheel
the intelligent speed limiter communicates with an on - board navigation system to glean extra data in order to help it accurately maintain the appropriate maximum speed when distances between speed limit signs are greater , for example on long country roads
â the limiter works between speeds of 20mph and 120mph and the speed is reduced by restricting the amount of fuel supplied to the engine , making deceleration smoother
the intelligent speed limiter communicates with an on - board navigation system to glean extra data in order to help it accurately maintain the appropriate maximum speed when distances between speed limit signs are greater
the system is designed to stop people being caught by speed cameras ( stock image ) if the car goes downhill and picks up speed that can not be restricted this way , then an alarm will sound so that the driver can apply more braking
the s-max model can also detect a person or object in the road ahead and slam the brakes on if the driver does not do so themselves
