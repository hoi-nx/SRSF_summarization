john moore has been awarded Â£ 400 after being put up in a club 18-30 hotel by thomas cook a parish councillor has won a Â£ 400 payout from thomas cook after booking what he thought was a ' relaxing holiday ' to a greek party island where he was housed with ' boozed up ' youngsters at a club 18-30 hotel
john moore , 56 , from herne in kent , planned to spend a week on the island of zante with his partner angela , 51 , in september
rather than the peaceful break they were hoping for , the couple , who run a sweet shop in herne bay , kent , were booked into christina studios in the resort of laganas in zante , advertised as an 18 - 30 clubbing destination
after spending two nights in the hotel where youngsters were ' banging on the walls and screaming and shouting ' , the couple abandoned the package holiday for something more quiet
they have since been awarded Â£ 400 in compensation by the holiday company
while being advertised by club 18-30 , christina studios is described on the thomas cook website as ' one of the best chill - out zones ' in zante
' after complaining to the thomas cook rep at the resort , the couple were told in order to be relocated they would have to pay extra on top of the Â£ 600 they had already spent
mr john moore decided to launch legal action when they failed to act , and was recently offered Â£ 400 after requesting a summons from a judge
the hotel where mr john moore and his partner stayed was advertised as being 600m from the laganas strip ( above ) , hailed as one of zante 's biggest nightlife spots the 56 - year - old parish councillor said christina studios ( above ) where he was placed was ' packed with youngsters ' who ' screamed and banged on walls ' ' i 'm not surprised at all ( that they 've offered me money ) , they did n't have a leg to stand on , ' he said , speaking of the offer
' the apartments are a five minute walk from the laganas strip , described by thomas cook as zante 's ' party resort ' whose nightlife is ' in the same league as ibiza '
but mr john moore claims he was sold a relaxing holiday , with the resort also described as suitable for family trips
' we would like to apologise to mr john moore for any inconvenience he may have experienced while staying at the christina studios in zante with our escapades brand in september 2014 , ' a spokesman said
