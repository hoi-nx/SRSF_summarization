" cinderella , " the latest live - action retelling of a classic , sparkled like a glass slipper in its opening weekend , with an estimated debut of $ 70.1 million
liam neeson 's latest thriller , " run all night , " opened in a very soft second place
liam neeson has been a solid draw since he reinvented himself as an action star six years ago with " taken , " but " run all night " debuted even more weakly than last year 's dismal " a walk among the tombstones
in limited release , the critically acclaimed horror thriller " it follows " made $ 163,000 in just four theaters , far and away the weekend 's best per - theater average
among returning films , colin firth and " kingsman : the secret service " shone the brightest , topping the $ 100 million mark in total domestic grosses and actually rising a spot on the chart , while last weekend 's winner , " chappie , " and runner - up , " focus , " duked it out for fourth place
