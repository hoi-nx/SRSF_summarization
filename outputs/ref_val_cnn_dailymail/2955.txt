' brainwashed ' : amer deghayes was exploited by radical islamists before he went to fight with jihadists in syria , according to his mother the mother of three teenagers who ran away to syria to wage jihad says her sons were ' brainwashed ' by youtube videos and their extremist friends
inas abulsayen was left heartbroken when her sons left their home in sussex and travelled to fight with a branch of al qaeda against the assad regime
her two younger sons abdullah and jaffar deghayes have now been killed in the war - torn country , and she has launched a public appeal for their older brother amer to come home
amer , 20 , left the family home in saltdean , near brighton , in october 2013 and joined the al nusra front , and two months later his brothers joined him in syria
in april last year , 18 - year - old abdullah was killed in a battle which also left amer injured , and in october jaffar died while fighting against assad 's troops in december
despite his brothers ' deaths , amer is determined to remain in the middle east , and has ignored his family 's demands for him to return to britain
mrs inas abulsayen said her sons were influenced by radical videos which they watched online , and insisted that she and her husband abubaker were opposed to extremism
' my sons went to serve , to sacrifice , and now two of them are dead , ' she said
' we have our religion , but there is lots of brainwashing on youtube , in the mosques , through friends
mrs inas abulsayen said : ' i had lots of arguments with him because he talked about osama bin laden , jihad - and i did n't want my sons in this position
' i heard kamara say to jaffar , " you are not young now , jaffar
" ' kamara died in a us air strike in aleppo last year after travelling to syria with jaffar
mrs inas abulsayen added that her sons told her they wanted to carry out humanitarian missions but instead turned to jihad once they arrived in syria
' father : abubaker deghayes outside his home in october , announcing that jaffar had been killed uncle : omar deghayes spent five years as a detainee in guantanamo bay before being released three months later , her two other sons left without telling their family where they were going , she said
" ' two weeks before he left , jaffar told me he would never leave me , so i do n't know who brainwashed him
in a film shot last year , amer insisted he would not return home , saying : ' my work here is not done
' if he did return to britain , amer could face legal action , because the al nusra front is classified as a banned terrorist organisation by the government .
