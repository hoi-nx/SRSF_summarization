these distressing pictures show a skeletal lurcher found roaming the streets just days from death in one of the worst neglect cases ever seen by an rspca inspector
the dog , whose rib cage and spine can clearly be seen , was completely emaciated , had suffered fur loss and was covered in fleas when she was found with a jack russell
rspca inspector bailey said : ' i have come across some pretty poorly dogs in my time as an inspector but i can safely say there have been few that have been as thin as this poor lurcher
' the lurcher was found with a jack russell ( pictured ) in new forest , hampshire , and the pair have formed a close bond recovering : it may be some weeks before the poorly lurcher is in a fit enough state to be re-homed an rspca inspector said he had never seen a dog as thin and emaciated as the lurcher , which was found earlier this week the dogs , who are both female , are now recovering however it could be some time before the lurcher is in a fit enough state to find a new family
because of their bond , the canine companions could be re-homed together , but this may not be the possible because the jack russell is likely to be healthy enough to be re-homed sooner
