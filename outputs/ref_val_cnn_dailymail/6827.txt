now , scientists believe the first four - limbed vertebrates , known as tetrapods , that lived 360 million years ago may have been more like modern crocodiles than previously thought
scientists have reconstructed a 360 million - year old tetrapod 's skull from bone fragments , to reveal it was similarly shaped to a modern day crocodile 's
individual bones are shown in different colours acanthostega gunnari lived between 380 and 360 million years ago when animals made the transition from the sea to land
they found that the reconstructed skull had a longer postorbital region and a more strongly hooked lower jaw than previously thought , making it relatively similar to modern crocodiles
to reconstruct the skull of the species from numerous pieces , scientists from the bristol university put fossil specimens of acanthostega gunnari from east greenland into a ct scanner , before using a computer programme to assemble it
they found that the reconstructed skull had a longer postorbital region and a more strongly hooked lower jaw than previously thought , making it relatively similar to a modern crocodile 's skull
the reconstruction has also provided some clues as to how the species fed. the size and distribution of the reptile 's teeth and the shape of contacts between individual bones of the skull , called sutures , suggest acanthostega gunnari may have initially seized prey at the front of its jaws using its large front teeth and lower jaw
' our new reconstruction suggests the skull of acanthostega gunnari was taller and somewhat narrower than previously interpreted - more similar to the skull of a modern crocodile
