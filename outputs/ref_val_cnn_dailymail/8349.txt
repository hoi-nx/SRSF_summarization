this is the moment a playful young seal tries its best to hitch a ride with a couple of kayaks - but keeps sliding off
the grey seal pup was filmed as it made several attempts to climb aboard the canoes in poole bay , dorset
hitching a ride : ron the friendly seal attempts to climb onto a kayak in poole bay , dorset attempt one : the young pup makes it onto one of the kayaks , and momentarily keeps his balance he then manages to get onto the left kayak , but just as it looks like he has found himself a comfortable spot - he falls in again
the pup , known locally as ron the seal , finally succeeds by draping himself across both of the kayaks
kayaker andrew linstead shot the video of the young seal 's repeated attempts to climb aboard his raft as he paddled in poole bay
this is the third time mr andrew linstead has had an encounter with ron the seal in four months
last november , while mr andrew linstead was practicing rolling his kayak in the water , he noticed the seal watching him and then joining in , rolling every time he did
fail : unfortunately for ron , he can not manage to stay on the kayak , and falls back in the water on it again : ron the seal proves he is not a quitter and is soon at it again , trying to climb the kayaks a month later , the pair met again , as ron jumped on the back of his kayak and hitched a ride around for several hours
the latest encounter , filmed by mr andrew linstead , lasted for four hours with ron climbing on and off mr andrew linstead 's kayak and even bringing him a fish it had caught
mr andrew linstead , from london , said : ' i 've had quite a few encounters with ron now , we are becoming good friends ! ' the first time i saw him was when i was practising rolling my kayak
