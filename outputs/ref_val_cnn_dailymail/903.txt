miss kari anderson , who has lived in a penthouse flat with her 25 - year - old son directly above pearson for 15 years , told the court : ' i was carrying a bin bag in one hand and an overnight bag in the other
i shone the light at the top of the stairs and then i saw the wire
' the mother - of - two , who owns a property business and a separate beauty company , was so severely injured that she needed surgery following the incident

' miss kari anderson told the court she had also been prescribed medication for anxiety and had been left Â£ 12,000 out of pocket as a result of having to hire extra staff to help her manage her businesses
judge shetty , sentencing , said : ' you knew that miss kari anderson often left in the early hours of the morning and you knew that because the hallway light was n't working , it would be dark when she left
' you put a wire across the top of the stairs to act as an improvised tripwire
