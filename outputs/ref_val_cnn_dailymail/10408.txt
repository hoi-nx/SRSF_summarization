target has proposed to pay $ 10million to settle a class - action lawsuit brought against the retailer following a massive data breach in 2013
the proposed settlement would also require minneapolis - based target to appoint a chief information security officer , keep a written information security program and offer security training to its workers
target 's data breach in 2013 exposed details of as many as 40 million credit and debit card accounts and hurt its holiday sales that year the chain has worked hard to lure back customers that were hesitant to shop there after the incident
target 's bounce back from a turbulent stretch including the data breach and exit from canada has been met with optimism on wall street
the retailer 's stock traded above $ 80 for the first time monday
earlier this month , target said it would lay off about 1,700 people , eliminate another 1,400 unfilled positions and cut up to $ 2billion in costs
a court hearing on the proposed settlement is set for thursday in st. paul , minneapolis .
