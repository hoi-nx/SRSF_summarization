on the basketball court , turk forgets that he walks with a limp and a cane
now , the man who was told he might never walk again is coaching his team in the state playoffs
turk is the head basketball coach at west oso high school in corpus christi , texas
his team just clinched the district championship after an undefeated district season and are playing in the texas state basketball playoffs
it 's an impressive run for his first season as head coach -- and an inspiration to his young players
" coach shows us to never give up on any of your dreams , " says 14 - year - old starter creighton avery , who has known turk since he was 9
turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in indiana
after numerous tests , turk was diagnosed with transverse myelitis , a rare disease that causes inflammation of the spinal cord
turk and his family were facing the harsh truth about what his quality of life would be like
he had to cope with the fact that he may not walk again
" most patients do not recover well , " said turk
a turning point came when reggie miller , the indiana pacers ' all - star player and turk 's favorite basketballer , heard about what turk was going through and paid him a visit in the hospital
reggie miller and turk spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories
the basketball player told him about growing up with pronated hips and having to wear leg braces , similar to the ones turk was wearing at the time
" reggie miller inspired me and helped me to embrace who i was , " turk said
turk participated in a rigorous physical therapy regimen and by his senior year he shed his last leg brace and began to walk with a cane , which he continues to walk with today
" i keep that last leg brace today on my desk as a reminder of where i have come from , " said turk
turk attended indiana state university , where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach
" all turk wanted was to coach his own basketball team
from 2009 to 2010 , he applied for 10 high school head coaching positions and numerous assistant coaching positions
and in 2014 , almost 10 years after moving to corpus christi , he became the head coach
" i want my students to know that i care about them , that i work for and belong to them , " said turk
