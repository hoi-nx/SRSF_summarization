a balloon carrying sensors designed to detect the faint traces left by alien life on other planets has been sent on a mission high into the earth 's atmosphere
the planetary atmospheres minor species sensor ( planetary atmospheres minor species sensor ) spent more than an hour at 105,000 feet above the earth 's surface taking measurements before parachuting safely back to the ground
the experimental sensor , developed by researchers at nasa and the university of central florida , was being tested ahead of plans to send the device to other planets
the high altitude balloon above carried the new highly sensitive instrument 19.8 miles into the atmosphere capable of detecting traces of gas at parts per trillion - far more sensitive from current technologies - it could reveal the existence of life on other planets
the planetary atmospheres minor species sensor sensor is launched into the air beneath a high - altitude balloon from tucson , arizona professor peale , a physicist at the university of central florida who is leading the project , said : ' our sensor has the potential to detect specific gases at extremely low concentrations
' metabolic byproducts of life include characteristic gases like methane , which on mars would be a very low concentrations
the toaster - sized device uses a technique known as ' intracavity laser absorption spectrometry ' to detect small amounts of gas
however , nasa hopes that by using the planetary atmospheres minor species sensor they may be able to detect small amounts of methane on other worlds like mars , jupiter 's moon europa and saturn 's moon enceladus
using a high - altitude balloon , they gathered samples of dust and other microscopic debris high above the earth 's surface and say they found fragments of single celled algae known as a diatom
however the team believe the device could also have applications on earth to help monitor changes in the ozone layer as well as helping to detect traces of gas in breath tests to help diagnose disease
' the planetary atmospheres minor species sensor , shown above sitting on top of laboratory equipment being used to calibrate the device , is about the size of a domestic toaster and can detect minute traces of gases
