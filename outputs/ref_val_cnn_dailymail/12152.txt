when walter isaacson 's biography of jobs came out in october 2011 -- less than three weeks after jobs ' death -- it crystallized many popularly held perceptions of the apple co-founder
walter isaacson 's book contained numerous examples of jobs ' cruel behavior , such as verbally abusing employees whose work did n't meet his exacting standards
now a new book is presenting a kinder , gentler portrait of the mercurial tech exec. " becoming jobs , " by schlender and rick tetzeli , seeks to humanize jobs through interviews with those who knew him in the latter , wildly successful phases of his career , when some of his rough edges had softened
unlike walter isaacson 's book , it 's an unauthorized bio , one that was not given jobs ' blessing before he died
and yet apple , mindful of jobs ' legacy , has clearly endorsed this new vision of their former ceo over the walter isaacson version
it was just a rehash of a bunch of stuff that had already been written , and focused on small parts of his personality , " says current apple ceo tim cook in the new book
" other apple execs also have heaped praise on " becoming jobs " while criticizing walter isaacson 's bestseller
and jony ive , apple 's head of design , said in a new yorker profile last month , " my regard ( for walter isaacson 's book ) could n't be any lower
" walter isaacson , for his part , told the new york times recently that he tried to present a balanced view of jobs : " my book is very favorable and honest , with no anonymous slings , " he said
although jobs ' life and career have been well chronicled , the new book contains some fresh tidbits : -- in 2009 , when jobs was dying of cancer , tim cook offered his boss a piece of his liver but jobs refused , saying , " no , i 'll never let you do that
" ' becoming jobs ' offers a more rounded portrait of the man not only because it does n't lean as heavily on its interviews or stretch for historical weight like walter isaacson 's book , but because it brings in schlender 's personal interactions with the apple co-founder , " wrote wright for the next web
