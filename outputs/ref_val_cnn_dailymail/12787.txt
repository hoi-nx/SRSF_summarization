howard would like a little bit more reality on his hit show " empire
" the actor , who plays hip - hop recording mogul lucious lyon on the series , recently told entertainment weekly that 's he 's " mad that we do n't say n * * * * r in the show
" " why is tv showing something different from the reality of the world ? " howard asked
you do n't just sit up , you know , let 's give a little aspirin right here ; no , we need to take the sutures , open up the problem and reach in and grab it , " the actor explained
" and since n * * * * r is used in almost every conversation in most black neighborhoods , why is it that we do n't hear it on tv anymore ? are white people afraid of it ? did they create the word ? but if this is something that we use on a daily basis , then let 's address what it really means
" and what does the word mean to the " empire " star ? " oh , it could mean love ; sometimes it 's a noun ; sometimes it 's a verb ; sometimes it 's an adjective ; it 's all , there 's a spirit attached to it , you know , " howard said
" but co-star taraji p. henson , who plays his ex-wife , cookie lyon , is not feeling it
when tmz asked whether she believed the fox series should be using the word , she responded , " naw , you might piss people off
