sturgeon yesterday vowed to work with labour to â lock the tories out â of power
in an extraordinary speech in london , scotland âs first minister claimed voters across the uk would welcome her party âs influence at westminster , saying she would end austerity
but , following mounting pressure from senior colleagues , miliband last night tried to draw a line under speculation about a labour - snp government by ruling out a formal coalition
labour leader miliband said a formal coalition with the snp ' will not happen ' - but failed to rule out forming a looser alliance on a vote - by - vote basis the labour leader said there would be â no snp ministers â in any government he leads after may âs general election
but mr miliband pointedly refused to rule out a deal that would see the resurgent scotland nationalists prop up a minority labour government in key commons votes â the preferred option of miss sturgeon
â but working with labour in a looser arrangement , i certainly would nât rule out because i want to see snp labour mps in the house of commons pushing for progressive change
â pollsters suggest the snp is on course for an unprecedented breakthrough at the general election , winning dozens of labour seats and depriving mr miliband of any chance of a majority
john curtice , of strathclyde university and one of the country âs leading election experts , said the snp appeared on the brink of winning 45 of scotland âs 59 seats
ms sturgeon , appearing on itv 's lorraine show , claimed that if labour ruled out a deal with the snp they would be saying they were happy to see david cameron ' waltz back in to number 10 ' â that means the formation of any government after may 7 will be with the acquiescence of the snp , â the professor added
william hague , the leader of the commons , said an issue - by - issue deal between labour and the snp would be â even worse â
miss sturgeon , speaking at the london school of economics , set out a shopping list of demands for a deal with labour , including Â£ 180billion of extra borrowing , ditching the trident nuclear deterrent , and billions more in benefits for the working poor
