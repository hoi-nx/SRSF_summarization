the images have been taken using a victorian photography technique and are part of a project to resurrect the earliest form of the art. instead of the instant results of instagram and other digital apps , each picture takes 20 minutes to develop and requires a number of chemicals
the method was invented in 1850 and , although initially used for formal studio portraits , it became enormously popular and photographers started offering casual portraiture at events such as fairs and amusement parks
the process works by coating a metal with a chemical called collodion before placing it into a silver nitrate solution , which makes it light sensitive
the plate is then loaded into the camera and the picture is taken
in victorian times this would have been the deadly poison potassium cyanide , but mr martin opts for a less risky sodium thiosulphate
