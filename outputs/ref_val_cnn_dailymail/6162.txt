boyce can attest to that after she spent years going back and forth between hospital and home with her young daughter sophie
when sophie was only three - years - old she put her delicate hand on a running treadmill and it gave her a nasty friction burn which required years of medical attention
sophie told daily mail australia the clown doctors always went above and beyond doing ' anything they could ' to give her and the other kids in the hospital a ' break from reality
' ' there would be some pretty bad things happening to me and it would hurt quite a lot but the clown doctors would totally take that away and make it fun
after watching her daughter emotionally connect with the clown doctors during such a challenging time in her life ms boyce said she was certain the doctors had a massive influence on sophie 's emotional well being
' there were days where sophie was having procedures to her hand and the clown doctor 's were having difficultly distracting her so they would start finding medical instruments in the room to play sword fights or even throw water balloons on the roof
' ms boyce said she found it challenging to describe exactly what the clown doctors did because it was more than just what they did , it was about how they made her daughter feel
' sophie , left , was only three - years - old when she started coming to the royal melbourne children 's hospital the doctors were shocked by how quickly sophie 's hand healed and ms boyce attributed this to sophie 's overall happiness during her treatment
blue steel : sophie said having the clown doctors around made the experience less harrowing she said sophie became so involved with the clown doctors that she even started dressing up and joining in herself
sophie said it can be hard for adults and parents to really understand what the clown doctors do but in her opinion ' they really do change lives
' lou pollard , who goes by the name of dr quack , is one of sixty clown doctors prescribing doses of fun and laughter across 22 major hospitals in australia
' some lucky australia cricketers got the chance to see the good work the clown doctors are doing first hand after sending steve smith , brad haddin and nathan lyon to randwick children 's hospital to test out some of ms pollard 's terrible dad jokes
spreading the joy : some of australia 's best cricketers joined dr quack at the randwick children 's hospital children are n't the only patients the clown doctors end up treating either
' she said the clown doctors create a sense of calm which gives parents the rare opportunity to see their kid with a smile on their face
relieved : ms boyce said she felt a sense of calm when the clown doctors came to visit sophie sophie and ms boyce are so passionate about spreading joy in hospitals all over australia they have spent a considerable amount of time advocating for the alternative medicine
' the sort of medicine the clown doctors dispense is just as important as the medicine the hospital is dispensing , ' said ms boyce
' as long as there are kids in hospitals , clown doctors need to be in hospitals
' while clown doctors are working in every major children 's hospital across the country , they do n't always get to spend as much time there as they would like
ms pollard said clown doctors spend three or four days of the week in some major hospitals but some others are lucky to get one day of comedic relief a week
laughter is the best medicine : ms pollard says clown doctors need to be in hospitals full time the clown doctors are a not - for - profit organisation and receive no government or hospital funding so donations are vital to their continued existence
ms pollard said she was thrilled to see commbank come on board to try and get clown doctors into more wards across australia
they are aiming to raise a massive $ 200,000 to further fund the clown doctor operation
australia cricket great michael clarke got involved with this selfie earning the clown doctors five dollars after spending years in the industry ms pollard said she goes to work every day knowing her job is a ' privilege
â donations to the clown doctors can also be made at any commbank branch until the end of march or online at commbank.com.au / clowndoctors
