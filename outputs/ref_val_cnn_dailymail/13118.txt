for those who hoped that the coming presidential election would usher in the dawn of a new , more inspiring politics , this past week has been deeply discouraging
the first and substantively more important moment was the sending of that letter by republicans senators to the iran regime
the second , and perhaps more important politically telling moment , was hillary clinton 's handling of her emails
in both cases , the principals have also created divisive issues that will deepen polarization through the campaign and probably into the next presidency
both have diminished the chances for breaking out of today 's ugly politics
republicans in congressional have reason to press hard with their views as negotiations with iran enter the home stretch
they , like many others -- including a sizable number of democrats , the current israeli government , and friendly arab nations -- fear the obama administration will cut a weak , leaky deal that will allow iran to come perilously close to having nuclear weapons
instead , they made the mistake -- a wicked one -- of sending it to the terrorist leaders of iran , leaving a clear impression they were out to sabotage both the deal and the president
where do we go then ? will talks collapse ? will an iran rush toward the bomb set off a nuclear arms race , starting in saudi arabia , which is already taking preliminary steps ? will the american then be compelled to use military force against iran ? who knows for sure ? what we do know is that iran is now almost certain to become a central issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and that the republicans nominee will be under relentless pressure from the right to adopt a hard , unyielding line
one can just imagine a number of republicans candidates pledging that if elected , they will abolish obamacare on day 1 and an iran agreement on day 2
hillary clinton 's mistakes did not start with creating an email protection system
no , they started when she and her team failed to coordinate up front with the state department system and record all official exchanges within the government system on a prompt , air - tight basis
the other half ( who knows what 's in there ? ) have been deleted and she is keeping the server
she was always going to face a rough campaign , but now she will begin with clouds already gathering
and she has also has a strong case to make that she and her husband know something about job creation : 22.9 million were created in the eight clinton years , more than in any other presidency since world war ii ( reagan was second at 16.1 million ; there have been some 6.4 million in the first six obama years
clinton likes to say that politics is always about tomorrow -- and he is right
after this last week , they might start by reading a wonderful book by historian tuchman published some 30 years ago : " the march of folly : from troy to vietnam
" there she argues that leaders often start out trying to do the right thing but take a wrong path , stubbornly stick with it despite all evidence and eventually wreck
