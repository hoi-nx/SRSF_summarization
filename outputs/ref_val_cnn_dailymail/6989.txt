smoke from burned food in the kitchen can damage the brains of unborn babies , scientists say
similarly , pollution from coal fires and traffic fumes disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour
scans of inner - city children from before birth until aged seven to nine revealed those exposed to high levels of air pollution had lower white matter in their left brain , impairing intelligence and causing adhd and aggression
the us study looked at neurotoxic pah - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - and its effects on the brains of inner city kids
they are contained in vehicles fumes , coal fires or oil central heating systems , power plants , wildfires and agricultural burning , tobacco smoke and hazardous waste sites earlier studies has shown pah can readily cross the placenta and affects an unborn child 's brain and animal studies showed that prenatal exposure impaired the development of behaviour , learning and memory
it involved taking brain scans of 40 children in new york , followed from before birth until aged seven to nine
traffic fumes , pollution from coal fires and smoke from burnt food disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour they were part of a cohort of more than 600 mother - baby pairs from which columbia researchers had previously reported exposure to airborne pah during gestation was associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disturbances
postnatal pah exposure - measured at age five - was found to contribute to additional disturbances in development of white matter in the dorsal prefrontal region of the brain , which is associated with concentration , reasoning , judgment , and problem - solving ability
although the study involved a small sample of ethnic minority children in poor inner city areas with low educational achievements , a larger study is underway
he added : ' our findings raise important concerns about the effects of air pollutants on brain development in children , and the consequences of those brain effects on cognition and behaviour
the baby whose mother was a smoker ( top ) and the other carried by a non-smoker ( bottom ) show developmental differences dr reissland , of durham university , said the ultrasound scans show unborn babies of mothers who smoke may have delayed development of their central nervous systems as part of the study , dr reissland , of durham university , used 4 - d ultrasound scan images to record thousands of tiny movements in the womb
