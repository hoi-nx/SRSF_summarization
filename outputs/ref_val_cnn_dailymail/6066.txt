the scheduled wednesday execution of a convicted cop killer that would have used up the state 's last dose of a lethal injection drug has been halted by the highest criminal appeals court in texas
the texas court of criminal appeals ruled to stop the scheduled execution of 55 - year - old mays late on monday
mays was convicted of murder after a shootout in 2007 left henderson county sheriff 's office investigator paul steven habelt and deputy tony price ogburn dead
thanks to the delay , texas has enough pentobarbital for its next scheduled execution on april 9
mays was going to receive a lethal injection
the delay means texas ' next execution can go on as planned as a result of this order , mays ' case will be sent back to henderson county
