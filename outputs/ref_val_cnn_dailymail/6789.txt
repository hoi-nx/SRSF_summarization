it âs one of the most famous scenes from any movie , let alone jurassic park : two raptors enter the kitchen , stalking two children - their human prey
it turns out that many of the dinosaur sounds in the hit 1993 film were made by recording modern animals - including , bizarrely , tortoises mating
other dinosaur sounds were ' voiced ' by a variety of animals
these include horses , donkeys , cattle and a dog for the tyrannosaurus rex in an interview for sf gate , sound designer for the movie rydstrom confirmed the odd choice of sound effect
but this was nât the only bizarre animal noise used in the movie ; it turns out horses , donkeys and even cattle were used for some of the other dinosaur calls
â the brachiosaur âs singing is one of my favourite sounds in the movie because it âs beautiful , but like all good sound design it 's made from a non-beautiful source , which is donkeys , â mr rydstrom told vulture
in an interview for sf gate , sound designer for the movie rydstrom confirmed the odd choice of sound effect
shown is a stock image of seychelles giant tortoises ( dipsochelys hololissa ) mating and even the tyrannosaurus rex got the animal treatment , with mr rydstrom âs own pet jack russell terrier being used to voice the huge dinosaur
and a trailer confirmed velociraptors would be making a return in the film - but whether they will similarly be voiced by mating tortoises you âll have to wait and see whether similar sound effects have been used
