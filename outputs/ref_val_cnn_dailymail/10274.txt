asian and formosan subterranean termites , two of the most destructive termite species on the planet , are could be mating in florida
they are producing hybrid colonies of ' super termites ' that are growing at twice the normal rate
asian ( pictured ) and formosan subterranean termites , two of the most destructive termite species on the planet , are could be mating in south florida.they are producing hybrid colonies of ' super termites ' that are growing at twice the normal rate together , asian and formosan subterranean termites , are responsible for much of the estimated $ 40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually
the formosan termites originated in china but now are established throughout the southeast and blamed for roughly $ 300m in property damage each year in new orleans alone
asian termites normally found in tropical south - eastern asian have spread to brazil , the caribbean and south florida
asian termites are not expected to spread farther north in the us than south florida because they do not tolerate colder weather / however , a hybrid might be able to thrive in a greater range than either species alone
' chouvenc is the lead author of a study published this week i the journal plos one detailing observations of asian and formosan termite swarms in downtown fort lauderdale
' what we did n't expect to see was when they 're in the same place at the same time , we saw the male asian subterranean termites looking for the female formosan termites in the field , ' chouvenc said
together , asian and formosan ( pictured ) subterranean termites , are responsible for much of the estimated $ 40 billion in economic losses attributed to termites annually ' when we put them in vials and brought them back to the lab , to our biggest surprise they started laying eggs and the eggs started growing
it is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in fort lauderdale , or whether the hybrids bred in the lab can reproduce
it is still unknown whether a hybrid colony has survived in the wild in fort lauderdale in the south of florida female termites can lay millions of eggs , but it takes five to eight years for a colony to produce the mature adults that fly in the mating swarms
liquid insecticides injected into the soil or baited traps are effective ways for homeowners to fight back against asian and formosan termites , and those methods should work against any hybrid , messenger said
