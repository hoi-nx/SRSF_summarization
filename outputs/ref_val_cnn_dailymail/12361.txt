dhaka , bangladesh at least six people have died and more than 60 were injured after the roof of a partially built cement factory collapsed thursday in southwestern bangladesh , police and fire officials told cnn
many of those injured were in critical condition , said mohammed bakir hossain , the top government physician of bagerhat district
the factory is owned by sena kalyan sangstha , a welfare organization for former bangladesh troops and their beneficiaries , according to rahman and other local officials
deadly incidents at factories and other buildings , sadly , are nothing new in bangladesh
that blaze led to the convictions of 13 people for gross negligence of safety measures and spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers ' rights in bangladesh
the government responded by revamping laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions , and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5 % of their profits toward a workers ' welfare fund
yet this has n't stopped more deadly incidents , including the january deaths of at least 13 people when a fire broke out inside a dhaka factory
