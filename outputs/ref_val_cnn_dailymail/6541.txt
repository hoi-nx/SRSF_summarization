four years after undergoing brain surgery , american holmes has a golden opportunity to put the seal on his heartening recovery by claiming the biggest title of his career on sunday
the huge - hitting kentucky native served notice he was bang in form when he opened up the wgc-cadillac championship here with a startling round of 62 â described by johnny miller on american television on saturday as one of the great rounds of the last 20 years
it seemed to catch up with holmes when he put four balls into the water on friday and started with an ugly three putt from just 5ft at the first hole of his third round
holmes acknowledges the crowd after making a hole - in - one during saturday 's round holmes , who leads the wgc-cadillac championship by five shots , had brain surgery four years ago for the first time since thursday he did not own the lead outright and , with players of the calibre of dustin johnson , henrik stenson and bubba watson champion bubba watson lurking , there were fears he would fall back still further
with dustin johnson and bubba watson his nearest pursuers , holmes wo nât be spending the mammoth Â£ 1.25 million first prize just yet
lee westwood is best placed of the brits in 8th place but a long way off the pace , at eight shots behind
the big - hitting holmes looks delighted after becoming the second man to ace the 14th in 30 minutes after a difficult start on saturday holmes remained patient to hold onto his lead going into the final round â i felt like i hit it a little better but my iron play is still not as sharp as i would like it to be , â said the world no 1
an unusually wet and windy third round made it tough for the players , with only dustin johnson ( 69 ) managing to break 70 among the last 12 groups
dustin johnson , who is holmes ' closest threat , eyes up a put during saturday 's round dustin johnson also aced the 14th , but is five shots behind holmes , alongsided masters ' champion bubba watson after shooting an 80 in the uspga championship in 2011 holmes withdrew and , suffering from vertigo symptoms , went to see a neurologist
lee westwood is the best - placed brit , but his eight shots back and tied for eighth place after three rounds dustin johnson and bubba watson are showing just why they will be heavily favoured at the masters next month , when the latter will be trying to win a third green jacket in four years
lee westwood is playing in his 50th wgc-cadillac championship event but it is a long shot that it will end in his first victory
