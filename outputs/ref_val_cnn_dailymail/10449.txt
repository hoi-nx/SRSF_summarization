rona fairhead should resign or be sacked as chairman of the bbc , a leading mp demanded yesterday
margaret hodge said mrs fairhead , who is also a director of hsbc , had been either â incredibly naive or totally incompetent â over the tax evasion scandal at the bank âs swiss division
the 53 - year - old was criticised by mps on the powerful public accounts committee as they grilled her over allegations that the embattled bank helped wealthy clients to hide billions of pounds from the taxman
but mps said her performance at the bank was not good enough â raising serious questions over whether she is suitable for her bbc role
committee chairman margaret hodge said : â i really do think you should consider your position and consider resigning and if not , the government should sack you
â mrs fairhead has already come under considerable pressure over potential conflicts between her multiple jobs , since she started as chairman of the bbc last september
public accounts committee chairman margaret hodge said ms fairhead had lost her trust , but tory committee member stephen hammond disagreed with the call for her to resign in addition to the Â£ 110,000 - a - year position , on which she spends three days a week , she is a non-executive director of pepsi and hsbc
last week mrs fairhead told a conference that she would prioritise her job at the bbc over her other positions , and that she was keeping her roles on the hsbc and pepsi boards â under review â
