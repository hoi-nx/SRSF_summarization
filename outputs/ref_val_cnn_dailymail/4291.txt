in this incredible video of an ultrasound scan , the 14 - week - old foetus appears to clap its hands together , as the mother sings if you 're happy and you know it clap your hands
the baby clapping in its mother 's womb has been rewound to seem like he 's clapping to a song the parents can be heard laughing in the background as the doctor then rewinds the tape to make it look like that baby was clapping along to their singing
