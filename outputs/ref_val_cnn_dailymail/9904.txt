twelve years ago 24 photographers decided to carry out an ambitious project - to document a full new year 's day every year for 24 years
to begin with each was allocated one hour of the day to record what was going on around them
but the project did not stop there
this was a project that was to last 24 years , with each photographer progressing one hour every year , so that at the end of 24 years , there will be 24 sets of images from new year 's day - or 576 images
' to contrast with the chaos she took this picture of a couple in ' a calm embrace and in their own magic space ' the original 24 photographers met while studying on a postgraduate photography course at central st martin 's in london
six prints from this year 's project will be auctioned off in aid of hope and homes for children , an international charity working to ensure that all children have the chance to grow up in the love of a family
now in its 12th year this group of dedicated photographers are still going out in all weathers and all hours to capture something that shows something of the first day of each new year
their commitment to the project is inspiring
' claire spreadbury , founder of 24photography , said : ' the exhibition is going from strength to strength and now in our twelfth year we 've really developed an identity and feel that we 're an established part of london 's art calendar
new year 's day is an exciting time of the year , and we hope that 24 captures some of that excitement , but also gives a little glimpse into the rest of the day after the celebrations and parties
