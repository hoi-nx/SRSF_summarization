a push for answers on how a new york police officer avoided criminal charges in the videotaped chokehold death of garner has stalled because it does not protect grand jury secrecy
new york state supreme court justice garnett ruled on thursday that the grand jury record would remain under seal
he wrote that the law required the plaintiffs to establish a ' compelling and particularized need ' to release the grand jury minutes
testimony from the grand jury than did not indict the police officer involved in the death of garner ( right , with family ) will remain sealed after a decision from new york state supreme court justice garnett mr garner was seen saying ' i ca n't breathe ' after being taken to a ground by a policeman on new york 's staten island borough the staten island judge 's ruling cited a handful of rare instances where new york courts authorized disclosure , but only to specific parties for specific reasons â not out of the public interest
for example , a 2012 appeals court ruling authorized release of bank records from a grand jury proceeding to someone seeking a civil judgment against the united arab emirates
a 2001 decision even gave the son of a defendant in a decades - old murder case access to grand jury minutes to use for a movie script
at a hearing in february , garnett had asked over and over how the garner grand jury minutes would be used
' the death of mr garner ( left poster ) and brown ( right poster ) and the subsequent non-indictment of the police officers involved in their deaths sparked a series of protests
justice garnett wrote that none of the plaintiffs seeking to unveil the grand jury testimony showed a ' compelling and particularized need ' for the information the effort to make the garner grand jury record public had been considered a longshot
by preserving secrecy in the garner case , the court ' has reinforced the distrust many new york already feel toward the performance of the criminal justice system in this case , ' said nyclu legal director arthur eisenberg
the nyclu and others had asked the court to order staten island district attorney donovan to release the grand jury transcript , including the testimony of pantaleo , and dozens of witnesses , detailed descriptions of evidence and other documentation
a lawyer for mr garner 's family said that the secrecy of grand juries was an ' anachronism
' above , his daughter erica leads a demonstration in september , when the grand jury decision was announced a similar step was voluntarily taken by the prosecutor in ferguson , missouri , when a grand jury there refused to indict an officer in the fatal police shooting of 18 - year - old brown
' ' if every newsworthy case were deemed compelling and , thus justified disclosure , the veil of grand jury secrecy would be lifted and every citizen 's right to have fellow citizens , sitting on a grand jury , check the power of the police and the prosecutor without pressure from outside influences â real or perceived â would be imperiled , ' the justice said
' their collective decision should not be impeached by the unbridled speculation that the integrity of this grand jury was impaired in any way
' we think this grand jury process was deeply flawed , ' he said
