what 's better than the sun on a march day in europe , at the tail end of winter with spring on the doorstep ? no sun , apparently
that was the verdict of many around the continent , who found friday morning 's solar eclipse picture perfect
millions from around north africa , the middle east as well as europe woke up with a chance to see the rare cosmic event
for some of them , it was a partial eclipse ; but others -- say if you were at the north pole , or in svalbard or the faroe islands between iceland and norway -- got the full deal
such eclipses are basically as old as the galaxy itself , happening when the moon and sun are at just the right distance from the earth and they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky -- even though the sun is actually about 400 times larger
an eclipse happens when the moon passes right in front of the sun , blocking the sunlight and casting a shadow on the earth
that means what used to be morning suddenly looks like nighttime again , until the sun and moon get out of each other 's way
staring at the sun anytime can be a bit dangerous , even when it 's there , not there , then there again during an eclipse
clouds be damned , some folks there used a sun costume , along with an earth - and - moon prop , to put on a show of their own
that means there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun. but do n't sweat it just yet : nasa calculates this will take about 563 million years , meaning there 's still time to catch another eclipse
