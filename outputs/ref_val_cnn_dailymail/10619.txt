an indiana couple who shocked doctors by naturally conceiving identical triplets welcomed their three daughters into the world on thursday night
the event was one - in - a - million , medical professionals said , and ashley and matt alexander , of greenfield , outside indianapolis , said they knew how they lucky they are
sophia mae and alexis kae weighed in at more than 4 pounds , while ella shae weighs 5 pounds , according to 6 abc , and were born at 36 weeks
' it 's just an awesome blessing for god to entrust us with three more little blessings all at once , ' ashley told the indiana network
but mrs alexander thinks she has the answer - nail polish
alexander ( left ) and hubsand matt , indiana , were surprised weeks ago when they learned they were expecting three new additions to their family during a routine sonogram ' is this a joke ? ' : mr matt alexander asked the technician to double check when she told the couple they were expecting triplets while triplets have become more common with the rise of methods such as in vitro fertilization , having an identical trio naturally , where one egg is fertilized and splits into three separate embyros , is rare
one in a million is commonly reported as the odds of having natural identical triplets , though estimates range from one in 60,000 to one in 200million
mr matt alexander works as a supervisor at a church - building company , and the couple hope to be able to continue working while splitting time caring for the sophia mae , alexis kae and ella shae along with their two - year - old son , stefan
the alexanders expect their new children in the coming weeks and may try to keep track of their girls by giving them different nail polish colors after first finding out about the triplets in september , mrs alexander has been preparing to give birth for the past several months
however doctors have said that sophia mae , alexis kae and ella shae appear to be developing healthily .
