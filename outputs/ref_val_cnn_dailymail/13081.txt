ferguson , missouri loistine hoskin cared for her old car as a sentimental possession , missing a tire while parked beside her home , until one day the city ticketed her for having a " derelict vehicle in driveway
so began an odyssey with ferguson police , municipal court and city hall that left her with $ 1,200 in fines that to this day she still does n't fully understand
it 's me going up against the city of ferguson when the attorneys wo n't help , " loistine hoskin said this week
while loistine hoskin 's surrender of both car and $ 1,200 to the city may seem a matter of personal choice , the justice department revealed this week a " pattern and practice " of racial discrimination within ferguson that may lend credibility to loistine hoskin 's account of a government run amok
just about every branch of ferguson government -- police , municipal court , city hall -- participated in " unlawful " targeting of african-american residents such as loistine hoskin for tickets and fines , the justice department concluded this week
to the outside world , the federal findings were staggering , but to loistine hoskin and other longtime residents , the conclusion was nothing new
the justice department is expected to pursue a court - supervised consent decree that requires the city of ferguson to make changes to its police and courts
" it 's definitely a vicious cycle , " said loistine hoskin , 64 , a retired airline reservation agent
" loistine hoskin 's household has experienced its share of ugly encounters with ferguson police , the family said
loistine hoskin 's daughter was ticketed by police in what she described as racial profiling , she said
in 2007 , kimberly hoskin got a $ 124 ticket for driving her sister 's car , which was n't insured in missouri , and then had to pay an additional $ 100 fine when she missed a court appearance because of an emergency appendectomy
she paid a total of $ 224 in fines because she was in the middle of a job search and did n't want an outstanding warrant to prevent her from getting a good job
in ferguson , the police do what they want to do
ferguson does what it wants , " said kimberly hoskin , 35 , who now works the overnight shift on a general motors manufacturing line
city officials and police declined to respond to cnn 's requests this week for comment about the loistine hoskin family 's assertions
the city also no longer has a specific offense for failing to appear in court , which eliminates certain additional fees and court costs , the mayor said
the justice department 's report details how ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration to city council -- to raise revenue for the city budget through increased ticketing and fining
ferguson 's budget increases were so sizable that city officials exhorted police and court staff to levy more and more fines and tickets against violators , who turned out to be largely african-american , the justice department said
ferguson police chief mum on federal report indeed , ferguson enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that ferguson , population 21,000 , was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in st. louis county by having more than $ 1 million in revenue in 2010 , the report said
when ferguson court revenues exceeded $ 2 million in 2012 , the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email : " awesome ! thanks ! " according to the federal report
by 2015 , the city anticipated that fines and fees would account for 23 % of the budget , or $ 3.09 million of $ 13.26 million in general fund expenses , the justice department found
for example , area parking fines ranged from $ 5 to $ 100 , but ferguson 's parking fine was $ 102
a fine for " weeds / tall grass " was $ 5 in one nearby city , but ferguson 's fine ranged from $ 77 to $ 102 , the justice department found
after the justice department 's announcement this week , ferguson mayor knowles told reporters that he , police chief tom jackson and city attorney stephanie karr met with federal officials about their findings and initiated several initiatives , including reforms to the municipal court
all the reforms are intended to " move this city , its residents and our entire community forward , " the mayor said
back at her home , loistine hoskin recalled the height of absurdity in her fight against the city , which occurred shortly after her husband , calvin , died in 2008 of complications from paralysis he suffered in a car accident three years earlier
" we just got to a point where we said we 're just not going to have anyone over -- because they were fearful when they left they would get some ticket , and they did n't even live here , " loistine hoskin said
