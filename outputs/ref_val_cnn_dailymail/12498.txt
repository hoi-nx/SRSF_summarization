pleading innocence , immunity and ignorance , the city of cleveland responded to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by tamir 's family by saying the 12 - year - old 's death was his own fault
in november , cleveland officer loehmann fired the fatal shots at tamir within two seconds of arriving outside a recreation center where the sixth - grader was playing with a pellet gun
in the 41 - page response to the family 's lawsuit filed friday , the city says that tamir 's injuries " were directly and proximately caused by the failure of plaintiffs ' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury
cleveland authorities have repeatedly said that loehmann mistook tamir 's fake gun for a real one
a witness called 911 on november 22 to say there was " a guy with a pistol " and that although the weapon was " probably " fake , tamir was scaring people
within two seconds of exiting the police car , loehmann shoots the 12 - year - old
" in the video , neither loehmann nor garmback appears to provide medical assistance to the boy , and police chief calvin williams has said that tamir did not receive first aid until an fbi agent arrived on the scene four minutes later
an attorney for the tamir family says the city 's response to the lawsuit is indicative of well - documented problems within the cleveland police department
" the tamir family maintains that tamir was shot and killed unnecessarily by cleveland police officers , " tamir family co-counsel walter madison said in a statement
crump went on to attack the police department 's assertion , put forth in december , that loehmann gave tamir three verbal commands to put his hands up
" it is just incredible that the police officer , based on what we see on the video surveillance recording , gave tamir three verbal commands to put his hands up and drop the weapon , based on what we see in the video
in december , the u.s. justice department released the results of a two - year investigation that found cleveland officers use guns , tasers , pepper spray and their fists excessively , unnecessarily or in retaliation
it was also reported in december that loehmann 's previous employer , the independence police department in a cleveland suburb , had numerous complaints about the officer , including that he was " distracted and weepy " and " emotionally immature " and had demonstrated " a pattern of lack of maturity , indiscretion and not following instructions
in tamir 's case , he said , " several things were done inappropriately , " which is probable cause to charge the officers
