a predator armed with six long claws prowled the seas more than 500 million years ago and was among the ancestors of modern insects , spiders and lobsters , scientists have found
the lobster - like yawunik kootenayi had four eyes and long whip - like antennae that extended from the tips of its claws
the lobster - like creature had four eyes and long whip - like antennae that extended from the tips of its claws a fossil of the strange looking creature was discovered in marble canyon at the north end of kootenay in the canadian rockies
palaeontologists say the species was probably one of the first predatory arthropods to roam the planet - a group that later evolved into spiders , lobsters and insects
aria , a evolutionary biologist at the university of toronto who was part of the team that discovered the species , said : ' this creature is expanding our perspective on the anatomy and predatory habits of the first arthropods , the group to which spiders and lobsters belong
it has long frontal appendages that resemble the antennae of modern beetles or shrimp , but in yawunik these were actually each comprised of three long claws
the fossil of yawunik ( above ) was discovered in marble canyon at the north end of kootenay in the canadian rockies
two of the claws on each appendage were also studded with opposing rows of teeth on the end of each claw were long flagella that the scientists believe helped the creature sense the environment around it
when attacking its prey , yawunik kootenayi probably spread its claws out in front of it and then retracted them under its body when swimming , say the researchers
the fossil was discovered in marble canyon in north end of kootenay in the canadian rockies mr aria said : ' unlike insects or crustaceans , yawunik kootenayi did not possess additional appendages in the head that were specifically modified to process food
yawunik kootenayi was named in tribute to the ktunaxa who have long inhabited the kootenay area around marble canyon
yawunik kootenayi was named in tribute to the ktunaxa who have long inhabited the kootenay area around marble canyon
the new species yawunik kootenayi is thought to have folded its long front claws under its body when it was swimming
yawunik kootenayi was named in tribute to the ktunaxa who have long inhabited the kootenay area around marble canyon
it was a fierce mythological marine creature according to ktunaxa legends professor jean-bernard caron , who led the study at the university of toronto , said : ' yawunik kootenayi is the most abundant of the large new species of the marble canyon site , and so , as a predator , it held a key position in the food network and had an important impact on this past ecosystem
