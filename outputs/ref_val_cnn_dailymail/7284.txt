at this year âs mobile world congress in barcelona , chip maker qualcomm is showcasing a maserati kitted out with optical and ultrasonic sensors , touchscreen displays and rear - view cameras
the maserati ( pictured ) is on display at this year âs mobile world congress in barcelona and uses qualcomm technology to power its sensors , camera and on - board modems
it has 4g technology built in , so does n't need a phone to get online , and this means it can double up as a wi-fi hotspot for all passengers like with apple âs carplay and google âs android auto , the maserati concept has a display that can be used with voice control , touch and hand gestures
the maserati ( pictured ) is a concept but qualcomm âs vice president for product management duggal said it showcases the potential for connected cars and believes these kinds of systems will be in cars soon the concept has a display that can be used with voice control , touch and hand gestures
the system syncs with phones using screen mirroring technology called mirrorlink ( right ) but also comes with its own mobile network the maserati is also kitted out cameras that provide an almost 360 - degree view of the car and warn of impending collisions , obstacles and more
the rear - view camera can additionally be used for parking assist features ( pictured )
the app was announced at mobile world congress in barcelona and currently works with a selection of ford âs electric and hybrid cars
the sensor and camera setup provides an almost 360 - degree view of the car and warns of impending collisions , obstacles and more
details about fuel , speed and any technical faults are updated in real - time , including an 8 - inch image from the rear - view parking assist camera to show the road behind
these include a light detection and ranging ( lidar ) sensor that shows a forward - facing collision warnings up to 164ft ( 50 metres )
a set of ultrasonic and optical sensors near each wing mirror spot pedestrians , cyclists , and obstacles in the blind spots , helping the driver make safer lane changes and turns
a set of ultrasonic and optical sensors near each wing mirror ( pictured ) spot pedestrians , cyclists , and obstacles in the blind spots , helping the driver make safer lane changes and turns a â digital instrument cluster â - or screen behind the wheel - shows the driver information from all the car âs systems at a glance plus navigation details ( pictured )
these details are updated in real - time and advanced map data plots the road ahead - even if it is beyond the view of the driver the mirrors show real - time video footage to offer a wide field of view , plus a warning bar that goes from green ( shown ) to red when an obstacle approaches and the mirrors themselves show real - time video footage offering a wider field of view than traditional mirrors
meanwhile , the rear - view camera , with ultrasonic proximity sensors , provides an unobstructed view of what âs coming up from behind
a similar system is used on the wing mirrors to warn of nearby obstacles
