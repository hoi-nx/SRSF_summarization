in 1796 , in his final annual address to congress , president george washington called for the creation of : " ... a national university ; and also a military academy
the desirableness of both these institutions , has so constantly increased with every new view i have taken of the subject , that i can not omit the opportunity of once for all , recalling your attention to them
" the military academy was soon built at west point
but despite leaving $ 22,222 for its establishment ( a lot of money back then ) in his last will and testament , washington 's national university never came to pass
instead , lawmakers chose to rely on state governments and religious denominations to build and finance new colleges and universities
today , the u.s. higher education system is in crisis
the price of college has grown astronomically , forcing students and parents to take out loans that now exceed $ 1.2 trillion in outstanding debt
many of those loans are falling into default as graduates struggle to find work
the latest research suggests that our vaunted universities are producing graduates who have n't learned very much
the time has come to revive george washington 's great idea , in 21st century form
advances in information technology that would have seemed like pure magic in colonial times mean we can now create a 21st century national university that will help millions of students get a high - quality , low - cost college education â without hiring any professors , building any buildings or costing the taxpayers a dime
to see how , it helps to understand the three ways the federal government currently supports higher education
first , the defense department , national institutes of health , and other federal agencies spend hundreds of billions of dollars financing university - based research , contributing to countless scientific breakthroughs and commercial innovations
it does this through a little - understood process called accreditation
but in order to make a college eligible for federal money , accreditors must first be approved by the federal government
without that approval and the money that goes along with it , both colleges and accreditors would immediately close up shop
so , here 's the big idea : in order to build a 21st century national university , all the federal government has to do is something very simple : approve itself
in george washington 's days , this would have been only the first step of a process subsequently involving the construction of an actual university
doing this today would accomplish little in solving the higher education crisis , because physical universities cost billions of dollars to construct from scratch and can still only enroll a handful of the many students who ca n't afford a good education
nonelite universities do n't want to give away something they 're currently selling for a lot of money
for example , this week , edx is launching a free , nine - week - long online course called " introduction to computational thinking and data science
those that are n't already accredited would pay a fee to cover the cost of evaluation
since national u. will likely be much cheaper , this will actually save the taxpayers money in the long run
