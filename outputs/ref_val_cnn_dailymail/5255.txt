the weekly shop has become something of a modern day nightmare with stores asking us to either scan as we shop or use self - service tills
morrisons 's new ceo , david potts , who took over last week has scrapped the intelligent queue management ( iqm ) system used in shops after receiving feedback from customers and staff
morrisons has ditched its intelligent queue management system in favour of returning to using humans to decide how many checkouts to open in stores the technology , which was introduced in 2008 , used infrared sensors to determine how many checkouts to open by monitoring the number of customer flowing through the store
the company 's retail team , along with the new boss , concluded that checkout teams would make better and more balanced decisions compared to the iqm computer system
but while they have brought humans back to monitor queues , the controversial self - scan tills will be here to stay
ex-tesco executive mr david potts , who took over as morrisons â chief executive on march 16 , spoke with customers and staff and after feedback decided to scrap some of the modern day technologies morrisons was the only british retailer to use iqm , which used infrared sensors both at the entrance to the store and over each checkout lanes
when the iqm system was first rolled out as part of a trial with the promise of cutting customer waiting times it had a five per cent success rate , however , staff claimed the system was pointless
the ' scan rate ' was introduced in 2012 after imposing new time targets of one item every three seconds , which prompted an outcry from members of the public , who branded the supermarket as turning into a ' battery hen farm '
