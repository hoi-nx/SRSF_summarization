secretary of state kerry spent five minutes of a senate hearing excoriating a group of 47 republicans who sent a highly unusual letter to the government of iran warning that congress could modify the terms of any nuclear deal it negotiates with the white house
' kerry later staked out a position that lawmakers have no standing to change any nuclear agreement between the us and iran because it wo n't be ' legally binding ' in the first place
' kerry , us 's top diplomat and the obama administration 's senior tehran negotiator , said he reacted with ' utter disbelief ' to the letter , which also warned iran 's leaders that an accord with president obama 's team could expire the day he leaves office
the letter itself is an unprecedented intervention by congress into negotiations with a foreign power , kerry suggested
' ' when it says that congress could actually modify the terms of an agreement at any time is flat wrong , ' said kerry , who once chaired the committ he addressed on wednedsay
they want to destroy isil , ' kerry said during an exchange with florida marco rubio sen. marco rubio
' kerry claimed the us has ' the capacity ' to ' knock out isil ' on its own , but ' we 're not going to get suckered into that
' ' the enduring transformation that has to take place here is not going to take place if the us just comes in and were to knock out isil and that âs it â go away , ' he said , adding that it 's ' not gon na happen
it warned that ' the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time
' as kerry 's turn on the hot seat began , protesters from the liberal anti-war group code pink interrupted â as they have done in other recent hearings
like arizona sen. john mccain , who last month called them ' low - life scum ' as they were led out of a hearing room , kerry fired back at a woman who shouted repeatedly that ' the us is killing innocent civilians with drones ! ' ' killing more innocent people ? ' he asked aloud
' enemy of my enemy : florida sen. marco rubio heard kerry say that iran is helpful in fighting the isil terror army the secretary of state will meet iran 's foreign minister , zarif , next week in switzerland for another round of talks
he said cotton 's letter ' erroneously asserts that this is a legally binding plan
' ' number two , it 's incorrect when it says that congress could actually modify the terms of an agreement at any time
' neither the us nor iran has emphasized the need for a legally binding deal because each has stronger forms of leverage
the us has also held out the prospect of military action if iran makes progress toward a nuclear weapon
similarly , if the us does n't live up to its side of the bargain , the iran can ramp up enrichment levels of uranium , taking them closer to nuclear weapons capacity
congress , too , wields a threat : new forms of economic punishment of iran that would be forbidden in the agreement
negotiators from the us , britain , china , france , germany and russian hope to seal a framework with iran by month 's end and a comprehensive agreement by july
kerry scoffed at the notion that obama 's successor would discard a deal reached between so many powerful governments and adhered to by iran
' ready to make history : kerry shook hands with new defense secretary ash carter ( left ) as protesters anticipated the start of wednesday 's hearing questions about the process involved in any agreement with shiite - majority iran are sensitive for a variety of reasons
' this framework was not legally binding and was not subject to congressional approval , ' psaki told reporters during a daily press briefing
' zarif is the only one who has gone on record saying such a model would be followed with a nuclear deal
making such a declaration would amount to telling congress that it wo n't have a say on the accord , because it is not a treaty , but that the united nations will .
