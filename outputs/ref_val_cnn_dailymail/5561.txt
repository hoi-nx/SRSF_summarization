so , given their obsession with all things kardashian , we decided on california this year - a classic america road trip along the pacific coast highway ( aka route ) from san francisco to los angeles
san francisco is known as america 's most europe city , you 'll need to pack a fleece even in late july so here we go ... san francisco is known as america 's most europe city , possibly because you 'll need to pack a fleece even in late july
the mist that rolls in off the sea and shrouds the golden gate bridge most days can sometimes linger , but we never stayed still long enough to get cold
based in the funky hotel zetta - where the foyer combines games room and bar , and is plastered with colossal photos of john lennon and past guests of alcatraz - we spent three days hurtling around the city , often clinging for dear life to the famous cable cars that haul you up and down the city of angels 's equally famous hills
jane travelled to america with her teenage children , molly , 15 and dylan who 's 17 and , fleeces on , we took the boat trip to alcatraz , which is not to be missed
it 's an eerie and compelling tour
after trying to distil the city into only 72 hours , we climbed into our suv and headed for route
it 's only about 350 miles as the crow flies between san francisco and los angeles , but this ( mostly ) coastal route is probably well over 500 miles long as it winds through some of california 's most wonderful , ever - changing scenery
much of the highway has a 55mph speed limit and has only one lane in each direction - it 's time to take your foot off the gas , relax and take it all in
the kids said it reminded them of dorset as we headed south past santa cruz and then nipped briefly into monterey to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of cannery row , the waterfront district made famous in john steinbeck 's novel of the same name
at dylan 's insistence , we took a detour on to 17 mile drive , the scenic road around the monterey peninsula that leads to the world - famous pebble beach golf club
when the sound of silence got too much for us , just across the street at valley hills there was the excellent and lively baja cantina mexican restaurant , and a wonderful deli too
leaving carmel , you find yourself at the edge of the spectacular area known as big sur : wild and often mountainous terrain battling it out with the equally wild pacific coast highway
the road coils up and down cliffs and crosses cavernous gorges for almost 100 miles - incredibly dramatic but sometimes not for the faint - hearted
the family nipped briefly into monterey to dine in a seafront restaurant on the edge of cannery row , the waterfront district made famous in john steinbeck 's novel of the same name we took a rare detour off route to the danish settlement of solvang , a sort of cutesy yet sinister re-creation of denmark in the california sun , full of pastry shops and chinese tourists
it 's the classic california of posters and t - shirts , with infinitely long palm - lined streets with mountains at one end and the ocean at the other
there are gold courses galore just outside the pretty little town of carmel having soaked up a bit of the golden age of hollywood , we headed off on route again to see the city of angels of today
mind you , the scariest ride of the day was getting on the freeway by accident on the way into los angeles
stop off for an guided tour taking in the chinese theatre , walk of fame , rodeo drive , sunset strip and other spots of note in los angeles unless you 're a professional stunt driver in a hurry , the freeway is probably best avoided in favour of a trundle along the city 's more sedate boulevards
we drove the last 40 miles south through the los angeles suburbs to our final stop at the huntington beach hyatt regency
