we are constantly being nagged to floss , with dental experts claiming it can add years to our life
but according to one dentist , most of us have been doing it incorrectly for years
dr carlos meulener , a dentist from new jersey , has released a video showing the best way to floss teeth in order to have the healthiest smile
dr calos meulener has released a video showing his ' one minute flossing technique ' which he says helps rid the mouth of bacteria
he is pictured holding floss between two thumbs , about an inch apart he advises taking a piece of wax dental floss and winding it up with the index fingers , but not so tightly that it hurts
dr carlos meulener said : â the reason why most people have a problem flossing is that they try to get too much floss in their mouths
repeat using the middle fingers for the bottom teeth â we âre flossing the walls of one tooth and the other tooth and polishing the bacteria off those surfaces , â dr carlos meulener said
one thumb should stay stationary while the other thumb is moved up and down , creating the flossing motion
dr carlos meulener says this method , which takes just a minute , is the best and most efficient way to floss
he advises using two thumbs for the upper teeth , or two middle fingers for the lower teeth , and flossing in an ' up and down ' motion rather than ' sawing ' from side to side in the uk , the the adult dental health survey of 2009 found 47 per cent of the population had moderate to severe gum disease - around 30 million people
they found poor dental hygiene and bleeding gums could allow up to 700 different types of bacteria to get into the bloodstream , which increases the risk of a heart attack regardless of how fit and healthy the person is
