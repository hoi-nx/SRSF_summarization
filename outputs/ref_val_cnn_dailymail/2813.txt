after feasting on too many fermented crabapples , a drunk squirrel has been filmed struggling to escape a snowy american backyard
misery : the squirrel 's problems begin when it falls from a tall tree into a snowy back garden in american fall : at first , the cameraman thinks the animal is hut but soon realises the small rodent is simply drunk daunting : the drunk squirrel eyes up the challenge ahead - a small mound of snow between him and an open fence his next great challenge is the small mound of snow between him and the open fence in an american backyard - a simple task made very difficult by his inebriated state
the shaky footage has gone viral since being uploaded to live leak and youtube where it has already gained tens of thousands of hits
persistent : the little animal continuously charges at the small mound of snow but always ends up flat on his back escape : finally , after minutes of continuous jumping - much of it on the spot - it reaches the fence it could simply have walked around freedom : with a similar lack of grace , the squirrel darts through the fence and up a slightly easier hill
