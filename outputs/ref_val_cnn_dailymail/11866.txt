allies of osborne last night denied he has given up hope of succeeding david cameron â just as the chancellor launched a new charm offensive
just ten days before he is due to unveil a multi-billion - pound giveaway budget which could decide the result of the election , mr osborne is working hard to boost his image
he took part in a magazine interview with the financial times which included â man of the people â images of him building a dry stone wall
claim : mr osborne said he was urged to run against mr david cameron by michael howard , whose resignation as tory leader triggered the contest apparently , â the drama and intrigue on the stage and people being assassinated â convinced him it was an â omen â
