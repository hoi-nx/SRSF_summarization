mourinho insists arsenal can mount a late charge to win the premier league title , however statistics from the last 10 years show chelsea tend to finish the season off in fine form
chelsea look set to win the 2014 - 15 premier league title as the blues tend to finish the season off in fine form chelsea dropped two points against southampton at the weekend but are still odds - on favourites to win the title mourinho insists arsenal have joined chelsea and man city in the premier league title race 2013 - 14 : 11 points dropped 12 - 13 : 7 11 - 12 : 15 10 - 11 : 10 09 - 10 : 5 08 - 09 : 6 07 - 08 : 10 06 - 07 : 11 05 - 06 : 6 average : 8.6 points dropped chelsea are seven points clear of man city with a game in hand of both their title rivals arsenal are even further behind as they are currently seven points behind premier league leaders chelsea , having played a game less than the gunners
' chelsea would finish the season off with over 85 points ( 85.4 to be exact ) if history is to repeat itself - based on the average number of points they have dropped in their last 10 games of the season
the maximum amount of points man city can ascertain is 85 and that would mean manuel pellegrini 's side defeating the likes of man united , tottenham and southampton
so it appears mourinho 's statement on arsenal 's title credentials may have just been a ploy to ease the pressure on his players following their draw against southampton
