farage was likened to nazi propagandist goebbels last night as he was forced to backtrack over a call to scrap most of british âs race relations laws
the ukip leader prompted a storm of controversy by suggesting he wanted to reverse legislation dating back to the 1960s which bars discrimination at work on the grounds of race or colour
david cameron said mr farage appeared â desperate for attention â , while ed miliband said the comments were â wrong , divisive and dangerous â
iraqi - born conservative mp for stratford - on - avon nadhim zahawi , a member of the no 10 policy board , told lbc radio : â the remark i found most difficult , and certainly hurt by , [ is when ] he talks about employers being able to discriminate in favour of british - born citizens
â i was nât born in british , but i feel equally british to farage or anyone else
these remarks make me feel very frightened that a man like farage , who aspires to lead the country , who says that he âs leading a serious party , actually takes the attitude that if you are not british - born , you âre not equal
' it âs a remark goebbels would be proud of
â last night the ukip leader claimed his remarks had been misinterpreted and that he did not want to scrap anti- discrimination legislation
iraqi - born conservative mp for stratford - on - avon nadhim zahawi compared the ukip leader to goebbels while david cameron said he was ' desperate for attention ' â people do see a fifth column living within our country , who hate us and want to kill us , â he said
mr farage then suggested that race and other anti-discrimination laws could be abolished on the grounds that people were now â colour blind â
pressed on which legislation he would get rid of , the ukip leader said : â much of it
â asked whether there would be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour if ukip were ever in power , mr farage added : â no â¦ because we take the view , we are colour blind
i think the situation that we now have , where an employer is not allowed to choose between a british - born person and somebody from poland , is a ludicrous state of affairs
â i would argue that the law does need changing , and that if an employer wishes to choose , or you can use the word â discriminate â if you want to , but wishes to choose to employ a british - born person , they should be allowed to do so
â challenged later about his remarks , the ukip leader appeared to reverse his position , insisting : â i did nât mention race at all
