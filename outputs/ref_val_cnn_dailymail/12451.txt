the two gunmen who took the prosecutor hostage were killed in a shootout with police after a standoff that lasted for hours
mehmet selim kiraz was assigned to the controversial case of berkin elvan , a 15 - year - old boy who was injured during the anti-government gezi park protests in june 2013
the case , with its overtones of possible police overreaction , has been politically contentious , just as the protests themselves were
in an online post widely cited in turkish media , the left - wing revolutionary people 's liberation party-front claimed responsibility for the attack
istanbul police chief selami altinok said mehmet selim kiraz had been shot before turkish security teams entered the room where the hostage crisis was unfolding
the revolutionary people 's liberation party-front , known as the revolutionary people 's liberation party-front , is viscerally hostile to the turkish state , the united states and nato , and has had links with the far left in europe
