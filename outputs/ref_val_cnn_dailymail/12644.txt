new york when prosecuting attorneys began their closing arguments in the terrorism trial of an accused al-qaeda operative on monday morning , they spoke of blood
" naseer was going to place a car bomb in a crowded ... shopping center and watch people die
" naseer , 28 , is accused of communicating with al-qaeda and conspiring to attack the arndale shopping center in manchester , england , in april 2009
naseer has maintained throughout the two - week trial that he is innocent , repeatedly denying all charges and insisting that he was in the british to find a wife , not to plan an attack
the case is now in the hands of the jury , who began deliberations tuesday
" naseer is charged with three criminal violations : providing material support to al-qaeda , conspiring to provide material support for al-qaeda , and conspiring to use a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence
prosecutors accuse naseer of using email addresses with female names to communicate with al-qaeda in planning the bomb attack
naseer , a pakistan national , was in the british on a student visa at the time of his arrest
prosecuting attorneys pointed to the fact that naseer had dropped out of classes after only a week as further evidence of his guilt
naseer had no intention of completing his studies because " that was never the plan , " ahmad said , arguing that naseer applied for a student visa as a means of entering the country to carry out the attack
the new york plot originated with a man named zazi , who is believed to have corresponded with the same al-qaeda contact as naseer
zazi pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and was the first witness in naseer 's trial
naseer 's 2009 arrest in england was part of a massive sweep in connection with an alleged plot to carry out bomb attacks in british
prosecutors also accuse naseer of using " coded language " in his emails to update al-qaeda on his progress
the dates mentioned in the email , they argue , were not referring to a marriage , but rather naseer signaling to al-qaeda when to expect the attack to happen
he told jury members that prosecutors were only able to produce circumstantial evidence , with no witnesses offering direct information of naseer 's role in the alleged plot
" did anyone come forward , take the stand , and say naseer is the one responsible ? " naseer asked the jury
naseer argued that he dropped out of school because the courses , taught in england , were too difficult for him
a 2008 trip to pakistan , during which prosecutors allege naseer received al-qaeda training , was really a trip to visit his ailing mother , naseer said
naseer spent the majority of his closing argument reading from transcripts from earlier testimony , highlighting pertinent quotes he felt supported his cause
surveillance officers who observed naseer for several weeks prior to his arrest also testified
