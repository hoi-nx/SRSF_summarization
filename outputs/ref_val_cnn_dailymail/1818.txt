an undercover investigation in chinese has revealed the disgusting conditions in which a wildly popular snack known as ' spicy sticks ' are made
the snacks are popular among chinese people living abroad , with thousands of people ordering them via online marketplaces such as amazon - and there was even an online campaign recently to promote the red sticks among westerners
but many consumers have reported suffering from severe sickness and diarrhoea after eating them , and one three - year - old girl was reportedly left with festering sores around her mouth after gorging on the snack
people 's daily online reported that , during secret , filming at one of the many firms which produce the snack , investigators found one worker handling food with a finger that had blistered through exposure to the chemicals used in the process - without wearing protective gloves
at the factory in tongxu county , henan province , an undercover reporter saw workers visit dirty lavatories and return to work without washing their hands - again without wearing gloves or face masks when handling food
this three - year - old girl allegedly developed sores and ulcers after eating too many of the snacks roaring trade : they are popular on online sites such as amazon
( there is no suggestion the product pictured here was manufactured at the plant in the undercover filming ) the finished product was also packed with bare hands , with workers ' hands stained by the red oil that coats the food - leading at least one woman to suffer sores on her finger
stomach - turning : many consumers have reported suffering from diarrhoea after eating spicy sticks stench : the undercover reporter said a vile smell came from vats holding chemicals like the one above campiagn : chinese fans of the snack have been encouraging westerners to try it and posting their comments online many consumers who have bought the snack online have also left comments reporting similar symptoms
chinese fans of the snack had recently started an online campaign to make it popular with westerners
if you are talking about washing hands , changing clothes before going to the toilet ... then the workers will find this very constricting and it will be difficult to recruit for this work
