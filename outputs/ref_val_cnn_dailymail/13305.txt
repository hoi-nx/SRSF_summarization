for decades , no one has been able to convict millionaire durst
not after his wife 's disappearance
not even after he admitted he killed and dismembered his neighbor
but it may be durst who does himself in with 11 words he muttered in a restroom : " what the hell did i do ? killed them all , of course
" those comments were picked up on a microphone he was wearing for the hbo documentary series about him called " the jinx
" apparently , the real estate heir did n't turn his microphone off when he went to the bathroom
durst now sits in a new orleans jail after his arrest saturday in connection with the 2000 death of his longtime friend berman in los angeles
on monday , california prosecutors said durst was " lying in wait " when he shot and killed berman because she " was a witness to a crime
" she had been shot in the head shortly before investigators were supposed to come ask her about the disappearance of durst 's first wife in 1982
durst will be transferred to los angeles to face a first - degree murder charge
when he goes to trial , could those 11 words be admitted in court ? here , several legal experts weigh in : yes : his lawyer could argue that he absolutely did
" here 's what his attorneys are going to say : they are going to say that he had an expectation of privacy , " hln legal analyst jackson said
" furthermore , toobin said , durst had a microphone on
susan criss was the judge during durst 's 2003 murder trial in which he admitted to shooting an elderly neighbor and then dismembering him
" in this case , durst is the declarant who spoke those words , and if they 're used against him , they could be fair game
already , one of durst 's attorneys has said not to read too much into his client 's offhand remarks
" no : the prosecution could argue durst knew what was going on
and so he realized ... he had a mic on , " said criss , the judge from durst 's earlier trial
