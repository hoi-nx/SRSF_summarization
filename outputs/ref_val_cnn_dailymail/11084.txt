great players with baggage like yaya toure are always worth the aggro when they are on top of their game
after the embarrassing mis - match in the nou camp when barcelona could have scored at least six against man city , you feel that time is rapidly running out for yaya toure and others like vincent kompany and edin dzeko
midfielder yaya toure struggled to impress as man city crashed out of the champions league to barcelona city were happy to put up with the baggage that came with yaya toure ( right ) while he was performing at his best man city captain and defender vincent kompany ( right ) contests for the ball alongside barcelona 's luis suarez defender pablo zabaleta has been left out of man city 's team for their biggest games this season yaya toure became the premier league 's best - paid player when he signed for roberto mancini from barcelona in 2010
in domestic football , he has been an unqualified success and scored 24 goals last season as man city won their second championship
his world - class strike against sunderland at wembley won pellegrini the capital one cup
premier league managers felt the midfielder did n't do enough of the hard yards to protect man city defensively but they were unable to capitalise much because when yaya toure had the ball he was an unstoppable force of nature
but those days have gone and the 31 - year - old 's hapless showing against barcelona as man city crashed out of the champions league underlined he is not the man to push the club forward any more
striker edin dzeko could be considered as dispensable by man city in the summer if they have an overhaul joe hart ( right ) was in inspired form during man city 's 1 - 0 defeat to barcelona on wednesday striker aguero ( left ) missed a penalty as man city were eliminated 3 - 1 on aggregate by barcelona city defender martin demichelis ( left ) challenges messi of barcelona for possession of the ball man city 's failure to reach europe 's last eight under their abu dhabi owners will create a major rethink at the club this summer
at 30 years old , pablo zabaleta is still able to cope with run - of - the - mill league games but it 's interesting he has been left out of the really big matches like chelsea away and barcelona away
edin dzeko is n't going to get any better , neither is martin demichelis or aleksandar kolarov
if they stay at man city , they will only be squad players and in the case of edin dzeko in particular his wages are astronomical compared with strikers at other clubs
