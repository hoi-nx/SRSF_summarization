the discovery raises the prospect of giving people drugs in the very earliest stages , when it is easiest to treat , and even stopping the disease in its tracks the telltale signs of alzheimer âs can be seen in people as young as 20 , research shows
the â unprecedented â finding suggests that the disease starts to eat away at the brain half a century before symptoms develop
crucially , it is nât known how many people who have the early signs of alzheimer âs in their brains in their 20s will go on to develop the disease
researchers , from northwestern university in chicago , examined the brains of elderly people with and without alzheimer âs , as well as samples taken from 13 people aged between 20 and 66
tests showed that beta - amyloid , the toxic protein that clogs up the brain in alzheimer âs , had started building up in people as young as 20
it had been thought that the damage to the brain started just 15 or 20 years before the disease takes hold
â the amyloid clumps were found inside neurons , or brain cells , that are involved in memory and attention and are among the first to die in normal ageing , as well as in alzheimer âs
but doctors called for more research to be carried out with not everyone who showed signs of alzheimer 's developing the disease even delaying the onset of alzheimer âs would have a massive impact on the lives of sufferers and their loved ones
dr james pickett , the charity âs head of research said the study was very small and that it is already known that not everyone with amyloid clumps will develop alzheimer âs
â dr laura phipps of alzheimer âs research uk , said : â with half a million people living with alzheimer âs in the uk and that number on the increase , we urgently need new treatments to stop the disease in its tracks
