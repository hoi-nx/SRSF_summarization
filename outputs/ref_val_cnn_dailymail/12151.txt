saudis is leading a military campaign against shiite rebels in yemen , bringing the wider region directly into a complex conflict that has festered for months
the saudis say they want to restore the yemen government , a key u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda , which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year
" having yemen fail can not be option for us or for our coalition partners , " said adel al-jubeir , the saudis ambassador to the u.s. , referring to the other nations in the region supporting the campaign
here are answers to key questions about the escalating conflict in yemen
analysts say it can be summed up in one word : iran
the saudis " perceive this as a threat from the iran , " said cnn military analyst lt. col. francona
" they look at the shiite houthis as nothing more than a proxy iran force , just like we can look at hezbollah as a proxy iran force in southern lebanon
" analysts say that shiite - majority iran and sunni - dominated saudis are locked in a strategic contest for influence across the middle east
now , the epic chess match has spread into yemen , saudis 's southern neighbor
" what they do not want is an iran - run state on their southern border , because they already feel they 've got enough problems on their northern border , " said francona , a retired u.s. air force intelligence officer
iran , northeast of saudis , is considered to exercise powerful influence within the regime of president bashar al-assad in war - torn syria and within the shiite - led iraq government
the saudis and other gulf nations appeared to make an implicit reference to iran in a statement about the start of the military campaign , describing the houthi militias as " backed by regional powers " that are aiming for " hegemony " in yemen
the iran government , for its part , condemned the offensive , calling for an immediate halt to saudis - led airstrikes , state media reported
the chaos in yemen appeared to be careering toward a full - blown civil war
the shiite houthis , whose power base is in northern yemen , started protests against the central government in the capital , sanaa , last summer
since then , hadi 's supporters have repeatedly clashed with the shiite houthis and their allies , prompting the united nations to warn of an impending civil war
the u.s. recently withdrew its remaining special forces in yemen , dealing a blow to counterterrorism efforts in the country
saudis has also pledged 150,000 soldiers to the coalition that 's intervening in yemen , the saudis - owned al-arabiya tv network reported thursday , raising the possibility of a ground offensive
" saudis , all these years , has avoided sending troops into yemen
the aim is to bring back yemen 's " security and stability through establishing a political process , " said a statement from saudis , the uae , bahrain , qatar and kuwait
houthi forces have clashed with aqap and its allies in central yemen
aqap and isis looked set to be " the big winners " from the deepening chaos in yemen , cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank said wednesday before news of the saudis airstrikes emerged
