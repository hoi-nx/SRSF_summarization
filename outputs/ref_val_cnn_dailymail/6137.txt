they may light our paths at night , but streetlamps and other sources of artificial light at night time affect the growth and flowering of plants as well as the number of insects , according to a new study
researchers have shown that light pollution can impact the natural environment in complex ways that may be hard to predict

this image shows the two different types of light treatment used - â white ' light similar to newer commercial led street lighting systems and an ' amber ' light simulating a type of sodium street lamp researchers from the university of exeter simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing a community of invertebrates at night
they exposed them to two different types of light treatment - a â white ' light similar to newer commercial led street lighting systems and an ' amber ' light simulating the type of sodium street lamp still found in much of the britain and further afield
the experiments investigated the effects of the lighting on the population density of a species of pea aphid
the low intensity amber light was shown to prevent flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird 's foot trefoil , which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges , especially in mid-summer
the study showed that low intensity amber light caused by street lighting in cities ( a stock image of london at dusk is shown ) prevented flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird 's foot trefoil , which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges , especially in mid summer bright lights in europe âs cities may be causing urban blackbirds to reach sexual maturity quicker their country cousins
animal biologists from glasgow university and the max planck institute for orntihology in seewiesen , near munich , fitted tiny light loggers to the backs of 100 blackbirds in the city of munich and in a nearby forest
the light loggers tracked the amount of light birds in both environments were exposed to each day and sent the data to experts
they found that the additional light from artificial sources caused the city birds to perceive the days to be longer by 49 minutes on average
as a result , the birds in early march experienced the day length that their country counterparts experienced in late march , according to the study published in journal philosophical transactions of the royal society b the city birds â perception that they were living at a later point in the year caused them to reach sexual maturity in anticipation of breeding season 19 days earlier than the forest birds
study leader dr davide dominoni of the university , said : â artificial light at night is one of the most obvious environmental changes affecting the habitat of wild animals
â the global increase in light pollution poses new challenges to wild species , but we âre very much in the early stages of understanding the effects of exposure to light at night
' they found that the number of aphids declined under the light treatment in mid-august due to the limited amount of food available
professor kevin gaston , director of the environment and sustainability institute ( esi ) said : â these are the first findings from major long - term experiments â¦ and already reveal how profound the impacts of artificial night time lighting can be on even simple communities of organisms
â dr jonathan bennie added : â our results suggest that by lighting up our night time environment we trigger complex effects on natural food webs
â while we are all aware that street lights often attract insects at night , we show that they may have more permanent , widespread impacts on wildlife and ecosystems
â another study carried out at the university , along with bat conservation ireland , revealed that bats do nât like streetlights either and that activity was generally lower in street - lit areas than in dark locations with similar habitat
the findings have important implications for conservation , overturning the previous assumption that common bats benefited from street - lights because they could feed on the insects that congregated around them
the research , published in the journal philosophical transactions of the royal society b , found that the activity of soprano pipistrelle , noctule and serotine bats was similar or lower in areas with street lighting compared with dark areas
dr fiona mathews said : â people rarely see bats , and when they do it is usually because they are silhouetted by a light
â because clouds of insects accumulate around lights , there has been an assumption that the bats were getting an easy lunch
another study carried out at the university , along with bat conservation ireland , revealed that bats do nât like streetlights either and are less active around them
