it âs the wonder material that âs 200 times stronger than steel and one million times thinner than human hair , which is set to revolutionise electronics , medicine and transport
now graphene is set to make its commercial debut in the form of a light bulb in a â matter of months â
the bulb contains a filament - shaped led coated in the super-strong carbon and is set to go on sale late 2015
the dimmable bulb contains a filament - shaped led coated in the super-strong carbon , which was co-discovered by sir kostya novoselov ( pictured left )
here , chancellor george osborne examines the bulb uk researchers behind the bulb claim it will last longer and be cheaper to make than conventional leds , as well as slash energy use by 10 per cent
it looks like a traditional light bulb , but the graphene coating enables it to conduct electricity and heat more effectively , to facilitate the improved performance , meaning users wo n't have to change their bulbs as regularly
it was designed at the university of manchester , where graphene was discovered , and will be made by graphene lighting plc , a uk - registered company that âs a spin - out from the university
professor bailey , deputy vice-chancellor at the university told the bbc : â the graphene light bulb will use less energy
â the innovative product looks like a traditional light bulb , but the graphene coating enables it to conduct electricity and heat more effectively , to facilitate the improved performance
similar to another important nanomaterial - carbon nanotubes - graphene is incredibly strong - around 200 times stronger than structural steel
the university said in a statement : â it is expected that the graphene light bulbs will be on the shelves in a matter of months , at a competitive cost
â this implies that the graphene bulbs may cost less than led bulbs , which can be priced at around Â£ 15
the graphene light bulb is thought to be the first commercial application of graphene to emerge from the uk âs Â£ 61 million national graphene institute ( ngi ) , which was opened in university of manchester last week by the chancellor , george osborne
now more than 200 researchers are studying the material at university of manchester to unlock its commercial potential
the graphene light bulb is thought to be the first commercial application of graphene to emerge from the uk âs Â£ 61 million national graphene institute ( pictured ) , which opened in university of manchester last week medical researchers are also excited , because graphene could be used to make nanotechnologies , which could one day provide better cancer treatments , for example and a filter system could create safe drinking water from salt water
graphene is the most conductive material in the world , but because it is thin and flat it does nât have the surface area needed to be used in batteries
