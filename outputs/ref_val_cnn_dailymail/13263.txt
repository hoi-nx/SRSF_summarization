washington president obama 's effort to bridge the trust deficit between african - americans and law enforcement , the money wars heading into 2016 , a little cpac history and a " do not reply " mandate fill our sunday trip around the " inside politics " table : 1
winning cpac once meant little , but are rand paul 's multiple wins just the ticket ? rand paul won his third consecutive cpac presidential straw poll this weekend , and most political journalists yawned -- and understandably so
and in all four of those cases , it was in the actual election year
so sen. rand paul should n't rush to measure the white house drapes

obama dominated high - tech fundraising in 2008 and 2012
bloomberg 's lisa lerer traveled west recently as hillary clinton made a pitch for help this time around
