i have an irrational fear of death by drowning and ca n't bear the thought of eating three meals a day , every day
so the prospect of a 16 - day voyage round new zealand to australia is alarming
will i survive ? or will i disappear overboard , laden with food , the heavyweight victim of some marine disaster ? new zealand is a living geography lesson - a country strewn with mountains , fjords , forests , glaciers , and lakes , home to the dolphin , whale , penguin , albatross , seal and sea - lion ( there is a difference : the latter eat the former for breakfast )
a place to pause : the tiny port of picton is a gateway to the winelands of new zealand 's marborough region home , too , to the beautiful blue agapanthus flower and the crimson - flowered pohutukawa , the new zealand christmas tree
it 's a long journey to new zealand , so make sure you find somewhere to recover
the the boatshed on waiheke , a short ferry ride from auckland , is perfect - a boutique hotel on the water where you can begin your acquaintance with this faraway land
i 'm taken on an exhilarating ride around the bay on a harley davidson - 1800cc of shiny , macho metal
coming back for more : a high percentage of people on the seabourn odyssey are returning passengers ' just lean when i lean , ' he says
my cruising worries begin to evaporate when i meet the crew of seabourn odyssey
' welcome home , ' they say as we embark - a curious choice of words , until you realise more than half the passengers are returnees
in our ship - shape suite , everything is sparklingly clean ( as a woman who enjoys scrubbing her front steps , i notice these things )
captain cook charted the coastline of new zealand 245 years ago
no danger of that on the seabourn odyssey
taken for a ride : sue took a tour of waiheke in speedy two - wheeled style - on a harley davidson the ship has 450 passengers , 11 decks , four restaurants , a spa , fitness centre , swimming pool , hot tubs everywhere and a theatre larger than captain cook 's ship
on day one , we disembark andhead for rotorua and its strange geothermal pools
idyllic : waiheke island sits on auckland 's doorstep - but feels far removed from new zealand 's biggest city ah , well - what 's for dinner ? in akaroa , we see hector 's dolphin , the smallest and rarest in the world
due west - nothing but sea until the tip of south america
it 's time to turn and head out to australia
it 's nearly 1,300 miles from the bottom of new zealand across the tasman sea to melbourne
the crossing takes three long days and nights , but i come to realise how a big ship like the seabourn odyssey can cope with such seas
that afternoon , i watch from my hotel window as the seabourn odyssey sets sail once more , back to auckland
