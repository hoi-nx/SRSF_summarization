congratulations , internet haters ! well done , keepers of the one - true - way - to - talk - about - race ! if we do n't tamp down the backlash against starbucks " campaign , i fear that no major corporation will even try to talk about race again -- for maybe 10 or 20 years
" and there are legitimate questions about what starbucks could realistically hope to accomplish , here
but for crying out loud ! in the past 48 hours , racial justice activists have spilled more digital ink criticizing starbucks for trying to fight racism than they have against other ( actually racist ) companies
we can not demand that companies address race , and then attack them when they try
at some point , all of us have enjoyed the cheap thrill one gets by kicking around a big company online
again , is that what we want ? mellody hobson , an african-american member of the starbucks board and a personal friend , is a major supporter of this campaign
how will other corporate boards react in the future when a minority member encourages the company to publicly address issues of racial inclusion ? starbucks is trying to make a positive difference
at some point in the future , activists will launch an online petition or protest against a company guilty of some legitimately racist behavior
unfortunately , today 's vicious backlash against starbucks could become a case study in proving that -- when it comes to race -- no good deed goes unpunished
ironically , after all this is over , starbucks will still sell plenty of lattes
