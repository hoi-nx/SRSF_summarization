a freshman senator who spearheaded a letter to iran leaders , cautioning them that any deal negotiated by the obama administration would not outlast the current president , defended his actions on tuesday as necessary to prevent the middle east country from becoming nuclear capable
' they âve been killing united states for 35 years , they âve killed hundreds of troops in iraq , now they control five capitols in the middle east , ' arkansas sen. tom cotton said tuesday on msnbc
' they are nothing but hardliners in iran and if they do all of those things without a nuclear weapon , imagine what they would do with one
' tom cotton 's remarks came after vice president biden , the official president of the senate and a former representative for delaware to the upper chamber , sent out a biting statement monday evening accusing letter signers of acting ' beneath the dignity ' of their office
' reminding the foreign government that united states president obama is ineligible for a third term and will leave office in january 2017 , ' the republicans lawmakers said ' most of us will remain in office well beyond then â perhaps decades
' in previewing the letter to bloomberg , tom cotton said monday ' iran 's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that â¦ any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril
' the white house , state department and democrats leaders denounced the audacious move and warned that it could have the intended effect - the dismantlement of the obama and other world leaders ' blossoming agreement with tehran
white house press secretary earnest said it ' certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks
vice president biden lashed out at republicans on monday night in a statement distributed to reporters through the white house 's massive press list
' this letter sends a highly misleading signal to friend and foe alike that that our commander - in - chief can not deliver on united states âs commitments â a message that is as false as it is dangerous
' biden , as obama âs own secretary of defense has said , has been wrong about nearly every foreign policy and national security decision in the last 40 years , ' tom cotton said in remarks captured by politico
the arkansas lawmaker was referring to former dod head robert gates , who deprecated biden in a memoir released after he exited obama 's cabinet
connecticut sen. richard blumenthal said republicans ' ' very blatant effort to undermine the legitimacy ' of the president and ' disrespect ' his as a negotiator is ' unconscionable
' iran 's foreign minister mohammed javad zarif said tuesday , ' this kind of communication is unprecedented and undiplomatic
' ' in fact it implies that the united states is not trustworthy , ' he said according to iran 's state - run news site
the letter , signed by 47 republicans senators , told iran the senate will ' consider any agreement regarding your nuclear - weapons program that is not approved by the congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between president obama and ayatollah khamenei ' the white house on monday reproached senators for acting outside ' the role our founding fathers envisioned congress for to play when it comes to foreign affairs ' and questioned the ' wisdom of their strategy
republicans have not specifically lobbied for military engagement with iran , but its the white house 's view that war could come about if world leaders do not at least attempt to negotiate a deal with iran in good faith
and , as tom cotton noted tuesday morning on cnn 's new day , several of the republicans senators who lent their name to the letter are considering presidential bids and could , in two years , potentially be calling the shots in the oval office
the state department said the republicans 's letter to iran ' undermines ' nuclear negotiations
the white house said it ' certainly interferes ' with ongoing talks asked about the republicans senators ' attempt to undercut his foreign policy strategy on monday , obama said he thought it was ' ironic ' that they were aligning themselves with iran 's hardliners , who also do n't want a deal to go through
in his unusually long statement , biden said the senators ' letter , sent ' in the guise of a constitutional lesson , ignores two centuries of precedent and threatens to undermine the ability of any future united states president , whether democrat or republicans , to negotiate with other nations on behalf of the united states
richard blumenthal said tuesday that tom cotton and other legislators had polarized and undermined a bipartisan coalition of senators ' which is now in tatters ' that were demanding the white house allow the senate to have the final say over any deal it negotiated with tehran
