there are many things that immigrants could teach those of us who are america - born
like a small plastic card that not only allows us to drive on public roadways but also provides us a sense of identity
imagine not having a driver 's license and not being able to obtain one because the government prohibits it
until recently , the 27 - year - old phoenix resident and co-director of the arizona dream coalition was barred from having a driver 's license by arizona
from that point , had she lived in another state , the process for getting a driver 's license might have been much smoother
but she lives in arizona , which -- in the 20 years from 1989 to 2009 -- welcomed illegal immigrants and their labor to build homes in phoenix , work in restaurants in tucson and make beds at ski lodges in flagstaff but then tried to expel them when their chores were done
in august 2012 , on the same day that daca took effect , arizona gov. brewer issued an executive order preventing the program 's recipients from obtaining driver 's licenses or other public " benefit
" brewer 's order was challenged in court
two years later , in july 2014 , a three - judge panel of the 9th circuit court of appeals struck down the arizona policy as a violation of the equal protection clause of the america constitution
with that , the estimated 22,000 daca recipients who are also residents of the arizona were free to apply for driver 's licenses and take their driving tests like anyone else
andiola got her arizona license earlier this month , after paying a $ 25 fee that she 'll have to pay every two years each time she renews it
and i was curious about whether she had given any thought to how the native - born see driver 's licenses compared to people like her
" i think it 's because we fought really hard for it
people born here might not ever think about their driver 's license unless they buy a drink or get stopped by police
for us , it 's a reminder of the fruits of our labor
" finally , there 's the right to vote
