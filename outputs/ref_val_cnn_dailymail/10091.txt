despite the ever growing popularity of online dating , virtual platforms are no match for interactions in the real world when it comes to finding true love , a new australian study has found
almost half of all australians surveyed by ticketing company eventbrite said they met their partner at a live event
one in three people said they 'd exchanged phone numbers at an event with someone they fancied and one in ten said they 'd fallen in love
the survey found the most common hooked - up hotspots were live sporting and music events , followed by business and networking events
from a survey of 1,000 australians commissioned by eventbrite : 35 % of people ( 1 in 3 ) exchanged numbers 32 % of people ( 1 in 3 ) kissed someone 30 % ( 1 in 3 ) approached someone they fancied at an event 24 % of people ( 1 in 4 ) held hands with someone new at an event 16 % of people ( 1 in 6 ) slept with someone they met at an event 10 % of people ( 1 in 10 ) have fallen in love with someone they met at an event 41 % of people said ' none of these ' food and wine , educational and fundraising events also featured in the study as likely places to find that special someone
of the 100 survey respondents , 32 per cent , or one in three people , said they had exchanged a kiss with someone new at a live event
97 per cent of people surveyed said they 'd prefer to initiate a conversation with someone they fancied than to ' like ' a photo of them on social media ( just 3 percent ) and 93 per cent of people said they 'd rather lock eyes with someone across a room for the first time than receive a friend request on facebook
the vast majority of people ( 92 per cent ) would rather introduce their new lover to their parents than change their relationship status on facebook
' no replacement for real life connections ' : 93 per cent of survey respondents said they 'd rather lock eyes with someone across a room than receive a friend request from a love interest on facebook ' while more and more first time interactions are being formed via apps and social media , the study findings are resounding proof there is no replacement for real life connections in taking a possible love match to the next level , ' said laura huddle , head of marketing at eventbrite australia
