as his side left mcdiarmid park with three points in the bag in the middle of last month , the norwegian thought it best to grant his players a day off to clear their minds before the small matter of inter milan at celtic park demanded their full focus
stokes , a native of dublin , had failed to make his scheduled flight back to glasgow after returning home for a family visit
stokes missed celtic 's big game with inter milan last month , but is keen to make the most of the next one whether or not stokes would have featured against the italians was beside the point
his absence left deila with no option but to banish him from what was left of the build - up
for those lucky enough to witness the pulsating 3 - 3 draw that ensued , a sense of bewilderment as to why someone would jeopardise the chance to live out their boyhood dream was compounded by the fact that armstrong and gary had only recently put further pressure on the irishman âs position
only a need to hastily draw a line under the affair
asked if he regretted what happened , stokes replied : â no. look the situation has been dealt with
â stokes has been battling for his place in the side since failing to return to celtic on time before the inter milan game had he apologised to deila over what had taken place ? â no , â he repeated
â try as he might to consign the matter to history , stokes is going to have to go some way to erase it from the minds of his manager and the supporters who pay his wages
deila initially left him out of the squad for the subsequent game with aberdeen but 59 minutes against st johnstone and 64 minutes against dundee united on sunday did at least suggest he âs now edging off the naughty step
with gary and armstrong cup - tied for sunday âs final , stokes has every chance of featuring at hampden
â there âs a lot of competition for places here at the minute and even after that ( missing inter milan ) it âs not as if i âve been a regular in the squad the past few weeks , â he stated
stokes has not made a public apology for his behaviour , but was keen to draw a line under the incident â i âve played the last two games
â they will be straight back in contention as soon as we have these games by us
â i have nât been outstanding since i came back in but i have been creating and getting into positions to score but i just have nât
â there would be no finer time and place to start than sunday at hampden
â i had one or two chances but the ball just wo nât go in the back of the net for me at the moment
â the national stadium would nât immediately spring to mind as an obvious backdrop for the salvation to start
stokes played in the scottish cup semi-final defeat to hearts in 2012 , the league cup final loss to kilmarnock the same year , as well as a semi-final reverse in the same competition to st mirren the following season
the striker has not been in the best of form recently , but is likely to get another chance to prove himself â probably , the ( scottish ) cup final against hibs ( in 2013 ) when i got man of the match , â he replied when asked of his favourite day on mount florida
i did nât know how i was going to come back
â when i first came back my ankle was still at me
â yes , i had a couple of crosses for gary and it was good to finish on a high , more so because of the injury because it had been a long season , â stokes recalled
â there is so much emphasis on getting back and defending and putting in the graft for the team
i actually do nât mind playing on the left but you are never going to get the same plaudits as playing up front and scoring all the goals
â even if stokes plays and scores the goal to win the cup on sunday , it will be hard to view him as the identikit of deila âs ideal player
yet , notwithstanding the inter milan episode , he believes he has now adjusted to the heightened demands of the norwegian
i needed to give myself a lift , keep my fitness levels up and wait for an opportunity to get back in , which fortunately i have got
