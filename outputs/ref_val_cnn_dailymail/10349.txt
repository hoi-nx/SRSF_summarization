scotland may not have won at twickenham since 1983 â but captain greig laidlaw insists there is no reason why cotter âs men should head south with an inferiority complex this weekend
from what he has seen in his first season in the premiership with gloucester , greig laidlaw reckons england âs players are anything but invincible
scotland captain greig greig laidlaw ( above ) insists that england are not invincible ahead of saturday 's clash â i âve always thought highly of the england players but seeing them down there just shows me that we can win , â said greig laidlaw
â greig laidlaw âs emotions are running high ahead of the calcutta cup clash , especially after team - mate stuart hogg told sportsmail he feels there is a lack of respect for scottish rugby south of the border
greig laidlaw made a similar point before the start of the six nations , based on the experiences of his first season with gloucester , following his move from edinburgh
scotland full back stuart hogg ( left ) accused the english of lacking respect for scottish rugby for greig laidlaw , a win at twickenham will not only belatedly ignite scotland âs six nations campaign , following defeats to france , wales and italy , it will give him bragging rights in the gloucester dressing room and make him even more proud to be a scot south of the border
â the england boys will respect us if we do a job on the field
it âs up to us as players to step up , go again and put in that performance against england
we know what is expected of us and he is a very clever coach who wants to make sure we come away from twickenham with a positive result
â greig laidlaw also has two very personal reasons for wanting to lead scotland to what would be a famous victory at twickenham
the other is to wipe out the memory of last year âs 20 - 0 defeat by england at murrayfield
it still makes him bristle and was arguably his worst performance in a scotland shirt
england captain chris robshaw lifts the calcutta cup at murrayfield last year after a 20 - 0 victory nothing went right for greig laidlaw that day and , after missing two penalties and struggling to make any sort of impression on the game , the scotland skipper was replaced by chris cusiter after 65 minutes
the boos that rang round the stadium at the final whistle hurt greig laidlaw and he knows that defeat , on top of scotland âs dreadful six nations campaign so far this season , makes it vitally important to put things right at the home of english rugby
â that was personally one of my worst games for scotland , to be honest , â he admitted
â we certainly want to turn around that defeat and how we have performed in this six nations , if we can , by winning at twickenham and there is slightly more added spice to the fixture because it is england down there
â england centre luther burrell is mobbed by his team - mates after he scored a try in last year 's match much will rest on the performance of second - row jonny gray , who turns 21 on saturday
jonny gray ( above ) will have a big role to play if scotland are to upset the odds and beat england â the result was hugely disappointing but we have to put that behind us now
