debra milke spent 22 years on death row , convicted of conspiring with two other men to kill her son allegedly for an insurance payout
this makes debra milke only the second woman exonerated from death row in the united states
more importantly , the judge 's decision finally clears debra milke after years of legal back - and - forth in a case where she steadfastly maintained her innocence
key to the case 's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct , mainly that of a detective , saldate , who said debra milke confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording
prosecutors withheld from the jury saldate 's personnel record which showed instances of misconduct in other cases , including lying under oath
the two men with whom debra milke was accused of conspiring were tried separately and are still on death row
debra milke 's roomate , styers , took the boy ; then called debra milke saying christopher had disappeared
styers and the friend were convicted of murder and sentenced to death
debra milke was implicated based on alleged testimony from styer 's friend , scott
the detective , saldate , said scott told him that debra milke was involved in a plot to kill her son
no other witnesses or direct evidence linked debra milke to the crime other than saldate 's testimony
saldate further said that debra milke confessed to her role in the murder plot during interrogation and said it was a " bad judgment call
debra milke offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had confessed to any role
ultimately , the jury believed the detective and convicted debra milke of murder
what prosecutors did n't tell the court was the detective 's long history of lying under oath and misconduct
