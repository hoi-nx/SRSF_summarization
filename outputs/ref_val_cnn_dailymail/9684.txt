there 's the beach , of course , on the island of ko phi phi lee , as featured in the 2000 film based on the alex garland novel and starring leonardo dicaprio
and there 's the small sandy cove on khao phing kan in uber - picturesque phang nga bay
the khao sok national park is one of the oldest rainforests in the world , where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps the island is now known as khao phing kan , upon which you and a chum can pose back to back with imaginary weapons , echoing the scene from the man with the golden gun of 007 ( roger moore ) and the evil scaramanga ( christopher lee )
if you do too , you 'll adore the khao lak
and thanks to direct flights to phuket aboard thomson 's dreamliner , you do n't have to faff around catching a connecting flight from bangkok
if you have flown long haul before , you will notice the difference - more space , both seat-wise and all around , dimmable windows , more oxygen and better lighting all make the journey more bearable
and it 's only an hour or so drive north from the airport to khao lak , or 90 minutes away from the busy and , er , colourful attractions of tourist trap patong
the jw marriott khao lak is very classy and quiet and has a glorious beach whch is free from crowds i 'll be honest , i was n't expecting such a tasteful resort
distinctly oriental in design , the jw marriott khao lak is very classy and quiet , with 250 rooms and all the facilities you need for a proper rest and de-stress , whether there 's just two of you or the whole family
a trip to khao phing kan also included a look at a small rubber plantation , feeding monkeys beside a buddhist temple , cruising through mangrove swamps in a long - tailed boat , and lunch in the muslim village at panyi island
roger more ( right ) and christopher lee on james bond island in the film the man with the golden gun more off the beaten track is khao sok national park , one of the oldest rainforests in the world , where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps
however , do be very careful to choose a well - run establishment when selecting this kind of adventure
