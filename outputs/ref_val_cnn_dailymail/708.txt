the conservatives are planning a â kill ukip â campaign in the kent constituency where farage is standing for parliament after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses tories hq is planning a â kill ukip â campaign in the kent constituency where farage is standing for parliament after he vowed to quit as party leader if he loses
mr farage declared yesterday that it would be â curtains â for him if he fails to win the ukip target seat of south thanet
conservative strategists believe mr farage has made a significant blunder by tying his fortunes in south thanet to his future as party leader
â the strategist said that if mr farage stood down after losing the seat , mr carswell was likely to take over and â that would be the end of ukip â
mr farage appears at odds over several areas of policy with key members of his team , mr carswell , who has expressed concern about the â ugly nativism â of some ukip supporters and spoken in favour of immigration
the clacton mp is also seen as lacking in the broad popular appeal of mr farage by tories campaign chiefs
a survation poll commissioned by a ukip donor in south thanet found mr farage to be ahead , but one previous survey had him neck and neck with the tories and another put the tories ahead
â what credibility would ukip have in the commons if others had to enunciate party policy in parliament and the party leader was only allowed in as a guest ? â was i supposed to brief ukip policy from the westminster arms ? no â if i fail to win south thanet , it is curtains for me
mr farage said : â this confirms that ukip is now a major party in britain politics
