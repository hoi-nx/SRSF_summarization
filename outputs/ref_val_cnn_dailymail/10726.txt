cisse was banned for seven games for his part in the spitting storm that also involved manchester united defender jonny evans
jonny evans himself is facing a ban of six matches if found guilty after the fa charged both men
the incident came during manchester united âs 1 - 0 win at newcastle on wednesday night when the pair spat at each other following a first - half tangle

and cisse will inform fa disciplinary chiefs that jonny evans intentionally spat at him when questioned about the incident
cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the fa on thursday this season , fa guidelines dictate that the punishment for spitting should be in line with fifa 's six game ban for the offence
cisse faces an additional one game ban because he has already been sent off for violent conduct after elbowing everton 's seamus coleman ( above ) in december
having conceded he was wrong to react by spitting in jonny evans âs face , cisse will be fined a week âs wages of around Â£ 40,000 by newcastle , who will now be without their 11 - goal top scorer until may
however , cisse has already served a three - match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing everton âs seamus coleman and as a result will be hit with an additional one - game suspension
but the 27 - year - old will contest the charge , to which he must respond by 6pm on friday evening

â during the game cisse and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting
â tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from newcastle and manchester united gather on the pitch cisse was banned for an extra man after beinf sent off for elbowing everton 's seamus coleman in december the fa were waiting for referee anthony taylor 's report
as he missed the incident between jonny evans and pappis cisse , and it was n't included in his report - the fa were within their right to retrospectively punish the pair
however , the fa have issued new guidelines to move in line with new fifa guidelines meaning jonny evans and cisse could now be banned for six games
