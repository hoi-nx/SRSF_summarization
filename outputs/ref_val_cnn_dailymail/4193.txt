a little boy born with a rare brain disease that prevented him from being able to cry or feed properly , has died at just eight weeks old
yasmin and michael burley have shared a touching tribute to their son tate , whose short and difficult life they documented on social media in the hope of raising awareness of the extremely rare brain disorder he suffered from : miller dieker lissencephaly
' tate passed away with his family surrounding him at 6.25pm
the syndrome affects most of tate 's major neural systems and his parents were told his brain will not develop past the three month stage
tate 's brain was abnormally smooth , without the grooves of a normal brain which receive senses
hundreds of messages of support and love from friends and strangers have since flooded the page tragically , his death came just hours after his family celebrated him turning eight weeks old and only one day after he experienced his first seizure ' last night however we witnessed tate develop from a sleeping premie to a seizing newborn
' tate 's story first came to light when friends and family launched a mycause fundraising campaign to help pay for tate 's care and more research into the condition , with mrs burley telling the sunday telegraph : ' we just want him to cry '
yesterday was a good day â¦ today i just want to get through , ' mrs burley wrote of watching her son suffer through seizures for the first time on friday baby tate was born at just 1.7kg and told he was unlikely to live past his fifth birthday a milestone for the family was when tate managed to suck 6 - 10mls out of a bottle by himself during one feed
the family 's first scare came after just four days at home when tate developed a cold and his parents rushed him back to emergency where he spent the next six days with his mother convinced he was dying
friends and family launched a mycause fundraising campaign to help pay for tate 's care and more research into the condition ' granny and i watched tate lie lifeless in the emergency ward on the table gasping for air , dropping saturations and an excessively weak heart rate , white with blue lips , eyes rolled in his head , body flopped , ' she said
' there is no cure for the condition and babies rarely live out their childhood
