three decades ago , mccurry took arguably the most iconic picture of all time
yet even after all this time , the pre-eminent photographer brims with enthusiasm when he talks about " afghan girl
i showed it to the editor of the national geographic , and he leaped to his feet and shouted , ' that 's our next cover '
" not only did " afghan girl " become the magazine 's next cover , but the most successful in its distinguished history
the striking portrait of 12 - year - old afghan girl , a pashtun orphan in the nasir bagh refugee camp on the afghanistan - pakistan border , was taken in december 1984 and published the following year
when mccurry reflects upon its popularity , what excites him most is the impact that this single image has had on the real world
" people volunteered to work in the refugee camps because of that photograph , " he says
" afghanistan are incredibly proud of it , as the girl is poor but shows great pride , fortitude and self - respect
" it also led the national geographic to set up the afghan children 's fund -- and meant that to this day , mccurry is never charged a fare by appreciative afghanistan taxi drivers
the portrait forms the centerpiece of a major retrospective exhibition of mccurry 's work , which opened recently in villa reale di monza , italy , and will run until 6 april
" it 's great to look back on my work and see how themes and connections have emerged
but i am never even remotely thinking of retiring , " the 64 - year - old tells cnn from his studio in new york
why would you retire from doing what you love ? it 's just not what we do
" the famous photograph is just one of thousands of extraordinary pictures that mccurry has taken over a 40 - year career , during which he has won dozens of awards
one which is displayed prominently in his retrospective exhibition was taken in kuwait in 1991 , during the first gulf war
" for many years , frontline war photography like this was mccurry 's stock in trade
born in pennsylvania in 1950 , mccurry -- whose right hand was permanently damaged when he fell down some stairs at the age of five -- studied theater arts at penn state university
two years after graduating , he moved to india in search of a freelance photography career
there he took a set of searing photographs of people who were being attacked by their own government
" as soon as i crossed the border , i came across about 40 houses and a few schools that were just bombed out , " he says
that 's when i knew that this was what i did -- this was me
the lens of the western media quickly swung towards the region , and mccurry happened to be already embedded
his pictures were soon appearing in the new york times , time and paris match -- but not before mccurry had escaped from afghanistan by crossing the tribal areas on foot , with his precious film sewn into his clothing
this was the beginning of many years of war photography , which he now describes as " the gritty period " of his career
" when you 're working in a war zone , you 're living moment to moment with people trying to kill you , " he says
" but i have found that i get completely consumed by the importance of the story i am telling , the feeling that the world has got to know
it 's never about the adrenaline
it 's about the story
" mccurry 's portfolio is far broader than his war photography , however
he has worked all over the world , from the jungles of central africa to the mountains of tibet , each time seeming to capture the soul of the people he photographs
" like " afghan girl " ? he pauses
" mccurry - oltre lo sguardo runs until april 6 , 2015 at villa reale di monza .
