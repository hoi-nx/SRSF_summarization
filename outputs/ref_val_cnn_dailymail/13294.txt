was the mideast better off under dictatorships ? it is certainly tempting to think so when one looks at conflicts in the region today , from yemen to libya to syria
while this instability is making the west -- particularly the u.s. -- uncomfortable , it is also a direct result of the west 's own stance towards dictatorships in the region prior to and during the arab spring
the west 's shortsightedness in handling the mideast throughout its modern history has directly contributed to its current devastation
before 2011 , what the west most valued in the mideast was stability rather than democracy
when the reality of living under dictatorships became exposed with the arab spring , the west could no longer ignore it and had to publicly declare support for the uprisings
but the west did not have a long - term strategy for handling the aftermath of dictatorships -- and the results have been catastrophic
syria saw diplomatic toing and froing that eventually dragged the west into a messy war
the west was naÃ¯ve to think that saleh would simply accept his removal from power
the saudis and the west ignored the simmering sectarian tensions between the houthis and the sunni tribes of yemen , not to mention the popular anger at u.s. - led drone attacks that sometimes killed civilians
they also ignored iran 's rising ambitions ; why would the houthis -- iran 's allies -- limit themselves to northern yemen if they could also expand southwards and rule the whole country ? the situation in yemen today shows that even though the status quo under dictatorships may have appeared stable , beneath the surface volcanoes were preparing to erupt
they may support the west 's interests , but they will turn against them whenever their own interests are threatened
although many today lament that the arab spring has turned into an arab winter , the conflicts emerging across the mideast are largely the result of the political , economic , and social ills of dictatorships and the conditions that had sustained them
but the current misery in the mideast still does not mean that the region was better off under dictatorships
the aftermath of dictatorships is always messy , and democratic transition is never linear
