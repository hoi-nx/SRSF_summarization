mike zimmer says the vikings have no intention of trading peterson
i mean , he 's under contract and we expect him to honor it , ' zimmer said at the nfl
' peterson played one game for the vikings last season before being suspended but ben dogra , agent of the superstar running back , has other ideas
' peterson and i feel it is in his best interest , and it would be his desire , to play elsewhere in the nfl
three years remain on the 30 - year - old 's deal with $ 12.75million due this season
peterson remains on the commissioners exempt list until at least april 15 after hitting his four - year - old son with a switch and the 2012 mvp has been less than enthusiastic about returning to minnesota
zimmer also poured scorn on notions that the vikings are set to trade 2013 first round draft pick cordarrelle
