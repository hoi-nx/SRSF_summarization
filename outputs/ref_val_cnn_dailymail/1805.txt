residents of rural communities could be forced to travel miles to their nearest bank after the biggest lenders refused to commit to never shut the â last bank in town â
after months of negotiation , the government failed to secure the crucial agreement to protect customers , as bank bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking
blame it on the internet : as they refuse to commit to never closing ' the last bank in town ' , bosses justify branch closures by stressing the soaring popularity of online banking but critics say they do not go far enough and will allow lenders to shut hundreds of branches across the country â even when there is no other bank in the community
under the new regime banks will have to consult with local communities before any branch closure and ensure there are alternatives for customers such as free cash machines , â mobile banking vans â , and a local post office where they can sort out their finances
banks also have to give 12 weeks â notice before they shut a branch

chris leslie , shadow chief secretary to the treasury said : â this is a massive embarrassment for vince cable
â the bosses of all the major banks have justified the closure of branches by stressing the soaring popularity of digital banking â both online and on smart phones
but the combination of bank and building society closures , particularly in rural areas , and the industry âs growing reliance on online services mean access has become increasingly difficult for many older people
â vince cable has said that the post office can play a vital role in providing an alternative for bank customers
