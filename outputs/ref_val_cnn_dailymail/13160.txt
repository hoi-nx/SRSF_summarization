australia foreign minister julie bishop says the government is seeking to confirm reports that an australia teenager has carried out a suicide attack on behalf of isis in iraq
" i can confirm that the australia government is currently seeking to independently verify reports that 18 - year - old melbourne teenager jake bilardi has been killed in a suicide bombing attack in the middle east , " she told reporters
" if these reports are confirmed , this is another tragic example of a young australia being lured to a senseless and violent death by a brutal terrorist organization that is intent on imposing suffering and misery not only in iraq and syria but beyond
" on wednesday , isis claimed that " abu abdullah al-australi , " along with four other foreign fighters , had been killed while carrying out suicide attacks during an offensive launched on the city of ramadi in iraq
the claim , issued on a twitter account associated with the anbar provincial division of isis , was accompanied by a series of 20 images , including a photo of a young man who looked like jake bilardi
the image appeared to show jake bilardi at the wheel of a car with the caption , " abu abdullah al-australi ( may allah accept him ) , the attacker on the 8th brigade
victoria police said jake bilardi first came to their attention when his family reported him missing last year

australia media have reported that jake bilardi kept a since - deleted blog , written under his alias abu abdullah al-australi
entitled " from melbourne to ramadi : my journey , " it reportedly detailed his transition from an " atheist school student in affluent melbourne to a soldier of the khilafah preparing to sacrifice my life for islamic
" the blog reportedly described a plan to attack targets in melbourne , after an initial attempt to move to iraq or syria failed
a former classmate of jake bilardi 's from melbourne 's craigieburn secondary college described the teen on facebook as a " shy kid who did n't like to be disturbed "
" julie bishop said that 90 australia citizens are in iraq and syria fighting on the side of isis , and that at least 20 australia have been killed in the conflict
julie bishop appealed to young australia " not to fall victim to this brutal terrorist organization , to not be lured into believing that they 're embarking on some adventure or some romantic endeavor
" australia prime minister tony abbott addressed jake bilardi 's alleged suicide attack in comments to the press thursday
" last week , two australia teen brothers were arrested at sydney airport on suspicion of trying to leave the country to join isis
