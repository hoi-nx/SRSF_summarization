what does it sound like to land on the surface of saturn âs titan or fly past the martian moon phobos ? thanks to the european space agency you can listen to these sounds - and more - recreated by processing data from various spacecraft
it took off from french guiana at 9.46pm gmt on friday 27 march ( pictured ) , carrying two satellites that will expand europe âs galileo system the various noises from space are shared on european space agency 's esaops soundcloud page
one clip uses audio data collected by the huygens probe probe as it descended onto the surface of saturn 's titan on 14 january 2005
according to european space agency they â give a realistic reproduction of what a traveller on board huygens probe would have heard during one minute of the descent through titan 's atmosphere
because titan is smaller than earth , its gravity does nât hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space
the spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the huygens atmospheric structure instrument ( hasi ) , which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended elsewhere , the famous sounds of comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko , as heard by the rosetta spacecraft and philae probe , are also replayed
rosetta âs plasma consortium ( rpc ) recorded oscillations in the comet âs magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz
elsewhere , the famous sounds of comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko ( pictured ) , as heard by the rosetta spacecraft and philae probe , are also replayed
rosetta âs plasma consortium ( rpc ) recorded oscillations in the comet âs magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz the landing of philae on the surface of 67p on 12 november 2014 is also heard in a brief clip , which is the actual recording of mechanical vibrations as it made its touchdown
philae 's first landing on the surface , seen here as pictured from the rosetta spacecraft , can be heard in a short clip
