disgraced mp joyce used his taxpayer - funded credit to pay for Â£ 450 - a - night hotels during his Â£ 13,000 expenses binge , it has been revealed
the ex-labour backbencher , who is standing down at the next election after he was convicted of headbutting a tory mp in a commons bar , repeatedly used his parliamentary card to settle big bills
many of these payments were later declared unclaimable on expenses , but his card was not blocked by the independent parliamentary standards authority ( ipsa ) for more than two years
he even claimed that one Â£ 896.92 bill for two nights was for a ' whole bunch of people ' to stay at the four - star park plaza near westminster
disgraced mp joyce used his taxpayer - funded credit to pay for Â£ 450 - a - night hotels during his Â£ 13,000 expenses binge mail online 's tom mctague revealed earlier this week that commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around Â£ 1,000 a month from his salary
the details emerged after ipsa admitted it has been labelling some of mr joyce 's hotel claims as ' not paid ' in its regular disclosures - when in fact it has paid a much higher bill in full
the falkirk mp accepts that he made mistakes in filing claims after using his card , suggesting he was also paying for rooms for staff the watchdog confirmed he put Â£ 743 on a card to fund a three night - stay at a ' non-london ' hotel , believed to be in glasgow , in september last year
but as he is only entitled to claim up to Â£ 120 a night for hotels outside the capital , an excess of Â£ 383 was added to his debt
mr joyce stayed at a prestigious intercontinental hotel in london in may 2013 , when he appears to have broken the Â£ 150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by Â£ 203.05
in december of that year - 10 months after he headbutted a tory mp during a brawl in a commons bar - he charged Â£ 896.92 to the card for a two - night stay at a london hotel
mr joyce insisted he was using hotels booked through the parliamentary travel office , and said some bills were high because staff stayed at the same time
the Â£ 896.92 bill was for a ' whole bunch of people ' to stay at the park plaza near westminster , he said
' they would have all been eligible ( for expenses ) but the parliamentary card was used rather than their cards or my card
' mr joyce said ipsa had contacted him about spending in late 2013 , but he heard nothing else and believed they had dropped the matter until last december
he even claimed that one Â£ 896.92 bill for two nights was for a ' whole bunch of people ' to stay at the four - star park plaza near westminster ( pictured ) ' the whole figure was only exposed in december , ' he said
' mr joyce said there was a ' particular issue ' with a member of staff who moved to brighton from scotland
however , after 16 months , ipsa decided the claims were invalid and demanded the money back , according to mr joyce
mr joyce stayed at a prestigious intercontinental hotel in london in may 2013 , when he appears to have broken the Â£ 150 a night limit for hotels in the capital by Â£ 203.05 ' when those assurances were not followed through , we turned off his payment card in january 2015 and in february 2015 we moved to recovering money directly from his salary
' in 2008 , before ipsa took over the system , mr joyce had his parliamentary expenses suspended after putting nearly Â£ 5,000 in ' non-parliamentary ' travel expenses to tokyo , kinshasa and nairobi on a commons card , and then ignoring repeated demands from officials to repay
mr joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics
