google has taken a fight with the journal to a new level - by countering what it sees as misleading , inaccurate reporting with a gif of a laughing baby
gif war : a google public relations official deployed this picture of a laughing baby to counter reporting she objects to in the journal boss : rachel whetstone , pictured , was the author of the blog post
she worked for the british conservative party before joining the search giant it also took umbrage to the suggestion that google staff members visiting the white house 230 times president obama took office could have affected the probe
implications : rachel whetstone 's post took aim at journal owner rupert murdoch , whose lower - brow publications were also given a mention rachel whetstone , senior vice president in google 's communications and policy department , wrote the post , which began with aspersions against news corp , the company which ultimately owns the journal
only then did rachel whetstone , a former high - ranking political adviser for the british conservative party , address a list of grievances with the journal 's report , which cited instances when ftc officials recommended suing google
clincher : rachel whetstone used the above image to end her argument , after pointing out that google 's business practices had been approved by several government bodies she also drew in another report which pointed out that google 's 230 + meetings at the white house during obama 's presidency , and cited an ftc statement saying the journal had been ' misleading ' by juxtaposing that fact with reporting on the anti-competitive practices investigation
after citing a number of other rulings vindicating , by state - level government bodies and also officials in europe , rachel whetstone fired off another gif - this one a jubilant jewish new yorker winning an argument
the piece was a seemingly rare intervention by rachel whetstone , who had n't written a blog for google since 2012
