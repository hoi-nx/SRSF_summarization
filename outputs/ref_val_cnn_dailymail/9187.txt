our ability to answer questions currently separates us from machines in the world of artificial intelligence
now , scientists at facebook have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer , if they can ever match human brainpower â but some of them are a bit tricky , meaning some people may fail them too
scientists at facebook ( logo shown ) have come up with questions that they say artificially intelligent machines must answer if they can ever match human brainpower â but some of them are a bit tricky , meaning some people may fail them too the team from the social media firm âs ai in new york have come up with a list of 20 questions to separate humans from robots , because they say â many existing learning systems can currently not solve them
â they test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language
will the box of chocolates sit in the suitcase ? the intelligent computers were tested on 20 questions in total , but none of them got a perfect score
the answers to the five examples listed , are shown above the sometimes tricky questions test different types of reasoning and the ability to process language
a stock image of a perplexed person is shown some of the questions require machines to recall facts , while others need reasoning , or to count the number of objects , expressed in a written passage
the researchers say that humans should be able to score full marks
while you may have got one answer wrong , none of the seven computer learning programmes that facebook tested got all 20 questions right
the paper says : â one long - term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to reasoning and natural language , in particular building an intelligent dialogue agent
â the results of the test show that humans are still ahead of the game when it comes to interpreting the world âs subtleties and language
