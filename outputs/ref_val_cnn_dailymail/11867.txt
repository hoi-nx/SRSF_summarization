almost 50 years ago , nasa launched two men into space in the same spacecraft for the first time - a milestone for america human spaceflight
but the groundbreaking mission is nât necessarily remembered for this feat. two hours into the mission , one of the pilots pulled out a contraband corned beef sandwich which sparked a controversial incident that was debated all the way to us congress
the gemini 3 mission of 23 march 1965 , america 's first two - man spaceflight , was shrouded in controversy when astronaut young snuck a corned beef sandwich on board
the first crewed gemini flight , gemini 3 , lifted off launch pad 19 at cape canaveral in florida on march 23 , 1965
nasa 's two - man gemini spaceflights demonstrated that astronauts could change their capsule 's orbit , remain in space for at least two weeks and work outside their spacecraft
so when astronaut young pulled out a sandwich from his spacesuit , two hours after launching from cape canaveral in florida , mission controllers were understandably perturbed
â where did that come from ? â co-astronaut gus grissom asked young when he produced the previously hidden item , in a bizarre exchange you can read in nasa âs transcript of the mission
young would go on to be one of nasa 's most decorated astronauts , but grissom died in the apollo 1 launchpad fire on 27 january 1967 young had been given the contrabrand from fellow astronaut wally schirra , who was known for his pranks within the agency , and put it inside his spacesuit on the way to the launchpad , seen here

the spacecraft was incredibly cramped , seen in a simulator on the right ( young is left , grissom right ) , and thus the movements and actions of the astronauts inside were severely restricted the major fear of having crumbs in a spacecraft was that they could get stuck in various controls , something that featured in the 15th episode of the fifth season of the simpsons , deep space homer , when homer opened and spilled a bag of crisps in space ( shown ) â my thought is that ... to have one of the astronauts slip a sandwich aboard the vehicle , frankly , is just a little bit disgusting , â representative george shipley of illinois later said to nasa administrators in houston
here 's some we made earlier : shown is the official food taken into space on the gemini 3 mission , including dehydrated beef pot roast , bacon and egg bites , toasted bread cubes , orange juice and a wet wipe

he was also part of the inaugural space shuttle mission - sts-1 in 1981 - which amusingly was the first time nasa allowed corned beef on a flight - before his sixth and final mission , sts-9 , in 1983
sadly , gus grissom âs next mission was apollo 1 , designed to be a low - earth orbit test of the apollo command and service module
in a routine test on 27 january 1967 , the capsule caught fire , killing all three crew members - gus grissom , ed white and roger chaffee - inside the module .
