the tories are planning to repeat the ' labour tax bombshell ' campaign that won them the 1992 general election
cameron will argue labour has Â£ 15billion of unexplained tax cuts , having voted to back government plans to save Â£ 30billion over five years
yesterday , the prime minister torpedoed labour 's central economic attack by categorically ruling out a rise in vat
asked by miliband at the final prime minister 's questions before polling day whether he would rule out a rise in vat , he replied : ' the answer is yes
' the announcement left mr miliband , who appeared unprepared for the ' straight answer ' he had demanded , floundering
mr cameron then challenged mr miliband to rule out the prospect of labour raising national insurance contributions , which it did in 2002
' labour has been panicked today into ruling out tax rises left , right and centre , ' said a senior official
' so where is the Â£ 15billion tax bombshell going to fall ? it is a safe bet that this is going to feature heavily in our campaign
' conservative sources said the party had set a trap for mr miliband because chancellor osborne two days ago ( pictured ) declined to give a ' cast - iron guarantee ' to match labour 's pledge not to increase vat in an echo of slogans in the 1992 election campaign , when john major defied the polls to win a majority , mr cameron said : ' we know there is a tax bombshell coming from labour â¦ it would wreck our economy
' the issue is likely to figure in the first leaders ' tv interviews of the election campaign tonight , when mr cameron and mr miliband face a grilling from jeremy paxman and kay burley on channel 4 and sky news
mr miliband insisted ' nobody would believe ' mr cameron 's pledge and labour officials said the party would press ahead with its billboard campaign
they pointed out that mr cameron had said before the last election that he had ' no plans ' to raise vat
labour said the tories had made a similar pledge before the 1992 election , only to break it a year later
