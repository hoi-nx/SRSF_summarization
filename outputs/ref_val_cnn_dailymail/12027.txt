isis terrorists are stealing civilians ' cars in an attempt to flee as iraqi soldiers fight their way into the strategically important city of tikrit
the massive operation involving more than 30,000 iraqi army soldiers is succeeding in forcing isis militants from the city , which is the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein
tikrit , which lies midway between regime - capital baghdad and the isis stronghold of mosul , was taken by isis in june
retaking the isis stronghold is considered vital if government forces are to succeed in their plan to force isis out of the oil rich city of mosul , the terror group 's iraqi power base which lies just 140 miles north of tikrit on highway 1 - a road that effectively marks the front line in northern iraqi
iraqi forces entered isis - held tikrit city centre from qadisiya in the north and also from the south - the terrorists still hold the town of al-alam , north of tikrit university militiamen laid down heavy machine gunfire in the neighborhood 's dusty streets during the attack today taking tikrit would open a supply line for a future operation to besiege mosul , iraqi 's second - largest city that still remains under isis control tikrit would be the biggest victory yet for iraqi forces , but the attack by thousands of shiite irregulars could severely test the government 's ability to handle sectarian divisions
us military officials - who have not been involved in the ongoing tikrit offensive - have that said a coordinated military mission to retake mosul is likely to take place next month or two and involve up to 25,000 iraqi troops
