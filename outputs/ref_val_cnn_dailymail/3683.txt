a new study suggests tall rooms encourage people to explore space as well as think freely , as previously discovered when choosing the perfect house , many people opt for high ceilings and a sense of space , despite premium price tags and the higher cost of heating airy expanses in the winter
now a new study suggests that tall rooms excite the brain and encourage people to explore space , building on previous research that high ceilings are linked to a sense of freedom
a psychologist thinks that the combination of a room that promotes free thinking and is stimulating to the senses , explains why people choose airy homes
participants indicated whether each image was beautiful or not while in the fmri scanner and the experts found that people were more likely to find spaces with high ceilings attractive , than those with low ceilings
studying levels of brain activity , they also discovered heightened activity triggered by high ceilings in two areas of the brain associated with visual exploration â the left precuneus and left middle frontal gyrus
scientists studied volunteers ' reactions to rooms with high and low ceilings using an fmri scanner and found that airy rooms activated areas of the brain associated with visual exploration , while more enclosed spaces ( stock image is shown ) did not catch people 's attention and stimulate their senses this suggests that high ceilings capture people âs attention and stimulate the senses , encouraging people to explore the space they are in
but because the fmri results did nât show any difference in brain regions linked to pleasure or emotion , the study , published in the journal of environmental psychology , hints that high ceilings do nât instantly put people in a good mood
studying levels of brain activity , theydiscovered heightened activity triggered by high ceilings in two areas of the brain associated with visual exploration â the left precuneus ( marked in red on this stock image ) and left middle frontal gyrus last year , a study of 2,000 homeowners revealed that in 68 per cent of cases , the majority of the decision of where to live was made by women
they discovered that high ceilings seem to cause people to think more freely , encouraging creativity and abstraction , while lower ceilings promoted confined thinking
