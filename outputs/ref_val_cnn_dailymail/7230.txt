it 's midnight , and i âm sitting by a fire swathed in native american blankets - bourbon on ice clinking in one hand , the other incinerating plump saccharine marshmallows in the gentle flames
this is no inauthentic act cranked out for tourists , but a moving , thought - provoking reminder of an almost - lost america heritage
i am at mustang monument wild horse eco-resort , the creation and domain of the glamorous madeleine , whose life âs work has been to preserve the last great america mustangs from oblivion
standing proud : mustang is home to an impressive number of wild horses she opened this resort last year , a 900 - square - mile reserve and not - for - profit luxury eco-resort in northeastern nevada
former wife to oil billionaire t. boone pickens , and an ex-racehorse breeder , , madeleine rescued 600 wild horses in 2008 after hearing that the government was planning to euthanise or sell more than 30,000 for slaughter
it was a prequel to setting up a foundation to save america âs mustangs , whose conservation is battled over between those who consider the animal an agricultural pest , and those who believe it is a symbol of pioneer freedom
â the story of these wild horses unites people
but behind the fantasy , each guest is preserving a symbol of america heritage , and a symbol of freedom , â as madeleine puts it
home free : some see wild mustangs as pests - but they are protected at this nevada retreat madeleine âs version of playtime is a surreal blend of high fashion and authentic ranch life
arriving at mustang monument â two hours drive from salt lake city and submerged within three mountain ranges â feels as though you are checking into the touristic lovechild of anna wintour and butch cassidy
candy - coloured hand - painted tipis , pioneer wagons and a cinnamon - coffee blend of migrating horses punctuate the brush
( although , with its hardwood floors , leather armchairs , and luxuriant egyptian cotton and hand - made quilts , the transition to camping is hardly challenging , and , if canvas does nât appeal , guests can also stay in a sumptuous pioneer cottage
) we meet the famous mustangs at feeding time when hordes of wild horses bashfully approach our wagon , their velvety noses pushing through the hay bundles
life under canvas : guests at mustang monument can opt to sleep in a luxury tipi we take off on regular saddle horses up spruce mountain led by clay nannini , who is riding a broken - in mustang
creature comforts : for those who prefer walls to tents , rustic cabins are also available in bringing freedom to mustangs in the wide - open spaces of america , madeleine is bringing freedom to her guests too ; as well as a slug of the old american dream
