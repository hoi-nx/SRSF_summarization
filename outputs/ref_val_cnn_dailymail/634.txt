microsoft has confirmed that it is dropping the windows internet explorer brand
the move was rumoured in december but now the redmond - based tech giant has said it will use a new name for its forthcoming browser , which is currently code named spartan
it is believed the new browser will look more like google 's chrome browser and be faster than windows internet explorer
the new browser will be the main way for microsoft 10 users to access the internet , although windows internet explorer will continue to exist , the verge reported
the re-branding move is unsurprising as microsoft has tried and largely failed to shake off the bad reputation of internet explorer 6 , which was notoriously insecure and has regularly made â worst tech products of all time â lists
the new operating system marks the return of the start , which has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface , combined with the tile set - up that microsoft introduced in windows 8 ( pictured ) the company is thought to be testing names using market research , but so far no final name has been announced
however , it struggled in the face of competition , and in may 2012 it was announced that google 's chrome overtook windows internet explorer as the most used browser worldwide
capossela mentioned that putting â microsoft â in front of the secret name boosted the browser âs appeal to some chrome users in the uk , suggesting the company âs name could appear in the final brand
' microsoft is building a new browser , codenamed spartan , which is not ie 12 - at least according to a couple of sources of mine , ' she wrote
thomas nigro , a microsoft student partner lead and developer of the modern version of vlc - a media playing app - claimed on twitter in december that he heard microsoft was building a brand - new browser
' however , if my sources are right , spartan is not ie 12
' instead , spartan is a new , light - weight browser microsoft is building
' it is believed windows 10 will ship with both spartan and ie to ensure compatibility with all web sites
microsoft has not publicly set a firm timetable for the release of windows
various app stores merged into one platform , called the one store
last year , it was derided for ' missing one ' when it announced it has decided to jump straight to version 10 of its windows software in a bid to convince consumers the software is different from current versions
myerson , microsoft 's windows chief said : ' there 's about one and a half billion people using windows today
' microsoft said its new operating system will run on the ' broadest types of devices ever ' and will see various app stores merged into one platform , called the one store
last year , myerson , microsoft 's windows chief , explained how windows 10 will work on everything from a desktop computer to a smartphone - and even the firm 's xbox one games console the new software will also allow users on hybrid devices like the surface pro tablet to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes ( pictured ) the new start has the traditional list layout of previous versions of the interface , combined with the tile set - up that microsoft introduced in windows 8
microsoft is restoring some of the more traditional ways of doing things and promises that windows will be familiar for users regardless of which version of windows they are now using
it will run on tablets , phones , desktop computers and even the firm 's xbox games console - and come with a yet - to - be - named browser industry experts have been having their say on microsoft 's latest operating system , windows 10 , which was announced at an event in california in december 2014
many see the upgrade as being the first steps towards righting the unpopular changes made in the company 's previous desktop software , windows 8 , and that is reflected in industry reaction
' with windows 10 microsoft has re-evaluated its approach to software releases by adopting a web mentality that dovetails with the cloud first , mobile first vision under satya nadella
this open , collaborative approach is critical if microsoft is to overcome the wave of negative sentiment that has plagued windows 8 since launch
' developers are the lifeblood of any platform so it is critical that microsoft 's ' one windows ' mantra delvers on the promise and re-energises developer engagement
' windows 10 is designed to bring together all of microsoft 's different hardware , such as a the surface tablet ( left ) and the xbox one ( right ) under the same software across desktop pcs as a whole , only 13.4 per cent currently run windows 8 or windows 8.1 , according to research firm netmarketshare
users on hybrid devices like the surface pro tablet will be able to jump between and keyboard and touchscreen modes , with microsoft demonstrating how the interface will change as you do
although the new software wo n't be formally released until later this year , analysts have already said that its success is crucial for microsoft and new ceo satya nadella .
