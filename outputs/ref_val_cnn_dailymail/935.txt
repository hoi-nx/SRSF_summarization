scientists have discovered that there might be dark matter trapped inside the sun - and it could be the solar interior
and once inside , it affects the movement of heat within our solar system 's star - which could explain why scientists have struggled to explain ' pressure waves ' inside the sun. durham university scientists have proposed a new model for the sun. they say that dark matter may be transferring heat around its interior ( artist 's illustration shown )
this would help explain how pressure waves move around the sun. current models are insufficient to account for how they move the theory was put forward by scientists from durham university
they propose that so - called asymmetric dark matter ( adm ) could explain some inconsistencies in the standard solar model
so far , the standard solar model has proved successful in calculating the sun âs density and temperature - but measuring ' pressure waves ' in its interior has proved much more difficult
it has previously been theorised that dark matter originating from elsewhere in the galaxy may have an affect on the sun - particularly its activity and even its structure
â weakly - interacting dark matter from the galactic halo is captured when it passes through the sun , â the researchers note in their paper
the dark matter becomes gravitationally trapped within the sun because it does not contain much antimatter
this means it is not destroyed when it interacts with other matter - so the sun likely has a steadily increasing amount of dark matter
according to the researchers , dark matter ( illustration shown ) originates in the galactic halo of the milky way before passing through the sun - and in some instances , it becomes gravitationally trapped dark matter particles are thought to absorb energy in the hottest , central parts of the core
this would explain why observations of pressure waves in the sun - namely how they move , and how heat is transported - do not match up with theories of solar behaviour
another conclusions the scientists is that the type of dark matter in the sun is â asymmetric , â as mentioned earlier , which means it contains very little antimatter
â the calculations produced by the team suggest that dark matter displaying this property would transfer large amounts of heat from the sun âs core to its surface
