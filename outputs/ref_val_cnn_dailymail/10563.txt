sadistic isis fanatics are turning children into an army of hundreds of murderous monsters willing to blow themselves up , die in battle and execute hostages for their twisted cause
extremism experts warn children are being indoctrinated and radicalised from birth , leading to a ' whole generation who will know nothing other than isis ideology '
their comments follow the release of a sickening new video that purports to show a boy of about 10 years old shooting dead of a 19 - year - old israeli - arab who was taken hostage by the terror group
the footage of a child seemingly carrying out such a brutal execution has sent shock waves around the world , but it came as no surprise to experts who have been following the brainwashing of youngsters by isis

last month , isis released a slickly - edited propaganda video showing boys as young as five being indoctrinated at a military - style training camp for ' cubs ' in syria
' other footage shows children being taught in an isis school before learning hand - to - hand combat and how to fire a gun
pictures posted on isis - linked social media accounts have included babies posing with firearms and young children holding up the heads of beheading victims
some propaganda videos attempt to show the ' lighter ' side of life under the control of the caliphate , and unsophisticated ploys such as giving sweets to children seem to have played a part in the radicalisation

raed , 17 , went to a training camp when he was just 16 , after isis visited his hometown in syria
