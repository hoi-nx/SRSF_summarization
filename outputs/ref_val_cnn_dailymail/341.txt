twitter has admitted it needs to get tougher on trolls and has already introduced new ways to report abuse to weed out the perpetrators
but now it 's taking aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the site
its rules now say that users must not ' post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent '
twitter 's rules have been updated in an attempt to clamp down on revenge porn
under ' private information ' ( pictured ) the guidelines now say that users must not ' post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent '
the site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users the changes were spotted by buzzfeednews , which recently submitted a q&a to reddit when the community site took a similar stance against pornographic posts
both twitter 's rules and abusive behaviour policy have been updated to reflect these changes
twitter said that an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent
in february a law was passed that made posting revenge porn images and videos a criminal offence in england and wales
under the rules , revenge porn is considered : ' photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed , where what is shown would not usually be seen in public '
it covers images shared without the subject 's permission and ' with the intent to cause harm
this follows laws in sixteen us states - including alaska , california , new jersey and texas - explicitly relating to revenge porn
under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can , in theory , distribute it as they see fit but twitter 's rules additionally considers the people in the footage
it will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission
twitter said ' agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy ' , including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders
' users posting such content with an intent to harass will be subject to suspension from twitter
' the changes follow reports twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers
