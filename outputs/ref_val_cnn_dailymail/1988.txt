dinner with arnold palmer on thursday night clearly agreed with world no 1 mcilroy
all those indifferent rounds in florida so far this year were swept aside on friday as the northern irishman notched up five birdies in a row at one point on his way to a superb 66 at the arnold palmer invitational
it was the first time in eight rounds in the florida this year that he had broken 70 and what a way to do it
from out of the pack , the 25 year old is now bang in contention for a morale - boosting victory in his last scheduled start before his attempt to complete the career grand slam at the masters next month
mcilroy hit a second round of 66 at the arnold palmer invitational on friday it was the first time in eight rounds in florida this year that the world no 1 had broken 70 mcilroy looks to have played himself back into form ahead of the masters next month â i âm just feeling more comfortable day by day , and it was great to see a few putts finally drop , â said mcilroy , whose performance drew a glowing tribute from his good friend and playing partner , rickie fowler
â after what i saw today and the fact he âs clearly the best player in the world , he has to be the favourite for the masters , â said the american , who was pipped at the post to both the open and uspga championships last year by mcilroy
â rickie fowler was right when he said nothing appeared to be happening for mcilroy over his front nine , the inward half on the course
fowler 's good friend and playing partner rickie fowler admitted mcilroy is now favourite for the masters mcilroy had five birdies in a row in dubai earlier this year but this was the first time he had enjoyed such a run in an event on the pga tour , and it electrified the huge galleries at bay hill
mcilroy will actually begin the third round on saturday five shots behind american pacesetter , hoffman , who has played brilliantly so far to post blistering rounds of 66 and 65
but can the little - known hoffman keep it going ? the new jersey native is the same age as 25 year old mcilroy but there the comparison ends
three shots off the pace are world no 3 henrik stenson and defending champion matt every , while mcilroy is not the only big name from the uk in position to have a crack at winning this prestigious title
matt every is also in the mix , three shots behind surprise leader hoffman ian poulter is in contention at halfway after rounds of 67 and 70 put him one shot behind mcilroy for the third week out of four in florida , ian poulter is in contention at halfway , standing just a shot behind mcilroy following rounds of 67 and 70
as for that dinner with arnold palmer , mcilroy was still buzzing
