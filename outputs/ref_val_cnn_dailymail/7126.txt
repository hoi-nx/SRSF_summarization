scientists have found that playing samuel barber 's adagio for strings can calm cats and may even help them recover quicker after a visit to the vets
the scientists played two - minute bursts of classical , pop and rock music to the animals and measured their reaction while under anaesthesia
scientists have created what they say is the first species - specific music for domestic cats by replicating some of the sounds the animals produce themselves
they found that the classical music - samuel barber 's adagio for strings - made the cats more relaxed while natalie imbruglia 's torn was slightly less effective
listening to ac / dc 's thunderstruck appeared to increase the stress levels of the animals
while listening to music is known to reduce pain and stress in human patients , the study is thought to be the first to show it can also have the same impact in cats
dr carreira , a veterinary surgeon at the university of lisbon , portugal who led the study , said : ' after reading about the influence of music on physiological parameters in humans , i decided to design a study protocol to investigate whether music could have any physiological effects on my surgical patients
' the researchers played the music to 12 cats while they were undergoing neutering surgery through headphones
the rock music of ac / dc , pictured above , seemed to increase the stress experienced by cats during surgery when listening to classical music , the cats had a lower respiratory rate and smaller pupil diametre , suggesting they were more relaxed
the strings of a violin were originally thought to have been made from cat 's gut , but playing classical violin music ( above ) , such as adagio for strings , may also be the best way to calm your pet say the scientists
