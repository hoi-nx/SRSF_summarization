obama has said that young united states should be more worried about climate change than whether smoking pot was legal
the united states president said the legalization of marijuana should come at the bottom of a long list of priorities for youths which also included the economy , war and peace
young people , i understand this is important to you , but you should be thinking about climate change , the economy , jobs , war and peace - maybe way at the bottom you should be thinking about marijuana
but obama said that the united states justice system was ' skewed ' towards non-violent drug offenders and the ' disproportionate ' prison sentence came at the huge cost to communities and the state
the president has come out in favour of decriminalization as a way to tackle the skewed system but said he felt that the issue was very separate from encouraging people to use marijuana he added that he felt ' encouraged ' by the numbers of politicians , including conservative republicans , who were beginning to see the cost of keeping the drug illegal did n't add up
obama has been very open about his past experimentation with drugs and alcohol in high school
in 2006 , then a new hampshire democratic presidential candidate , obama was asked about his use of marijuana
' obama also suggested that if medical marijuana was the best way to relieve pain and suffering then it was something he would be open to
' but while he appeared to take steps towards decriminalization , obama warned legalization was n't a ' panacea ' and there will still many who had concerns about the drug 's affect on society
punishment for people found in possession of the drug currently depends on the location they were caught
