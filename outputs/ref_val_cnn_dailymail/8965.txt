a picture is definitely worth a thousand words , especially in this mesmerising new time - lapse video showing a century of beauty in korea
in the latest 100 years of beauty film , model tiffany lee is given makeovers showcasing the trends of each decade between 1910 and 2010
in 1945 , korea was divided into two spheres of influence , during which united states controlled korea , and russia installed a communist regime in north korea , later surrendering power to china
under the japan colonial rule , north korea preferred to emulate japan beauty trends , which in the twenties included pinned hair and fresh - faced make - up in the 1930s , korea was still very much emulating japan beauty trends , such as matte red lips and hats the video is the latest in a series by cut.com , which created two demonstrations of 100 years of united states beauty as well as a film that revealed the dramatic changes in female beauty in iran over the last century
the latest installment in the series reveals how korea 's trends continued in line with the western beauty after the second world war and beyond
the united states trend of finger curls were worn by style - conscious north korea women in the forties in the fifties , korea is divided into two states - the trends reflect that united states controlled the korea , and russia created a communist state in north korea by the time it was the swinging sixties made it to korea , the divide between the beauty norms in the neighbouring countries was obvious
the korea , very much focused on capitalism , appropriating glamorous trends from the united states or japan
on the other hand , the looks for north korea women of the same time involves wearing wearing a bandanna , synonymous with labourers at the time
the sixties shows a wide disparity in beauty ideals , with korea looking to united states trends and the north sticking with communist ideologies north korea 's communist regime meant that women were encouraged to be labourers
this is what was considered beautiful at the time and propaganda from the time emphasised this while north korea focuses on women as labourers and providers , korea follows united states trends freely this portrayal was created by the communist ideologies in the north : propaganda at the time highlighted the belief that dressed - down , healthy and hardworking women were considered beautiful
the seventies similarly saw korea following united states trends , as the model showcases garish earrings , a stylish bandanna , winged eyeliner and a beehive
the noughties saw the korea continue on its glamorous trajectory while the north was slowly recovering from the famine and laid a focus on nuclear weaponry and industry in the 2010s , north korea has shown gradual social progress and freedom for women , shown by tiffany 's increased use of make - up and accessories
this is shown in the video where the noughties continue on its glamorous trajectory , but tiffany in north korea sees a return to the days where women sport military gear
