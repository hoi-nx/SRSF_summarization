i just loved seeing danny welbeck celebrate his goal
goalscoring is why we play / watch / support â and it âs a while since danny welbeck scored one ! manchester united did nât want to keep him , he left for arsenal and here he was back at old trafford scoring a predatory winner
danny welbeck rounded de gea to score arsenal 's winner against manchester united danny welbeck latched on to an weak pass from antonio valencia to take the ball past de gea and score danny welbeck ( left ) celebrated his goal at old trafford despite the fact he used to play for manchester united of course he should enjoy it
before his goal , watching danny welbeck for an hour was awkward tv
the poor lad must be thinking : what am i doing here ? louis van gaal did not use striker falcao to rescue the game against arsenal at old trafford michael carrick ( right ) was brought on at half - time but colombia forward falcao was unused i know he is not the player manchester united thought they were getting , but is nât it down to the manager to get the best out of him ? goalscorers change games but instead they chased the match with daley blind and michael carrick , two sitting midfielders , on the pitch
the defending from manchester united for arsenal âs first goal was unbelievable ! yes , it was a fantastic goal for arsenal but the defending from manchester united was scandalous.that âs not about tactics , that âs players needing to tackle
three manchester united players failed to stop oxlade-chamberlain as he ran at them and antonio valencia â who was playing at right back â turned his back on the arsenal player
nacho monreal wheels away to celebrate scoring arsenal 's first goal against manchester united at old trafford oxlade-chamberlain breezed through the manchester united defence to provide an assist for the monreal goal you can not do that
santi cazorla ( second right ) was in inspirational form as arsenal secured a place in the fa cup semi-final he does nât crash into tackles , but he has a different type of courage ; courage on the ball
is he being overcoached ? what has happened to the marauding full back who played with such freedom for southampton ? he is only 19 and he will come again , but the player manchester united signed for Â£ 30million would hit crosses on the run and did his best work at the top end of the pitch
luke shaw did n't enjoy his best night for manchester united and has struggled to recapture his southampton form maroune fellaini 's tireless work for manchester united made him one of their standout players against arsenal he is going to be a star , but when you consider how nathaniel clyne is developing , why is nât luke shaw doing the same ? he is a young man , who has had his injuries , but he is struggling and was taken off at half - time in a reshuffle that ultimately did nât pay off
it is strange watching manchester united and when their best player is maroune fellaini then it shows where they are
i âm not a maroune fellaini fan , but he is working hard and looks the player most likely to get them out of this hole
