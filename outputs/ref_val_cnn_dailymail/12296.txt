in it , fraternity members from your university are chanting a hateful , racist song about lynching african - americans
you 're president of the university
imagine being in that situation
as most everyone knows by now , boren , president of the university of oklahoma , faced just this situation monday
and i 've been thinking about it intensely , not only because i care about race and civic leadership in u.s. , but also because boren was my first boss , when he was a u.s. senator
i 'm not from oklahoma but ended up working for boren through a college internship
boren responded to the crisis swiftly , with a statement that went viral
boren told the students from sae ( sae ) he had a message for them : " you are disgraceful
you should not have the privilege of calling yourselves sooners " ( the university of oklahoma nickname )
boren went on to sever all ties between university of oklahoma and sae
later , boren said he 'd be glad if the students in the video left campus because " we do n't provide student services for bigots
on social media , people shocked by the video find themselves also stunned by boren 's response
why ? because he did something rare in public life today
he expressed a decisive , judgmental view with moral clarity
some question whether boren has the legal authority , as head of a public institution , to expel students on the basis of their free speech , even racist hate speech
boren was n't just condemning wrongdoers ; he was shifting social norms for all
a cynic might consider laughable a refrain from boren 's statement about " real sooners
" boren said that real sooners are not racists or bigots ; they believe in equal opportunity , treat people with mutual respect and love each other like family
but the point of boren 's " real sooners " riff is not to describe or sanitize today 's reality ; it is to issue a challenge
boren can now examine the institution he works for and ask how and why such attitudes and behaviors -- racism so casually vicious -- could ever take root among people as young as freshmen
he can explore the ways in which everyone -- not only the obviously guilty parties at a frat party -- is touched by unconscious bias and institutional racism
but you do n't have to be a college president or a ceo
