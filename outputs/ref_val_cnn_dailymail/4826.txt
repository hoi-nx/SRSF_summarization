the supreme court has given a former ups driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duties while she was pregnant
on a 6 - 3 vote , the justices on wednesday revived peggy young 's discrimination claim against ups and sent the case back to a lower court
peggy young ( pictured in december last year ) , a virginia woman who lost her ups job because she became pregnant , speaks to reporters outside the supreme court in dc , dc. the supreme court is giving the former ups driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duty when she was pregnant but the company changed its policy as of january and said it now tries to accommodate pregnant workers
the justices gave young another chance to litigate whether ups should have granted her request for temporary changes in work duties - she asked not to lift heavier packages - after she became pregnant in 2006
breyer said the lower court failed to consider the effects of ups policies that covered non-pregnant workers who might have disabilities , injuries or otherwise might need accommodations , and asked , ' why , when the employer accommodated so many , could it not accommodate pregnant women as well ? ' breyer said there is a ' genuine dispute as to whether ups provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation can not reasonably be distinguished from young 's '
courts must now re-examine young 's case with a more accepting view of the discrimination claim
young , who worked at a maryland facility , had acted on a midwife 's advice that she not be required to lift packages weighing more than 20 pounds ( 9 kg )
young , now 43 , said she dealt almost exclusively with overnight letters , but ups said its drivers must be able to lift packages weighing up to 70 pounds
the justices found in young 's favor on wednesday
