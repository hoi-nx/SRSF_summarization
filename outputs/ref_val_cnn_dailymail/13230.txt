it 's a controversial question that 's sparked debate since officials revealed the identity of the masked man known as jihadi john
was mohammed emwazi , the man with a british accent who 's appeared in numerous isis beheading videos , pushed toward extremism by authorities ? or was he someone who 'd long been heading down a militant path ? a london - based advocacy group that worked with mohammed emwazi says emails he sent them paint a picture of a desperate man hounded by authorities who saw his plans for a new life crumble as he tried unsuccessfully to get help
and a report from the daily mail , also citing emails purportedly sent from emwazi to the british publication , said the kuwait - born london saw himself as a " dead man walking " and contemplated suicide because of his alleged harassment by authorities
" you ca n't start the story at how he 's been treated by british officials
you certainly ca n't start the story from the email trail , " said rashad ali , director at the counterextremism consultancy centri and a fellow of the institute of strategic dialogue
well , because he was part of a group of a people who were going to join shabaab -- a very extremist organization and jihadist group that got involved in horrific terrorist attacks in somalia
" mohammed emwazi felt he was being harassed by authorities and tried to seek legal help to stop it , according to cage , the human rights and muslim advocacy organization that worked with him
one email details mohammed emwazi 's account of his detention at a british airport , when authorities stopped him from traveling to kuwait in 2010 and questioned him for hours
when i asked for their names they said ' we do n't give out our names
' " mohammed emwazi wrote that the way he was treated by british security and intelligence officials reminded him " of criminals that you see on tv who have committed a serious crime , only i was a person never charged or arrested for anything
" in the british , he was n't arrested once , prosecuted or cautioned whatsoever
" british authorities have not responded to cnn 's requests for comment on the case
in the emails , mohammed emwazi pleaded for cage 's help
" please help me as i do n't want to stay in the british because i have found a job in kuwait , found a spouse in kuwait and thus found a new start for my life in kuwait
i just want to go their and start my new life again ! ! " mohammed emwazi wrote that he had also made a formal complaint at the ipcc , before going into detail about how he was apparently " assaulted by the police officer " as he attempted to leave for kuwait
" details from court papers reported in british media paint a different picture
they say mohammed emwazi was part of a group of extremists sometimes called the " north london boys " who allegedly funneled money and recruits to shabaab
analysts who 've studied isis recruiting say they are n't buying the argument that harassment from authorities turned mohammed emwazi into " jihadi john
" rashad ali argued that abuse at the hands of officials is not an excuse for terrorism
the daily mail published excerpts from those exchanges , including mohammed emwazi 's description of an incident where he tried to sell his laptop through a website , but only stated his surname
mohammed emwazi 's concerns bordered on paranoia , verkaik wrote , and he desperately wanted his story to be told
