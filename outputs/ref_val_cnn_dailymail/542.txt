dna molecules extracted from fish sperm is being used to develop new types of flame retardant materials
and in a series of experiments , the researchers coated cloth in the dna from herring sperm cells and found it converts to a ceramic - like material when exposed to extreme heat
cotton layered with dna molecules resists burning as the genetic material forms a ceramic - like coating over the fabric , shown in the bottom image in the photograph above , while untreated cotton will burn readily ( top ) this char - like foam then helps to prevent the flames from catching alight on the material
researchers behind the work believe dna could provide a natural and environmentally - friendly way of protecting fabrics from fire
currently many materials including furniture , such as sofas , are coated in chemical flame retardants that have been found to be accumulating in the environment and have been linked to infertility , cancers and birth defects
' this means that it possesses some flame retardant features that could be exploited for conferring fire resistance to fabrics and also to low melting plastics
writing in the journal polymer , he and his colleagues said : ' we have explored its flame retardant activity by applying as a surface coating on cotton fabrics and observed that on exposure to heat , the dna was able to form a foamed char on the surface of the fabric
researchers behind the work believe dna could provide a natural and environmentally - friendly way of protecting fabrics from fire
for the study they used dna extracted from the sperm of herring ( pictured above ) to protect pieces of cotton the images above show cotton coated with dna before burning ( b and c ) and after it has burned ( d and e )
the water also combines with phosphoric acid created from the phosphate groups that form part of the backbone of the dna molecule to create a flame retardant residue
nitrogen in each of the dna bases also form ammonia when heated - another flame retardant
dr jenny alongi , a researcher also at the polytechnic university of turin who has been working on the study with professor malucelli , said dna appeared to become intumescent at relatively low temperatures compared to other fire retardant materials
sperm cells , shown above approaching an egg , could provide dna for use in future flame retardant materials in cells dna binds itself together to form chromosomes ( shown above ) but when heated it rapidly denatures she said : ' this may be the reason for the dna high fire retardant effectiveness particularly when dna is layered onto polymer surface
' the researchers also recently found that some proteins found in biological cells have similar fire resistant properties - raising the prospect of a new generation of biological flame retardants .
