the britain crew of the new james bond film triggered an international air safety alert by going on a drunken rampage aboard the official 007 jet
last night , the producers of the forthcoming spectre film confirmed that they were investigating the ' intimidatory and frightening ' behaviour on board the privately chartered plane flying from stansted airport in essex to mexico city 11 days ago
last night , a worker at toluca airport in mexico city said the mayhem had left the interior of the plane looking like a ' pack of wild animals ' had gone through it
the producers of the forthcoming spectre film , starring monica bellucci and craig , confirmed that they were investigating the ' intimidatory and frightening ' behaviour he also claimed the airline had to bring in a specialist firm to clean the plane at a cost of 20,000 pesos â about Â£ 1,000
about 150 of the film 's crew , including cameramen , technicians and stunt men , were on their way to mexico city to film some of the most spectacular action sequences , including one that takes place during mexico city 's macabre day of the dead festival
hi fly , which has told eon that its staff breached the conditions of the charter , will deploy extra security at the airport to ensure that no passengers arrive drunk for the jet 's return journey to the britain on wednesday
the privately chartered plane ( pictured ) was flying from stansted airport in essex to mexico city 11 days ago members of the film crew removed a safety pin from one of the aircraft 's doors - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage eon , led by michael and his stepsister barbara , have now told staff that the flight will be ' dry '
however , in a twist worthy of the james bond films , it is unclear whether the us watchdog , the faa , is investigating the incident
the faa has some jurisdiction over international airspace around the us , which could have been passed through by the 007 film crew 's flight
but the mail on sunday understands that michael and barbara read the riot act to staff at a production meeting held shortly after the plane 's arrival in mexico city
it is understood that neither craig ( pictured ) nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet some of the film 's crew vomited and urinated in the aisles and verbally abused cabin crew - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage ' the behaviour of a handful of crew members got out of hand and made things very unpleasant for their fellow passengers
' airline expert chris yates said last night that ' it was entirely possible ' that the removal of the safety pin could have caused the door to open
