however , the 22 - year - old former british boys champion narrowly failed to chip in from the edge of the green on the 17th and then dropped his only shot of the day on the last after finding a bunker off the tee
otaegui made an impressive nine birdies in his round of 62 , and came close to going under 60 the resulting 62 gave the world number 403 a halfway total of 11 under par , two shots ahead of south africa 's merrick bremner , who birdied four of his last six holes to add a 66 to his opening 65
merrick bremner 's compatriots keith horne and trevor fisher jnr , who won the africa open on sunday , were a shot further back on eight under alongside england 's david horsey and italy 's edoardo molinari
