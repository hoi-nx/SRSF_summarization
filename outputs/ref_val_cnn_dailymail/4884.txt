farage was today condemned as an attention seeker for calling for race discrimination laws to be scrapped and claiming some muslims in british ' hate us and want to kill us '
the ukip leader became embroiled in a race row after first suggesting in a tv interview that laws against discrimination should be scrapped , before trying to claim that he never discussed race at all
david cameron said the remarks were ' deeply concerning ' and labour accused mr farage of wanting to go back to the days when firms put up signs saying ' no blacks , no dogs , no irish '
would there be a law against discrimination on the grounds of race or colour ? ' farage : ' no. we are colour blind
we as a party are colour blind
' in a channel 4 documentary , mr farage claimed concern over preventing racial discrimination in employment ' would probably have been valid ' 40 years ago and he would get rid of ' much of ' existing legislation
setting out the case for scrapping race laws , mr farage said : ' i think the situation that we now have , where an employer is not allowed to choose between a british - born person and somebody from poland , is a ludicrous state of affairs
' prime minister david cameron used twitter to issue a public condemnation of mr farage 's comments labour leader miliband said the comments were ' wrong , dangerous and divisive ' while lib dem clegg accused mr farage of ' instilling fear ' mr farage was speaking in an interview with ex-equalities watchdog chief trevor phillips for a channel 4 documentary , things we wo n't say about race that are true , due to be broadcast next week
' the remarks sparked a furious row , with political opponents accusing the ukip leader of fuelling racial tensions
mr david cameron said : ' farage is attention seeking
' labour leader miliband said the comments were ' wrong , dangerous and divisive '
' labour mp sadiq khan called the comments ' one of the most shocking things i have ever heard ' , suggesting mr farage wanted to take british back to the days when shops displayed signs reading ' no blacks , no irish ' lib dem clegg accused mr farage of ' instilling fear ' by conflating problems like violent extremism and sharia law with the issue of employment legislation
' when my parents moved to london they frequently saw signs saying ' no blacks , no dogs , no irish ' : what ukip is suggesting would take us back to those days
' a ukip spokesperson said : ' we do n't think there 's anything controversial in what farage has said , at least not [ for ] the vast majority of the country
' ukip is the only party that is suggesting that british 's employers should be free to employ british workers , regardless of creed or colour
it was n't that long ago that the labour called for ' british jobs for british workers '
