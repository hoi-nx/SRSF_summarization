united have been heavily criticised by former liverpool star molby , as the playmaker adds fuel to fire ahead of the crucial clash in the race for the champions league places
the ex-danish international is very much a favourite at his former employers and was keen to play up liverpool 's chances of pipping united to fourth
molby gave a scathing review on louis van gaal 's side and has described their position in the champions league places as a ' miracle
' molby labelled united as ' clueless ' and thinks it 's a ' miracle ' where they are in the table he told the daily star : ' i 've seen a lot of united 's matches this season and i find it quite amazing they are in the top four
louis van gaal and wayne rooney wo n't be pleased with molby 's comments ahead of the clash ' but having an excellent keeper and not conceding many goals has enabled them to paper over the cracks and win games narrowly
