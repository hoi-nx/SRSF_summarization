common sense would suggest that when molten lava meets a sheet of ice it will simply melt through
but geologist professor jeff karson and artist professor bob wysocki from syracuse university in ny found that the results can be far more spectacular
using a lava furnace to heat gravel to temperatures of more than 1,100 Â° c ( 2,000 â° f ) they were able to pour it onto a slab of ice to produce a seething , bubbling mass of molten rock
lava turns ice directly into steam which bubbles up through the molten rock to form bizarre glass bubbles professor jeff karson , who has been pouring lava in a series of experiments to better understand how it behaves and forms geological formations , described it as ' scrambled eggs from hell '
steam from the ice below bubbles up through the molten rock as it tries to escape , forming a layer of glassy bubbles
the lava flows rapidly across the surface of the ice on a cushion of escaping steam it creates as it moves ' as the lava cools we start to get a thick black layer forming on top and that starts to trap those bubbles of superheated steam inside the rock
