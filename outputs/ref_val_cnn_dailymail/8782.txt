a tooth belonging to a peking man â an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades
it was found in one of 40 forgotten boxes at the museum of evolution at uppsala university , sweden , allowing scientists to re-examine it using modern techniques
from wear - and - tear on the canine tooth , they say that the individual it belonged to was quite old when she died and probably gnawed on bones and crunched on hard nuts
a tooth belonging to the peking man â an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago - has been re-discovered after being lost for decades in an unopened box in a museum fossils , including a number of teeth , were found in caves in zhoukoudian near beijing in the 1920s , but most of the pieces were lost in the chaos of world war two
the tooth surfaced in 2011 in a box that had never been unpacked or studied since it was shipped from chinese in the 1920s
the tooth indicates that peking man ( a bust is pictured ) gnawed on bones and ate nuts two chinese palaeontologists , liu wu and tong haowen from the institute of vertebrate palaeontology and palaeoanthropology ( ivpp ) in beijing have now examined the tooth and it has at last been described in the journal acta anthropologica sinica
they quickly determined that it was a canine tooth from a peking man
â the crown of the tooth is relatively small , which indicates that it belonged to a woman
â the tooth is quite worn , so the individual must have been quite old when she died
â dr ahlberg told mailonline the woman may have been between 30 and 40 years old when she died , which was a ripe age at the time
the very first samples of the prehistoric ancestor were found by otto zdansky from uppsala university in the 1920s and are on show alongside a third tooth discovered in the 1950s , at the museum
peking man , an ancient human ancestor lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago
examination of a tooth now shows that the species ate nuts and meat with wear and tear indicating he gnawed on bones
