nasa 's tractor - trailer sized dawn spacecraft spacecraft will snuggle up to ceres on friday , getting close enough to be pulled into orbit and to complete the first mission to a dwarf planet
" i 'm just delighted that dawn spacecraft is now on the doorstep of ceres , " jim green , director of nasa 's planetary science division said in a news conference on monday
dawn spacecraft is expected to begin orbiting ceres around 7:20 a.m. et , but nasa says it may take an hour or two to confirm it
ceres was discovered in 1801 ( pluto was n't found until 1930 ) and was the first object found in our solar system 's main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter
it 's about 310 million miles from earth and was initially classified as planet , then later demoted to an asteroid , only to be reclassified again as a dwarf planet
the early images from dawn spacecraft already have mission scientists excited
" ceres has really surprised us , " said carol raymond , dawn spacecraft 's deputy principal investigator
" one of the puzzles -- two bright white spots that showed up in photographs taken by dawn spacecraft in february
herschel 's scientists also said their research showed ceres has an atmosphere
scientists expect to learn more as dawn spacecraft is gradually lowered to about 235 miles above the surface of ceres in december
being round is very important because it is the main characteristic of a planet -- a title that ceres had -- then lost
but it was bumped up to a dwarf planet when that category was created in 2006
according to the iau -- the group that came up with the definition -- a dwarf planet is similar to the eight main planets ( mercury , venus , earth , mars , jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune ) except it has a lot of other stuff orbiting with it around the sun. the iau recognizes five dwarf planets : eris , pluto , ceres , makemake and haumea
on friday , dawn spacecraft will make its closest approach yet to ceres , flying about 25,000 miles from it , according to robert mase , project manager for the dawn spacecraft at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california
dawn spacecraft will stay in orbit around ceres for years , even after its primary mission ends in june 2016
between now and then -- mission managers hope dawn spacecraft will help solve the mysteries of ceres and add to our knowledge of how our solar system formed .
