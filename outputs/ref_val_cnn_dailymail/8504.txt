aircraft in the future could feature three decks , generate their own power and be 75 per cent quieter than current aircraft , according to designs for new concept plane
the progress eagle would have capacity for around 800 passengers and would run on hydrogen fuel rather than the high - grade aircraft fossil fuels used today
capacity : 800 passengers wingspan : 96m length : 80m decks : 3 engines : five superconductive engines other features : solar panels on wings and rear engine that doubles as wind turbine once it reaches the right altitude , however , the central engine turns off and starts to generate electricity from the airflowing through it
solar panels would also help to generate electrical power that the aircraft uses while it is in flight
mr viã±als said that the aircraft would produce zero carbon emissions and would also be far quieter than current airliners
the awwa-qg progress eagle has solar panels on its wings and carries air turbines to allow it to generate its own energy while in flight the huge 96 metre wide wingspan may cause problems when maneuvering on the ground in airports but mr viã±als says the wings may fold mr viã±als said : ' the progress eagle is based in the technology beyond 2030 with ideas from quantum mechanics , if we consider the evolution of current technology and future progress in uses of theoretical physics solutions
' this is the second concept aircraft designed by mr viã±als - last year he released designs for the sky whale , with a wingspan of 88m
