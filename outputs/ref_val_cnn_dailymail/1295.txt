a schoolboy who says he was so overweight and unfit he looked ' like a tomato ' after pe lessons decided to put himself on a diet - and shed almost three stone
owen , 12 , weighed 10st 8lb ( 67kg ) last summer and says he was embarrassed by his size , and because he got so red and sweaty after exercise
he begged his mother to let him join her on a diet so he was fit enough to play football with his friends
owen , 12 , weighed 10st 8lbs ( left ) and was embarrassed as he was so unfit he looked ' like a tomato ' after a pe lesson
he decided to put himself on a diet , and managed to lose nearly three stone ( right ) owen lost weight by giving up biscuits , chocolate bars and sausage rolls and instead snacking on yogurts , homemade scotch eggs , cucumber and carrot sticks his efforts inspired his mother , michelle hatfield , to re-evaluate the food she was feeding her family , as she did n't realise her son was overweight in the first place
the 33 - year - old has now swapped convenience foods ans takeaways for meals made from scratch , crediting the change on her son 's desire to be healthier
owen , from leicester , said : ' i was a bit lazy before losing weight and did n't enjoy sport that much
' i remember hating it because i 'd get really tired and i 'd look like a tomato after pe but that 's all changed now
' i never used to enjoy pe and felt a bit left out but now that 's all changed
owen 's efforts made ms michelle hatfield realise it was the food she fed him that made him pile on the pounds
she said : ' it all started when i decided i wanted to lose some weight on a slimming world plan and went home to tell the family that i was going to change my diet
' it did n't take long for owen to ask if he could join me
' one afternoon , owen came over to me and asked if he could change his diet too
' before he lost weight , owen 's bmi meant he was obese
after losing weight ( pictured left and right ) , he has a bmi in the healthy range owen swapped chocolate and sausage rolls for low fat yoghurts and cucumber and carrot sticks
he is now able to play football with his friends , and plays for up to an hour a day ms michelle hatfield , who dropped from 13st 8lbs ( 86kg ) to 11st 1lbs ( 70kg ) at the same time as owen said she never saw her son as being overweight
he 's my son and you just do n't look at your children like that
ms michelle hatfield said : ' owen made me realise how irresponsible i 'd been with the food i was buying ' ' that moment when he asked if he could join me at slimming world finally made me realise how irresponsible i 'd been with the food i was buying in
' i 'm really proud of owen because he did this all on his own back and it 's inspired me to think differently about the food i put on the table
' he was n't pushed to lose weight at any stage , he 's just got his head down and done it
' even though i was initially pretty ashamed of myself , i could n't be any more proud of owen
' now when i take him to the supermarket , he 's out looking for muller light rather than chocolate trifles ! ' owen added : ' my attitude towards food has completely changed too
' owen 's dad , lee clarke , has also noticed his son 's remarkable transformation when he cares for him at weekends
