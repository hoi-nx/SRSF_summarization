a mother was horrified when she opened a bag of tesco bananas and discovered something deadly lurking inside
the fruit was infested with eggs of the brazilian wandering spider , the world âs most venomous spider , which can kill a human in under an hour
layton , 43 , said the eggs started to hatch after she opened the bag for her daughter siri , six , so she immediately put the whole lot into a sealed container
the bite of the brazilian wandering spider can also give a man a painful four - hour erection â its venom is currently being studied for use in erectile dysfunction treatments
the bananas , shipped from costa rica , had been bought at a tesco store in pontardawe , south wales , by mrs layton âs husband and taken to their home in bristol
mrs layton said : â siri asked for a banana
the spiders ' nest may have been exported with the bananas , which were shipped to the supermarket from costa rica â i was so scared â i do nât like spiders at the best of times , but have read about the brazilian wandering spider and was very frightened about the potential threat
â shocked by the possible danger to siri and her three - year - old sister , phoebe , mrs layton contacted tesco customer services , which told her to take the bananas , deadly spiders and all , back to the store â so that the barcode could be scanned and the store could refund her money
â a tesco spokesman said : â our policy is for the customer to take the product to the store where it can be investigated
â we âve apologised to mrs layton and offered a gesture of goodwill
we âve asked her to return the product to our store so we can conduct a full investigation
last october a family found a lethal brazilian wandering spider among their waitrose bananas
meanwhile a mother - of - one from colchester , essex , had to incinerate her vacuum cleaner in september after a cocoon on one of her tesco bananas burst , sending eggs flying on to the floor
their greek name brazilian wandering spider actually means ' murderess ' - an indication of their deadly bite
