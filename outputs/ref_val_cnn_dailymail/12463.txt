the image of the braided kurdish female fighter , donning military camouflage and taking up arms against the militant group isis , may have done more to promote the kurdish cause in the west than anything else in recent years
now , with soccer moms in middle america tweeting photos of kurdish female fighters , western governments may find it harder to explain their tepid kurdish policies to their constituencies
jacob russell 's sensitive photo essay brings much - needed nuance to the recent proliferation of images of kurdish female fighters
images of smiling young female fighters brandishing weapons with a hint of glamour ( " girls with guns , " as jacob russell calls this type of portrayal ) tend to portray more of the photographer 's assumptions about the woman 's emancipation than her actual experiences as a kurdish woman in combat
jacob russell consciously avoids this uncomplicated portrayal of female fighters
" i think that the female fighters are used quite cynically by kurdish leaders ( who ) know very well how attractive this image is to the western media
" having lived in kurdish for nearly two years , jacob russell understands that many women join the peshmerga or other kurdish forces for unglamorous reasons

the women now serve a political role , too
