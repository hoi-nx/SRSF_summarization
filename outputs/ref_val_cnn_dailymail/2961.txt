the grand slam door was slammed in ireland âs face at the millennium stadium as wales defended their patch like 15 cardiff bouncers to secure a famous six nations victory
as the welsh tackle count moved past the 250 mark , it was clear that ireland had finally met their match
wales killed off ireland âs 10 - match winning run and â describing himself as â a simple kiwi boy â in the post-match press conference â gatland proved that he is a smarter tactician than a tub of flora

â that emotion was beamed through the exquisite kicking game of full - back halfpenny
ireland âs sexton was dubbed as the player with gold - plated feet , but the celebrated no 10 did not quite live up to his billing
sexton kicked a restart straight into touch and wales were able to build up phases
all the momentum was with the hosts and , after 13 minutes , they were 12 - 0 up
â wales were building nicely but their progress was stalled by an injury to lee in the front - row
gatland breathed a sigh of relief as sexton pushed his first penalty wide of the left post , but the no 10 made amends with his second effort following a cheap high tackle by scott baldwin
the tables were there to be turned and ireland identified lee âs replacement , aaron jarvis , as a weakness at the set - piece

sexton continued to edge his side back with two more penalties â sandwiching a fine drop goal by dan biggar â but wales survived the yellow card with their half - time lead still intact
gatland was forced into more front - row changes at half - time when he lost jenkins to a hamstring injury
in a breath - taking seven minutes , the welsh defence saw off two full - blooded attacks â combining almost 50 phases â and eventually won the penalty when sexton went off his feet at the breakdown
