wales assistant coach howley has called on the six nations organisers to adopt a premier league - style format of synchronised kick - off times on the final day of competition
under current broadcasting agreements , the last round of fixtures is staggered throughout the day in a bid to maximise television audiences ; with wales facing italy in tomorrow 's early tie
with the three - way race likely to be decided by points difference , the approach gives fellow challengers ireland and england â who are up second and third â a clearer indication of their required score - line and , according to howley , lessens the entertainment value
wales assistant coach howley ( left ) wants the final round of six nations games to be sychronised ' i do really enjoy the last day of the premier league , where everyone listens to their radios to hear the scores , ' said howley
' the drama of that situation is unique and it would be unique in rugby - probably that should be the case in the six nations
they must capitalise on every attacking opportunity and , following an injury to sergio parisse , the chances of a significant winning margin have been given a major boost
he will line up against faletau but - despite being connected to real madrid superstar bale â the welshman does not share howley 's view about following football 's lead with fixture scheduling
it 's not the case this time , but it 's exciting for the players who play the first game , because they can watch the other games and wait in anticipation
if wales go on to win the championship , it will be the first time they have claimed the title outside of cardiff since 1971 , when barry john scored the winning points in a 9 - 5 victory over france at the stade yves-du-manoir
but gatland 's side are building momentum and , if results over the last two years are any indication , they will be confident of ending the 34 - year wait in the italian capital
italy will be without they skipper and talisman sergio parisse for the clash against wales in rome wales are slow starters in tournament rugby but , in 2013 and 2014 , they won their final - round tests against england and scotland by 27 and 48 points
the famous victory over england clinched the title for wales , but howley believes winning this year 's championship would be an even sweeter feeling than two years ago
performances since the opening round defeat by england have given the kiwi a settled idea of his squad but , following the long - term injury to lee , the selection saga surrounding jones looks set to rumble on
' i had a knock back in the summer , then the autumn , and again in the six nations - so it was n't premature
