rome italy 's highest court friday will consider whether to uphold the 2009 murder conviction of united states amanda marie knox , according to judge gennaro marasca
the high court judge will either uphold the murder convictions of knox and her italy ex-boyfriend , or send the case back for another appeal , or potentially on to a different section of the court
knox , a 27 - year - old seattle native , and raffaele sollecito were convicted of the 2007 killing of knox 's british roommate , meredith kercher
knox and kercher lived together in italy at the time of kercher 's death
however , italy 's supreme court overturned the acquittals in 2013 , and they were convicted last year after a retrial
but if the court upholds the conviction , the case will be closed for good -- and what happens to knox next is uncertain
the statute of limitations is double the sentence , meaning the italy have 57 years to bring her back to the country
knox , however , would benefit from the united states ' extradition treaty with italy -- under which the united states will not extradite a person who has been acquitted -- and from the united states constitution 's protection against double jeopardy
" meredith kercher , from the ivory coast , was convicted separately in a fast - track trial and is midway through a 16 - year sentence for kercher 's murder
his case was confirmed by italy 's high court in 2010
many commentators in the united states have reasoned that italy may not ask the united states for knox 's extradition because it would cause a diplomatic rift between the two nations
but there could be a greater rift if it appears that knox gets away with murder and her italy ex-boyfriend pays for the crime
if raffaele sollecito is languishing in prison and knox is sipping frappuccino in a seattle starbucks , italy will not be pleased , says capponi , an italy journalist for corriere della sera who has been covering the case since kercher was killed in 2007
the italy will say that the united states gets away with murder and it wo n't be the first time
in 2012 , italy 's highest court upheld the convictions of 23 united states ( 22 cia agents and an air force pilot ) for the kidnapping of egyptian cleric abu omar , a suspeced terrorist , from a street in milan
" knox 's case has been divisive from the start , and her supporters have come down hard on the italy judicial system
in fact , he has long suffered the impact of knox 's ardent campaigners who have mostly criticized italy from the other side of the atlantic
" knox could still beat the system , but raffaele sollecito 's game is up if the convictions are upheld , " nicola canestrini , an italy extradition lawyer familiar with both legal systems , told cnn
last summer , he held a press conference when his lawyers filed their appeal to the high court , in which his lawyer bongiorno pointed out " certain anomalies " in knox 's testimony that have nothing to do with raffaele sollecito
whether that is enough to get the high court to give raffaele sollecito another , independent chance is yet to be seen
