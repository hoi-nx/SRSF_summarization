cosby stood up to hecklers at a performance in baltimore on friday night
at one point during the show a man stood up and yelled ; ' 38 women spoke up and called you a rapist
38 women ! ' as fans of cosby screamed ' shut up ! ' at the man , he quieted the audience and spoke directly to the protester
38 women ! ' ( protesters from outside his denver show earlier this year above ) ' just remain calm , ' cosby told the audience according to the washington post
this as venues have stopped selling water during cosby 's performances , afraid someone may throw it at him during his set
this happened on the same day two more women ( above with gloria allred ) came forward to say they were drugged and raped by cosby outside the venue , over 30 protesters greeted guests as they went into the auditorium , along with two individuals who were there in support of cosby
