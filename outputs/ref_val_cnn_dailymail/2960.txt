the parents of murdered black teenager michael brown have announced their plan to file a civil suit against the city of ferguson
it comes a day after the justice department refused to prosecute wilson despite compiling a 350,000 - page report on racial profiling in the missouri city that ' led to ' michael brown 's fatal shooting at the hands of a white police officer on august 9 , 2014
' he did not have to kill michael brown , ' attorney parks said of ferguson police officer wilson
parks said the justice department report makes it clear there are ' rampant , wholesale , systemic ' problems in the ferguson police department that need to ' change soon for the safety of the citizens
the report said police in the st. louis county suburb of ferguson overwhelmingly arrested and issued citations to blacks to boost city revenues through fines and court fees , creating a culture of distrust that exploded on august 9 when wilson killed michael brown
catalyst : the justice department began the civil rights investigation following the august shooting of michael brown ( left ) , an unarmed black 18 - year - old , by white police officer wilson ( right ) justice department staff interviewed hundreds of average citizens as part of the six - month probe , concluding that a large portion of ferguson 's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were african americans ' let me be clear , this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the ferguson police department or in any department in the city of ferguson , ' the city 's mayor james knowles said at the conference
the justice department investigation into ferguson police began immediately after michael brown 's killing in august
not tolerated : ferguson mayor james knowles announced the firing of one police department employee identified among those who sent racist emails according to figures recorded between 2012 and 2014 , blacks were also twice as likely to be searched than whites during traffic stops , though contraband showed up more during searches of white drivers
a st. louis county grand jury declined to indict wilson , who has since left the police department .
