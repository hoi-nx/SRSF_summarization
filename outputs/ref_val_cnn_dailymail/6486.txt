he said : â if this had been any other artist , it [ the listed status ] would have been laughed out of the chambers
' mr possee said he could fight the decision , but that would mean him spending his own money to launch a case at the high court
mr possee said he has had ' substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork ' â they just said â you ca nât put that on there â and i was threatened with a fine
' he added : ' i think it deserves to stay in cheltenham , but obviously it is difficult to re-render a house that has that artwork on it
â mr possee has even been targeted by men posing as â millionaire architects â trying to buy the building , who turned out to be frauds

' seeing the banksy for the first time when he returned from holiday in april 2014 , mr possee said he thought it was â quite nice â and liked the new addition before the problems began .
