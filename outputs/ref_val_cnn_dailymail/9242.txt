plastic doll lammily - who was created as an antidote to barbie 's super-slim frame - is being used to teach us about our bikini body obsession
the brown - haired figure confronts her fears on a trip to the beach and sees other women there with flaws and scars , making her realise that no one 's perfect
in the advert lammily is constantly faced with adverts which tell her she can lose weight quickly - the same images women see in real life the doll is initially seen with red cheeks when she gets to the beach because she is embarrassed by her bikini body however when she finally heads to the beach average lammily realises that everyone there has their own issues
the dolls creator nickolay lamm , a digital artist who majored in marketing at the university of pittsburgh , said of making the ad : ' i was thinking about how lammily , in the fashion doll world , would feel very out of place
' lammily also looks at magazines which ask her ' are you beach ready ? ' when lammily sees the other dolls on the beach she soon realises that they all have their issues with their bodies lammily was first created in 2014 as the result of a crowd - funding project
' if you buy a lammily doll then you can buy stickers to go on her - for example these stretch mark stickers which show the marks many women have on their bodies lammily has stretch marks herself which she proudly shows off as she djs a party on the beach for her friends
