but a few weeks ago i was invited to a photoshoot to give my verdict on a new range of suede clothing â apparently , the must - have fabric this season , as we experience a seventies revival
i did nât know i was about to try out a garment that has since fuelled a major fashion debate and divided britain âs women , who , it seems , all have an opinion on that skirt , as it is now known
â yet when i spotted it a few weeks ago , it was just one of several suede garments hanging on a rail , so i had the chance to judge it in an unbiased and objective way
i found the suede stiff and heavy , and the colour and shape channelled the seventies cowgirl look a little too closely for comfort
some fashions are best left unrevisited and this length and shape of suede skirt seemed one of them
soon after that , all hell broke loose as various fashionistas were spotted wearing the skirt
it was photographed on the lithe and youthful hips of people who know a lot more about fashion than me â first alexa chung , then socialite olivia palermo at new york fashion week , both of whom obviously liked it enough to happily endorse it
alexa chung ( pictured ) was spotted in the m&s skirt in february this year well , i can be as easily influenced as anyone , and a horrible guilt crept over me that i had nât spotted this as the wonder garment everyone else had
i wondered : should i rush out and grab one from m&s ? well , not much point , as it wo nât be on sale to us ordinary punters until april 10
yesterday , daily mail columnist sarah vine was one of the first to shout â emperor âs new clothes ! â when she criticised m&s for its aggressive marketing of the skirt , which , she felt â correctly in my view â seemed to use a lot of energy that could have been better focused on producing affordable fashion that does nât follow any trend
â just because a couple of voguettes have given it their stamp of approval , we loyal m&s customers are meant to flock like good little style sheep to get our hands on one , too , â she said
â ca nât m&s see how patronising this is ? â for this suede skirt did nât work in the seventies and it does nât really work now
sorry , m&s , i âm giving it just three out of five : wearable for a few outings , after which it would be confined to the back of my wardrobe , never to be worn again
updated classic jane asher ( pictured ) loved this flattering suede dress from h&m , finding the whole outfit comfortable and well fitting , without the stiffness of some other suede garments wraparound suede dress , Â£ 199.99 , hm.com suede block - heeled sandals , Â£ 129 , reiss.com bangle , Â£ 39 , reiss.com button diamond ring , Â£ 210 , monicavinader.com my favourite : it âs an excellent price and a beautiful and flattering berry colour , which suits most skin tones
5/5 should you fake it ? the suede culottes jane asher is sporting here did not get a good review with the stiff fabric and odd shape granting them a paltry 2/5 tweed top , Â£ 129 , baukjen.com suedette culottes , Â£ 24.99 , hm.com heels , Â£ 225 , russellandbromley.co.uk no ! no ! no ! culottes tend to look stiff and oddly shaped unless they âre made in a fluid fabric
if i wanted some suede trousers i âd save up for a better design
