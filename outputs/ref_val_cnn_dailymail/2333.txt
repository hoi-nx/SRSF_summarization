utah became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when the governor signed a law on monday approving the method when no lethal injection drugs were available , even though he called it ' a little bit gruesome '
utah is a capital punishment state and needs a backup execution method in case a shortage of the drugs persists , gary herbert governor gary herbert said
' we regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty , and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued , ' the governor 's spokesman said
utah became the only state to allow firing squads for executions when governor gary herbert signed a law monday approving the method for use when no lethal injection drugs are available however , enforcing death sentences is ' the obligation of the executive branch '
the governor 's office noted that other states allow execution methods other than lethal injection

and an oklahoma law would allow the state to use firing squads if lethal injections are ever declared unconstitutional
utah 's new approval of firing squads carries no such legal caveat and represents the latest example of frustration over botched executions and the difficulty of obtaining lethal injection drugs as manufacturers opposed to capital punishment have made them off - limits to prisons
the bill 's sponsor , republican rep. republican of clearfield , argued that a team of trained marksmen is faster and more decent than the drawn - out deaths involved when lethal injections go awry - or even if they go as planned
though utah 's next execution is probably a few years away , republican said wants to settle on a backup method now so authorities are not racing to find a solution if the drug shortage drags on
opponents of the measure say firing squads are barbaric , with the american civil liberties union of utah saying the bill makes the state ' look backward and backwoods
' utah lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of firing squad in 2004 , saying the method attracted intense media interest and took attention away from victims

randy gardner of salt lake city said monday that he does n't condone his brother 's actions , but he opposes the death penalty and said firing squads make the state look bad
the other utah death row inmate who could be next up for execution , carter , has chosen lethal injection
under this new law , carter would get the firing squad if the state ca n't get their hands on lethal injection drugs 30 days before
