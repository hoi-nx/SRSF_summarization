according to the cdc , that 's the human toll from antibiotic - resistant " superbugs " each year in the united states
to fight the growing problem of infections that ca n't be treated , the administration of president barack obama is implementing a five - year national action plan at a cost of $ 1.2 billion
those funds , part of the president 's 2015 budget , which must still be approved by congress , would nearly double the amount of federal money allocated to the fight
the plan calls for creating a " one - health " approach to testing and reporting superbugs around the country , as well as establishing a dna database of resistant bacteria
research for new antibiotics and vaccines will accelerate
the plan calls for two new options for people , and three for animals , by 2020
the plan calls for a 50 % reduction in inappropriate antibiotic use in doctor 's offices and a 20 % reduction in hospital use by 2020
" a recent survey of 796 health care professionals found 63 % of the sample prescribed antibiotics when they were n't absolutely necessary , at least 10 % of the time
" another part of the plan pledges to eliminate the widespread use of antibiotics to boost the growth of animals raised for food
" what we hoped for in the plan was a commitment from fda to identify which antibiotic uses other than growth promotion need to be changed
" " with 80 % of the antibiotics produced in the united states being used in agriculture mostly for prevention , " said louise slaughter , d - new york , who has an alternate proposal in front of congress , " any meaningful solution to the looming antibiotic resistance crisis must begin with limits on the farm
