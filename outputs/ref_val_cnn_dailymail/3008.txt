rings of gas and dust are known to encircle saturn , jupiter , uranus , and neptune
now astronomers have detected a possible ring system around a second centaur , chiron , suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought
scientists have detected a possible saturn - like ring system ( pictured ) around a minor , chiron , suggesting that ringed bodies may be more common in our solar system previously thought like their mythological counterparts , centaurs are hybrids , embodying traits of both asteroids and comets
to discover the rings , the mit observed the dimming of a star as chiron passed in front of it , briefly blocking the light
while most centaurs are thought to be dormant , scientists have seen glimmers of activity from chiron
chiron was discovered in 1977 by charles kowal recovery images have been found as far back as 1895 , it was the first - known member of a class of objects now known as centaurs , with an orbit between saturn and uranus starting in the late 1980s , astronomers observed patterns of brightening from the centaur , as well as activity similar to that of a streaking comet
in 2010 , mit started to chart the orbits of chiron and nearby stars in order to pinpoint exactly when the centaur might pass across a star bright enough to detect
' we need a certain amount of luck , waiting for chiron to pass in front of a star that is bright enough
chiron itself is small enough that the event is very short ; if you blink , you might miss it
' in light of these new observations , the researchers say that chiron may still possess symmetrical jets of gas and dust
' if chiron has a ring system , it will show it 's more common than previously thought
