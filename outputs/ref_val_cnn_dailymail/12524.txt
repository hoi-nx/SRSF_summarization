even with the national chapter shutting the sae house at the university of oklahoma , the school president said the university 's affiliation with the fraternity is permanently done as a campus group called for the expulsion of fraternity members
the members have until midnight tuesday to get their things out of the house , university president boren said in a monday afternoon news conference
" the house will be closed , and as far as i 'm concerned , they wo n't be back , " he said , adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members
a saturday video showing party - bound fraternity members on a bus chanting a racial epithet found its way anonymously to the school newspaper and a campus organization , which both promptly publicized the nine - second clip
" by sunday night , sae 's national chapter had suspended the university of oklahoma members and threatened lifelong suspensions for anyone responsible for the chant , but boren took it a step further
boren stressed that the fraternity members ' behavior is not indicative of what university of oklahoma students , nicknamed sooners , represent
" sooners are not racists
they wanted this video out there , and i 've asked them to please let me know when they 're other things like this that happen , " boren told cnn
" we decided that this was definitely a story they needed to cover without question , " she told cnn
this mentality is not new to campus , and it 's not confined to one fraternity , davis told cnn , but it 's the first time people have been caught on video
boren emphasized that " there is no room for racists and bigots " at university of oklahoma
" i think some of the students themselves may take themselves off the campus , and i hope they do because this is not a place that wants racists , " he told cnn later
" it was addressed to @ president_boren , the university president 's twitter handle
boren quickly threatened to throw the fraternity off - campus if the allegations were true
the sae 's national chapter also moved promptly , saying in a statement it had closed the chapter " following the discovery of an inappropriate video
" " i was not only shocked and disappointed , but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video , " sae national president bradley cohen said in a statement
one of them told cnn affiliate kfor-tv he was " nauseated , frustrated , " but he was happy with the sae headquarters ' decision
spray paint marked a wall of sae 's fraternity house at the university
backlash extended beyond campus as well , with hip - hop star waka flocka flame saying on instagram that he was canceling an upcoming show for the saes
that 's what waka flocka flame is all about
for that reason , i must say i 'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the sae fraternity at university of oklahoma and i will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month
