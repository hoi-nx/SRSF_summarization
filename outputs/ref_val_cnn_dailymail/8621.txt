city breaks have overtaken beach holidays as the most popular getaway choice for uk tourists , according to a new study
with the pound strengthening against the euro and other currencies , prices have dropped by as much as 22 per cent over last year in three quarters of the cities included in post office travel money 's annual report on city costs
eastern european cities offer bargain hunters the best value with vilnius , lithuania , topping the list
lithuania 's capital , vilnius , offers bargain hunters the best value as a city break destination , says a study budapest , hungary , also offers uk travellers a great deal , with a weekend getaway tallying Â£ 119.77 the newest eurozone member has seen a fall of over 15 per cent year - on - year with a three - course evening meal for two including drinks and two nights ' accommodation coming in at just Â£ 100.04
the cost of a weekend break in vilnius is half of what visitors would pay in perennial favourites paris , rome and amsterdam
in riga , latvia , not only is transport extremely affordable , but three - star city centre hotels are cheapest and when it comes to europe , post office travel money recommends heading to athens for a deal 1
strasbourg , french - Â£ 169.60 * cost of two nights ' accommodation and a three - course meal for two with drinks but it 's not only eastern europe that offers uk tourists some serious value
athens , which is a new entry in the report , comes in fifth with a weekend city break coming in at just Â£ 131.35 , which puts it as the cheapest in europe
proving that not all french cities must be needlessly expensive , strasbourg is noteworthy for being 35 per cent cheaper than paris
while perennial favourite , paris , is a very expensive french destination , strasbourg offers good value if money is not a concern , stockholm has been named europe 's most expensive city for the third year in a row andrew brown of post office travel money said : ' it 's a win / win situation for uk holidaymakers this year in european cities because prices are down in the majority of cities we surveyed , thanks to the soaring value of sterling
' remember that the cost of meals and drinks will need to be added into the spending budget , as city breaks are never all - inclusive holidays , ' he explains
' over the course of a two - or three - night break , these can make a big difference to the cost of a city break and the low prices in prague , athens and budapest will make these cities strong contenders for a bargain break rival to the baltic states
