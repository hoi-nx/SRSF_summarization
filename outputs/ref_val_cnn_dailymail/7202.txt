a south african woman who snatched a newborn baby and raised her as her own for nearly 18 years was today banned by a judge from any contact with the child
the 50 - year - old was ordered to live at a secret address isolated from the girl she 'd brought up and the husband she 'd deceived when she appeared in court following her arrest for kidnapping
yesterday the biological mother of zephany who was snatched from her arms in hospital in april 1997 , thanked the stranger who had brought her up for ' doing a good job ' in an exclusive interview with mailonline
the seamstress , from a poverty - stricken suburb of cape town , looked grief - stricken but managed to smile weakly at a clutch of friends who had gathered to support her in court
' as a mother and child they just seemed just to fit together â like a proper family
the mother is a lovely , lovable woman , always smiling and kind and will do anything for you
' it was the husband who came to tell us what had happened , when she had been arrested for kidnap
' relief : unbelievably , celeste has revealed she has already forgiven the woman who kidnapped her daughter shock : zephany ( pictured ) is coming to terms with the fact her family is not who she thought they were zephany , who was given a different name by the woman â neither of whom can be identified â is being cared for by social workers and has met her biological family three times since discovering her real identity
the girl , who turns 18 next month , learned she had been stolen at birth following an extraordinary twist of fate when her long lost sister , 13 - year - old cassidy , joined her school
once morne , 37 , learned of his daughter 's new older friend ' who looks just like us ' , he sought her out and immediately felt an inexplicable bond with the girl
the electrical sales rep then carried out his own investigation into the 17 - year - old , scanning her facebook page for information which would help prove she was the three - day - old baby who 'd been taken from his sleeping wife 's arms
anger : there is a feeling of betrayal in the community where zephany was raised on the cape flats , with many questioning how this lie has been able to go on beneath their noses for so many years precious : the family only have a few photos of zephany taken before she was snatched
here she is with her uncle abraham nurse in hospital on april 29 , 1997 the father of four told mailonline , ' when i saw zephany for the first time the feeling was there completely
' he downloaded a picture of the woman who was raising zephany from the girl 's facebook page and sent it to a witness who had seen the woman , dressed in a nurse 's uniform , carrying the baby away from celeste as she slept , heavily medicated following a cesarean section
instinct : morne ( centre , arriving at court with ex-wife celeste , left ) said he recognised his nearly 18 - year - old daughter immediately - despite not having seen her since she was just three days old appeals : the family has worked hard to make sure people do n't forget about their missing daughter over the years , including a big appeal in 2010 in the local newspaper the cape argus , but no one ever come forward once they were satisfied that they had enough evidence , they contacted police who carried out dna tests and proved they had traced their own child
both families have lived only streets apart for all of zephany 's life and the poverty - stricken community of lavender hill , where drugs and gangs are rife , are divided over the extraordinary story
it is understood that the baby snatcher had had a still birth before she took zephany and was able to breastfeed the newborn and bring her home from hospital without raising suspicion , even from her own husband
