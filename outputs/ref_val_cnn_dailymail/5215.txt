but these so - called nanorobots are set to be used to treat a person who is seriously ill with leukaemia
the lead researcher behind the innovation hopes the patient could be cured within a month - and has already successfully tested the machines in animals
the lead researcher behind the innovation hopes that the patient could be cured within a month , based upon successful tests in animals bachelet , who was previously at harvard âs wyss institute in boston , massachusetts and israel âs bar-ilan university , intends to treat a patient who has been given six months to live
the patient is set to receive an injection of dna nanorobots designed to interact with and destroy leukaemia cells without damaging healthy tissue
nanorobots can be programmed to independently recognise target cells and deliver payloads , such as cancer drugs , to these cells
the double helixes stay closed until specific molecules or proteins on the surface of cancer cells act like a ' key ' to open the â barrel â so the payload can be deployed
this diagram shows the nanorobot being ' unlocked ' so the drugs ( shown in purple ) are released nanorobots are ' devices ' made from dna that are so small they can be injected into the bloodstream and carry a payload of drugs to specific cells
they are built upon a single strand of dna which is combined with short synthetic strands of dna designed by the experts
the robots have two halves linked together by flexible dna hinges , which are held shut by latches that are dna double helixes a complementary piece of dna is attached to a payload of drugs , which enables it to bind to the inside of the biological barrel

george church , who is involved in the research at the wyss institute explained the idea of the microscopic robots is to make a â cage â that protects a fragile or toxic payload and â only releases it at the right moment

the nanorobots would screen â every cell â in the body for cancerous or abnormal cells and destroy them before they spread if dr bachelet 's approach proves successful in humans , and is backed by more research in the coming years , the team âs work could signal a transformational moment in cancer treatment and could be used for many other diseases by delivering drugs more effectively without causing side effects
