as the wembley clock ticked over into the 89th minute , the booming pa system kicked in and proclaimed that welbeck was england 's man of the match
welbeck had been excellent , by some distance the stand - out player
who needs harry kane ? welbeck leads the celebrations after putting england 2 - 0 ahead against lithuania on friday welbeck 's header deflects into the back of the net to send england into a commanding lead welbeck is congratulated by england captain rooney after scoring his sixth of the qualfying campaign welbeck 's pitch map from the lithuania match shows his influence right across the front line welbeck has scored eight goals in 29 appearances for arsenal this season but has six in four qualifiers for england
on a productive night , welbeck blasted in the shot that led to rooney 's opener , stooped to divert home england 's second , had three other shots on goal and tormented the lithuanian defence with his pace , power and passing
the goal augmented his international goal tally to 14 - drawing level with paul scholes - and he duly became the leading scorer in euro 2016 qualifying with six goals , one ahead of israel 's omar damari
which all begs the question - why does n't welbeck play like this for arsenal ? welbeck caused the lithuanian defence problems all evening and justified his selection welbeck ran directly at the lithuanian defence all evening in a positive performance welbeck is congratulated by former manchester united team - mate rooney after doubling the lead welbeck 's touch map from the match with lithuania shows his presence right across the attack pushed out to the wing to accommodate the in - form olivier giroud , welbeck has all - too - often looked a spare part in arsenal colours this season following his Â£ 16m move from manchester united last september
the fact his england goal tally for the campaign is just two shy of his club return speaks volumes - perhaps arsene wenger should ask roy hodgson for advice on how to get the best out of the frontman
because he looks a man transformed on international duty - while with arsenal , the wide berth is regarded as something of a snub , inhibiting his performance
with the england on his chest , welbeck is content and confident , raising his game to a level rarely seen for the gunners
at the moment , welbeck is unlikely to displace olivier giroud , who has 17 goals in 26 games this season , but friday night 's electric performance proves that he can perform in a wide position - on both flanks
