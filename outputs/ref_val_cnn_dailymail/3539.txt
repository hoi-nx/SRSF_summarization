ms rebecca ( right ) pictured in the bridesmaid 's dress in which she was found dead after her sister 's wedding last november salamone ( pictured with his sister mirella newman-bale , who also gave evidence at today 's hearing ) told the inquest that he had been planning to ask ms rebecca , his partner of four years , to marry him this summer she was juggling work as a youth counsellor specialising in substance abuse with studying for a masters degree in family therapy

ms rebecca ( pictured , third from right ) had been head bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister jo and her husband matt wilson
family had described her as the ' life and soul of the party ' at the event earlier last year , ms rebecca organised her sister 's hen party
family said they could not explain her actions mr salamone 's sister mirella newman-bale said saw the young woman crying by the bar at one point in the evening , when confided her worries about work and study
however , the head bridesmaid later perked up and started dancing again and the upset seemed to be over , the inquest heard
the coroner heard that ms rebecca started working at visions , a young person 's drug and alcohol service in hounslow , london , in 2011
records showed her caseload had not increased in the months before her death and she was a valued member of the team , providing vital support to young people with substance abuse problems
' offering his sympathies to her parents and partner , coroner richard travers said rebecca had been a ' remarkable force
' it is also apparent to me that there were issues in her personal life which caused her stress and anxiety - her partner , family , work life - but there is nothing that specifically assists me in boo 's intentions on the day she died
' i heard that during the course of the wedding in the main boo was her usual bubbly , lively self and that she , as her father told me , had been the ' life and soul of the party
' consequently i conclude rebecca died from self - inflicted injuries but her intention was unclear , ' he said
