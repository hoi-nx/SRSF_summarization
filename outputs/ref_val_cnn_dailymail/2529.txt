a gm â super spud â claimed by scientists to be healthier to eat , cheaper to grow and better for the environment could be field tested in british next year
but plans for the trials were condemned last night by critics who argue that genetically modifying crops to create â frankenfoods â could threaten natural ecosystems and human health
scientists at the publicly funded sainsbury laboratory in norwich are hoping to develop the potato using eight genes from other varieties
scientists claim to have be close to engineering a gm â super spud â which is healthier to eat , cheaper to grow and better for the environment
the added genes will also protect against potato blight , which costs british farmers Â£ 60million a year in losses and use of fungicides , and nematode worms
but field trials , which the scientists hope to begin in 12 months â time , will first have to be approved under tough eu regulations and are likely to attract protesters , requiring them to be conducted behind high fences
peter melchett , of the soil association , said : â a previous gm potato , launched in 2009 , was claimed to be the answer to the blight disease common in the british potato crop
â now we âre told that wo nât work , and a gm potato needs up to eight different gm characteristics to be useful
â as with other gm research , this is a complete waste of time , money and scientific expertise
â although there have been field trials in the past , no gm food has ever been commercially grown in british because of european regulations that make it difficult to get licences
it means that although british researchers are leading the way in developing gm technology , the end results are usually snapped up by foreign firms
professor jonathan jones said gm â has been shown to be safe â , and before the potato could be sold , it would need extensive testing and authorisation from eu bodies such as the european food safety authority
â professor jonathan jones , who is leading the project said the new potato â aims to be better for the environment , reduce production costs , reduce waste and also be healthier â
he hopes to conduct field trials in just 12 months time
