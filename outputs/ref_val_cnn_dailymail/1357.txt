action : the 72 - year - old woman , who does not want to be named , paid to have a white line painted on the road in front of her home on culmington road , birmingham , and ' no parking ' written on the pavement the woman also placed traffic cones on either side of her driveway
the grandmother - of - five called the police during a dispute last week with a couple who she claims parked in front of her home twice on the same day
they have children at the school - two little children - and i went to see who was parking there and blocking me in
' parents at the school have branded the woman 's decision ' extreme '
one mother , katey large , who walks her children to school along the road every day , said : ' there have been days when the lady who lives there sits outside in a chair underneath the window and tells people they ca n't park there and she 's gone to extremes now by painting that on the road
' taking a stand : the grandmother - of - five also placed traffic cones on either side of her driveway ' ludicrous ' : parents of nearby albert bradbeer primary school have branded her measures ' extreme ' but she added : ' you quite often see parents in the morning walking up the road and sniggering , but if it was outside their house they would n't be laughing about it
