atlanta as u.s. air force fighter jets and bombers carry out airstrikes against isis in iraq and syria , air force officials are waging a campaign of their own on capitol hill
air force secretary deborah james told lawmakers last month that " enough is enough " when it comes to downsizing the air force , defending president obama 's $ 534 billion pentagon base budget request to the defense appropriations subcommittee
despite the concerns of defense officials , lawmakers insisted that $ 10 billion will need to be cut from the air force 's portion of the president 's proposed budget , which , in total , exceeds spending caps by nearly $ 35 billion
rep. tom cole , r-oklahoma , called the president 's base budget " a fantasy " but expressed a desire to find a bipartisan compromise to provide some relief from spending caps instituted in 2013 after budget disagreements between president obama and congress
until a compromise is reached , tom cole said the committee will have to make " a lot of tough decisions " related to cutting billions from the air force 's spending request
but will cuts actually threaten the u.s. ' standing as the most modern and capable air fleet on the planet ? despite writing the blueprint on how to build the world 's greatest air force , gen. welsh , the air force 's chief of staff , says the u.s. will not be able to maintain the air force 's strategic gains once next year 's sequestration cuts take effect
air force officials argue that the force is currently older and smaller than it has ever been and that further budget cuts would hinder its ability to modernize and maintain effective command structure
" the irony lies in that the air force 's emphasis on investing in a fleet solely made up of high - end aircraft may be one of the key factors drawing down the size of the force , says hendrix
