more than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation royal mail has stepped up the amount of junk mail it stuffs through our doors since it was sold off by the government , new figures show
more than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation â sparking fears that it risks becoming a â leaflet distributor â
it means almost 3.2bn items of â unaddressed â junk mail were delivered in just one year â almost double the 1.7bn delivered annually five years ago
these figures do not even include the vast quantities of â addressed â junk mail also delivered , which have the names of occupants on the envelope
the rise in unsolicited mail has proved lucrative for royal mail , which is struggling from increased competition in the parcels market and a fall in the number of ordinary letters being posted
revenue from â marketing mail â â addressed and unaddressed â has soared to Â£ 1.1bn a year , earning them Â£ 3million a day
critics last night called for royal mail to reduce the amount of â nuisance â junk mail it delivers or risk becoming a â leaflet distributor â
royal mail admitted junk mail had become an â important component â of its business , and insisted many households found advertising flyers â useful â
â royal mail and its direct marketing clients have to do far more to reduce the torrent of junk mail
he said : â royal mail needs to make money but , if they deliver more and more junk mail as a source of income , in the long term i am not sure it is a sustainable business
â critics claim that some junk mail contain scams sent by fraudsters from overseas
critics said the company was running the risk of being labelled a ' leaflet distributor ' with fewer letters being posted every year in 2011 , the national fraud authority claimed the royal mail logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy , making the scammers appear more trustworthy
