bain was unpacking his tesco shopping at his home in clacton , essex , when he noticed something stirring in one of the bags
after he phoned tesco to complain , the supermarket sent a team of pest control experts whose trap later caught the creature
it was one of the first times mr bain and his wife , hayley , 28 , had used tesco 's online delivery service
' i told my wife there was a mouse in the bag and she jumped off the floor
the animal ran around the couple 's kitchen and disappeared into a hole before being caught by pest control mr bain said the incident left him wondering what might have happened to other people 's shopping which was also on the delivery van
' the shopping was delivered last thursday and the mouse was captured in a trap on saturday
' a thorough check of the store by pest control found no evidence of further problems , so we 're still investigating to find out exactly what happened
' tesco , which sent in pest control experts , has apologised and replaced the Â£ 85 worth of shopping
