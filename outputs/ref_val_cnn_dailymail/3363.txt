consumption rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014 , which equates to an extra 700,000 that are boiled , scrambled and fried every day of the week
it is a remarkable resurgence for the egg , which has suffered from a series of health scares and changes in food fashion since the 1950s when the nation was happy to â go to work on an egg â
the revival is being attributed to the fact they form a central part of protein - rich diets such at atkins and paleo , which promise weight loss and even a longer life
consumption of eggs rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014 , the equivalent of 700,000 extra a day
experts are crediting the revival with the rise of protein - rich diets including atkins and paleo as a result , egg sales are now finally back to the levels seen in the 1980s when the former tory health minister edwina currie infamously labelled them a health threat because of salmonella contamination
that attack fuelled existing concerns about eggs , which were also being demonised by doctors for containing high levels of cholesterol , which was wrongly assumed to fur up the arteries
the net result is that eggs are now being actively promoted as a health food given they are also full of the protein , vitamins , minerals and essential fatty acids that are vital to a healthy body
research by experts at university of surrey found overweight people given two eggs a day as part of a reduced calorie diet lost weight and saw no increase in blood cholesterol levels
and the us dietary guidelines advisory committee has recently recommended that limitations on consumption of cholesterol found in eggs should be removed from official health guidelines
â they are also included in all major slimming plans , from established groups such as weight watchers and slimming world , to more recent trends such as the atkins and paleo diets
in total , 32 million eggs were eaten every day in the uk in 2014 , equivalent to 11.7 billion throughout the whole year
â consumption from retail purchases exceeded six billion for the first time in 2014 , having grown 16 per cent in the past five years , â said the spokesman , adding that consumption had returned to levels last seen before the salmonella crisis of the late 1980s
