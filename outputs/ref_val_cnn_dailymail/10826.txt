' how to open a bottle of beer with a sheet of paper ' was uploaded by rhys morgan this week , and it does exactly what it says on the tinnie
mr rhys morgan 's method is so ludicrously simple it 's a wonder no one has thought of it before
all you need to successfully crack open your beer is one piece of a4 paper
mr rhys morgan who lives in cardiff , wales starts off by vertically folding the paper in half
mr rhys morgan starts by vertically folding a piece of a4 paper in half ( left ) before he folds it in half again ( right ) then he folds the remaining paper lengthways to create a ' v ' shape from the paper
he places the ' v ' - shaped paper against the underside of the bottle and applies pressure and with one swift upwards move he pops the cap of the bottle , successfully releasing the beer from its bottle - topped prison
we needed to create some kind of bottle opener , and i thought that strengthening a sheet of paper by folding it could help it act as a lever to pry the top off ! ' after folding the paper thrice the forms a ' v ' shape with the paper he then places it on the underside of the bottle ( left ) and in one swift move pops the cap ( right ) success ! he has managed to open a bottle of beer without a bottle opener mr rhys morgan said his trick will work with all types of paper , down to kitchen roll
