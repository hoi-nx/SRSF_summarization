a year later , it still sounds impossible : a sophisticated $ 270 million airliner carrying 239 people disappears , leaving very few clues about where it went
but did the tragedy of mh370 really have to be such a mystery ? maybe not
lingering questions -- and the trauma experienced by friends and family of passengers and crew of the boeing 777-200er -- all might have been avoided if already proven technology had been put into place
believe it or not , in our modern world , airplane tracking technology has yet to enter the 21st century
why are n't air traffic controllers using it to constantly track all commercial airliners ? how about communicating with satellites ? why do n't all airliners stream their so - called black box data to satellites in real time ? the technology is available
flight 370 had eight ways to communicate with the ground while in flight : five very high frequency and high frequency radios that could transmit and receive voice and data transmissions
two transponders that could send identification and altitude data to air traffic control radar screens
despite this technology , the world lost track of the flight with the airline industry codename mh370
to understand why , you first have to know a little about the technology and the gaps in the system
throughout most of the world , air traffic controllers still track airplanes with radar -- which uses technology dating back to the 1940s
radar is reliable , but it is limited
aircraft flying more than about 200 miles from land over oceans are not tracked by air traffic control radar screens
radar covers only about 2 % or 3 % of the planet 's surface , experts say
if an aircraft 's transponders are turned off , an aircraft can be seen only through so - called primary radar
this provides evidence that mh370 ended somewhere in the southern indian ocean
it leads them to an almost inescapable conclusion : whatever happened on mh370 was likely deliberate , experts say
we might know more about what happened to mh370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners , instead of radar
there are numerous technical details that need to be worked out , but moving from spinning radar domes to orbiting satellites could eventually make blind spots in airliner tracking a thing of the past
another emerging technology that might have helped us know more about what happened is called afirs , the automated flight information reporting system , developed by a canada company called flyht
in the months since mh370 was lost , international aviation authorities have moved toward tracking airliners more closely
they 'll use satellite - based positioning technology to track flights at least every 15 minutes -- improving on the previous tracking rate of every 30 to 45 minutes , airservices australia said in a statement
" would any of these improvements in airline communication technology have helped the world learn what happened to flight 370 ? possibly
