mathematics is probably not a subject that many people find sexy , but it could hold the key to finding true love
mathematicians have developed a series of theories that can help people find the perfect partner
these include tips such as not trying to hide the less attractive parts of your appearance in your online dating profile pictures and looking for people who had fewer colds as a child
she said the discreet choice theory dictates that if there are two women - a and b - who men rank as equally attractive , if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman a , then woman a becomes more popular they have also proposed mathematical approaches to finding the perfect wife or husband - by not choosing to settle down until after the age of 22 years old
dr hannah fry , a lecturer at university college london and author of a new book on the mathematics of love , outlined the theories at the oxford literary festival
she said that choosing friends who are slightly less attractive than you when going out looking for love could also bring advantages
this is known as the discreet choice theory , where the presence of an irrelevant alternative can change how you view your choices
in her book , dr hannah fry suggest a number of techniques to help people find true love
have friends who are less attractive than you : known as discreet choice theory , the idea is that if there are two women - a and b - who men rank as being equally attractive , if a third woman comes along who looks like a less attractive version of woman a , then woman a becomes more popular with the men
highlight your flaws : analysis from dating websites has shown that often it is not those who are rated the ' most attractive ' who get the most responses from other users
this means people who find these traits attractive will face less competition than messaging those who have ' perfect ' profile pictures
the most successful couples are those that allow each other to complain and do n't let trivial problems build up choose ' healthy ' looking partners : dr hannah fry also explained that looking for those who tend to be heathlier are also likely to be more attractive
do n't settle down until 37 % of your ' dating period ' has past : the optimal stopping period theory dictates that people should only start looking for the partner they want to settle down with after 37 per cent of their ' dating period ' has past
if , for example , they are looking to get married by the age of 35 years old , and start dating from the age of 15 , they should discount all partners they have before the age of 22.4 years old
after this time has past , marry the first ' best ' partner you get : after the 37 per cent period has past , dr hannah fry said people should marry the first partner they find that is better than any that came before
and if married , follow the ' positive ' formula : this formula , devised by psychologist john gottmann and mathematician james murray predicts how positive or negative a wife and husband will be when they respond in the next turn of a conversation
dr hannah fry said : ' if you are trying to choose a wingman or wingwoman , choose someone as similar to you as possible , just slightly less attractive
' other mathematicians have dedicated a fair amount of time to the subject of finding and keeping love
sarah jessica parker ( shown ) divides opinion with many people thinking she 's beautiful and others disagreeing fortunately for him , it seems he did meet one of them - a girl called rose from london who he met at a dinner with friends while he was working at warwick university - and has now married her
according to dr hannah fry , however , there are ways of increasing your chances of meeting the one
dr hannah fry said : ' people who are unbelievably good looking will always do well , but the rest of us would be better to divide opinion
' she also outlined a maths based strategy for finding a wife or husband known as the optimal stopping period
this states that people should only start looking for the partner you want to settle down with after 37 per cent of their ' dating period ' has passed
meanwhile , the optimal stopping period theory says people should only start looking for the partner they want to settle down with after 37 % of their ' dating period ' has past
dr hannah fry also explained that looking for those who tend to be heathlier are also likely to be more attractive
speaking during a ted talk last year , dr hannah fry said : ' love , as with most of life , is full of patterns and mathematics is about studying patterns
