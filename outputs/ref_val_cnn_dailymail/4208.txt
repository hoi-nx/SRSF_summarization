in november 2014 , plasma physicist dr brandenburg revealed his theory that an ancient civilisation on mars was massacred in a nuclear attack
he claims there is no other explanation for his proposal that a â weapon âs signature â remains from the attack on mars
dr brandenburg is to present his theory in houston , texas today
he says an ancient mars civilisation was wiped out by a nuclear bomb
a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium , thorium ( shown in graphic ) and radioactive potassium on the surface supposedly provide evidence for this theory dr brandenburg will be presenting his theory at the 46th lunar and planetary science conference in houston , texas at the town center exhibit area this evening
aside from this outlandish theories , dr brandenburg has led a rather more normal , and prestigious , career
dr brandenburg has authored a number of books with his latest being death on mars : the discovery of a planetary nuclear massacre
â we have now found evidence of the nuclear melt - glass trinitite ( formed on earth at the site of nuclear weapon air - bursts ) at both sites of the hypothesised explosions and this will be presented at the conference , â dr brandenburg revealed to mailonline ahead of his talk
â dr brandenburg will be presenting his theory at the 46th lunar and planetary science conference in houston , texas at the town center exhibit area this evening
nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere apparently resemble hydrogen bomb tests - which he says occurred in two places on mars , cydonia mensa and galaxias chaos back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on mars ( pictured ) could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion - but now he thinks it was caused by an intelligent alien race however , at the conference dr brandenburg said he would not be talking about his belief in the ancient civilisation
â dr brandenburg also claims he came up with the hypothesis that mars was once covered in an ocean , which nasa recently announced
shown is a ground level view of a nuclear device in nevada , us on 15 april 1955 dr brandenburg also claims he came up with the hypothesis that mars was once covered in an ocean , which nasa recently announced
the agency said they now had evidence that 3.7 billion years ago the planet had more water ( shown in illustration ) than than the arctic ocean does today on the reaction he is expecting , dr brandenburg said : â i expect the paper to be controversial , with perhaps statements to the effect that " this theory is so ludicrous i am not going to comment on its abundant evidences ! " by pundits
â this is a weapon 's signature
â dr brandenburg will also be presenting another of his theories at the conference , that mars once has a â biologically stabilised greenhouse
