arsenal , for a change , performed with a trace of discipline
for once , wenger âs team refused to be lured into the high - speed pursuit of glory
wenger looks on as his side win in monaco - but it was not quite enough to progress to the last eight olivier giroud gave the gunners hope , finishing with aplomb to increase the nerves among the home side ramsey stepped off the bench to latch on to a loose ball in the box to level the tie on aggregate after the debacle at the emirates stadium in the first leg , they learned not to repeat their mistakes but it did them no good
wenger âs team kept a clean sheet and scored twice against a defence which had conceded only once in its previous 12 home games , but it was meaningless
there was robin van persie âs red card and nicklas bendtner âs late chance in barca and that 2 - 0 win in munich against bayern munich , a carbon copy of this tie , two years ago
there were the lionel messi four goals in 2010 when pep guardiola âs barca were at their peak , the penalty conceded by kolo toure at liverpool and a near - miss against ac milan , when wenger raged at the referee , having lost by four in the san siro
what if sanchez had been awarded a penalty instead of booked for diving ? what if danny welbeck âs shot had not hit aymen abdennour and deflected wide before half - time ? what if danijel subasic had not clawed that one out of the top corner in the dying minutes ? what if arsenal learned how to cope with two - legged knockout ties against quality opposition ? for a team who aspire to win major trophies , they have failed to make it past this stage for five successive years
they seized on arsenal âs frailties in london and clung to their lead
there would be no miracle in monaco , under the terracotta tiles of stade louis ii , where irish rock band u2 came to watch on st patrick âs day , and might have played arsenal out with a chorus of still have nât found what i âm looking for
wenger âs selection was typically bold â four at the back , shielded by francis coquelin , who was later discarded for ramsey
an early goal might have exerted more pressure on a team in unfamiliar territory and made them anxious , but 35 minutes had elapsed when olivier giroud struck
arsenal at last had exposed monaco âs nerve ends and the monegasques shifted uneasily
olivier giroud perhaps epitomises the arsenal riddle better than anyone
arsenal paid price for first leg - wenger sanchez reacts after missing a chance on an ultimately frustrating night for the visitors the monaco bench erupts after the full - time whistle after the elimination of wenger 's side he showed mental strength to overcome the disappointment of missed sitters in the first leg but chances went astray again : a header nodded wide early in the game and another into the goalkeeper âs hands
time runs out on wenger âs dream of ever winning the champions league .
