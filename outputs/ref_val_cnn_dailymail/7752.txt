a powerful committee of mps claims weak law enforcement means tax avoidance â and evasion â remains â a risk worth taking â
the public accounts committee said hmrc is failing to sufficiently tackle â widespread â tax avoidance by us giants , including starbucks , google and amazon
margaret hodge , chair of the public accounts committee , said hmrc needs to come down hard on companies who use artificial overseas offices to avoid tax , and the firms that advise them they must also do more to challenge the accountancy firms which help these multinationals to dodge their liabilities , the group will say
today , the public accounts committee will say that the taxman must do more to â challenge â these tactics , saying : â hmrc needs to show that it comes down hard on tax cheats and change the perception that it is far too tolerant of those who break the law by hiding their income
â amazon , starbucks and vodaphone have all previously been found to funnel profits through tax havens , despite earning that money in the uk it added : â hmrc has not been sufficiently challenging of the manifestly artificial tax arrangements of multinationals
they accused hmrc of not doing enough to â challenge â this tax advice and instead focusing on the multinationals themselves
margaret hodge , chair of the public accounts committee and a labour mp , said : â we remain concerned that hmrc âs relationship with these large accountancy firms is too cosy , and it needs to get much tougher in challenging the advice they give to their clients
â it is disappointing that hmrc has rejected our recommendation for a tougher code of conduct for tax advisers - a response which is out of kilter with its wider policy to clamp down on aggressive tax avoidance
as it stands , tax avoidance â and even evasion â can be a risk worth taking
the report said : â for as long as the uk has such a complex tax code , opportunities for aggressive tax avoidance and evasion will continue to be exploited
gauke told mps the co-operation was part of the diverted profits tax project - or so - called â google tax â - announced in the budget last week and aimed at clamping down on tax avoidance
â a spokesman for hmrc said : â we are pleased that the committee recognises the progress that hmrc has made in clamping down on tax evasion and avoidance , by relentlessly pursuing those who seek to cheat the system
