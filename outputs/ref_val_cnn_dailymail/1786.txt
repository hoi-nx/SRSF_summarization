' alcapa is a rare heart condition you can be born with
left undiagnosed , it kills in 90 % of cases june davison , senior cardiac nurse at the british heart foundation , said : ' alcapa is a rare heart condition that you can be born with
' blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the left side of the heart , depriving the heart of oxygen , which can cause damage to the heart muscle
' surgery is needed to correct the condition and nowadays people with alcapa have a much better prognosis
' an ' alcapa ( anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery ) is a problem that occurs when the baby 's heart is developing early in the pregnancy
in the normal heart , the left coronary artery starts in the aorta
when this defect occurs , blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the left side of the heart
this condition leads to a heart attack in the baby
a condition known as ' coronary steal ' further damages the heart in babies with alcapa
the low blood pressure in the pulmonary artery causes blood from the abnormal left coronary artery to flow toward the pulmonary artery instead of toward the heart
