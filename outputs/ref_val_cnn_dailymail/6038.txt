the star of each one was the road runner and his nemesis - wile e. coyote
the rules come from the 1999 autobiography of former looney tunes animator chuck jones , called chuck amuck : the life and times of an animated cartoonist
the star of each show was the road runner and his nemesis - wile e. coyote
the road runner can not harm the coyote except by going ' beep - beep ! ' no outside force can harm the coyote - only his own ineptitude or the failure of the acme products the coyote could stop anytime - if he were not a fanatic no dialogue ever , except ' beep - beep ! ' the road runner must stay on the road - otherwise , logically , he would not be called road runner ( though this seems to be a rule that was often broken ) all action must be confined to the natural environment of the two characters - the southwest american desert all materials , tools , weapons , or mechanical conveniences must be obtained from the acme corporation whenever possible , make gravity the coyote 's greatest enemy the coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures
