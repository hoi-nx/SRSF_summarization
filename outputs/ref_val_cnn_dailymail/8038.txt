they had been driving at this speed since 1977 , until it was realised 18 months ago that defence chiefs had wrongly assumed they were exempt from laws restricting tracked vehicles to 20mph
the top speed was therefore halved to 20mph in october 2013 to comply with the 1984 road traffic regulation act , but the dft is now proposing to put it back to 40mph
new limit ? armoured tracked vehicles had been driving at 40mph since 1977 , until it was realised 18 months ago that defence chiefs had wrongly assumed they were exempt from road traffic laws ( file picture ) ministers are worried that the 20mph limit is causing more congestion and raising possible safety concerns , as well as preventing proper training of tank crews to operate safely on public roads
the dft , which is now consulting on plans to raise the limit , added that actual operating speeds would still depend on careful risk assessments by the military and specific vehicle capabilities
a dft spokesman said : â the plans under consultation will help address congestion that can be created by slow - moving vehicles on faster roads
â increasing the maximum speed limit to 40mph will also reduce costs of higher fuel consumption and the time taken for training and testing when vehicles are limited to 20mph
