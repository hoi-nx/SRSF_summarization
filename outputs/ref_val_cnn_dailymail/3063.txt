iraqi officials say government forces have defused dozens of the devices in the course of their war with the fanatics and have produced video footage which backs up their claim
one iraqi bomb disposal expert said that the use of the chemical is a sign of desperation
' he described how his team detonated a bomb in tikrit that , unbeknown to them , contained chlorine
they immediately began feeling the effects of the chemical , experiencing ' painful choking ' and blocked throats
the bbc has been shown footage of bright yellow gas rising up from a roadside bomb explosion that the iraqi say is chlorine , as well as film of the tikrit explosion
' she added : ' there is no doubt that public perception often sees chemical weapons such as this as more dangerous than conventional weapons such as explosives , even though it may not be the case that a chlorine bomb could cause more harm
in one attack in 1915 the gas blew back into britain trenches after canisters of the chemical were fired from heavy guns at the germans
shocking : this footage purportedly shows toxic chlorine gas which was released from a roadside bomb destroyed by iraqi soldiers in tikrit recently the use of chlorine bombs by isis ( pictured ) is a sign of desperation , one expert told the bbc the u.n. security council recently approved a united states - drafted resolution that condemns the use of toxic chemicals such as chlorine in syria , while threatening militarily enforced action in the case of further violations
