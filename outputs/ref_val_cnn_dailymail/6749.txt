the financial details of members of vladimir putin 's inner circle could be published by ministers to expose the rampant corruption and wealth of his henchmen and allies
foreign secretary philip hammond said he was interested in the idea of publicising what is known by the government about the ruling russian elite
such a move would expose how those close to the president were exploiting their positions to obtain enormous wealth , and embarrass them in front of the russian people
asked if there was an argument for the ' interesting ' financial arrangements of members of vladimir putin 's inner circle to be published by ministers , mr philip hammond replied : ' there might be '
philip hammond labelled vladimir putin as potentially the ' single greatest threat ' to britain 's security ' when we talk about having further steps that we can take , increasing the pressure on russian , one the headings that we regularly review is strategic communication : how can we message the russian people and to people that russian is seeking to influence about what is really going on ? ' it is an interesting thought and i will make sure the strategic communications people are thinking precisely about that
