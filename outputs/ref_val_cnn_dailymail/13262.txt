if death is the big sleep , as it is sometimes called , is there anything wrong with a dying person choosing a medically induced smaller sleep -- deep sedation -- to avoid the pain of a terminal illness ? is it ok for a patient to choose to spend his or her final days on this mortal coil in what would amount to a medically induced coma ? or is it simply euthanasia in disguise ? members of the french parliament offered resounding support tuesday for the proposition that is should be permissible for doctors to induce sleep until death in terminally ill patients who are in pain
should it become law , doctors would be allowed to administer " deep sedation until death " to terminally ill patients who request it , and for whom palliative care would not ease the pain
the law would also allow doctors who have stopped life - saving measures to administer deep sedation , if they deem it appropriate , to terminally ill patients who are unable to give their consent
" everyone has the right to a death that is dignified and soothed , " the proposed law says
" what the law entails , according to jean leonetti , the member of parliament who proposed it , is simple : " sleep before death to avoid suffering
polls show that more than 90 % of french people support the proposal -- an astonishing majority for any proposal -- and hollande has said it would represent a big step forward
