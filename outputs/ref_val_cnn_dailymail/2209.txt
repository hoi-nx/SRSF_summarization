the deaths of three people who developed a foodborne illness linked to some blue bell ice cream products has prompted the texas icon 's first product recall in its 108 - year history
five people , in all , developed listeriosis in kansas after eating products from one production line at the blue bell creamery in brenham , texas , according to a statement friday from the fda
the fda says listeria bacteria were found in samples of blue bell chocolate chip country cookies , great divide bars , sour pop green apple bars , cotton candy bars , scoops , vanilla stick slices , almond bars and moo bars
according to a friday statement from the cdc , all five of the people sickened were receiving treatment for unrelated health issues at the same kansas hospital before developing listeriosis , ' a finding that strongly suggests their infections ( with listeria bacteria ) were acquired in the hospital , ' the cdc said
all four had consumed milkshakes made with a single - serving blue bell ice cream product called ' scoops ' while they were in the hospital , the cdc said
' scoops , ' as well as the other suspect blue bell items , are mostly food service items and not produced for retail , said paul cruse , ceo of the brenham creamery
blue bell says its regular moo bars were untainted , as were its half gallons , quarts , pints , cups , three - gallon ice cream and take - home frozen snack novelties the cdc said the listeria isolated from specimens taken from four of the five patients at via christi st. francis hospital in wichita , kansas , matched strains isolated from blue bell products obtained this year in south carolina and texas
' via christi was not aware of any listeria contamination in the blue bell ice cream products and immediately removed all blue bell products from all via christi locations once the potential contamination was discovered , ' loving said in a statement friday to the associated press
that contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies , and that machine remains off line , he said
although people can sometimes develop listeriosis up to 2 months after eating contaminated food , symptoms usually start within several days
