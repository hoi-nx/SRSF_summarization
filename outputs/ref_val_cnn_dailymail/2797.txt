clarkson is ' confident ' he will be able to return to the bbc clarkson is â confident â he will be able to return to the bbc , but he may be given an executive minder to keep him on the straight and narrow
the manager would sit above wilman , top gear âs longstanding executive producer , who has known mr clarkson since they were children , when they both attended the Â£ 10,500 - a - term repton school in derby
the two men have been inseparable for years , but bbc executives are concerned that mr wilman can not keep mr clarkson in check , following a string of scandals
according to sources close to the top gear host , he is keen to return to the corporation after he was suspended last week for a â fracas â with his producer , tymon
mr clarkson , 54 , is said to be furious with the way the bbc has treated him , and is particularly angry that a high level bbc executive compared him to the serial paedophile jimmy savile
the executive minder to keep clarkson on the straight and narrow would sit above top gear 's longstanding executive producer â clarkson did report it himself to danny cohen [ the bbc âs director of television ]
â bbc bosses are also likely to be keen to find a way to keep him on top gear , given its Â£ 50million - a - year - contribution to the corporation âs balance sheet
clarkson was suspended last week for a â fracas â with his producer , tymon , pictured however , introducing a new executive minder between mr wilman and mr clarkson would help it avoid what a source described as some of their most embarrassing â excesses â
last week , noel edmonds , himself a former top gear host , accused bbc bosses for being â out of touch â , â out of control â and â incompetent â when it comes to dealing with larger - than - life broadcasters
the bbc has no strong managers so clarkson and wilman were left to do what they wanted
mr wilman admitted it was a mistake , but has made it clear that he thinks the corporation comes down too heavily on mr clarkson
â the bbc would not confirm that it is considering a new executive minder for mr clarkson
