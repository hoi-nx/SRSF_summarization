pakistanis officials executed 12 people this morning in the country 's single - largest day of executions since a moratorium on the death penalty was lifted in december
prime minister nawaz sharif lifted the moratorium on december 17 , a day after pakistanis taliban gunmen attacked a school and killed 134 students and 19 adults
the killings put pressure the government to do more to tackle the islamist insurgency and the current wave of executions are a continuation of pakistan 's crackdown on the taliban
late last year , pakistan 's prime minister lifted the death - penalty moratorium specifically for terror - related cases after the december taliban attack on a school in peshawar killed 153 people , most of them children
last week , in a controversial step , the government completely lifted the death - penalty ban for all cases
human rights groups estimate pakistan has roughly 8,000 prisoners on death row
a relative mourns beside the body of convicted killer muhammad faisal following his execution in karachi day of death : a man chats on the phone as he sits next to the body of his relative muhammad afzal , who was convicted of murder and executed in karachi earlier this morning one of the most closely watched execution cases is that of hussain , who family members say was 14 when he was sentenced to death by a court in karachi for the murder of a seven - year - old boy
criticism : the executions are sure to raise concerns over due process and proper oversight of the country 's troubled criminal justice system , which rights groups say often does little to protect defendants attack : human rights groups say convictions in pakistan are highly unreliable because its antiquated criminal justice system barely functions , torture is common and police are mostly untrained so far , 39 people have been hanged since december
some of pakistan 's allies have criticised the executions
' we do not believe that the death penalty is a deterrent
