a 22 - year - old college student whose disappearance had police scouring california for weeks said she was overwhelmed with personal problems when she decided to walk away
sahray barber , whose march 9 disappearance triggered a huge land and air search across california 's inland empire , resurfaced on march 19
she had spent the ten days living in two la - area hospitals under assumed names
she wrote : ' things got so bad that i did n't know what to say or who to ask for help , ' i had dug a hole so deep , that i felt entirely hopeless
her disappearance was even more concerning because two women had recently been assaulted on the campus of california state university , san bernadino , near barber 's home
san bernadino police chief burguan said the department will seek criminal charges against barber 's roommates
