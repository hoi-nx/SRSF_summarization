it may not look nearly as good as pamela anderson in a bikini on baywatch , but a new type of drone could save your life if you get into trouble in the water
ryptide is a lifeguard drone that can carry an inflatable life ring to a swimmer in under a minute , according to the developers
the system uses a specially adapted carrying device that can rush a life ring out over the water and drop it close to a swimmer in distress
the device is being built by students at a school in stamford , connecticut the rings are designed to automatically inflate as soon as they hit the water , helping swimmers to stay afloat until rescuers arrive
the engineers behind the project , who are based in stamford , connecticut , say the drone would be particularly useful for helping swimmers who stray into rip tide currents
lifeguards rescue more than 10,000 swimmers from rip tide currents - strong currents of water that can drag swimmers out to sea
piedra , a teacher at king low heywood thomas school in stamford and founder of flying robots llc , began developing the ryptide system with students in 2014
he said : ' ryptide is a life saving drone accessory that can carry an automatically inflating life ring to a swimmer in distress in less than 30 seconds
they say the final model of ryptide will be able to carry up to four inflatable rings that can be dropped one at a time at the press of a button
it would allow life - guards to get help out to swimmers in trouble almost immediately while waiting for rescue boats or other vehicles to arrive
the system ( shown in action above ) can be attached to any drone capable of carrying a gopro camera and brushless gimba the drone is able to fly over a swimmer in distress and drop an inflatable life ring to help keep them afloat pamela anderson ( right ) in baywatch only had a boyancy aid and the odd speed boat to help rescue swimmers nick smith , one of the students involved in the project , said : ' currently the only solution to this problem is another human being risking their life to venture into the rip tide to save the swimmer in crisis
' they said as drones become more popular , the ryptide system could also be installed along beaches so that drone users can quickly attach them to their machines in the event of an emergency .
