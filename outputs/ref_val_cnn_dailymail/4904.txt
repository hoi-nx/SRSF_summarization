sturm , a senior economist at rand , said the much - hailed los angeles fast - food ban did little to reshape the retail food landscape in the targeted area the south los angeles fast - food ban did not decrease obesity in poor neighborhoods because residents found unhealthy food at restaurants in strip malls and convenience stores instead , a new study has found
in 2008 , a dietary ordinance targeted a 32 - square - mile area south of interstate 10 that struggles with high obesity rates and other health problems
the ban went into effect in south los angeles and restricted the opening or expansion of standalone fast - food restaurants
however , the law , believed to be the first effort of its kind by a major city to improve public health , did not ban new fast food restaurants in strip malls
sturm , a senior economist at rand and lead author of the study , said findings should not come as a surprise , as most food outlets in the area are small food stores or restaurants that have limited seating and were not affected by the policy
in the study , which was published in the social science and medicine journal , sturm found that in the targeted area , free - standing restaurants were rare to begin with and no new ones have opened since the ordinance took effect
these standalone fast - food restaurants are outnumbered by restaurants in strip malls and small food stores , such as convenience stores , which were not restricted by the ban , according to npr
larger fast - food chains opened 17 new outlets in strip shopping centers and food courts in south los angeles from 2008 to 2012
almost half of the new food permits were for convenience stores that sell soda and junk food
obesity rates in south los angeles grew by 12 per cent despite a much - hailed three - year ban on stand - alone fast - food restaurants , a new study has found findings showed that before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008 , 63 per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 per cent in other parts of the county
' the south los angeles fast food ban may have symbolic value , but it has had no measurable impact in improving diets or reducing obesity , ' said sturm
the study also revealed that obesity rates following the ban have been significantly larger in south los angeles compared to other parts of the city
' unfortunately , the rates of overweight and obesity increased and they increased fastest in the area subject to the fast - food ban
