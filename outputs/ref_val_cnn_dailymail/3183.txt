wawrzynski claims the ' little dipper ' condiment package he patented in 1997 led heinz to develop its dip & squeeze ketchup packets , which it rolled out in february 2010 a michigan food entrepreneur claims the ' little dipper ' condiment package he patented in 1997 led heinz to develop its dip & squeeze ketchup packets , which it rolled out in february 2010 , lawyers in opening statements told a federal court jury in pittsburgh on monday
the trial , expected to last through until thursday , will determine whether or not pittsburgh - based heinz used wawrzynski 's ' concrete , new and novel ' ideas when it developed the dual - purpose ketchup packets
if the jury rules in the detroit businessman 's favor and determines heinz agreed to pay for the ideas , a separate trial will begin june 10 on how much heinz owes wawrzynski
' heinz says it did n't use any of mr. wawrzynski 's ideas â they thought it up all on their own , ' his attorney , boyle told the jury
but heinz attorney wolfsohn said heinz owes nothing because the dip & squeeze owes nothing to the cone - shaped container that wawrzynski invented
wawrzynski is n't claiming heinz copied the exact design
heinz claims the dip & squeeze grew out of an earlier idea called the ' dunk ' n squirt ' that it shelved in 2006 because it could n't make it cheaply enough the dip & squeeze grew out of an earlier idea called the ' dunk ' n squirt ' that heinz began working on in 2002 but shelved in 2006 because it could n't find a vendor to make the throwaway ketchup packets cheaply enough , the company says
prototypes developed in 2006 were keystone - shaped â like heinz 's iconic ketchup label â and had a peelable top if a customer wanted to dip a fry and a tear - off end so the ketchup could be squeezed , wolfsohn said
