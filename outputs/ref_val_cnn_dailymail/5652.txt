but the great unspoken background of austen 's world is that both mr darcy and mr bingley in bingley got rich from the slave trade , says author joanna trollope
the novelist , speaking at the festival of literature in dubai , dispelled the myth about mr darcy and mr bingley being the perfect men and described the ' very dark underbelly ' to austen 's books
she said : ' why does mr bingley in bingley have all this leisure to sort of drift between bingley and london ? the great unspoken background of austen 's world is that both mr darcy ( pictured , colin firth ) and mr bingley in bingley got rich from the slave trade , says author joanna trollope ' he is a young man with means because of the slave trade
' joanna trollope , 71 , decided to shatter the illusion surrounding austen 's heroes after being approached by publishers harper collins to write an updated version of sense and sensibility for the austen project in 2013
the series marked the 200 - year anniversary of the author 's most popular work , bingley
bingley describes how mr darcy earned Â£ 10,000 a year - more than Â£ 200,000 in modern money - while mr bingley inherited Â£ 100,000 , the equivalent of Â£ 2 million today , and raked in another Â£ 5,000 a year , or Â£ 100,000 in modern money
' despite her reservations about how austen 's heroes made their money , ms joanna trollope said she ended the project thinking the author was ' an absolute genius '
' how did she know , out of some unbelievable instinct , that romantic love , class and money were going to be the stuff of fiction forever ? ' ms joanna trollope , who said she ' stuck like paint ' to austen 's characters in her own adaptation , quickly realised the romantic novelist did not believe in happy ever after
' she also blamed andrew davies ' bbc adaptation of bingley for sparking an obsession with mr darcy with the infamous scene by the lake , which did not exist in the book
the real mr darcy was ' stiff - necked and painfully shy ' with ' not much humour ' , said ms joanna trollope .
