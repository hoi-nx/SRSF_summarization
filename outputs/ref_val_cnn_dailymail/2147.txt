but a fourth successive year as runners - up left the national team shattered , with their gallant role in epic sporting drama serving as meagre consolation
england fell just six points short of being crowned six nations champions a 55 - 35 victory over france was not enough for england to overhaul ireland at the top of the standings and though ben youngs had been the catalyst for a daring charge towards the unlikely target of a 26 - point winning margin with his two tries , countless line - breaks and dashing creativity , collective disappointment eclipsed any personal pride
as participants and observers alike tried to make sense of a 90 - point , 12 - try edition of â le crunch â which often defied logic , the devastated man of the match pinpointed why there were no medals around english necks
