marie , 34 , did n't suspect a thing when her fourth child , eloise , came into this world in may , 2012
â marie , who lives in basildon , essex , with her husband andrew , 50 , had already had three children ; jack , nine , adam , eight , orla jane , four , by the time she fell pregnant with eloise
â eloise in neonatal intensive care at portsmouth marie was rushed to basildon hospital but the staff there were unable to deal with babies born more prematurely than 27 weeks and instead arranged for her to be admitted to portsmouth hospital , two hours drive away
after administering her with an injection that helps babies to develop lungs in the womb quicker if they are at risk of premature birth , marie was taken by ambulance to portsmouth
eloise weighed just 1lb when she was born once there , marie had just two days to settle in before the shock birth occurred
â two of the midwives supported me while the third one helped to deliver eloise
â but being born so premature was nât the only battle facing eloise , she had also severely ill after picking up streptococcus a and b from her mother
marie said : â she was infected by the streptococcus a and b , because in the meantime i had also developed streptococcus b. â so , as she came out and we were n't prepared , she picked that up too
â marie practised reiki and psychic surgery on her daughter alongside traditional medicines given by the nhs but while the future looked bleak for her daughter , marie , who works as a spiritual healer , says that as she was put back into her hospital bed and her baby was rushed to the intensive care unit , she was possessed by total calm
â as the doctors used their traditional medicine on eloise , marie supplemented it with reiki and what she called â psychic surgery â
she believes it was a combination of these two methods that enabled eloise to fight through
father andrew with his daughter eloise in hospital marie said : â i would do reiki , which is universal energy giving
â i would also do psychic surgery , which is healing with the mind
â when eloise was taken home , she has to continue to be given oxygen after four months and two days in hospital , eloise was finally well enough to go home
doctors took the precaution of hooking eloise up to a portable oxygen tank for the following eight months
marie said : â she was on home oxygen but an incredibly small amount - 0.02 of home oxygen so a very low flow
â eloise is now a healthy two year old girl marie ( right ) with eloise , and her other children from left : adam , eight , jack , nine , and orla jane , four since then , the family have nât looked back â eloise is now as healthy as any other child her age
marie said : â she sailed through for a baby who had given birth ill and so early
