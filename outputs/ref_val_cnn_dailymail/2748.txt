over the last year jason has raised over Â£ 400 in a bid to raise funds for the special school aaron attends bursting with pride , lynn said : â he has always had such a loving personality and been so protective over aaron
â when aaron was younger , his speech was badly affected , so jason along with ourselves learnt sign language so aaron could communicate with us
â but they have also have their own way of communication - sometimes i ca nât quite decipher what aaron has said , but jason always knows and will explain for me
â so jason âs latest mission to help aaron does nât come as any surprise to lynn and her husband , jeff
he took it to aaron âs headmistress to gain her approval and set up a website to promote his charity , suportthenoun
they are nât just twin brothers , they are best of mates too ' jason , who is clearly very keen to support his brother âs school , said : â i decided it was a good idea because it does quite a lot for people born with disabilities and i wanted to do something for them
' the money raised will go towards a gardening project for the school

the plan is for older children to have a chance to run a gardening service and then offer the service to people so they can learn new skills and how to earn money
' lynn added : â we have been completely overwhelmed by jason 's determination and enthusiasm
â despite being born a minute after aaron , jason has always taken on the big brother role
lynn recalls : â when they were little jason would always keep a very watchful eye on aaron
â on their first day at school , jason kept a very close eye on aaron , knowing how hard it would be for him
