biohacking has brought us the ' frankenburger ' and vegan cheese but the latest developments could lead to cultured designer fragrances
experts in boston are developing a perfume that smells exactly like roses but is made from genetically engineered strains of yeast

they hope to use the technology to create a range of designer perfumes that even the most discerning customer wo n't be able to tell apart form the real thing the plans were revealed to aviva rutkin at new scientist by bioengineers from gingko bioworks
to make the cultured fragrance as close to the real thing as possible , the bioengineers at gingko bioworks coded the genes of the rose to discover which enzymes are responsible for producing its smell

from these enzymes the experts can identify specific chemical compounds involved in the odour
they then modify the genome of yeast to engineer multiple strains of the fungus which each produce different metabolic reactions
the key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the compounds found the scent of a rose

the key is to engineer reactions between microbes that create the same compounds found in the scent of a rose
and the firm told ms rutkin that this can involve adding genes from a rose or other plant to the yeast 's genome to force these reactions
the boston - based firm is working with flavours and fragrance company robertet and sends samples of each stage to the french firm for analysis and feedback
' we 're working on a number of cultured flowers where the scent of the wild flower is difficult or impossible to capture through traditional extraction - such as lily of the valley and hyacinth , ' jason kelly from gingko bioworks told mailonline
' perfumers would love to bring these novel scents to life in perfumes and using ginkgo 's technology to design cultured fragrances we hope to grant their wish
' ' the natural next step in the evolution of cultured foods is the advent of cultured ingredients , ' added gingko bioworks 's reshma shetty
' the mechanics of the process of making cultured ingredients is much the same as those used for thousands of years of cultured food production : the raw material ( often sugar ) is converted to the desired ingredient using microbes as processing aid

the patty was developed by professor mark post ( pictured ) of maastricht university in the netherlands and cost Â£ 250,000 to produce its creator , netherlands scientist mark post , believes it could revolutionise the food industry and help save the planet
more recently , biohackers in california discovered a way to create cheese protein genes based on sequences in cow dna , before growing them in baker âs yeast and using them to create a â milk â substitute
they optimised the genes for use in yeast and created the resulting yeast milk protein dna from scratch
this dna is then put into yeast cells where the cells take over and produce real milk - protein
