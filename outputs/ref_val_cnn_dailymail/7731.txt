for dundee united and celtic , the trilogy becomes a quadrilogy
already facing each other three times in three competitions at three different venues across the third month of the year , one final blast of beleaguered referee thomson âs whistle at tannadice ensured yet another instalment of this saga
for on an astonishing william hill scottish cup afternoon on tayside , nine - man dundee united fought to a valiant 1 - 1 draw against their 10 - man visitors
one , dished out to the luckless paul paton , was a monumentally unjust case of mistaken identity
leigh griffiths wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1 - 1 draw with dundee united celtic defender virgil van dijk ( right ) was sent off after only nine minutes of the william hill scottish cup quarter - final in a case of mistaken identity , the referee also sent off dundee united 's paul paton adding to the scandal , nadir ciftci , the dundee united striker who opened the scoring from the spot after team - mate connolly appeared to dive to win a penalty , should not have been on the park at all after kicking out at scott brown
and even after all that drama there was still room to plot in a villain - to - hero story , as leigh griffiths missed a penalty then scored an equaliser to break the heart of outstanding dundee united keeper cierzniak
leigh griffiths â beautiful header secured a replay at parkhead on march 18 â the second of three games in a week between the teams â although the celtic striker may now relinquish penalty duties
â i had the chance to get us back in it with the penalty but he saved it , â said leigh griffiths
' the referee points to the spot after connolly was brought down in the celtic box celtic keeper gordon fails to stop nadir ciftci from giving dundee united the lead dundee united 's nadir ciftci celebrates scoring the opening goal with a penalty the tone for a bizarre afternoon was set on nine minutes when scott brown went in hard on ciftci
in the same melee , butcher slid into virgil van dijk , who appeared to stamp down on the dundee united man as the pair tangled on the ground
and yet , after a three - minute discussion between referee thomson and his assistant graham chambers , red cards were issued to virgil van dijk and , astonishingly , the apparently blameless paul paton instead of butcher
as half - time approached , dundee united nearly took the lead when butcher âs mis - hit shot was diverted past gordon by ryan dow but the ball bounced back off the inside of the post and was hacked away to safety
unfortunately for him , however , the spot he chose was the bottom left post and the ball was cleared by dundee united âs relieved defence
dundee united have a second player sent off after paul dixon ( 3rd left ) receives his marching orders leigh griffiths missed his chance to equalise for celtic from the penalty spot it looked a dive but nadir ciftci did nât care about that as he ruthlessly cracked his spot kick low and hard beyond the diving gordon
within three minutes , dundee united were down to nine men when leigh griffiths â shot struck paul dixon on the arm as the dundee united defender attempted to block
leigh griffiths caught the ball well but dundee united goalkeeper cierzniak , so often criticised , pulled off a wonderful save to prevent celtic levelling
with dundee united moving to a 5 - 3 - 0 formation , it was like the alamo at times but there were great saves to come from cierzniak - from both stokes and substitute john guidetti
leigh griffiths makes up for his penalty miss by drawing celtic level with a header celtic captain scott brown celebrates with leigh griffiths as the game finishes in a 1 - 1 draw despite the one - way traffic , however , gordon had to look lively to stop butcher scoring on a rare dundee united counter
just as it looked like celtic âs treble dreams could come unstuck on an unacceptably poor tannadice pitch , leigh griffiths gained his redemption
