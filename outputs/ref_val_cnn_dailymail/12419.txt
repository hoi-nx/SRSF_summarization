minneapolis unexpected car repairs can blow anyone 's budget
but when you 're struggling to make ends meet , the impact can extend well beyond your bank account
as a social worker in minneapolis , heying repeatedly saw how car problems could create a domino effect that endangered her clients ' health , their jobs , even their homes
five years later , armed with a degree in auto technology , heying founded the lift
her nonprofit garage provides steeply discounted car repairs to low - income individuals
to date , heying has provided affordable car repairs to more than 300 low - income individuals , saving them more than $ 170,000 and keeping them on the road to success
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015 i talked with heying about her career change and what she 's learned from her work
i want to talk about feelings and people , and they want to talk about cars
but for the most part , i had no skills around car maintenance
" see more cnn heroes i give credit , at least in that first quarter , to one of my instructors who 's now on the board of the lift , who kept saying , " i know that you have a good vision here , and i 'm going to help you get through this
" and when i really thought about it , going to school is nothing compared to people who are trying to raise their kids on minimum wage , who are living with a broken - down car in subzero weather
toner : what 's it like being a mechanic ? heying : it 's physically hard
i think of being a mechanic a lot like being a doctor
people come in , they give you a list of symptoms
it 's a very satisfying job , when you can have a car come in not starting and you send it out the door running
and so that is another piece of the work that we do at the lift
how do they react ? heying : for the most part , people are ecstatic when they get the bill
and that just makes such a huge difference in people 's lives
we had a customer in here a few weeks ago who is sleeping in his car
and he had just gotten released from the hospital because he had frostbite because he did n't have heat in his car
and so it 's not just about getting people to and from work or to and from school , even though that 's a really important piece of it
it 's really about protecting people 's lives
for many people , having a car that works and that is safe holds the rest of the pieces together
