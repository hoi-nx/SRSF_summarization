miliband has been challenged on live tv over whether he regrets ' stabbing his brother in the back ' to win the labour leadership
he insisted that although the contest was ' bruising ' he thought he would make a better leader than brother david , and still does
it came as he was grilled by young voters on bbc three , who questioned him about trust , drugs and being weird
the surprise decision by miliband , his less experienced younger brother , to stand against sent shock waves through westminster and plunged their relationship into the deep freeze
but his decision to stand against his brother has proved to be one of the most potent aspects of his leadership remembered by voters , almost five years on
taking part in bbc three 's free speech programme , audience member alex hancock asked to applause : ' do you think the labour party would be in a better position if your brother was leader ? ' mr miliband replied : ' look i thought i was the best person for the job when i ran for leader , and i think that now
look , let me try to explain to you why i thought that
' it was obviously really tough for me to be in a contest with my brother , tough for him as well
i thought we needed to move on from labour
because i thought we 'd been a good government but on issues like iraq , inequality we got it wrong and we needed to move on
' i thought i was the best party to move the labour party on
and sure it was bruising and sure it was difficult but i thought that then and i think that now as well
' he was asked if he thought the labour party would be better off if his brother david had won the leadership election taking part in bbc three 's free speech programme , audience member alex hancock ( right ) asked mr miliband : ' so do you regret stabbing him in the back or not ? ' david miliband had been seen as a frontrunner for the labour leadership after gordon brown lost the election in 2010 but was narrowly beaten by younger brother miliband audience member fay asked mr miliband what he would do if he found cannabis in his son 's bedroom miliband would not call the police if he found cannabis in his son 's bedroom
he was challenged by audience member fay over whether he would support the decriminalisation of cannabis
if the government sends a signal that cannabis use is somehow ok , and we know there âs harder forms of cannabis and softer forms of cannabis , i think it âs sending the wrong signal
' fay responded : ' in a few years â time when your sons are teenagers and you find a bag of cannabis in your bedroom , will you be going to a doctor or will you be going to the police ? ' but the labour leader insisted : ' i âll be going to neither
it was tough at the time and it 's obviously healed since then
an audience member called john told the labour leader : ' you are often portrayed as a bit strange , a bit weird
' i had heard that , ' the labour leader laughed
he admitted the last labour government did not do enough on rented housing
