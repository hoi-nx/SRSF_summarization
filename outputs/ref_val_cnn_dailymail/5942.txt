a short circuit has temporarily rendered nasa 's curiosity inactive as engineers investigate the problem
the mars rover stopped work when an electrical problem was discovered while it was using its arm to move powder into its sample container
the severity of the problem is not yet known , but nasa said they expected to resume operations in several days if it can be resolved
a short circuit occurred in the rover 's arm as it was moving
nasa engineers in california are now investigating the problem
the rover ( shown here in a recent mosaic image taken by its arm ) had been transferring rock powder into a sample analysis container ' we are running tests on the vehicle in its present configuration before we move the arm or drive , ' said curiosity project manager jim erickson , of nasa 's jpl in pasadena , california
' the short circuit occurred while the rover was moving its arm on 27 february
nasa said that such a brief short could have little effect on rover operations , or it ' could prompt the rover team to restrict use of a mechanism '
some ops on hold while my team investigates a short circuit
' the rover 's top speed is 1.5 inches ( 3.8 centimetres ) per second
the fault occurred while the rover had been transferring rock powder collected by its drill on the arm to laboratory instruments on the rover

three days later , a fault - protection action by the rover halted a process of transferring sample powder that was collected during this drilling on twitter the official account for the rover , @ marscuriosity , said : ' call me johnny five [ pictured ]
