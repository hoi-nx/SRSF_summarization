a ' zombie ' parasite can turn animals to cannibalism , researchers have found
researchers looked at cannibalism among freshwater shrimp in northern ireland
they found a tiny parasite , pleistophora mulleri , not only significantly increased cannibalism among shrimp , but made infected shrimp more voracious , taking much less time to consume their victims
a tiny parasite , pleistophora mulleri , significantly increased cannibalism among shrimp - and caused them to eat in a frenzy dr dunn said : ' our research does not suggest any link between parasites and human cannibalism
' however , cannibalism for the shrimp , unlike in humans , is a significant source of food even in uninfected animals
' it seems unlikely that a parasite would be under evolutionary pressure to influence cannibalism in humans
they found a tiny parasite , pleistophora mulleri , not only significantly increased cannibalism among the indigenous shrimp gammarus duebeni celticus but made infected shrimp more voracious , taking much less time to consume their victims
' the research , published in royal society open science today , reports that although consumption of juveniles by adults is a normal feature of the shrimp 's feeding patterns , shrimp infected with the parasite ate twice as much of their own kind as uninfected animals
mandy bunke , a phd student at the university of leeds who was the key researcher on the study , said : ' although the parasite is tiny â similar in size to a human red blood cell â there are millions of them in the host muscle and they all rely on the host for food
' interestingly , our group has also found previously that infected shrimp may be able to catch and eat less prey of other animal species
researchers say their study does not suggest any link between parasites and human cannibalism dr dunn said : ' the parasite is passed to its new host either when it dies and is eaten by another shrimp , or when one shrimp cannibalises another
' infected shrimp do n't avoid infected juveniles
