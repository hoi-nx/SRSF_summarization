the chinese government has declared the internet to be the new battlefield in its fight against " pornography and unlawful information
chinese 's internet model is one of extreme control
" under the guise of a campaign to ensure social stability , the chinese authorities suppress online debate on a range of legitimate issues
while the new battlefield is virtual , the impact on people 's lives is real and devastating
since president xi came to power , hundreds of people have been detained solely for expressing their peaceful views online
it is women 's rights activists , anti-corruption and environmental campaigners , and those urging debate on political and legal reforms who fall foul of online censors
her apparent " crime " was to have posted comments online in support of hong kong 's pro-democracy protests
last june , she was sentenced to six years in prison on the charge of " picking quarrels and provoking troubles " for publicly calling on the chinese government to step up the fight against corruption
liu ping 's online posts of photos of her holding banners calling for transparency , and transcripts of skype chats with foreign media , were used to condemn her at her trial
this online attack is part of the worst crackdown against freedom of expression in chinese in more than a decade
the chinese authorities abuse the law to suppress online freedom and target critical voices , yet have the guile to portray such persecution as evidence of the rule of law in action
internet companies doing business in chinese must also take all possible efforts to avoid contributing to human rights abuses
chinese 's charismatic " internet czar , " lu wei , extolls the concept of " internet sovereignty " and promotes it as an acceptable global model
internet sovereignty in chinese equals censorship and persecution ; a web to trap thousands of individuals peacefully expressing different views online
for every online critic the chinese authorities imprison , there are scores more prepared to speak out despite the risks
the battle to promote internet sovereignty and silence all critical voices is one the chinese authorities must not be allowed to win
