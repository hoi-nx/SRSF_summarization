both sides have denied using chlorine gas in the attacks , which are believed to be dropped onto villages using helicopters
the assad regime and the rebels have accused each other of using chemical agents , including chlorine , in the nearly four - year war that has killed more than 210,000 us secretary of state john kerry said he was ' deeply disturbed ' by the reports of renewed use of chlorine gas , last used widely in world war one
