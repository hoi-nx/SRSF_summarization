mr and wood started working for the duke and duchess of cambridge in september last year when restoration work was being completed on the georgian mansion

mrs carole has previously been said to be a frequent visitor to anmer hall
but news of the middletons â involvement in running the cambridge family home comes at a time when reports suggest that prince charles is growing anxious about how little he sees his grandchild
at the moment carole is getting everything in place because the baby is due around april 25
â the couple have been left in the lurch since housekeepers amy and colin wood , their valuable husband - and - wife team , quit last month the middletons were the first to meet prince george after his birth in 2013 â ahead of charles and his wife camilla â and it seems they are set to be favourites when it comes to getting access to george âs brother or sister too

officials were forced to announce the duchess of cambridge 's pregnancy in september , which was earlier than planned , because her acute morning sickness meant she was forced to cancel a number of public engagements
