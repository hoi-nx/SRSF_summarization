on trial : speaking at gloucester crown court ( above ) , prosecutor tara wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of about Â£ 42,500 to which they were not entitled the defence argued that it therefore counted as a gift , but when prosecutor , tara wolfe , asked the witness : ' would a gift of Â£ 40,000 be eligible for pension credit ?

mrs gregory also argued that the Â£ 40,000 given to grant by her mother was clearly a loan and did not count as income
