a brave transgender teenager came out in front of his entire class
tom , 13 , of fresno , california , first read the suicide note written by leelah alcorn , another tragic teen who took her own life at the end of last year
he then told the students ; ' i am no longer mia
i never really was ' tom ( above with glee star lauren potter ) when he was mia the middle school student then said ; ' and now i finally stand before you in my true and authentic gender identity as tom
i stand before you as a 13 - year - old boy
' tom then detailed his struggle over the past few years , and what it took to bring him to the moment where he made this announcement
he eloquently explained his challenges , saying ; ' for a while , i dismissed the fact that i hated my body
i pretended to be content with what i was assigned until , at a certain point , i broke
' tom began his speech by reading the tragic suicide note of leelah alcorn ( above ) he then added ; ' i went through a series of horrible breakdowns
and i would stand under the water in the shower crying
i knew i was n't happy
' he also took some time to let other students know if they were struggling with their sexual identity or orientation , he was there for them
' i want you to know that if no one else accepts you , i always will , ' he said
if you are reading this , it means that i have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue
the life i would 've lived is n't worth living in â¦ because i 'm transgender
i could go into detail explaining why i feel that way , but this note is probably going to be lengthy enough as it is
i never knew there was a word for that feeling , nor was it possible for a boy to become a girl , so i never told anyone and i just continued to do traditionally ' boyish ' things to try to fit in
when i was 14 , i learned what transgender meant and cried of happiness
i immediately told my mom , and she reacted extremely negatively , telling me that it was a phase , that i would never truly be a girl , that god does n't make mistakes , that i am wrong
if you are reading this , parents , please do n't tell this to your kids
even if you are christians or are against transgender people do n't ever say that to someone , especially your kid
the longer you wait , the harder it is to transition
at the end of the school year , my parents finally came around and gave me my phone and let me back on social media
the only way i will rest in peace is if one day transgender people are n't treated the way i was , they 're treated like humans , with valid feelings and human rights
my death needs to be counted in the number of transgender people who commit suicide this year
goodbye , ( leelah alcorn ) josh alcorn
