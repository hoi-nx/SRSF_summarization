prize - winning irish setter jagger was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of belgium a prize - winning irish setter allegedly ' murdered ' at crufts was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of belgium , according to the kennel club
three - year - old jagger collapsed and died at his owner 's home in tongeren , belgium , 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at the world 's biggest dog show
but the kennel club , which runs crufts , said toxicology reports revealed the fast - acting poison was consumed 28 hours after the dog show
caroline kisko , club secretary , said two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for jagger 's death
she said : ' there has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to crufts that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons , thought to be on a piece of beef , were eaten in belgium , shortly before jagger 's death
' we have had confirmation , including from independent toxicologists , that the poisons identified in the toxicology report - carbofuran and aldicarb - are fast acting
' considering we are told that jagger showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in belgium , late on friday march 6 night , leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention , we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at crufts on thursday march 5 , some 28 to 36 hours earlier
