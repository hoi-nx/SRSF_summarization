david duckenfield admitted calling for police dogs instead of ambulances as fans were being crushed to death the police chief on duty during the hillsborough disaster has admitted calling for police dogs instead of ambulances as fans were being crushed to death
but david duckenfield denied his mindset was focused on hooliganism rather than safety at the inquest into the deaths of 96 liverpool fans during the fa cup semi-final in april 1989
the retired officer , 70 , has already made a series of admissions about ' mistakes ' he made , confessed that he lied in the aftermath and apologised ' unreservedly ' to fans ' families
but at that time transcripts of tape recordings made in the police control box where the match commander was stationed showed a subordinate officer calling for police dogs
can you explain that ? why on earth do you need dogs at the stadium ? ' mr david duckenfield said he had ' no idea ' other than he wanted to create a ' secure area ' for the rescue operation
' at 3.06pm mr david duckenfield called for operational support , a request for all available officers in the force area to go to the stadium
' the inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back - up from dog - handlers
on the day of the disaster , police became overwhelmed by fans at the turnstiles as kick - off approached and mr david duckenfield gave the order at 2.52pm to open gates to let them in
but mr david duckenfield , as match commander , had not ordered this to be closed , which was a ' blunder of the first magnitude ' , the inquest jury heard
some 96 liverpool fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded leppings lane terrace around 2,000 fans poured in through gate c ( pictured ) , many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them , which had not been closed off by police ninety - six liverpool fans died in the ensuing crush minutes later on the terraces of sheffield wednesday 's hillsborough ground as the fa cup semi-final against nottingham forest kicked off
' the inquest heard that a request for a fleet of ambulances to attend hillsborough was made around two minutes and 40 seconds after the call for back - up from dog - handlers accusing mr david duckenfield of showing little , if any , organisation or control while in the control box , mr menon asked the witness : ' your leadership and co-ordination and emergency response was woefully inadequate from start to finish ? ' mr david duckenfield answered : ' i disagree , sir
' mr menon then asserted : ' your mistake ( in failing to foresee where fans would go or close the tunnel ) was the most terrifyingly bad mistake that fell woefully below the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent match commander , was n't it ? ' mr david duckenfield responded : ' sir , i have made my admissions , i take it no further
' mr menon continued : ' it was gross negligence and ultimately it caused the disaster and the deaths of 96 liverpool fans , did n't it ? ' mr david duckenfield answered : ' no , sir
he denied taking part in a ' cover - up ' designed to divert blame from the police by ascribing the disaster to liverpool fans ' bad behaviour
