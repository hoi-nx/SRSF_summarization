this is according to a new study that has combined 18 - years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites
the researchers claim that some ice shelves in antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years
during the study period 's first half , to about 2003 , the overall volume decline around antarctica was small , with antarctica losses almost balanced out by gains in east antarctica
after that , western losses accelerated and gains in the east ended
' there has been more and more ice being lost from antarctica 's floating ice shelves , ' said glaciologist fricker of the scripps at the university of california , san diego
under some ice shelves , cold and fresh meltwater rises to a point where it refreezes onto the ice shelf the crosson ice shelf in the amundsen and the venable ice shelf in the bellingshausen , both in antarctica , each shrank about 18 percent during the study period
' if the loss rates that we observed during the past two decades are sustained , some ice shelves in the amundsen and bellingshausen seas could disappear within this century , ' added scripps geophysics doctoral candidate fernando paolo
the melting of these ice shelves does not directly affect sea levels because they are already floating
but the floating ice shelves provide a restraining force for land - based ice , and their reduction would increase the flow of the ice from the land into the ocean , which would increase sea levels
' while it is fair to say that we 're seeing the ice shelves responding to climate change , we do n't believe there is enough evidence to directly relate recent ice shelf losses specifically to changes in global temperature , ' fricker said
oceanographer and co-author padman of earth & space research in corvallis , oregon said for a few west antarctic ice shelves , ice loss can be related fairly directly to warming air temperatures
much of the increased melting elsewhere is probably due to more warm water getting under the ice shelves because of increasing winds near antarctica , padman added
