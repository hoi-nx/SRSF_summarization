modern british men are more hands - on than ever before when it comes to household chores , according to a new survey
researchers found that millions of men are more than happy to tackle a range of tasks their fathers would rarely encounter , with one in ten doing the bulk of the cleaning , polishing and dusting in the home
in fact , one in five men are in charge of cooking dinner every night , while one in ten regularly do the family washing
a new survey has found that british men are more involved in household chores than ever - with 60per cent happy to prepare dinner every night and do the washing up afterwards as well the study of 2,000 modern couples found the gender roles in the home are now being rewritten , with more than three quarters of women saying they are happy to tackle jobs that might previously have been tasked to the man of the house such emptying gutters and mowing the lawn
the research , conducted by karcher , also found two thirds of women will actively attempt jobs around the home their mum might have avoided or just left to the man of the house
' the study revealed more than half of men feel they do much more domestic work around the house than their fathers ever did in terms of chores
and six in ten men said they would be willing to sort the dinner every night and the washing up afterwards as well
other jobs that men are happy to do around the home were found to be ironing , tending to the kids and cleaning
so it may not come as a surprise that 84 per cent of british adults in a relationship believe the modern generation of men should be happier to do any of the kind of cleaning , washing or other domestic chores around the home
