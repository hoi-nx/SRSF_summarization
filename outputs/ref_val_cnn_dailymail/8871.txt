a decorated british army officer who devoted his retirement to helping troops serving on the frontline shot himself after allegedly feeling â harassed â by a former aide to thatcher , the mail on sunday can reveal
brigadier david martin , 57 , ended his life after receiving phone calls and a â harassing voicemail â over a Â£ 300,000 dispute involving his military charity
brig martin was a director and trustee of uk4u thanks , a charity founded in 2005 which works with the mod ( mod ) to deliver uk4u christmas food parcels to troops in war zones
diane martin - pictured with son will , centre , and her late husband david - says the david martin felt he would be â the sacrificial lamb â in a row between uk4u and a businessman who pr man hugh colver was representing in a letter to friends and family breaking the news , his widow said the brigadier was left agitated after speaking to pr man hugh colver earlier this month , saying he felt he would be â the sacrificial lamb â in a row between uk4u and a businessman who mr hugh colver was representing
the founding businessman felt that he had never been properly recompensed for his initial ( very substantial ) outlay â despite formal arbitration and subsequent revisiting of the arbitration by legal teams
neither the charity nor the mod could legally â pay off â a claim that was unsubstantiated , so he concluded ( again in his letter ) that he would be the sacrificial lamb that would have to be found â guilty â in order that the claims could be settled
â just hours after speaking to mr hugh colver , a former director of communications for the conservative party , brig martin wrote a suicide note and killed himself in the grounds of his cotswolds family home near avening in gloucestershire
' brought in to mediate ' : hugh colver said he was ' deeply saddened ' by brig martin 's death when questioned by the mail on sunday , mr hugh colver confirmed he had attempted to persuade brig martin to negotiate with businessman briggs , who in 2005 provided uk4u with hundreds of thousands of pounds of start - up cash
mr hugh colver , from westbury , wiltshire , said : â as far as i know brigadier david martin and i did not know each other previously but he was aware of who i was and my background
â a friend of brig martin claimed that mr hugh colver adopted an â icy tone â in their conversations , but the pr man insisted : â i absolutely refute any suggestion that i was threatening and i was deeply saddened to learn of his death , this is tragic , ghastly
â brig martin was made a commander of the british empire ( cbe ) during a glittering military career
