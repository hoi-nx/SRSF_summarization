whether you 're suffering from dehydration due to low cabin humidity or suffering from pain in your ear canal during takeoff and landing , everything from oxygen deprivation to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell in the air
here are some of the scariest health effects of flying ... and some suggestions to prevent and combat them
everything from dehydration to inactivity can contribute to passengers feeling unwell while in the air dehydration while bodies are most comfortable at around 50 percent humidity , an aeroplane 's cabin humidity can be as low as 10 per cent
according to nhs , the symptoms of dehydration include ' dizziness or light - headedness , headache , tiredness , dry mouth , lips and eyes , and the passing of small amounts of urine infrequently
' dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina and dry sinuses , nostrils and throat that make you far more prone to infection
combat all of this by drinking plenty of water and keeping away from beverages with diuretic properties , like alcohol or coffee
low humidity in cabin air means that passengers should keep diuretic beverages , like alcohol , to a minimum ear pain ever wondered exactly why you feel pain in your ears during takeoff and landing ? it turns out that the uncomfortable feeling a product of the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure to build up within the ear canal
ear pain during take off and landing is due to the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure in this instance , the best bet for preventing nausea is to book a seat over the wings , which is the steadiest part of the plane
the lower pressure in the cabin can also affect your blood circulation , which could lead to swelling in your lower extremities - especially on long haul flights when you 're cramped in your seat
deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) occurs when blood clots develop in the legs due to long periods of inactivity dvt deep vein thrombosis ( or dvt ) occurs when blood clots develop within the deep veins of the legs , causing pain and swelling
on long - haul flights , your exposure to radiation from cosmic rays , energetic particles from space , is higher radiation exposure while on international flights , you 're exposed to more than a tiny amount of radiation from cosmic rays , which are energetic particles from space , mostly made up of protons
the longer the flight and the higher and closer the plane flies to the north pole , the greater the dose of radiation that crew and passengers alike will experience
several studies have found also that cancer rates among flight personnel are marginally higher than the rest of the general population , although a recent cdc ( cdc ) report did not find further support of such a claim
however , the cdc does admit that experts are still not sure of the health risks associated with cosmic radiation and because you can not see or feel it , often people do not just precisely when they are being exposed
' when flying , a passenger is 100 times more at risk to catch a common cold than when not on a plane common cold finally , and what may seem insignificant in comparison to the other risks that befall frequent travellers , those who travel often may be at a greater risk for catching a common cold
a 2004 study in the journal of environmental health research found that when you 're flying , your risk for catching a cold is over 100 times higher than when you 're not on a plane
