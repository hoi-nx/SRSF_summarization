method of choice : double murderer ron lafferty has chosen to die by firing squad it is a macabre choice to make - and almost unique to some inmates on utah 's death row : would you be injected with toxic chemicals , or shot in the heart ? but , amid cries of outrage against the southwestern state bringing death by firing quad back into law , almost half of those due to die that way have picked the punishment themselves
ron lafferty , who slit the throats of his sister - in - law and her baby daughter in 1984 , is one of three who has opted to die by the bullet
two others in utah 's eight - strong death row have made the same choice , the los angeles times reported - though it is not clear who they are
the recent change in utah 's execution law revived the firing squad as a back - up method , in case no lethal injection drugs are available it was outlawed in 2004 , before which time inmates such as lafferty had been able to choose between the two
in practice , utah has no doses of lethal injection , and no way to acquire more
that situation means anybody the state executes is likely to be put before a firing squad - five marksmen with .30 - caliber winchester rifles - whatever their preference
the state is not due to kill anybody for several years yet , so a new source could be found - though many drugs manufacturers now refuse to do business with governments that carry out capital punishment
' we regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued
others : two other inmates have requested death by firing squad
' refusal : douglas carter , pictured , has asked for lethal injection - but may be killed by firing squad anyway if none can be found the move follows a series of high - profile botched executions around the united states in 2014 and 2015 , many due to concerns about the efficacy of lethal injection drugs
the last firing squad death in utah , and the united states , was that of ronnie lee gardner in 2010
a new york times report said that he told a utah judge ' i would like the firing squad , please ' a few weeks before his execution date
' ' i like the firing squad
unlike lethal injections , death by firing squad leaves some of an inmates ' organs - such as the eyes , kidneys and liver - unspoilt for donation , so long as they are not hit by stray bullets
