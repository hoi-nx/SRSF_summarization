raising the legal tobacco age to 21 across america would lower the number of premature deaths by almost 250,000 , according to new research
the report , issued by the institute of medicine , examined the public health impact of increasing the age across the america to 19 , 21 or 25
and it concluded that if it were to be raised to 21 now , it would result in about 249,000 fewer premature deaths for people born between 2000 and 2019
four states - alabama , alaska , new jersey and utah - have set the age at 19 and several localities , including new york city , have raised the minimum age to 21
but in some areas you have to be older : 19 : alabama , alaska , new jersey , utah 21 : suffolk county ; new york city ; evanston , illinois ; columbia , missouri ; a number of towns in massachusetts ; englewood , new jersey and hawaii county , hawaii increasing the federal age would take an act of congress , which mandated the report in a 2009 law that gave the food and drug administration authority to regulate tobacco
raising the legal age for buying tobacco to 21 could mean 45,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer and 4.2million fewer years of life lost for the same generation , the report suggests that decrease would rise to 12 percent if it were to be raised to age 21 and 16 percent if it were raised to age 25
