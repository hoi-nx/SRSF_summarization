an ancient ring has shed new light on the ties between vikings and the islamic world , more than a century after its discovery
the finger ring found in a 9th century swedish grave is inscribed with arabic kufic writing
the letters appear to read " al_llh , researchers say , which they interpret as meaning " for / to ( the approval of ) allah
" in a paper published in the journal scanning , the researchers say it is the only ring with an arabic inscription ever found at a scandinavian archaeological site
the ring is part of the swedish history museum 's collection , originally cataloged as being made of gilded silver and violet amethyst , bearing the inscription " allah
" researchers led by stockholm university biophysicist sebastian w達造rml達造nder say they used " scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy ( eds ) to analyze the ring 's composition and found that it was in fact made of silver alloy and the " amethyst " was colored glass
" more significantly , the researchers found no trace of the gold that had been assumed to coat the ring and noted the presence of filing marks
" the team , therefore , believes the ring was passed from an arabic silversmith to the woman , with few or any other owners in between
while imported coins were also found in the grave -- many from afghanistan -- they were " usually worn and torn ... from passing many hands along the established trade routes " researchers said
the owner of the ring was found wearing traditional scandinavian clothing , but the researchers said it was impossible to determine her ethnicity due to the decomposed state of the bones in the grave
