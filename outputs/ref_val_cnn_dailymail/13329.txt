superheroes have always had a special place in my heart
i grew up in zambian in the 1980s , an era that marked the beginning of the country 's worst economic crisis
my childhood memories are of a prolonged state of emergency that was characterized by acute food shortages and an economic decline where the basic needs of the average zambian family were barely met
my siblings and i -- and our gang of friends from around the farmlands -- spent countless hours sitting on a deserted piggery wall , perfecting our extra-terrestrial code language
our goal was to send an sos out to the superheroes in the galaxies , and had our code language been refined enough to reach across the chasm of space , perhaps a spaceship would come down to earth to save us from our dreary lives and carry us away into outer space
searching for superheroes rewind to just a few years earlier -- in the mid to late 1970s and before the economic decline -- when superheroes like superman , spiderman , batman and the incredible hulk were huge deals for anyone growing up
in our childhood eyes , these were powerful , all - embodying beings , and their brands were merchandised on t - shirts , caps , lunchboxes , toys , and just about everything
they influenced many aspects of the childhood experience to such an extent that i spent a lot of my formative years aspiring to become a superhero when i grew up
but then disillusionment set in
" a work in progress , " the revolutionist " is set in the near future , on a satellite colony that is located a little off the orbit of mainland earth , and administrated by a corporation
