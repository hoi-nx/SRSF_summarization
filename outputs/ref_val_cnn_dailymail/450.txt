switch off ? the sale of halogen bulbs could be banned as part of the eu 's energy - saving drive the sale of halogen bulbs which are used in millions of homes could be banned as early as next year as part of the eu âs energy - saving drive
it follows the prohibition of traditional incandescent bulbs , which have been phased out in an effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions
the ec and green campaigners say halogens are not much more efficient than traditional bulbs so should be replaced by energy - saving compact fluorescent bulbs â known as cfls â and leds
yet these alternatives can be as much as 15 times more expensive
there is the additional problem that some leds do not work with the dimmer switches and wiring circuits currently used by halogen bulbs , while cfls can take up to five minutes to reach full brightness
â and a campaign group of manufacturers called lightingeurope is demanding any ban on halogens is delayed until 2020 at the earliest , in order to minimise the impact on consumers and the industry
the industry supports the change to more energy efficient lighting ... however , an earlier date does not allow for alternative developing technologies to be widely available
the new bulbs last longer and , because they are more energy efficient , they will cut electricity bills over time
typically , halogens use 10 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs , while cfls use 60 - 80 per cent less and leds up to 90 per cent less
