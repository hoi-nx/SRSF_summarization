kp has been given no assurances about a return to england âs set - up in a phone call with the new power - broker of english cricket
mixed messages coming out of the ecb have left the impression the door is open to the maverick batsman , who was sacked last year after the ashes debacle
but incoming ecb chairman colin graves , who takes over from kp âs arch - opponent giles clarke on may 15 , has spoken to the 34 - year - old and made it clear there are no guarantees â even if he scores heavily for surrey on his expected county comeback
kp will return to surrey in the summer to play in the lv = county championship incoming ecb chairman colin graves has made it clear there are no guarantees colin graves , who instigated the conversation , hoped to keep it confidential but the tenor of the chat was that kp âs england future rests entirely with the selectors , who would consider form as well as other aspects â such as upsetting team spirit â when picking the test side this summer
though colin graves told kp he would not interfere with selection , having never done so as chairman of yorkshire , kp ( right ) remains so enthused about the slim possibility of playing for england again that he will commit himself to surrey this season
â surrey still have to agree the detail of kp âs re-engagement but he is expected to fulfil at least some of his Â£ 205,000 ipl contract with sunrisers hyderabad
kp has hinted he could change his ipl contract in a bid to push for an england place after playing for the big bash league 's melbourne stars , kp has signed with the sunrisers hyderabad england cricket managing director paul downton said he watched every ball of that game and had never seen a player so disengaged from his team - mates
