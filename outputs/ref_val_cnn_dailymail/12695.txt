these are the traits the next police chief in ferguson , missouri , will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police
smith is the police chief in sanford , florida , another community rocked by racial tensions and poor police - community relations after the high - profile shooting of a black teenager -- the 2012 death of trayvon martin
and if smith 's experience is any guide , it will take " a lot of prayer and a little goading " to convince someone to step into the job vacated this week by chief jackson
and how : -- the community remains deeply scarred by the events last year , after the august shooting death of unarmed american - american teenager michael brown by a white ferguson officer wilson , and the november decision by the st. louis county grand jury not to charge wilson , who later resigned
occasionally violent protests and sometimes heavy - handed responses by police deepened divisions and distrust
-- the police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week 's release of a damning department of justice report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of ferguson officials
the decision for jackson to step aside was a mutual one between the chief and city , mayor knowles told reporters
" the city of ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity
to get there , it might look to sanford for guidance
while no police officers were involved in the shooting , anger over their perceived failure to arrest the teenager 's killer , zimmerman , pushed relations in the community to a boiling point , eventually resulting in the firing of chief bill lee
a former boss in illinois suggested he look at the job , so he traveled to florida on his own time , getting to know the community and learning what divided residents and police
after taking the job , smith made it a point of spending time " walking and talking " in sanford , building relationships with community leaders and everyday residents
the new chief in ferguson will likely need to do some of the same things , smith says
" to police leadership consultant john vanek , whoever takes over the ferguson department will need to have the same leadership traits valued in boardrooms across the world -- the ability to form partnerships across organizational lines , to think differently , to turn failure into success and to do it all in a harsh media spotlight
" there 's going to be a lot of hostility in ferguson for a long time , " he said
so will the new chief need to be american to help defuse the racial tensions roiling the city ? here 's the politic answer : find the right candidate , regardless of race
" you want to find the best candidate to be police chief , " said attorney crump , who has represented the families of both trayvon martin and michael brown
it 's very important that the police officers understand the communities , at least want to engage with members of the community they are going to be protecting and serving
