' sara , wife of the winning trainer and daughter of the lord oaksey , who bred coneygree , said : ' he ( lord oaksey ) is not here , but he 's here in spirit
' i 'd been saying to people , when we win the gold cup we 'll win the lottery , it 's that amazing
' ' it 's only his fourth run over fences , but he had so much time off and he 's wise in his own way
' lady oaksey said : ' i 've been asking myself what decision would john ( lord oaksey ) have made ? as it turned out , it was a very good decision after looking at vautour and don poli ( in the novice chases )
' to win this now - you dream and it 's absolutely amazing

' it 's a little bit back to work later as my favourite person , carruthers , runs tomorrow ( at uttoxeter ) , but i might not be at my best ! ' it shows anyone can do it , you do n't need millions ' he did n't know he 's a novice

' paying tribute to the winner , ap mccoy said : ' fair do 's to the bradstocks for running him
