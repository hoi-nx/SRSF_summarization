just before a new $ 6million sports center bearing her name was opened last fall , beach volleyball star may-treanor said she was excited to be involved in the club and give back to her local southern california community
but six months later , the three - time olympic gold medalist 's office at the mmtsc is empty after a mysterious fallout with her longtime trainer rangel , who founded the irvine facility

' may - may-treanor has n't been seen at the gym since october , a month before it 's official opening and since then parents have been getting angrier and angrier walking past her perennially empty office
and in a meeting with rangel , volleyball mom peters threatened to stop paying , saying she felt her 15 - year - old daughter was n't getting the advertised program ( parents at the facility pay $ 4,300 for a seven - month season )
rangel wanted to built a state - of - the - art sports facility , while may - may-treanor wanted to coach so it made the perfect project for the pair
