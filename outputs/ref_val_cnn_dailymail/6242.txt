former england spinner swann has called on the england and wales cricket board to realise their approach is ' out of date ' , saying that there is a ' stubbornness ' about their selection policy and that they are ' living in the past '
swann watched on as england slumped to another heavy world cup loss , with sri lanka chasing down their 309 for six with ease , winning with nine wickets and 16 balls to spare
the defeat goes alongside reverses against australia and new zealand , with scotland the only team england have beaten so far
writing on twitter , he said : ' a positive thing that can come of this world cup is that maybe the top brass will realise just how out of date our approach is
' swann also aired his views on bbc , adding that england had been overly pleased to get what he considered to be an average score
' swann feels the answer could lie with former nottinghamshire team - mate alex hales
' there 's a bit of stubbornness about the selection policy , ' he added
' i like gary ballance , he 's a great lad , but i think even he 'd admit that he should n't be in the team at the minute , he 's in horrible form
