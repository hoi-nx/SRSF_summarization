a republicans state senator from maine is in hot water after posting an image on facebook that suggested american president obama is going easy on the isis terror army because it includes some of his family
' why have n't i done anything about isis ? because i 'll deal with them at the family reunion , ' its caption reads
' willette apparently found it on the ' news today ' facebook feed , which supplies a daily diet of anti-obama , anti-clinton and anti-islam material including ' meme ' photos , videos and cartoons
' common sense ' : mike willette 's campaign postcards from the 2014 election season called him a ' rare breed of public servant ' ' i apologize for posting this on facebook , ' willette 's statement read
' like too many people these days , i fell into the trap of posting something first and then thinking later
' the maine democratic party pounced on the scandal , saying willette 's behavior was ' extremely disappointing and shows a severe lack of judgement
' ' this reflects very poorly on the maine gop and we urge their leadership to denounce sen. willette 's actions , ' wrote party chairman phil bartlett
he switched parties when the maine gop took over control of the state senate .
