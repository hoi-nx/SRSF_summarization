a powdered alcohol intended to be mixed up into drinks has gained approval from a federal regulator
the product , called palcohol , had received the greenlight from the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau briefly last year before the bureau backtracked and said the label approvals had been given in error
dry booze : a brand of powdered alcohol has been approved by the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau
the maker of palcohol hopes to start selling the product by summer
a few of their flavors of powdered alcohol seen above the approval is a step forward for a small company whose product plans have already sparked controversy
several states have already moved to ban powdered alcohol , including lawmakers in colorado who last month advanced legislation to temporarily halt its sale
that bill has since morphed to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it gets federal approval
a statement on palcohol 's website says the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer
