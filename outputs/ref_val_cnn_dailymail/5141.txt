woodman has been warned by newcastle legend alan shearer
woodman â the england under-19 goalkeeper who is currently tim krul 's no.2 at st james ' park â was presented with the jack hixon trophy by alan shearer earlier this week

he won the european championships last summer , has been a regular on the newcastle bench this season - despite his tender years - and starred in newcastle 's run to the last eight of the fa youth cup
alan shearer , though , has told woodman all of that will count for nothing if he fails to come good on his undoubted potential
alan shearer said to me that some of the names who have won it have not gone on to achieve what they should have done
' woodman 's chances of making it big will undoubtedly be aided by the presence of tim krul
the young custodian was newcastle 's penalty - shootout hero during last month 's victory at sunderland in the fa youth cup , mimicking the world cup antics of the dutchman
tim krul made headlines around the world when he saved two spot - kicks in holland 's shootout win over costa rica in brazil
and woodman , whose dad andy is magpies goalkeeping coach , said : ' every time we do penalties i think of tim. ' the shootout at sunderland was one of my best moments in football , up there with the euros
alan shearer has told woodman to make use of his potential and prove that he can be a great goalkeeper newcastle 's no 2 keeper woodman was presented with the jack hixon trophy by alan shearer earlier this week ' the feeling of saving the penalty and the fans singing my name was a moment i ' ll remember for a long time
a lot of people might think tim krul does n't have time for the young keepers , but he 's absolutely top class
tim krul ( right ) has taken woodman under his wing at newcastle and is teaching him the tricks woodman says newcastle 's no 1 goalkeeper tim krul will ' say when i 'm rubbish and say when i 'm good ' ' i would love to do that
' london - born woodman followed his dad to the north-east three years ago and , given his position on alan pardew 's backroom team , he admits it was n't easy to be accepted by his peers
' it 's brilliant having my dad as coach , but it 's been hard as well , ' he said
' woodman was on the bench at spurs earlier in the season when jak alnwick needed lengthy treatment
woodman is looking to get a first team opportunity from newcastle manager carver this season woodman says he feels like he 's ' having a kickabout with my mates ' but will hope to get carver 's attention ' when the gaffer turned around and said , " fred , get warmed up " , you do get a feeling where you think , " woah , this is big " , ' he said
