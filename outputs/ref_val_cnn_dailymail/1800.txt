administrators at a catholic university in florida agreed to help an honors student start a campus club that would send money and supplies to the isis terror army
hidden camera footage released monday morning shows officials and faculty at barry university advising a senior â identified only as ' laura ' â about the best way to secure funding for a club she called ' sympathetic students in support of the isis
' ' i want to start fundraising efforts on campus , and what i want to do is raise funds to send overseas , ' she told bley , the school 's coordinator for leadership development and student organizations
bley offered to help her create the organization and agreed with her request to ' pass out isis state flags and educate people ' at an annual student ' festival of nations ' fair
the video is from james o'keefe , a conservative ' guerilla film - making group ' that last week captured a cornell university dean agreeing that isis and hamas would be welcome at the ivy league school
' we 're not here to limit people and their clubs , he said
' ' we 're here to support that ' : bley explained that his office would n't make judgments about the kinds of activities and clubs college students wanted to sign up for the only objection ? asking students to support a group with ' isis ' in its name , a multicultural program coordinator thought , might hold the organization back â so why not rename it ? laura put the murderous isis army 's credentials front - and - center
' they are terrorists , ' she told bley , ' but , like , we 're trying to help them
we 're trying to , like , educate them and give them funding so that they do n't have to be impoverished and get involved in acts of violence

in a statement provided to daily mail online by the university , smith , vice president for student affairs , said , ' there has been no formation of an isis - related humanitarian aid group at barry university ' and that ' no paperwork ' has ' ever ' been filed to create such an organization
