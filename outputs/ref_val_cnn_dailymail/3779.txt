the mouth - watering prospect of the clasico at the nou camp does put the premier league into perspective in a week of europe failure
in those champions league games there were five english players in the three starting xis
lionel messi , luis suarez and neymar jnr will be in action for barcelona on sunday night cristiano ronaldo , gareth bale and karim benzema will be hoping to fire real madrid to victory in the clasico fernandinho was signed by man city for Â£ 35million from shakhtar donetsk in 2013 man city became the last english team to be knocked out of the champions league last week man city 's players leave the nou camp looking glum after being eliminated by barcelona tottenham 's ryan mason has enjoyed an impressive season after breaking into the first team and the managers were from chile , france and portugal
the premier league may be failing but it âs not its englishness letting it down
but you ca nât tell me fernandinho is a better player and better prospect than ryan mason
we âre failing in europe anyway so the premier league need to ensure we âre not forever looking overseas for solutions .
