a mother has not eaten a meal for seven years due to a rare condition which left her stomach paralysed
nicola nichols , 25 , from bolton , was struck down by a ' mild case of man flu ' in 2008
she has not been able to keep any food or drink down since and vomited up to 50 times every day
this is a condition in which the stomach muscles are paralysed , meaning food is not emptied properly
mrs nicola nichols said : ' i ca n't really stress just how mild this flu was - i called it man flu
' but once i started vomiting , it is crippling pain and i have n't really stopped vomiting since
gastroparesis is a chronic condition in which the stomach is unable to empty in the normal way
the problem is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles controlling the emptying of the stomach
if none of these options succeed in making the stomach process food , the patient will have to be fed through a tube
mrs nicola nichols said : ' imagine being sat at the top table at your wedding watching everyone tuck in to the wedding cake that you made and you ca n't have any
' mrs nicola nichols ' problems began when she was 18
her stomach stopped working after a bout of flu two years earlier , leaving her unable to keep any food or liquid down
she would vomit up to 50 times a day , but doctors suspected she had an eating disorder
finally , in 2008 mrs nicola nichols was diagnosed with gastroparesis , a condition in which there is a problem with nerves or stomach muscles , meaning it does not empty itself of food properly
when this nerve is damaged , the muscles in the stomach and intestines stop working , preventing food from moving through the digestive system properly
mrs nicola nichols was fitted with a gastro pacemaker , a metal device fitted in the abdomen to transmit electrical signals to the stomach muscles to get them working again
but the emergency measure failed and she suffered intestinal failure , where her bowel could not digest the foods and absorb the fluids necessary for her to live
mrs nicola nichols was struck down with mild flu in 2008 , and after this vomited up to 50 times a day
she was unable to eat any of the food on her wedding day to partner ben , an it worker a side effect of being fed through a tube is that mrs nicola nichols ' hair became thin and fell out , something she finds difficult mrs nicola nichols said : ' it has a real impact on your life because you ca n't make any last - minute decisions - everything has to be planned months in advance ' ' you have to have the bag delivered there , the bag has to be stored in a fridge between two and eight degrees , everything has to be deep cleaned - sometimes it just really is n't worth it
' the illness has left mrs nicola nichols wheelchair - bound and she has had to watch her hair fall out , something she has found very difficult
the two children were both born healthy despite their mother being unable to eat for two
mrs nicola nichols said : ' i call them my two miracle babies - william was fed off my old tube and felicity was fed by tpn
mrs nicola nichols knows she will never eat ' real food ' again , and her weight dropped from 9st to 7st ' william knows it 's different and will always say as soon as we meet anyway " my mummy is fed by a tube " , which really breaks the ice
