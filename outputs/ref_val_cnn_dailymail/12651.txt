she is being called zephany , though it is not the name with which the 17 - year - old south african girl grew up
zephany means " hidden by the lord , " a fitting name for a girl who was allegedly kidnapped at birth and found thanks to an improbable coincidence
a police spokesman , andre traut , confirmed that a woman was arrested last week and charged with kidnapping and falsely pretending that she was the girl 's biological mother
zephany was a newborn when she was taken from a cape town hospital in 1997
she is 17 and in her final year of school
in fact , according to local reports , that 's how she crossed paths with her biological parents , celeste and morne nurse
the two girls became friends , according to sapa , and eventually , morne nurse made up an excuse to meet his daughter 's new friend
while zephany 's biological parents have said in interviews over the years that they never lost hope of finding her , for now , the girl is in the custody of the social services
