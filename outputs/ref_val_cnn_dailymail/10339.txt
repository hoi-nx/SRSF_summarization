manchester united have been linked with summer moves for both bale and ronaldo
but who would you buy if you could only pick one ? we asked our experts ... bale and ronaldo have both been linked with a move to manchester united martin keown - ronaldo bale is a better long - term investment but if you âre talking about a transfer this summer that would make an immediate impact , then it has to be ronaldo
signing ronaldo would bring manchester united instant success and put them back on the map
ronaldo enjoyed six successful years under sir alex ferguson at old trafford neil ashton - ronaldo this feels like a trick question
ronaldo has done it all before at manchester united - and we would love to see him do it all over again
bale âs game is tailor - made for the premier league and if his pace was added to the current manchester united technicians they would be champions bale trains at the valdebebas training ground before heading to barcelona for the crunch clash riath al samarrai - bale no doubting ronaldo is the better player but bale has age on his side and is not so unbelievably selfish as a person that he would pout if a team - mate scores
bale would make a sensational return to the premier league if he joins manchester united
