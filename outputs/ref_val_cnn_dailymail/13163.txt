i ca n't remember exactly when my teenage fascination with computers collided with the federal government , but i will never forget the morning in 1983 when two fbi agents showed up on my parents ' doorstep
i had gone to bed around 4 or 5 a.m. after spending hours on my computer , which was pretty common for me back then , at age 18
a few hours later , my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business
two men sitting at my kitchen table pulled out badges and stated they were with the fbi
the teacher dialed into the central office computer , logged in and started the math program
that junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school
finally in 1982 , i bought my first computer
i used my computer and modem to log onto electronic bulletin board systems , or bbs , and create more friendships and acquaintances
we ended up getting into about a dozen computer systems -- from the sloan kettering cancer center in new york to a major international bank system in los angeles to the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico , one of only two u.s. laboratories dedicated to nuclear weapons research
we were really just looking around and playing games on these systems ; we did n't want to harm anything
we would share information with each other about any particularly interesting system we connected to and , when we got together for explorers , we 'd talk about exploring , not harming systems
then , the fbi showed up at my home
remember , back then home computers were very new , so there were no computer hacking laws
after about a year of back and forth with the fbi , three of us were eventually charged under a federal provision against harassing phone calls , which carried a maximum of six months in prison and a $ 500 fine each
i had recently met the love of my life and we were expecting our first child
oh , and i 'm still married to the love of my life
the things that we did set the stage for more than just our personal career paths : we helped create several federal laws that are still on the books for computer crime and password safety
there are still lots of issues with people using simple passwords , companies leaving too many doors open and just the massive amounts of computing power available to work on decoding and breaking into systems
we could have caused some damage to these companies and many were surprised that we just looked around and played games
