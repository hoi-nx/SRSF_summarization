from roads and agriculture to the design of the local flag , napoleon transformed elba when he was banished here in 1814
inviting : the pretty harbour of portoferraio in elba , an island which lies just 12 miles off the coast of tuscan in this anniversary year , there are plenty of pageants and parades in his honour
yet , as i sit bobbing on the waters below his villa , i ca n't help thinking that napoleon must have spent his later years wondering why he ever left
for there is something magical , something other about elba
half the size of the isle of wight , this fish - shaped island has 3,000ft peaks , coral reefs , beaches of every complexion and italian 's lowest crime rate
the vast majority of visitors who make the one - hour ferry crossing from piombino are ordinary italian ( we do n't meet a briton all week )
many beaches and bays can be reached only by hiking , biking or , better still , by boat
that is why elba is perfect for a sailing holiday , whether you are a sailor or not
blissful bobbing : lovely porto azzurro is an ideal place to drop anchor , perfect for pizzas and people - watching kent - based nautilus yachting has yachts all over the med and has been organising charters around elba and the tuscan archipelago for years
you might almost call it a napoleon complex ( my wife does )
it proves invaluable ; after five days mixing with ferries , container ships and hovercraft in one of europe 's busiest sealanes , i am more than ready to steer a course for elba
setting off in napoleon 's wake , we are swimming off elba 's eastern shores three hours later
we keep the sailing to an hour or two each morning before dropping the anchor in a pretty bay , swimming and exploring in the rubber dinghy ( every boat comes with one )
i had hoped to spend a night or two on the quayside in a pretty little fishing town such as marciana marina on elba 's northern coast , but there 's no chance in mid-august ( unless you know the harbour master )
favoured spot : the gulf of biodola has a three - mile crescent of sand - as well as elba 's smartest hotel elba 's capital , portoferraio , is well worth a visit
napoleon lived up here and his villa is now a popular museum
this three - mile crescent of sand , where the trees come right down to the water , is home to elba 's smartest hotel , the hermitage
some would trek up to the mountain town of capoliveri or strike out for the other islands in the tuscan archipelago - or even reach napoleon 's native island of corsica
pottering along at our child - friendly pace , we only do half of elba
and i never do find the place where napoleon hatched his escape plan
