deputy pm clegg making cornish pasties during a visit to st merryn school in north cornwall clegg yesterday handed over Â£ 150,000 of public money to promote a language barely anyone speaks
the liberal democrat leader âs generosity to the handful of cornish speakers is the latest in a series of extraordinary gestures to the county over recent months
yesterday âs handout brings coalition spending on attempts to revive cornish to Â£ 500,000 â enough to give nearly Â£ 900 to every person who speaks it
the deputy prime minister âs interest in cornish provoked cynicism among opponents , who pointed to his party âs lowly status in the polls
three of cornwall âs six mps are liberal democrat with slim majorities and mr clegg even chose to visit the county rather than attend the commons on the day chancellor george osborne presented his autumn statement in december
last april , liberal democrat persuaded the council of europe to recognise cornish people as a â national minority â in england , which means the government is now pledged to â combat discrimination â against them
mr clegg said yesterday he will stay on as a caretaker deputy prime minister if there is a hung parliament because the country will need a government in place to â keep the lights on â
