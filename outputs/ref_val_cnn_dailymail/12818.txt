the 1 - 0 scoreline that took barca through to the champions league quarterfinals made their clash with manchester city all seem rather academic
in truth , the english champions deserved little over the two legs as barca built upon their 2 - 1 victory in manchester three weeks ago to go through as 3 - 1 aggregate winners
" it was a game with a lot of chances where we could have finished it off a lot earlier , " barca coach enrique told reporters
" the high - profile scrutiny of the relationship between coach enrique and argentine superstar messi suddenly seems a distant memory with barca still capable of repeating their wonder year of 2009
on that occasion , they won the champions league , la liga and spanish super cup under the guidance of guardiola , who was one of many enthralled spectators inside the camp nou
now in charge of fellow quarterfinalists bayern munich , guardiola was out of his seat -- seemingly in celebration -- as ivan rakitic opened the scoring after 31 minutes when lifting the ball over joe hart following a fine pass from messi
england 's number one made 10 saves , the most of any keeper in any champions league this season , not only repelling messi but also neymar and suarez , both of whom were also denied by the post in the first half
to their credit , the premier league side -- who were looking to reach the champions league quarterfinals for the first time -- improved after the break but found chances hard to come by
barca can now prepare for sunday 's superclasico clash with real madrid , whom they lead in the la liga table by one point
" questions will now be asked of coach manuel pellegrini , who had been expected to perform better in the champions league after roberto mancini twice failed to get out of the group stages
it means that for the second time in three years , no english team have made the last eight , where barca have joined real madrid sides real madrid and atletico madrid , bayern munich , monaco , psg , porto and juve
it started badly and did not get any better , " dortmund coach jurgen klopp , who led his side to the 2013 champions league final , told reporters
