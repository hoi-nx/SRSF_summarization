when winston was caught looting the fridge for hot dogs , his owner decided this old dog needed to learn some new tricks
do n't shoot ! winston looks worried at the prospect this picture may be a preamble to some amateur archery sour grapes : the dog appears less than impressed with this set of headgear he 's been asked to balance on his snout by owner scott cromwell for this series of quirky photograph superfoods for a super dog : winston looks on inscrutably while balancing a mound of blueberries leaves a sour taste : winston looks a little shocked after being persuaded to grip a lime in his jaws not impressed : but the loyal dog does n't flinch even with a slimy half - eaten banana balanced on his bonce anticipation : winston looks like he better get something a little more meaty to justify all this posing ' winston 's very eager to please me and will do about anything for a treat
he absolutely loved doing these shots , ' mr scott cromwell said
' mr scott cromwell , a tv repairman - cum - animal photographer from oklahoma city , spent two months working with winston to create the quirky shots
now there 's a snack i can sink my teeth into ... winston got to scoff a whole packet of hotdogs for this picture mr scott cromwell said : ' winston does stick his nose in nearly every time i go to the fridge and open it and that is what gave me the idea , so luckily i never taught him how to open it to get me a beer or he would be in there a lot
