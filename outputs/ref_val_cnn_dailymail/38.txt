annie ramsay was walking with her friends near her home in whittle-le-woods , lancashire , on thursday when she bent down to stroke the dog as it made its way out of a park with its owner
her friend stroked the animal first before annie ramsay did the same but the spaniel , which was known to her , licked her face then sank its teeth into her cheek - puncturing her
she ran back home with blood pouring down her face screaming ' i 'm going to die ' as her horrified father , john , 47 , called for an ambulance
annie ramsay was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery , where doctors used the inside or her lip to rebuild the part that had been torn off
the attack has left her unable to eat and her mother rebecca ramsay , 34 , has to blend her food and feed it to her through a straw or with a syringe
' the schoolgirl had bent down to stroke the dog when it sunk its teeth into her cheek and tore a centimetre of skin from her lip
she was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery to fix the damage the family was struck by tragedy in 2011 when annie ramsay 's older brother , dylan , drowned while swimming in a quarry near their home
annie ramsay , who has since returned home to recover , is likely to have a hairline scar as a result of the attack ' she had been out playing with friends and the owner , who she knows and lives on our road , was coming out of the park and she stroked it like she has done several times before
she ran home screaming and my husband shouted for a neighbour to call the ambulance
