at that point , he decided that losing weight was his only option the couple , pictured before their weightloss , began to have weight problems around 15 years ago when they began to replace cigarettes with snacks however things changed when , in summer 2010 , chris was left mortified after a wooden chair collapsed beneath him at a family barbecue
so when his doctor , who was a slimming world member herself , recommended chris join his local group in may 2011 , he decided losing weight was his only option
chris , pictured before his weight loss , used to eat 3 or 4 slices of toast with butter or a sausage sandwich with tomato sauce just for breakfast chris , pictured at 29st 5lbs on a camping holiday , regularly stopped breathing in his sleep chris said : ' my leg was in a real mess and it was getting to the point where they did n't know what else to do , i started to worry that i might actually lose my leg

' chris and lesley are also keen walkers and have climbed the highest peak in mid wales twice , and chris enjoys cycling and finds a round of golf much easier nowadays
in fact , the pair have so much more energy that they decided to compile a ' slim list ' of places they 'd like to visit and things they 'd like to do minus their extra 21st 11lbs , which includes travelling to paris , venice and dublin and re-visiting the royal albert hall so that they can fit comfortably into the seats
lesley says : ' we 'd never been abroad as a couple , we would n't have dreamed of trying to go on a plane because chris would never have fit into the seats
chris , pictured before his weight loss , said he would dine on spaghetti bolognese with cheese on top and a garlic bread baguette , a takeaway from the local chip shop or a pizza for dinner at his heaviest , 51 - year - old chris was 29st 5lb , but went on to lose more than half his original body weight ( right )
he now tips the scales at 12 stone 3lb ' now we 've been to venice and to paris and we had a brilliant time
' chris says : ' while it 's obviously not why we joined slimming world in the first place , it 's amazing to be the couple of the year
