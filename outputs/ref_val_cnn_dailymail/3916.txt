the white house sent a stern message on monday to israeli prime minister bibi netanyahu , with president obama 's chief of staff declaring that tel aviv ' must end ' a 47 - year policy of holding contested territory that palestinian claim as their own
' an occupation that has lasted for almost than 50 years must end , ' mcdonough told an annual convention of ' j street , ' a left - wing jewish advocacy group , in washington obama himself did not attend , but sent mcdonough to read a speech in his stead while he attended a science fair for schoolchildren at the white house and gave brief remarks to an investment summit
had the president delivered the message himself , comparisons would have instantly been made to the american israel public affairs committee , j street 's conservative counterpart , which obama snubbed during the week when bibi netanyahu was in the us to deliver a speech to congress
but it was mention of a ' two - state solution ' to the decades - old arab - israeli conflict that brought the disproportionately young crowd , seeded wth raucous college students , to its feet
' president obama asked me to convey his deep appreciation to all of you for your partnership and your work on behalf of the us - israeli relationship , ' mcdonough said near the beginning of his speech
' especially building support for our efforts to advance a two - state solution
' bibi netanyahu , now poised for another four years as prime ministrer , pledged before last week 's israeli elections that with his likud party in power , he would refuse to allow the palestinian authority to graduate to full statehood
he qualified that promise after his come - from - behind victory on election day , saying conditions on the ground would have to change before he would consider approving a palestinian state
busy , busy , busy : president obama sent his chief of staff to deliver an ultimatum to israeli while he presided over a science fair in the east room at the white house enthusiastic : liberal jews , led by college students on spring break , erupted into applause at the mention of a two - state solution tensions : palestinian authority leader mahmoud abbas ( right ) argues â and j street agrees â that israeli is encroaching on his people 's lands with settlements ( left ) built by bibi netanyahu 's government the us has for decades used its permanent - member veto on the united nations security council to block resolutions demanding palestinian statehood
mcdonough followed his saber - rattling in bibi netanyahu 's direction with a calmer assurance that ' no matter who leads israeli , us âs commitment to israeli national security will never waver
