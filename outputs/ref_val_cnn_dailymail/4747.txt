and speaking to dr phil , gordon insisted : ' i did everything possible in the world to protect them [ whitney and bobbi kristina ]

it is now six weeks since bobbi kristina â krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath - tub of the home she shared with gordon in roswell , georgia
unlike whitney 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating bobbi kristina 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22 - year - old as a criminal investigation
while bobbi kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with gordon , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged

' bobbi kristina and gordon would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had
