a force field that can protect vehicles from the destructive blastwaves thrown out by explosions has been development by aircraft manufacturer boeing
the company has been granted a patent for a device that appears to work like the fictional shields seen in science fiction movies like star wars films and star trek
the system works by using an ' arc generator ' to rapidly heat the air in front of a shockwave creating a cloud of electrically charged gas
they say the device could be mounted on vehicles such as tanks and armoured personnel carriers , buildings , aircraft , ships and submarines
boeing 's patent proposes using lasers ( shown above ) or microwaves to create plasma to slow the shockwave boeing 's patent proposes using sensors that can detect the light or other electromagentic radiation - such as microwaves or infrared light - thrown out by explosion
this would then trigger an ' arc generator ' to produce a temporary force field between the vehicle or building and the advancing shockwave
it says this could be created using lasers or microwaves to rapidly heat the air in front of the vehicle to produce an area of electrically charged gas , or plasma
it also claims that the arc generator could create a powerful electric current within just a few milliseconds to create an electric art through the air
this graphic shows how lasers could be used to create a plasma shied protect a vehicle from a shockwave the uss enterprise in star trek ( pictured ) used a force field to help protect it from torpedos and phaser blasts spacecraft , vehicles and even individual robots in the star wars films ( pictured ) had their own shields this would heat the gas and change its density to interfere with the path of the shockwave
boeing also proposes that the arc generator could be a gun that fires multiple pellets on converging paths , leaving a trail of ions in their wake like tracer bullets
it also says the arc generator could also fire projectiles training conductive wires that would also heat the air to create a medium that would remove energy from the shockwave
this diagram shows how a arc generator could be mounted onto the side of a vehicle to protect it from a blast ' specifically the shockwave pushes the ionised air created by or making up the arc inward and the current tends to flow where the air is ionised
