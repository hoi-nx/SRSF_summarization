this was a pragmatic , impressive display against a team who knew they needed three goals and threw all they had at that task in the second half

ratings by rob draper in monaco it was horribly tense for monaco once ramsey scored arsenal âs second with 11 minutes to go â but , once again , in this competition wenger âs team lost it in the first leg
as arsenal threw more at it with the minutes slipping away , monaco pressed forward and substitute yannick ferreira-carrasco nipped one across the face of goal that could have ended the contest there and then
the goal that brought arsenal to the brink of one of the greatest fightbacks in champions league history came in the 79th minute after theo walcott hit a post with a side - footed shot
predictably , monaco âs hoofs were better than arsenal âs lumps
four goals and a goalkeeper down at half - time , tottenham pulled it back to 4 - 3 and would surely have drawn level had they not run out of time
giroud scored in the first half at the stade louis ii to give arsenal hope of pulling off a comeback in their last - 16 tie the french striker picked his spot from a tight angle to give arsenal the lead over monaco in the last 16 second leg monaco 's defenders on the line can not stop giroud 's 36th - minute shot from hitting the roof of the net giroud 's goal left arsenal needing two more to progress in the remaining 55 minutes in the french principality yet they had bale in the ranks that night
equally , monaco âs centre halves , wallace and abdennour , were exceptional â a different league from the inter team that tottenham faced
so it is now down to manchester city , the last premier league team standing , to restore english pride and claim a place in the champions league quarter - finals
ramsey came off the bench to score arsenal 's second in the 79th minute to set up a grandstand finish ramsey celebrates his goal with per mertesacker to pull arsenal within one goal of pulling off an unlikely comeback laurent koscielny celebrates ramsey 's goal as arsenal pushed their opponents all the way in their last - 16 contest ramsey 's strike in the 79th minute was the 300th goal in european competition that arsenal have scored under wenger
arsenal were the better team last night but then they had to be
they had significant levels of possession in the second half without really threatening goalkeeper danijel subasic for long periods
for monaco to progress on away goals appears close but , once again , arsenal deceive
arsenal grew into the game after a flat opening 15 minutes enlivened only by a cross from hector bellerin that giroud headed wide
santi cazorla , whose heat map is shown above , was at the centre of most of arsenal 's attacking play

you can see what sanchez thought of the referee âs decision ! from there , however , the game began to progress along familiar lines , arsenal in the ascendancy , monaco retreating to massed ranks of stout defence
for a while it looked as if they were more than capable of holding out â monaco are a tight defensive unit with that most old - fashioned of qualities , a couple of big units who do nât mind putting a foot in â but arsenal got a breakthrough after 36 minutes
it was welbeck who set up the goal , driving forward and slipping his final pass to giroud , who was left with only danijel subasic to beat
with danijel subasic stranded on the floor , giroud reacted quickest and after scanning the immediate area , seized on the loose ball , rifling it into the roof of the net with monaco âs covering defenders helpless
after his travails in the first leg â hooked by wenger to utter derision , having missed enough chances to put arsenal in the quarter - finals â this was a perfect response
giroud rises highest in the monaco penalty area to unleash a header towards goal which just went wide of the far post ozil swaps shirts with monaco 's kondogbia at half - time at the stade louis ii monaco goalkeeper danijel subasic makes a save from giroud during the first half of the second leg clash in monaco real madrid , porto , bayern munich , paris saint-germain , monaco , atletico madrid wednesday : barcelona ( 2 ) vs manchester city ( 1 ) ; borussia dortmund ( 1 ) vs juventus ( 2 ) true , it was at kondogbia âs request , but it hardly fitted in with the cold determination required to conjure victory against a team that had not conceded three goals at home since 2011
