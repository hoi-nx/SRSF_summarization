although , again , they use a vacuum device so that stray hairs do not to float away
elsewhere on the grooming front , astronauts have sponge baths instead of regular showers as water clings to the body instead of running down it in microgravity , there is a limited supply of water on the international space station ( international space station ) - no more than 4 liters per wash - so taking sponge baths also saves water

in space , astronauts use a no - rinse shampoo to wash their hair , and apply the shampoo using a towel , vigorously rub their hair and scalp
the reason for the vacuum is to make sure loose hairs do n't float around the station
' astronauts must not let loose hairs fall off the towel because floating hairs can create a safety hazard since they can be inhaled or aggravate an astronauts ' eyes , ' explained the canadian space agency
