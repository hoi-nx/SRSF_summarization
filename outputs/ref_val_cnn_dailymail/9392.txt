the tartan army march on twickenham in a mood pitched somewhere between resignation and outright dejection
it is almost impossible to imagine this young â in parts - visiting side succeeding where so many hardened men have failed
somewhere amid the mix of technique and aggression required to stifle england , it would be awfully nice if someone from the current crop showed some inspired â maybe even swashbuckling â leadership
cotter 's squad need to find a new source of inspiration if they are to triumph at twickenham jonny gray may only turn 21 on saturday , but he has emerged as a key leader in this scottish squad stuart hogg ( second left ) is all smiles ahead of saturday 's calcutta cup clash in london laidlaw is captain , of course
among the forwards , an increasing burden is falling on jonny gray , who turns 21 on saturday
the risk , of course , is that the burden of responsibility dulls the energy and skills that make jonny gray such an exciting prospect
would it be better , perhaps , to leave him to concentrate on his own game ? scotland know they will need to be strong in the battle up front if they want to be in touch towards the end scotland hooker ross ford leads a passing drill during scotland 's final preparations for saturday 's game â ideally , yeah , you may think that , â admits scotland assistant coach humphreys , the former wales captain adding : â but i compare him to alun wyn jones , who i coached at a very similar age
and , with jonny gray , he does nât see it as a burden
what scotland will get out of this is just a phenomenal leader and a phenomenal character
â if it âs obviously asking a bit much for jonny gray to emerge chrysalis - like from his cocoon in time to out - think and overpower a hugely effective english pack today , this might also be a perfect opportunity for the kid â winning only his 12th cap â to provide some firm and effective direction
the scotland players have spent part of this week watching video footage of last season âs humiliation at the hands of england , as well as dissecting the horror show against italy just a fortnight ago
scotland go through their paces at twickenham on friday - it 's an important game for them to restore pride humphreys warned : â if you go into a game just with passion and heated fervour then that lasts maybe 15 or 20 minutes
â we have a young group who need to understand that being on the wrong end of the penalty count does exert a lot of pressure on yourself
twickenham is a tough enough venue for visitors on a high , never mind those struggling for confidence
scotland coach humphreys says jonny gray is thriving under the pressure , just as alun wyn jones did scotland fly half finn russell ( left ) and full back stuart hogg work on their kicking on friday those of us who have been making this pilgrimage , on and off , since the dying days of the amateur era can remember when scotland âs miserable streak here â only four wins in history , the most â recent â in 1983 â felt odd , given that both sides were usually closely matched
england have moved on , found new best enemies , chucked us
at the end of a week when even head coach cotter has spoken about keeping things tight and staying in the game until the final 20 minutes , it feels like scotland will do well to avoid being absolutely flattened
