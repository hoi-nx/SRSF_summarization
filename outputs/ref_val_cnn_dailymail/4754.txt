mrs clinton has yet to comment on the row over her private email server clinton arranged for a â homebrew â email server to be set up whilst secretary of state amid an atmosphere of â what clinton wants , clinton gets â
a former senior it official in the department of state told dailymail.com that mrs clinton was â demanding â and that staff had to get things done without asking too many questions
the existence of the server at her private home in chappaqua , upstate new york , would have been known to just a close circle of friends as â these are things that are not discussed â , he said
the former official also spoke of his frustration that mrs clinton âs actions had deprived the public of vital historical records
the former official said he did not know at the time what mrs clinton was doing but said that he was â not surprised â when it became public knowledge
he said that under her watch the mantra was : â this is what the secretary wants , this is what the secretary gets
â he said : â if you âve ever met a secretary of state they are demanding ... that âs the reason they head the department of state
the former official said that the rules from the national archives are â antiquated â and say that it falls on the individual to save their emails for archiving purposes
he said : â once you get into the senior levels of government , anything we talk about is going to be of historical merit , even if it might be minor now
â twenty years from now it could be a major thing â
he told dailymail.com that it â does appear that it âs the same server , though i can not be sure â
