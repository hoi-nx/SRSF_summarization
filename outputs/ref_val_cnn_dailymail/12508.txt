after enduring about four days at sea under stressful conditions , tyke , an african elephant , escaped during a circus performance , crushing her trainer to death and injuring dozens of others while storming through the streets of honolulu
tyke suffered a slow and painful death after being hit by a barrage of bullets fired by police officers
that incident happened 20 years ago , but the welcome announcement last week by feld entertainment -- parent company to ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus -- that it plans to retire elephants from its circuses by 2018 is a reminder of how that controversy lingers
in analyzing the horrific experience involving tyke , it was reported that the elephant had been rebellious before she arrived on our shores , and she is said to have had a history of acting out and being unpredictable
and though she was not submissive and was difficult to train , her owners sent her to honolulu anyway
sadly , performing animals in circuses and traveling shows are too often subjected to inhumane conditions , especially in their training
reward - based training takes time and patience , which are things that many circus trainers do not have
yet whatever provisions they may make , the reality is that circuses are particularly unsuited to meet the unique needs of elephants
these extremely intelligent animals live in large family groups when in the wild , and they form close social ties with other elephants
" we are told that circuses and traveling shows are about education
ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus has come a long way in its thinking , and for that we congratulate the company for its decision to move the elephants to its sanctuary in florida
rather than fighting the many cities and counties that have taken steps to pass anti-circus and anti-elephant ordinances , the company instead is putting its resources toward the study and protection of elephants
with this step , we look forward to the day that it , and other circuses , phase out all wild animals , including the lions and tigers that also are featured in their shows
