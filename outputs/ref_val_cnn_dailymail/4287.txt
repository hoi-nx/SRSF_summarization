uk could be linked with north america by road as part of an ambitious project to create the world 's longest superhighway spanning half the circumference of the globe
proposals have been put forward to build the mega route stretching about 12,400 miles from the western edge of russia to the bering strait where the country nudges alaska
linking into existing road networks in europe and asia , for the first time it would allow travellers a proper highway to drive all way from the uk to the united states
a trans - siberian rail link as well as oil and gas pipes would run alongside the highway , and plans have been mooted already for a rail tunnel connecting the far flung russia region of chukotka - where football tycoon roman abramovich once served as governor - and alaska
by jumping on the channel tunnel you could get all the way from london to alaska by road under plans for a more than 12,000 mile superhighway linking europe and western russia to the bering strait while roads exist across much of russia some are of dismal quality , especially in the east of the country
this new scheme is seen as a way of turning russia into a global transportation hub , a bridge between europe , asia and north america , so revitalising the russia economy and attracting new tourism
vladimir fortov , the head of the russian academy of science , recently put forward the uncosted plan dubbed the trans-eurasian belt development ( tepr ) to president vladimir putin
the current longest continuous road in the world is found in australian , where highway 1 runs around the entire country and spans some 9,000 miles
