rounding up sheep successfully is a difficult task usually reserved for experienced shepherds and their sheepdog
new footage shows how a drone can herd around 120 sheep across a field and through a narrow gateway within minutes
as the farmer and photographer stand in one corner of the field the drone does all of the hard work , forcing the sheep towards the gate the sheep stay in a group while the drone flies behind them
the animals appear to react to the slight movement of the nifty aircraft the footage of the sheep was captured by paul brennan , who specialises in aerial photography for farmers the final sheep make their way through the gate ( left ) and into the next field minutes after the drone ( stock image right ) started its work it was captured by paul brennan , who specialises in aerial photography for farmers
