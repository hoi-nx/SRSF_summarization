they simply do not draw games , and that âs something which could see watford over the line in this season âs race to the premier league
against fulham troy deeney âs 15th of the season secured their eighth win in the last ten
troy deeney ( centre ) fires home to give watford the lead and send them third in the sky bet championship the hornets captain celebrates as his side continued their quest for an automatic promotion place watford starting xi ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : heurelho gomes 6.5 ; craig cathcart 7 , angella 7.5 , hoban 6 ; motta 6 , abdi 8 ( forestieri - 86 ) , ben watson 7 , adlene guedioura 7 , pudil 6.5 ( layun - 58 6 ) ; troy deeney 7.5 , vydra 7 ( ighalo - 68 6 ) subs not used : bond , paredes , anya , tozser , goals : troy deeney 9 booked : adlene guedioura fulham starting xi ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : marcus bettinelli 6 ; jazz richards 6 , hutchinson 6 , bodurov 6 , stafylidis 6.5 ; ryan tunnicliffe 6 , fofana 7 , kavanagh 6.5 ( kaäanikliä , - 76 6 ) ; bryan ruiz ( matt - 76 7 ) , cauley woodrow 6.5 ( hugo rodallega - 66 6 ) , ross 7 subs not used : kiraly , hoogland , amorebieta , dembã©lã© booked : jazz richards , fofana â it âs nice winning 5 - 0 or 3 - 2 but sometimes it is difficult , â jokanovic said
â it âs only six months since managerial turmoil looked to undermine the foundations previously laid when billy mckinlay left after a matter of days but watford will take some stopping from here
the winner came on nine minutes after fulham goalkeeper marcus bettinelli , rather bizarrely , opted to travel away from his goal to retrieve a ball for abdi to whip in a wicked corner ; from that craig cathcart âs header was partially saved but troy deeney was on the spot to smash in the rebound
â jokanovic âs side are top scorers in the division - netting 16 in their last five at vicarage road before this - but are occasionally susceptible to pace and ross might âve drawn the visitors level soon after , only for his half - volley to be thwarted by former tottenham stopper heurelho gomes
ryan tunnicliffe ( centre ) tussles with abdi for the ball during his side 's defeat to watford match winner troy deeney fights with kostas stafylidis for possession during the first half at vicarage road despite fulham looking bright , it was the hornets who could âve sewn the points up before half - time
make no mistake , this was not vintage watford but you sense they do nât need to be weekly , such is the quality stacked up in a well - stocked squad
ben watson ( centre ) climbs higher than bryan ruiz during his side 's crucial victory over fulham symons saw cauley woodrow head over from a corner and seko fofana âs vicious strike was deflected wide
fulham failed to build a real period of sustained pressure until introducing giant striker matt ; his knockdown fell to ross but heurelho gomes rushed out , spread himself and superbly blocked the scot âs certain equaliser
â watford might usually be a pleasure to watch , but they âll be thankful for that mad brazilian between the sticks - this ended up being as gritty as they come .
