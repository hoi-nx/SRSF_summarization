scholes believes manchester united must spend big again this summer if louis van gaal 's tactics are to bring success to old trafford
and former manchester united midfielder scholes , who has two season tickets at his old club , is unconvinced that van gaal 's preferred style of play suits the players in his squad
louis van gaal gives instructions to ashley young during manchester united 's defeat by arsenal fellaini , michael carrick and wayne rooney ( l-r ) look dejected at old trafford arsene wenger was right ! i would have loved to have played with mesut ozil ... but only if he always performed like he did at old trafford writing in his column for the independent , scholes said : ' watching manchester united at old trafford on monday , i know what louis van gaal is trying to do with this team
' in recent weeks , van gaal has tried what i would describe as a more barcelona - style approach to games
barcelona can do it because they have the players and they have been playing this way for years
manchester united have spent around Â£ 220m in the last three transfer windows and yet i would question whether they have the players to operate this system
' van gaal has been criticised for utilising fellaini 's height and physical presence at times this season former manchester united midfielder scholes believes the club must buy more new players this summer manchester united were known for their relentless attacking under sir alex ferguson and scholes , who was an integral part of the scot 's midfield , wants to see fluid football back at old trafford
' i understand what van gaal is trying to do , ' scholes wrote
despite the club 's precarious position , scholes is adamant that the dutchman has what it takes to turn things around - even if he must take action in the summer transfer window
but i am afraid to say that if he wants to play this barcelona style then the club will have to go back into the transfer market this summer to get the players they need to do it
