no audience with louis van gaal is complete without a mention of the dutchman âs â philo - sophy â
he talked about it on his first day at old trafford and was still talking about it in the build - up to united âs win over liverpool on sunday
and now ( with united ) until march
â there were signs all over the pitch at anfield that his players are finally getting the message
united playmaker mata stole the show at anfield as he netted a brace against liverpool mata ( left ) and fellow countryman ander herrera ( right ) impressed against united 's arch - rivals david de gea uploaded a dressing room photograph of united 's post-match celebrations united are currently fourth in the premier league the 63 - year - old is ruthless in his pursuit of what he wants
no - one is exempt , and it was significant that mata and ander herrera , two of united âs best performers in the 2 - 1 win over their bitter rivals , have been made to sit on the sidelines for lengthy spells this season
two - goal hero mata only returned against spurs in the previous game after a two - month absence from van gaal âs starting line - up in the premier league
his position at anfield , described by van gaal as a â false right winger â , demonstrated once again how the manager places his team âs needs above an individual âs preference
and ander herrera spoke candidly on monday about how upsetting van gaal contributed to him making just six league starts in his first six months at old trafford following a Â£ 29million move from bilbao
â i keep my distance with van gaal , but he âs a good guy with a strong character , â said ander herrera , who was not seen for more than a month after being hooked at half - time against west brom in october
united 's first team stars finally appear to be buying in louis van gaal 's philosophy mata was given a free role against liverpool in december ( left ) but performed admirably as a ' false winger ' at anfield on sunday ( right ) â he likes discipline and does not believe in egos in the dressing room
an eight - point deficit on chelsea is evidence of that , and they are still far from certain to achieve their target of champions league qualification despite sunday âs win opening up a five - point advantage over liverpool
but something seems to have clicked in the wins against spurs and liverpool , just when the fa cup defeat by arsenal looked to have raised major concerns over the club âs direction under van gaal
players who privately have questioned his methods look more comfortable , although liverpool âs alarmingly lacklustre display at anfield helped in that respect
united midfielder carrick has been in impressive form since his return from injury marouane fellaini , pictured with van gaal , is showing his best form since joining united in september 2013 carrick âs return to anchor the midfield has been an important factor , so too marouane fellaini âs advanced role , which has given united âs attack a new dimension
even chris and phil jones , united âs much - maligned england centre backs , look solid after being thrown back together by marcos rojo âs groin injury and jonny evans âs ban for spitting at newcastle âs papiss cisse
