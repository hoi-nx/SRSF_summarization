apple âs watch does what google glass and pebble âs smartwatch failed at - create a beautiful , elegant device that works as a piece of jewellery , without even switching it on
surprisingly light , the watch oozes quality and attention to detail in the design and build
' while in images it looks a little chunky , on the wrist it is a different story
for the record , i used the leather strap with magnetic â slap band â on the sport model , and also tested the gold edition
using the watch can be slightly confusing at first - the combination of digital crown , button and touchscreen mean that for your first few tries , you âll probably press the wrong one
however , after a few minutes it becomes second nature to navigate around , and the digital crown in particular is perfectly weighted , making scrolling through long lists - such as music or your messages - simple
the touchscreen in particular is extremely accurate
we were able to try its features , and found even in the beta version we were using , the software is spot on - animation are smooth and fluid , with watch faces such as an opening rose showing off the screen however , there is undoubtedly an initial confusion factor apple will have to overcome
however , once you know how to get around , the watch is fluid , fast and the screen astonishingly bright
we were able to try all of its features , and found even in the beta version we were using , the software is spot on - animations are smooth and fluid , with watch faces really showing off the screen
apple has taken the ios software on its phones and tablets and tweaked it to better suit the watch 's power , display size and functions
it has also invented a new typeface to make the screen easier to read however , will people want one ? overall , the selling point from my ( admittedly short ) time with the watch seems to be its time - saving potential - as a phone addict , i âm constantly checking for messages

gestures : following last year 's unveiling , apple admitted the watch is unlike any device it has ever made
it said it has ' reinvented all - new ways to select navigate and input that are suited to a smaller device worn on the wrist '
force touch uses electrodes around the flexible display to distinguish between a light tap and a deep press , and trigger instant access to a range of contextually specific controls - such as an action menu in messages , or a mode that lets you select different watch faces
