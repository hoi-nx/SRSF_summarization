australian bat - lovers and conservationists are mourning the loss of an infant flying fox named charlotte
charlotte , also known as little miss charlotte , was in the care of batzilla , a bat rescue group in brisbane , for a little over a month before the baby bat was found to have liver issues and her carers were forced to have her euthanized
though the rescue group takes in many orphaned bats , usually rehabilitating them and releasing them back into the wild , charlotte was different
massage : here , charlotte is seen in a video posted to batzilla the bat 's youtube account being massaged by a carer the group shared charlotte 's story on the facebook page and described her rescue as a ' little miracle , ' the post was accompanied by a video of little charlotte being cradled in the hands of one of the group 's carers
' baby bats : about 300 baby bats are orphaned every year in australian after their mothers die of starvation or illness a facebook post indicates that charlotte was euthanized in the morning on feb. 21
' the comment section of the post is riddled with condolences from more than 1,000 facebook users who followed charlotte 's short journey with the rescue group
