wenger âs champions league record is as phenomenal as it is deeply disappointing
the paradox is apparent is wenger âs own mantra , oft repeated , that the club âs record of qualifying for the tournament for 17 consecutive years and having reached the equivalent of knock - out stages for the last 15 years is extraordinary
yet having contested the champions league and its predecessor the champions league 18 times now ( including twice at monaco ) , he has never won it
perhaps more damningly he has been in the final just once and the semi-finals three times , once with monaco and twice with arsenal
wenger is undoubtedly one of the managerial greats but his european record is a blot on his cv wenger leads his arsenal side against monaco on tuesday night hoping to turn around a 3 - 1 deficit wenger looks towards the champions league trophy after losing the 2006 final to barcelona in paris progression to the quarter - finals of the champions league would require arsenal to do what no other side has done in the champions league - overturn a two - goal home leg deficit
supporters will hope mesut ozil and co can live up to their alter - egos from arsenal 's christmas party in 2013 where the squad dressed up as superheroes
but his failure to win any european trophy and to have contested just three finals in 22 years of qualifying for various european tournaments , is a glaring omission in his career
it is why the game against monaco is so poignant
it is the fact that this tie should have been the perfect platform for wenger to have another go at building a european success
it has nât turned out that way after that awful , shambolic 3 - 1 defeat in the first leg at the emirates
â the closest wenger came to realising his dream was the champions league final in 2006 , when ten - man arsenal led until the 76th minute against barcelona
who is to say that arsenal would nât have won that day had jens lehmann not been sent off ? this is thrust of wenger âs argument when questioned on his record : that the fine margins and necessary luck which plays its part in football is to blame for him not having achieved his goal
video monaco are favourite to progress freddie ljungberg admitted that it was one of the biggest regrets for wenger 's great side to not win in europe ashley cole reacts after arsenal lose out in paris , courtesy of goals from samuel eto'o and juliano belletti thierry henry could not inspire arsenal to victory in wenger 's only champions league final back in 2006 it is compelling up to a point
wenger looks on as barcelona lift the trophy - and he is still without a european trophy in his long career jens lehmann was sent off early in the game and barcelona 's pressure eventually told as they beat arsenal a persistent critique of sir alex ferguson âs ability as a coach ( as opposed to manager ) was that , given his resources he â only â won the trophy twice in 21 years
monaco tonight is the reminder that wenger is the consummate qualifier in europe but never the victor
in his six years here at the club , the team qualified for european competition every season , losing in the final of the cup-winners â cup in 1992 to werder bremen
remarkably , given the relative size of the club , they reached the champions league semi-finals in 1994 , losing 3 - 0 to ac milan
carlo ancelotti has won the champions league three times , including last year , in twelve attempts jose mourinho has won the big trophy twice in eleven entries ( counting this season , as he is already out ) jupp heynckes has a hugely impressive record of two wins and four finals in five champions league attempts wenger âs gifts are undeniable
there is a missing link in wenger âs tactical psyche
the year he perhaps should have done it but did nât was not so much 2006 , when that team was beginning to decline , but the invincible year of 2003 - 04 , when a late wayne bridge goal at highbury knocked arsenal out in the quarter - finals in the days when wenger âs teams were considerably stronger than chelsea
wayne bridge fired in a late chelsea winner at highbury in 2004 in one of arsenal 's best chances of winning bridge 's goal defeated an arsenal side that were superior to chelsea and went on to win the premier league wenger can not hide his disappointment as then - chelsea manager claudio ranieri celebrates a rare win nothing would give english football lovers greater pleasure that to see arsenal execute a remarkable comeback tonight and for wenger to go on and finally lift the trophy â with the big ears , â as patrick vieira always called it
wenger is back at his former club monaco on tuesday night with the hope of reaching european glory
