reigning world champion lewis hamilton and teammate nico rosberg resumed where they left off last season as the 2015 formula1.com season kicked off in melbourne
the mercedes duo , who took pole position in all but one of last season 's qualifying sessions and won 16 of the 19 races , were dominant in first and second practice for sunday 's australia grand prix
nico rosberg , who won last year 's gp at albert park , was fastest around the melbourne street circuit on friday , finishing 0.1 second ahead of lewis hamilton with vettel taking third spot for his new team ferrari -- the german four - time world champion finished 0.715 seconds off the pace set by his compatriot
" it was great to be back in the car at this awesome track , " nico rosberg said , the official formula1.com site reported
" lewis hamilton , who was forced to retire from last year 's race with engine trouble , was satisfied with his pace
in general it 's been a good first day , " lewis hamilton said
" the opening day 's racing was somewhat overshadowed by an ongoing dispute between sauber and the swiss team 's 2014 reserve driver giedo van der garde
van der garde won the case held in a swiss court earlier this month , with the decision being upheld by supreme court of victoria in australia on tuesday after sauber had appealed the original ruling
during practice van der garde could be seen in the sauber garage wearing his race overalls , but he did not make an appearance on track as marcus ericsson and nasr completing both practice sessions
following the initial court ruling , team principal monisha kaltenborn said that changing drivers hours before a grand prix could be dangerous
