clinton aides and department officials stressed this week that the former secretary of state did not violate state policy when she exclusively used a private email account for government work
" those guidelines were filled with exemptions that could allow clinton to use a private account
the department official was careful to say that the people reviewing the documents are " not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of secretary clinton 's 55,000 pages of emails
" clinton was not automatically in violation of state policy when she exclusively used a private email during her four years as america 's top diplomat , the source added , contradicting other media on thursday
" clinton 's use of private email was never hidden from anyone , according to a former state official
there were no big internal discussion among state lawyers , either , about clinton 's use of private email
clinton 's exclusive use of a private email system has quickly ballooned this week into a controversy for the presumed democratic frontrunner for president in 2016
experts have said it does n't appear clinton violated federal laws , but that has n't stemmed the issue that has become more about bad optics and politics
" the state acknowledged clinton 's request after the tweet , and a senior official said the review could " take several months
on friday , harf , a state department spokeswoman , said she was " not going to speculate " about whether there is sensitive information in clinton 's emails
the times reported on thursday that clinton 's closest aides at state were well aware that clinton communicated using a private email address
clinton 's spokesman failed to comment to cnn questions about those revelations by the times
the questions around clinton 's email use have captivated political watchers over the last week and allowed republicans to cast clinton in a similar way they did her husband , former president clinton : as a secretive politician pushing the boundaries and rules and regulations
charges of hypocrisy have also surfaced given that an inspector general 's report from 2012 - while clinton was secretary - repeatedly cited ambassador to kenya gration 's use of " commercial email for official government business " saying it was against policy to do so " except in emergencies , " which created morale problems , " confusion and discouragement within the embassy community
state guidelines require employees who use private email accounts to back up those documents on government computers so that the department can archive them and they can be available for freedom of information act requests
in addition to directives from state , federal guidelines from clinton 's four years leading the department do not appear to outlaw the exclusive use of personal email devices
