rand paul 's goal to run for two offices in 2016 cleared a hurdle saturday after the kentucky gop decided to move forward with a proposal to hold a presidential caucus rather than a primary
rand paul searches for green light on caucus proposal after rand paul met with the party 's 54 - member executive committee in bowling green for a two - hour session , the group voted unanimously to appoint a smaller committee that would decide the rules and regulations of how a caucus would be held
the final vote would come in august when a larger gathering of the kentucky gop is scheduled to meet and hear a more detailed plan from the task force
in other words , rand paul 's name for his senate re-election bid would still remain on the may 2016 primary ballot , but the presidential vote would likely move up earlier in the year to march
