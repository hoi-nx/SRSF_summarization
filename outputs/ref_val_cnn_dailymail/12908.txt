on and off for over 40 years , i have had the privilege of roaming around the west wing of the white house , usually as a member of the staff , sometimes as a journalist or visitor
but this past weekend , making a visit , there was something that was brand new and entirely welcome : there among the stream of visitors touring the west wing were many families of every color , especially americans
my wife anne and i , along with 10 - year - old grandkids gabriel barnett and gergen , were there for a superb , two - hour tour by a young man , clay , once a college intern working with me and now an aide to the president
) like most staff members over the years , clay spoke with near reverence about his president as he pointed out many photos of barack obama on the walls
of course , it did n't take a visit to the white house to know that barack obama has promoted diversity
president barack obama 's efforts to allocate power in new ways have sometimes raised hackles
but to be fair , it is n't as if there has n't been a string of white males in the past who have been even less suited for powerful white house jobs
as i left the white house this past saturday , i knew that i would continue to grind my teeth over many of president barack obama 's policies along with his leadership style
i will write my young friend clay and tell him that one day , accompanied by his grandchildren , he will return to the west wing and be proud that he served under the first president to turn diversity into a living reality at the white house
