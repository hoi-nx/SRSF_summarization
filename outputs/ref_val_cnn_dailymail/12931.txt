on friday , isis claimed responsibility for yemen 's deadliest terror attack
the group 's momentum may have stalled in syria and iraq , but its supporters from the atlantic to the hindu kush appear to be heeding its leader abu bakr al-baghdadi 's call to " erupt volcanoes of jihad
" by far the most surprising development was its claim of responsibility for the twin suicide bomb blasts that killed over 130 in shia mosques in sanaa , yemen , on friday and another attack in the north
isis was only thought to have a fledgling presence in yemen and had only claimed one previous attack , the assassination of a yemen security official north of aden earlier this month
al qaeda in yemen , or aqap , has for years been the dominant jihadi group inside yemen , but it denied involvement in the mosque attacks , saying it was against its principles to target mosques , bolstering the isis claim
this indicates isis has very quickly built up an operational capability inside yemen in the months since jihadis inside the country released an audiotape declaring allegiance to baghdadi last november
only two developments could explain this : defections from aqap or the return home of yemen isis veterans skilled in urban warfare and explosives
since baghdadi declared isis had expanded into yemen late last year there has been an escalating war of words between them , with isis claiming aqap was not doing enough to target houthis and aqap declaring that the isis caliphate was illegitimate
while aqap has acknowledged previous internal disagreements about whether to support isis , there have been relatively few defections
its charismatic leader , nasir al-wuhayshi , al qaeda 's global number two , is extremely popular among the group 's rank and file
in recent months the group has reaped a recruitment windfall from sunnis tribal anger over the shia takeover of sanaa , allowing it to expand its operations across yemen
but isis appears now to have laid down the gauntlet , declaring its attacks friday were the " tip of the iceberg
" in targeting the shia mosques in sanaa , isis would be quite deliberately repeating the sectarian strategy of its founder , al-zarqawi , who launched a devastating suicide bombing on golden mosque in samarra in february 2006 , which plunged iraq into a full - blown sectarian civil war
yemen appears now to be on the brink of a similar civil war
it would also be isis ' most spectacular act of international terrorism since it carried out coordinated suicide bombings on american and international hotels in amman , jordan , in 2005
isis has so far offered no proof to back up its claim it was responsible
in november , cnn reported that isis was running several training camps in the green mountains between these two eastern libya towns where it was instructing recruits from across north africa , including tunisians
thirdly , up to 3,000 tunisians have traveled to syria and iraq , many to fight with isis
the three most powerful new isis affiliates are in egypt , libya and nigerian
last november the egypt sinai - based jihadi group ansar beit al-maqdis pledged allegiance to isis
bolstered by the return home from syria of egypt isis veterans , in recent months the group has escalated its campaign of attacks against security forces in the sinai and across egypt and has put out its own gory beheading videos
in libya , isis is taking advantage of chaos and simmering civil war to rapidly expand
