the cowardly and reprehensible shooting wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the missouri town , which had already seen ferguson police chief thomas jackson announce his resignation after a damning justice department report on its police department
the report , which was ordered in the wake of the killing of michael brown last year , highlighted a predatory policing problem and a department that was biased , prejudiced and that has regularly targeted , arrested and fined african - americans
but what 's worse in all this is that ferguson is illustrative of a broader problem across the country as increasingly militarized majority - white police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward majority - black communities
it 's a combustible mix. in three - quarters of all americans cities with populations 50,000 or more , the police presence is " disproportionately white relative to the local population , " according to the washington post
and tensions are being exacerbated by the use among police departments of military weapons , and stipulations that these former war zone weapons must be used within a year of acquisition
all this suggests a need for a completely new mindset on how we try to understand and implement policing practices across americans
first and foremost , our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse nation , whether it be race , creed , sexual orientation and more
second , we must radically rethink the trend toward the indiscriminate procurement and use of surplus military grade weaponry , which under the department of defense 's 1033 program is flowing from battlefields to our local police forces
ferguson is an excellent example of how the deployment of heavy weaponry inflames rather than de-escalates a crisis situation
yes , the white house 's task force on police militarization was a start , but more concrete measures are needed if we want to reverse the rising anger in ferguson and elsewhere
if we do n't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities , then towns like ferguson will unravel further .
