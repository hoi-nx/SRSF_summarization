a portrait of a rare amur tiger family captured on film in the wild has provided clues that the notoriously solitary male big cats may play a role in rearing cubs
scientists have long believed that the large adult males tend to leave females to raise their young and they are known to even attack and kill cubs when they come across them
however , in an astonishing new set of images captured by a camera trap in the sikhote-alin biosphere reserve in eastern russia , a large male amur tiger is seen leading a family of three cubs and their mother through the snowy forest
it was created by stitching together several images the images could help scientists learn new details of the role male tigers play in rearing their young
' these images confirm that male amur tigers do participate in family life , at least occasionally , and we were lucky enough to capture one such moment
after mating male tigers tend to leave a female to rear the cubs herself but will provide protection for them while they remain inside his territory
jonathan slaght , , russia program project manager for the wildlife conservation society , said : ' amur tigers , which have home ranges that typically overlap the home ranges of several females , try to associate with those females as they patrol their own territories
' an adult male might pass through a female âs territory every one or two months so , if the male and female were to meet up every time , this behavior might occur 6 - 12 times per year
' however , considering that an adult male amur tiger has a home range between 1,000 - 2,000 square kilometers , and an adult female has a territory about 400 square kilometers , having a camera trap in the right place at the right time to document this â especially with young in tow â is incredibly rare
' in fact , this behaviour of an adult male amur tiger traveling with a family unit of a female and her cubs has never been photographed before
' the large male tiger was the first to trigger the camera trap ( above ) as he broke the trail for his family through the forest in east russia the amur tiger cubs , two of which can be seen above , followed closely in their parents footsteps , triggering the trap as they passed amur tigers are among the most endangered big cats in the world - thee are just 430 - 500 left remaining in the wild
