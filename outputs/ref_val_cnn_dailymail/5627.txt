researchers found a link between milk consumption and higher levels of anti-oxidant which might minimise damage to brain cells drinking three glasses of milk a day could help stave off diseases such as alzheimer âs and parkinson âs , say researchers
a new us study shows a link between milk consumption and higher levels of a naturally - occurring antioxidant called glutathione in the brain in older , healthy adults
the powerful antioxidant may minimise damage to brain cells from free radicals , destructive groups of atoms made as a by - product of metabolism that can damage cells
â altogether 60 adults enrolled in the study were asked about their diets in the days leading up to brain scans to monitor levels of glutathione in the brain
the researchers found those who said they had drunk milk recently had more glutathione in their brains
those who drank around three glasses a day had highest levels , says a report in the american journal of clinical nutrition ( must credit )
study found people who drank three glasses of milk a day had the highest level of anti-oxident glutathione dr choi said â our equipment enables us to understand complex processes occurring that are related to health and disease
a study from oxford university suggested milk drinking might mitigate neurological damage leading to diseases such as alzheimer âs due to its vitamin b12 content
