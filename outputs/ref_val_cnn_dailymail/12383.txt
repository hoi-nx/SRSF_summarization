washington calling state bans on same - sex marriage " incompatible with the constitution , " the barack obama administration friday filed a brief at the americans supreme court in support of couples who are making challenges in kentucky , michigan , ohio and tennessee
" the marriage bans challenged in these cases impermissibly exclude lesbian and gay couples from the rights , responsibilities and status of civil marriage , " solicitor general verrilli wrote
verrilli said the laws " impose concrete harms on same - sex couples and send the inescapable message that same - sex couples and their children are second - class families , unworthy of the recognition and benefits that opposite - sex couples take for granted
" president barack obama 's position on same - sex marriage has evolved
" at a certain point , " he said , " i 've just concluded that for me , personally , it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same - sex couples should be able to get married
" in february 2013 , the administration filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of couples challenging california 's ban on same sex marriage
supporters of the state bans have until the end of the month to file their briefs
