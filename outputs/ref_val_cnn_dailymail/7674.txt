southampton manager koeman has seen a reaction from goal - shy pelle after dropping him in the league for the first time
pelle scored nine goals in his first 12 matches for southampton in all competitions and netted the winner on his debut for italy
pelle ( 19 ) has struggled with form recently and was n't happy at being dropped for the first time the goals have dried up of late , though , and he was replaced in the starting line - up by shane long in sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at chelsea
pelle ran straight down the tunnel at the final whistle , having played the final few minutes , and koeman hopes the striker can end his three - month wait for a premier league goal when burnley visit this weekend
' there has been a little bit of a reaction , yes , because nobody is happy to stay on the bench , ' the southampton boss said
koeman ( centre ) says he 's ' seen a reaction ' from pelle after leaving him on the bench against chelsea ' sometimes you need a reaction off the player in that situation
' saturday 's match will be their last before a two - week international break , during which time many of southampton 's players will be away with their national teams
martin odegaard ( left ) was linked with a loan move to the southampton next season but koeman denied the claims england duo nathaniel clyne and fraser forster are amongst those players , with some eyebrows raised by the fact left - back ryan bertrand did not join them in roy hodgson 's squad
' the 16 - year - old signed for real madrid from norwegian side strã¸msgodset and big things are expected meanwhile , koeman downplayed speculation linking southampton with a loan move for talented real madrid teenager martin odegaard
