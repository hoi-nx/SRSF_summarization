halsey , the controversial former elite referee who lost his role as a regular bt sport pundit following premier league upset , has had an invitation to speak to a regional referees association withdrawn following intervention from the highest level
halsey was due to address the sheffield referee association on how he beat cancer to continue as a top referee
but an objection from an unnamed football figure led to the ra persuading their sheffield branch to embarrassingly cancel the appearance of halsey , who was giving his services free
the email from laura ritchie , chairwoman of the ra , read : â a senior member of the footballing world has brought it to our attention that you have invited halsey to be a guest speaker
it is a worry that a figure who is being very negative about top - flight referees wo nât send the right message to members
â halsey was invited to speak to the sheffield referee association regarding his battle against cancer however his planned appearance was cancelled after an unnamed football figure objected against the talk sheffield management then informed members : â there was an agreement that we cancel halsey after pressure from the national ra and the wider football world
â and the sheffield response to the ra said : â our irritation at having been placed in this position can not be underestimated
however , halsey âs strong views on a decline in refereeing standards is certainly born out by the widespread furore around their performances this season
the network , happy to employ the more volatile roy keane as a football pundit , have had no contact with brian moore
the dutch football leader , who has a budget of â¬ 400,000 from his national association for his campaign , is also concerned at the way fox tv were given the rights to the world cup in 2026 without a tender to end their resistance to a world cup in qatar
