suarez left the field a loser last october in his first ever santiago bernabeu clasico but on sunday night he walked off the pitch a man who had put the league title within touching distance of his team â some way to mark your first ever home game against real madrid
â that âs why we paid a lot of money for him , he compliments what we already have , â said luis enrique of a performance and a goal that meant even though real madrid had successfully subdued messi they still lost the game
the barcelona squad have plenty of players who float like butterflies , but at times over the last few seasons what they have really needed was someone who could sting like a bee â suarez did exactly that on sunday night
suarez celebrates after scoring for barcelona in his first ever home match against real madrid suarez gets the better of real madrid pair pepe ( left ) and sergio ramos to score for barcelona on sunday it was nât quite the 3 - 1 win that earlier in the season real madrid inflicted on barcelona â and that could still matter if the two teams finish level on points such is the head - to - head goal - difference rule in spain â but it was still some performance and some win
he then laid another golden opportunity on a plate for messi only to see it missed and real madrid come back into the game and win it 3 - 1
jeremy mathieu , meanwhile , was the unlikely scorer of the first goal
suarez is crowded out during his first - ever el clasico match at the bernabeu as barcelona lost 3 - 1 in october defender jeremy mathieu celebrates with his barcelona team - mates after giving his team the lead luis enrique was questioned for requesting the signing of jeremy mathieu â a 30 - year - old defender with a â¬ 20m price tag was always going to have a hard job convincing supporters but sunday night âs display will have gone a long way to doing that
for suarez the convincing had already been done with those two crucial goals at the etihad that made sure manchester city were brushed aside by barcelona in the champions league
suarez is congratulated by his team - mates as his goal pushed barcelona closer to the la liga title suarez has that same speed of touch , not in his passing , but in his finishing
but barcelona are now in control of their own destiny and in suarez they have someone absolutely determined not to finish second this season as he did last year with liverpool .
