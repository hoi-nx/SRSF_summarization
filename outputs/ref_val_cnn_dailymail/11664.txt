but years of crazy parking rules have made many law - abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals , and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses
you return a minute late to find a parking ticket slapped on your windscreen
local government and communities secretary eric pickles ( left ) and transport secretary patrick mcloughlin ( right ) have vowed to end the ' war on the motorist ' with their new ' common sense ' approach in 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end
that meant not only changing the rules , but changing attitudes , because under the previous government councils were encouraged to fleece shoppers and rivers for every penny , treating them like cash machines on wheels
residents and businesses just had to suffer in silence
local residents and businesses will be able to demand a review of parking in their area , including charges and the use of yellow lines
parking adjudicators will be able to hold councils to account so they can look to change signs and stop charging fines in areas where parking tickets keep being issued
they have also vowed to end the industrial use of cctv ' spy cars ' to enforce on - street parking we are bringing back common sense
very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute ' grace periods ' for council - controlled parking , whether it 's on or off - street , paid or free
we 're also ending the industrial use of cctv ' spy cars ' to enforce on - street parking
and in another victory for common sense parking at an out - of - order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay
people supporting their local high street will be able to enjoy shopping without constantly worrying about trigger happy parking wardens waiting to pounce
