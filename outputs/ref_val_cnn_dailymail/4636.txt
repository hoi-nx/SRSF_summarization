the men expected to carry the can for england âs world cup humiliation will attempt to ride the storm swirling around their embarrassing exit and plough on into an ashes summer
downton , the managing director who has endured a torrid first 14 months in office , gave his full backing to beleaguered coach peter moores on tuesday while making it clear he expects the full support of the ecb
downton has had to make some momentous decisions since replacing hugh morris in the wake of england âs 5 - 0 ashes debacle and it was his call to bring back moores for a second spell as coach that is most under the spotlight now
peter moores ' place as england coach is safe in the short - term , says ecb managing director downton england crashed out of the world cup at the first hurdle on monday after defeat by bangladesh downton says no decisions on the future of players or staff , including peter moores , would be made immediately but a review will take place peter moores is fighting for his credibility at international level after england failed to live up to any expectations at the world cup by crashing to a first - round exit sealed by defeat against bangladesh
yet downton , who called peter moores the â outstanding coach of his generation â when preferring him to ashley giles , was adamant that nothing had changed when he addressed england âs worst world cup of all from london on tuesday
â peter moores is an outstanding coach and i do nât think 10 months is a fair amount of time for him to prove that , particularly when we have spent the last six of those playing one - day cricket and trying to catch up , â said downton
â clearly as head coach he feels responsible for what has happened but we all feel responsible frankly , because we feel we âve let the country down and nobody wants to do that
in less than a month we will be playing in the west indies so i do nât expect anything to change before then
â i âm not saying everybody âs job is safe and i âm not saying everybody âs going to get sacked
â bangladesh players celebrates after their victory over england that eliminated eoin morgan 's side from the world cup england batsman moeen lays on the ground after being run out by bangladesh wicketkeeper rahim the question now is whether english cricket âs two new bosses agree with downton because if they do not , incoming ecb chairman colin and new chief executive tom will have a big call to make
england are due to name their ashes test party to tour the caribbean next tuesday and if they want to get rid of peter moores , they have to move quickly
â i âve worked with colin over the last year and he âs been extremely supportive , â said downton , whose position would be untenable if his superiors moved to replace peter moores
â so does downton expect himself and peter moores to still be in place come the first ashes test in july , before which england have to play a revitalised new zealand in test and one - day series after returning home from the caribbean ? it âs imperative england begin again in one - day cricket with a young , vibrant side in tune with the modern 50 - over game and give them as much experience as possible before the next world cup in 2019
who should go ? so the group of senior players who have failed to produce the goods at this world cup must all go now â that means ian bell , jimmy anderson and stuart broad should all concentrate on test cricket
peter moores endures the post-match press conference after his side fell 15 runs short of their target downton says incoming ecb chairman colin , who did not appoint him , has been supportive â that âs the plan
â the problem for england is the dearth of quality alternatives to peter moores , particularly as some of the leading coaches in the world in gary kirsten , stephen fleming and the man the ecb would most like â jason gillespie â do not want the year - round slog of international cricket

to be picked by england you have to be scoring an awful lot of runs in county cricket and you have to be perceived by the selectors to be a positive influence
â yet until england start winning regularly the pietersen question will go on being asked of downton , not to mention those questions over the ability of peter moores to finally prove he belongs with england
l england have injury concerns over chris woakes and moeen ali ahead of their dead - rubber final world cup match against afghanistan on friday
that âs more runs and a better average than any england batsman has managed
head to head : england have never played afghanistan in a one - day game , but they did meet at the icc world twenty20 in 2012 in colombo
