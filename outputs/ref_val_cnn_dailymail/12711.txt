sen. harry 's harry reid 's perfunctory announcement on friday that he wo n't seek re-election next year -- leaving a vacancy for leadership of the senate -- was followed , hours later , by a matter - of - fact statement in an interview with the washington post : " i think schumer should be able to succeed me
left - leaning activists have begun scrambling to block schumer 's rise
the progressive organization democracy for america is calling for sen. elizabeth warren to seek the leadership post , and the left - leaning daily kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing schumer as too close to the " wall street wing " of the democratic
with more than $ 13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers , schumer has more money than all but one member of the senate -- and is the only democrat in the top 10 in that category
even among the 100 - member senate -- home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos -- schumer has long operated at a high - octane level of smarts and media - savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues
) schumer is n't the only politically ambitious kid from brooklyn -- before attending harvard , he graduated from a public school , james madison high , whose alumni include supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg , sen. bernie sanders and ex- sen. norm coleman of minnesota ( a childhood pal of schumer 's )
but schumer 's political climb been a long - term work in progress
with allies , money and the blessing of harry reid , schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book , " positively american , " which lays out a vision for how senate should lead america
like schumer himself , the book is savvy , hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle - class voters
those who wonder what a schumer senate leadership would look like should take a look as senate prepare for what could well be the start of the schumer era on capitol hill .
