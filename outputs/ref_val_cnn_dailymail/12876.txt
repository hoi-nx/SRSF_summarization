young innocent children were brutally massacred in a school in peshawar along with their teachers
it shook a nation that had already seen more than 55,000 of its innocent civilians die in the hands of terrorism in the last 10 years , to a whole new level
hailing from a humble background , where both my parents have served in the field of education their entire lives , the strong emphasis on education in our house was probably another reason why this incident had affected me so deeply

so i picked up the phone and started calling all my colleagues from film , fashion , tv and music
we all got together because we all want a progressive , peaceful , tolerant and positive pakistan
and the response to the song and video further solidified my belief that every pakistan wants the same
i also feel that there is a lot more to pakistan than what the world gets to see
pakistan is a beautiful land with beautiful people who -- like those in any other nation -- want to live in harmony with themselves and the world
a place where people sing , dance and play
the world needs to see pakistan in a whole different light to help us out of this darkness
a pakistan that stands united to make sure that the lives of those innocent children did not go to waste
so , i collaborated with a leading pakistan educational non-profit organization , the citizens foundation ( tcf ) and 141schools.org ( 141 schools ) , a new citizen web movement
together , they are building 141 schools across pakistan
all proceeds from the downloads of the song will go towards building schools for the children of pakistan and ensuring a bright future
