zimmerman says he bears a grudge against president obama , accusing him of inflaming racial tensions around the trayvon martin case
zimmerman , who was acquitted of murder in 2013 over trayvon martin 's death , made the allegations against obama in a video posted on his lawyers ' website
in the new video , zimmerman claims it was obama who stoked racial tensions surrounding the case
he cites the president 's remarks in march 2012 , when the case was still being investigated , in which obama said , " if i had a son , he would look like trayvon martin
zimmerman notes that obama 's press secretary at the time , jay carney , had said previously that the white house would not wade into the case , calling it " a local law - enforcement matter
zimmerman 's comments are the first since the department of justice announced last month that it would n't bring any civil rights charges against him
