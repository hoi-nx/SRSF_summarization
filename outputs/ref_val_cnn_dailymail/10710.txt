the home secretary said british had tolerated extremist views for too long and hardliners needed to understand the ' game is up ' for anybody who rejects british values
home secretary theresa may ( above ) will promise to drive out the ' significant ' number of fanatics who have been able to infiltrate british establishments as the mail revealed yesterday , there will also be new civil orders to silence preachers of hate , a review of sharia courts and new rules making it easier to ban extremist groups
closure orders for mosques or other premises hosting extremist meetings blacklist of people and bodies public sector should not engage with all foreign religious workers in pastoral roles required to speak english orders making it unlawful to preach hate in public or on the internet banning orders for extremist groups that fall short of existing terrorist proscription thresholds migrants arriving on visas must declare they will respect british values independent review of operation of sharia courts ban on asylum for terror suspects translation services cut public spending on translation services will be cut to encourage all muslims to speak english
closure orders would be served on any premises owned or occupied by extremists or used to host extremist speakers â including mosques
she called for a new partnership to defeat the fanatics , saying : ' to those who do not want to join this new partnership , to those who choose consciously to reject our values and the basic principles of our society , the message is equally clear : the game is up
' mrs may told islamist hardliners : ' the game is up
we will expose your hateful beliefs for what they are ' mrs may is expected to set out priorities for a tory government - including a review of sharia courts and powers to stop preachers of hate like anjem choudary ( pictured ) from public speaking or using social media lord prescott policy failures are partly to blame for islamic extremism in british , prescott claimed yesterday
' lord prescott served under tony blair through the 2003 invasion of iraq and the british military intervention in afghanistan , before leaving office in 2007
tory mps welcomed her uncompromising stance in which she criticised those who sought to excuse islamist extremism as mere ' social conservatism '
the measures will be included in the tory manifesto but , in the event of a new coalition , would be fiercely resisted by the liberal democrats
the labour prime minister famously declared that the ' rules of the game are changing ' but later abandoned his own proposal for mosque closure orders after a backlash from muslim groups
at least four tory cabinet ministers , including education secretary nicky morgan and communities secretary eric pickles , are also understood to have argued the strategy needs more work
islamic human rights commission chairman massoud shadjareh said : ' nobody will be fooled by the home secretary 's claims that these measures are designed to tackle extremism
' they are a shameless expression of a hate and bigotry that is increasingly becoming normalised in british
shadow home secretary yvette cooper said : ' everyone other than the extremists agrees we should robustly defend and actively promote the pluralistic values our society rightly holds in esteem
but it is n't enough for the home secretary to say it , she needs to act
