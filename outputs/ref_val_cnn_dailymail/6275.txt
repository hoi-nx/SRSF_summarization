bale rammed some of the ridiculous criticism he has received in recent weeks from real madrid supporters back down their throats with a first half double and the perfect goal celebration
when he put real madrid ahead on 18 minutes in the 2 - 0 win over levante on sunday night he made sure he left off some steam , covering his ears as he ran to the corner to give the flag a celebratory kick
host commentator thanks for following sportsmail 's live coverage of real madrid 's 2 - 0 win over levante
if only karim benzema had netted that ridiculous flick , eh ? anyway , bale 's seven - game run without scoring is over and he looks ready for next week 's el clasico , even if cristiano ronaldo was a bit out of sorts
real madrid move to within a point of barcelona , and they are nine goals behind the catalan club in terms of goal difference
marcelo puts in a cross , bale slicks it on and cristiano ronaldo shins the ball wide
cristiano ronaldo elects to allow someone else to take a free - kick
oh , and javier hernandez was just one of four real madrid players offside - the linesman spots it
cristiano ronaldo still looking for that elusive goal , he cuts in from the left along the edge of the area , past two markers and fires in the shot but it 's straight at goalkeeper marino
another change , karim benzema gets a bit of a rest towards the end - with most people still gutted not to see his wondergoal effort go it - and is replaced by javier hernandez
he might be the best player in the world but cristiano ronaldo is taking a bit of a liberty here
first the lack of respect to bale in the first half , and now he 's running around demanding the ball
karim benzema plays in bale and he fires at goal
there 's four forwards for real madrid on the pitch now - looks like they 're going to go with cristiano ronaldo and karim benzema up front as a pair , jese on the left and bale on the right as an extremely attacking front through
wow ! how do you describe that ? cristiano ronaldo crosses from the right and karim benzema is completely unmarked
nabir el zhar ( yes , the ex-liverpool one ) and ruben garcia replace jose luis morales and xumetra for levante
not much going on so far but karim benzema fires over a half - volley seven minutes after the break
can cristiano ronaldo get himself a goal ? and will bale get his hat - trick ? we 'll find out in the next 45 minutes at the bernabeu
first , his acrobatic volley was cleared and bale smashed in the rebound , with cristiano ronaldo raising his arm in frustration even as bale netted
second , bale deflected in cristiano ronaldo 's shot , which was heading wide , to make it 2 - 0 , and the ballon d'or looked far from pleased , and it 's not something that 's gone unnoticed
two bale goals - the second to the frustration of cristiano ronaldo - and they 're 2 - 0 up
it - decisively - deflects in off bale and real madrid are 2 - 0 up
cristiano ronaldo celebrates the strike but we 're crediting that one to bale
no pleasing these guys is there ? they 've done next to nothing so far but levante are trying to play a bit , but there 's just no intensity to their play jose luis morales does well down the left but he ca n't get past his man and real madrid recover and are free to build up again
it 's real madrid 's 10th shot of the game ( levante have had none ) and cristiano ronaldo almost makes it 2 - 0 to his side
he looks set for a tap - in in front of goal after bale plays the ball across the six - yard line but tono manages to get in with a last - ditch block to save levante
the real madrid captain got a less - than - warm reception from the crowd when his name was announced pre-match , as you can hear here : bale runs towards the bernabeu crowd with his hands to his ears
where are the boos now ? after cristiano ronaldo 's acrobatic volley was headed off the line , bale slams in with a right - footed volley
lovely flick from bale over to karim benzema who cuts back to cristiano ronaldo inside the box and he toe - pokes it towards the corner ... but it hits the base of marino 's post
it 's bad enough having to play away against real madrid , but levante have a dreadful record here and will likely just be hoping not to be on the end of a rout
the reverse fixture back in october ended 5 - 0 to real madrid , with cristiano ronaldo scoring twice , and their past record at the bernabeu makes grim reading too , looking from now back to 2008 their form here reads : 3 - 0 , 5 - 1 , 4 - 2 , 2 - 0 , 8 - 0 ( yes , eight ) , 5 - 2
the big news for real madrid is that their famous front three of karim benzema , cristiano ronaldo and bale all start - while toni kroos is rested
here 's the rest of their line - up plus the levante xi : real madrid ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : navas ; carvajal , pepe , ramos , marcelo ; modric , silva , isco ; bale , karim benzema , cristiano ronaldo
