kerry tried to defuse the ongoing row over netanyahu 's forthcoming speech to congress - despite fears it will affect negotiations with iran over their nuclear program
the secretary of state said he did not want the israeli 's prime minister 's forthcoming address to a joint session of congress to become ' some great political football '
netanyahu 's speech , organized by john boehner , the republican house speaker , was set up without the blessing of the obama administration - and comes as the white house tries to strike a deal over iran 's nuclear ambitions
kerry played up u.s. - israeli unity in an interview on sunday for abc 's this week show , insisting ' the prime minister of israeli is welcome to speak in the u.s. , obviously
' there is , however , a clear different in policy between netanyahu and the white house - with the israeli leader expected to urge congress to stop iran 's nuclear ambitions by keeping up the current sanctions regime
kerry reiterated d.c. 's determination to pursue negotiations with iran , saying the white house deserved ' the benefit of the doubt ' to see if a nuclear deal could be reached
by accepting an invitation from the gop party to address congress on tuesday , the israeli leader infuriated the obama administration , which said it was not told of the speech before plans were made public in an apparent breach of protocol
the israeli prime minister , who is running for re-election in a march 17 ballot , has framed his visit as being above politics and he portrayed himself as being a guardian for all jews
not popular : anti-israeli demonstrator are pictured above protesting in d.c. ahead of netanyahu 's address netanyahu is expected to use his speech to urge congress to approve new sanctions against iran despite obama 's pledge to veto such legislation because it would jeopardize nuclear talks
u.s. officials fear he is seeking to sabotage the iran diplomacy , and critics have suggested his visit is an elaborate election stunt that will play well with voters back home
while white house and israeli officials insist that key areas of cooperation , from counter-terrorism to intelligence to cyber security , will remain unaffected , the divide over the iran talks has shaped up as the worst in decades
