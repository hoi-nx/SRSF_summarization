paris french lawmakers are weighing a ban on extremely thin models
dr. veran , a doctor and french lawmaker who 's proposing the measures , said it 's time to put a stop to the practice of pressuring models to be so thin that it 's dangerous for their health
" we want to combat the idea that an agency could urge a model to stop eating ; for example eating cotton balls to lose their appetite , to always lose more weight , " he said
the average bmi for a woman in french is 23.2 -- the lowest average in western europe , according to a 2009 study from french 's national institute of demographic studies
in french , veran said , 30,000 - 40,000 people suffer from eating disorders , mainly teenagers
marisol touraine , french 's minister of social affairs , expressed her support for the new anti-anorexia measures in an interview with cnn affiliate bfmtv
extreme cases such as that of french model caro have sparked calls for change for years
similar concerns in spain , italy and israel prompted those countries to adopt laws against the use of ultra-thin models on catwalks and in advertising campaigns
israel even has strict rules on how model 's bodies are photoshopped ; any changes must be clearly marked on the photo
