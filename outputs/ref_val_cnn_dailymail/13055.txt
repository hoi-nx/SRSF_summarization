boston tsarnaev 's own words may determine whether he lives or dies , even if he never speaks a word at his trial
he slouched in his chair as jurors watched videos of him both before and after two nail - packed pressure cooker bombs exploded , killing three people , claiming 17 limbs and hurting more than 260 others
he did n't utter a peep as his tweets and words he had scribbled on the side of a pleasure boat flashed up on a big screen and were quoted in court
at issue : was tsarnaev a terrorist looking to punish the u.s. for policies he believed were harmful to muslims ? or , was he a goofball stoner who simply followed the lead of his older , more radical brother ? the defense team tried to portray tsarnaev as a confused college kid who , like countless others , watches comedy central and cracks crass jokes
he jokes about not seeing commercials featuring the trix rabbit , and about " whale watching " outside a mcdonald 's fast - food restaurant
his brother was dead and police knew who he was ; they were scouring the boston suburb of watertown for tsarnaev when he slipped under a tarp and climbed aboard the slip away ii , a fishing boat dry - docked in a watertown backyard
he hid for hours before being discovered
" tsarnaev wrote he was jealous that his brother , tamerlan , had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior ; he was killed the night before during a gunbattle with police
the indictment against him says tsarnaev helped in his brother 's demise by running him over and dragging him along the road as he tried to run down police
about the bombings , tsarnaev wrote on the boat that he did n't enjoy killing innocent civilians , but that circumstances excused it
while in the boat , he wrote that he could n't stand to see the u.s. government " go unpunished " for killing muslims
" we muslims are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all
" tsarnaev 's connections : who 's who judge george o'toole viewed the boat tuesday afternoon so he could rule on a defense request to show the entire boat " in context " to the jury
on monday , fbi agent steven kimball testified about two twitter accounts used by tsarnaev
he sent it while on the run : " i 'm a stress free kind of guy " his other account carried seven tweets , including this : " strive to be a better muslim , be greedy with your time , devote most of it to the almighty for it is his satisfaction that you need # islam " the jury also has now seen tsarnaev in videos , trailing his brother onto boylston street
the next video showed tsarnaev in the crowd running
by the next morning , his brother was dead , and tsarnaev was hiding in the boat , writing of martyrdom and paradise .
