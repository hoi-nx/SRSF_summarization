england full - back brown is expected to be available for the six nations showdown with scotland as he enters the final stage of his recovery from concussion
brown 's tenacity and watertight defence were missed in sunday 's 19 - 9 defeat by ireland after he suffered a double setback during the return to play protocols having been knocked out against italy
brown has been suffering from concussion and missed england 's defeat in ireland last week brown was knocked out while tackling italy 's andrea masi at twickenham last month ' we 're pretty confident about brown
he 's had a reasonable amount of time now and certainly all the signs from everyone , including from brown himself , is that he 's back to 100 per cent , ' head coach stuart lancaster said
' alex goode deputised for brown on the afternoon england 's grand slam dream evaporated at the aviva stadium and while he produced some fine moments , he was out - jumped during robbie henshaw 's try in the key moment of the match
alex goode will play for saracens at wasps on sunday , after which stuart lancaster insists he will make a call on who starts at full - back against scotland when the red rose seek to revive their title aspirations
' both brown and alex goode will compete for that 15 shirt next week , ' stuart lancaster said
' brown is set to return to training in a much - needed boost to england boss stuart lancaster alex goode will compete with brown for the no 15 jersey after filling in against ireland inside centre luther burrell has a calf injury but lancaster is ' reasonably optimistic ' he will resume training on tuesday
lancaster 's immediate impression after england had been kicked into submission by jonny sexton and his lions half - back partner conor murray was one of a ' tight test decided by small margins '
and having reviewed a defeat that has halted the momentum generated after wales and italy were swept aside in an encouraging start to the six nations , lancaster voices his exasperation at failing to deliver during key moments
luther burrell has picked up a calf injury but lancaster is hopeful that the centre will be fine for scotland stuart lancaster is adamant that jonny sexton was the reason between defeat and victory in ireland ' there 's frustration that we had n't delivered the level and quality of performance that we 'd hoped to , ' stuart lancaster said
