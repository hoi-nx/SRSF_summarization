fa chairman greg dyke has described as â pretty scary â the increase in disciplinary cases brought against players surrounding referees to try to influence decisions
greg dyke was speaking out a week after chelsea âs champions league defeat by psg during which nine chelsea players crowded around the dutch referee bjorn kuipers following zlatan ibrahimovic âs challenge on oscar which resulted in the swedish talisman being sent off
the fa clampdown on such incidents has seen an increase in clubs in the top five divisions â from the premier league to the conference - charged with ' surrounding match officials ' ( three or more players from one club approach a match official in a confrontational manner ) from six last season to 16 with another three months of the campaign still to go
terry , cesc fabregas and their chelsea team - mates surround referee bjorn kuipers all nine outfield chelsea players remonstrate with bjorn kuipers as oscar is left in a heap on the floor warnings or reminders are also up from 23 last campaign to 29 during 2014 - 2015
zlatan ibrahimovic was sent off for his challenge which provoked an aggressive reaction from chelsea chelsea captain terry moved to defend his side 's actions during their clash against psg the fa will now look at heavier fines than the current sliding scale of costs from Â£ 20,000 - Â£ 500 or other options to address the worrying upward curve in harassing the match officials
ironically , considering that the chelsea players ' distasteful conduct brought this issue to the fore , uefa do not have a similar charge in their rulebook
chelsea captain terry admitted after the psg match that the willingness to surround referees â does nât look good â
