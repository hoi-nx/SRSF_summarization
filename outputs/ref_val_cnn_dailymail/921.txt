a pair of mysterious bright spots on the asteroid ceres could be towering ' water volcanoes ' , scientists claim
recent images from the dawn spacecraft reveal the spots , dubbed ' feature number 5 ' , at various angles as the asteroid rotates
the glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of ceres , suggesting that they must be high above the surface rather than at the bottom of an impact crater , as previously believed
the glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of ceres , suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface ' what is amazing is that you can see the feature while the rim is still in the line of sight , ' said andreas nathues , a planetary scientist at the max planck institute for solar system research in gottingen , germany
scientists have speculated that the interior of ceres is rocky with a layer of water and ice
the leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge ' cryovolcanoes ' due to internal pressure in the asteroid
ceres continues to baffle astronomers as dawn orbits the dwarf planet
this image was taken by the dawn spacecraft of dwarf planet ceres on february 19 from a distance of nearly 29,000 miles ( 46,000 km )
it shows that the brightest spot on ceres has a dimmer companion , which apparently lies in the same basin dawn observed ceres completing one full rotation , which lasted about nine hours
the images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at ceres ' surface : from shallow , flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system
the dawn spacecraft pulled into orbit earlier this month around the ceres in the asteroid belt
there is high interest in the mission because ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice , water , and minerals

dawn has been steadily returning stunning animations of ceres
the ' alien ' mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the dawn hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on march 6 ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image
the long exposure made ceres appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size a cropped , magnified view of ceres appears in the inset image at lower left dawn will be captured into ceres ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) ceres is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801
since launching in 2007 , dawn has already visited vesta , a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles ( 168 million km ) away from ceres
the distance between vesta and ceres is greater than the distance between the earth and the sun. during its 14 months in orbit around vesta , the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights , including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history
