the cap of sea ice that spreads across the arctic in winter appears to have been the smallest on record this year , according to nasa
arctic sea ice , frozen seawater floating on top of the arctic and its neighboring seas , is in a state of constant flux
if this year 's maximum extent , totaling 5.61 million square miles , was reached on february 25 , it was reached 15 days earlier than the 1981 to 2010 average date of march 12 , according to nsidc
a peak of 5.61 million square miles is about 50,000 square miles below the previous lowest peak wintertime extent , reached in 2011 , according to nsidc
scientists have been using satellite data to track changes in arctic sea ice , a vital habitat for birds and marine mammals such as polar bears , seals and walruses , for over three decades
according to the noaa , ted scambos , nsidc lead scientist , puts the potentially record low maximum sea ice extent this year down to low ice extent in the pacific and a late drop in ice extent in the barents sea
scientists say it does n't necessarily follow that a low maximum winter extent will mean a record amount of shrinkage in sea ice over the summer , however
while the winter sea ice extent was low in 2006 and 2011 , neither of those years saw an unusually low summer minimum , noaa said
" over the span of the satellite record , arctic sea ice has been declining significantly , while sea ice in the antarctic has increased very slightly , " the noaa news release said
" recent research demosntrates that the antarctic gains do not balance out the arctic losses : globally , sea ice extent has decreased over the past several decades
