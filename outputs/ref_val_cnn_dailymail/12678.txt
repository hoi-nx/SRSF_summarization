an investigation by the charlottesville , virginia , police department has found no " substantive basis " to support the allegations of a uva student that she was gang raped at a fraternity there
the allegations were first revealed in a story in rolling stone magazine that was initially widely circulated and then increasingly widely doubted
" that does n't mean that something terrible did n't happen to jackie " on the day in question , police chief longo said regarding the uva student and her allegations
while rolling stone 's reporting was clearly shoddy , for example , some writers who initially poked holes in jackie 's story did so for ideological motives
for instance , even before the reporting lapses were revealed , conservative commentator goldberg called jackie 's story unbelievable
" instead , goldberg insisted , jackie 's account was " a convenient conversation for an exposÃ© of rape culture , " something , incidentally , goldberg also doubts to be real
" ' rape culture ' suggests that there is a large and obvious belief system that condones and enables rape as an end in itself in america , " goldberg later wrote in national review
it 's all hogwash , says goldberg , alleging that the very idea of " rape culture " is just " an elaborate political lie intended to strengthen the hand of activists
on october 24 , 2009 , in richmond , california , a 15 - year - old girl was repeatedly raped by a group of young men in a courtyard outside their high school homecoming dance
on august 12 , 2012 , a 16 - year - old girl who was incapacitated by alcohol was raped by two high school football players in steubenville , ohio
in the backseat of a car and later in the basement of a house , the two assailants stripped their victim naked and took turns , one inserting his fingers into her vagina , the other forcing his penis into her mouth
some of those at the party even posted pictures of the unresponsive girl , being carried by her wrists and ankles , on twitter with words like " rape " and " drunk girl
on may 11 , 2014 , an 18 - year - old woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by three students at a party after their high school prom
in june 2014 , a 16 - year - old girl went to a party where she was allegedly drugged and raped
the photos went viral on the internet , with twitter users posting photos of themselves in the same awkward position , mocking the alleged victim
and while we do n't know whether something terrible happened to jackie , it would be truly tragic if we let this incident cast doubt on all allegations of rape and sexual assault
too often rapists are given the benefit of the doubt , even in the case of overwhelming evidence , while female victims are shamed ( see multiple bill cosby allegations )
we should not use this case to undermine the pervasive reality of rape culture
