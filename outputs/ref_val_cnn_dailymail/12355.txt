this is what it 's come to
starbucks asked its local baristas to have conversations about race
not the federal government or congress
not academia or the naacp
but a national coffee shop chain waded into an area of social conflict that is as old as the slave ships and as modern as stop - and - frisk policing
starbucks ceo howard schultz was accused of ruining that magic morning moment when customers fork over $ 4.15 for a " grande " coffee with warm skim milk and vanilla extract
a barista writing " race together " on cups was called an affront to mornings and coffee -- such important conversations belonged inside a hallowed institution , not a common coffee shop , where apparently people no longer chat
a lot of the reaction came via snipes on twitter from people calling schultz out on starbucks ' diversity , the hue of his mochaccinos , or his liberal " brewing " of controversy
the nastiness drove the company 's communications chief briefly off twitter
then , after barely a week , starbucks shut down the whole darned thing , pushing ahead with a hiring and media initiative instead
but treating twitter as an important voice of american conscience is like focusing on the annoying beep emitting from your smoke detector instead of addressing the fact that the battery 's run dry
what 's trending is not necessarily what matters
people do need to talk about race
not because of a harmless coffee cup , but because we have a real race problem and we need solutions
starfish media group just finished a nationwide tour of american colleges , universities and communities called " black in america 2015
" it 's based on our cnn documentary series that takes a close look at the challenges and triumphs of being black in american : from the hopes of the martin luther king era to today 's unlikely brew of un-kept promises and vast opportunities
there were plenty of conversations about race among the thousands of black and white college students and panelists like rapper chuck d and cedric alexander of the national organization of black law enforcement executives
they lined up to talk about how their experiences mirrored those of the people in the documentaries : black families finding common roots with whites , the politics of skin color , or the black - and - blue conflict over the police engaging in racial profiling
the topics and perceptions were an unending thread
not only did people talk when they were offered the chance ; they wanted to talk
new technology has multiplied and spread symbols of racial injustice , but that has created new challenges and new reasons to talk
" that is modern - day terror , and worth at least a coffee shop chat
black people talk about race all the time , from processing comments about our freckles to recounting how someone rolls their fingers through our child 's curly hair
ceo howard schultz was left wondering why it was such a bad idea to encourage people to talk about race
his initial letter to his staff made it clear he believes his # racetogether coffee cup campaign can contribute to starting an important conversation
