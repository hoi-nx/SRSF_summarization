diarist anne frank likely died a month earlier than previously thought meaning there was little chance of her surviving the holocaust , according to new research
it was previously believed that the jewish teenager , who was sent to the bergen-belsen concentration camp , died of typhus on 31 march 1945 , two weeks before the camp was liberated
however a new study puts the date of her death at some point in mid february , meaning that even if british troops had reached the camp a little sooner , she would likely not have survived
the book documents how anne frank , her sister margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house , but were eventually betrayed and sent to bergen-belsen concentration camp , where she and her sister perished
but after two years the group were anonymously betrayed and were sent to their deaths at the bergen-belsen concentration camp , where anne frank died of typhus in 1945
because the allies liberated the camp on april 15 , this added a bitter twist to her tale - the thought that if she could have hung on a few weeks longer she might have been saved
bergen-belsen concentration camp was liberated in april 1945 , meaning if anne frank died in march , then she was two weeks from rescue
but this new study shows she was months from safety ( anne frank pictured left , with father frank , and right ) anne frank and her sister margot died during a typhus epidemic that swept through the bergen-belsen concentration camp camp in 1945 , killing an estimated 35,000 people ( pictured , typhus patients inside the camp ) ' so maybe if they 'd lived two more weeks ... well , that 's not true anymore
' anne frank and margot were just two of an estimated 35,000 deaths at bergen-belsen concentration camp when a typhus epidemic swept through the camp in early 1945 .
