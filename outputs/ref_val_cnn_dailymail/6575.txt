mr grant , posing as his business guru alter - ego michael green , used online leaflets to boast of his wealth and status in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions
using pictures of himself in his private plane and six - bedroom mansion , the future conservative party minister offered his ' friends ' the chance to learn how to make their fortune â as long as they handed him $ 197 , worth Â£ 130
the revelations come just days after mr grant , 46 , faced calls to quit after being forced to admit he had continued to offer get - rich - quick advice after becoming a conservative party mp despite vehement denials to the contrary
it comes after a recording emerged from 2006 , a year after he was elected to parliament , capturing the mp selling self - help guide stinking rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a ' ton of cash '
the full extent of his toe - curling sales pitch was published in the sunday mirror today after pictures were published on the website political scrapbook
in it he offers punters the chance to buy his toolkit on ' how to become stinking rich online ' for $ 197 â even though he claimed it was worth $ 100,000
mr grant offered his online kit to people throughout the uk and across the world from his howtocorp business based in north west london
he wrote : ' since owning an online business has enabled me to live in a $ 2m home ... to drive 3 high - end luxury cars and to own and operate my own aircraft , i suppose a toolkit that exposes every secret used to build that kind of wealth should rightfully sell for say $ 100,000
the letter , published in 2004 , featured mr grant posing in his luxury sports car with the caption : ' that 's me ... and i 'm sitting in my brandspanking - new crossfire convertible 3.2l ( delivered saturday july 24 )
but buying and maintaining an aircraft ( and this is my second machine ) is n't cheap ! ' but i just hate to rent ... so i took out my pocket - book and bought a plane
dean archer , 50 , said he had feared losing his family home after mr grant warned he would take him to court over a facebook post that mentioned his internet sales sideline as michael green
