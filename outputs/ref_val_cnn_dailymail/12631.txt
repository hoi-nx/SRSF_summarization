once again the global community waits to see if the united states and its partners can really halt iran 's quest for nuclear power through a verifiable accord or if tehran is trying to buy more time for a clandestine nuclear weapons program it is suspected of having
true , the government of the iran has consistently denied it seeks anything more than nuclear energy for peaceful purposes
iran reluctantly disclosed to the iaea , or iaea â only after united states - led detection â its clandestine enrichment of uranium at an underground facility near qum , testing of bridge wires to explode the detonators of atom bombs at the parchin military facility near tehran , and development of an advanced multipoint trigger system for nuclear warheads
moreover , khamenei has made it amply clear to iran 's citizens in the text of an infographic on his website , also reproduced by the state - controlled news media , that " iran must not cease or slow down " but should " continue nuclear research , expansion , and progress
however , economically strapped and internationally isolated , iran 's citizens are putting pronounced pressure on president hassan rouhani and khamenei
so iran politicians and clerics , even those on the national security and foreign policy parliamentary committee , have gradually begun acknowledging that sooner or later " some sort of a result [ i.e. , nuclear deal ] " will have to be accepted by tehran
iran 's economy ranks only 32nd in the world , according to data from the world bank , despite its vast energy resources and well - educated public
consequently there will be countervailing internal pressure on iran 's leaders to withstand fully meeting obligations under the nonproliferation treaty , irrespective of whether a deal is reached , even if the socioeconomic cost to their citizens and fever - pitch global consternation continue to rise
but iran 's leaders also know full well that agreeing to a pact that lifts most or all sanctions will boost the economy and thereby generate additional resources to enhance the regime 's popularity at home and influence abroad
this central goal of iran 's presence at the negotiating table was made crystal clear during the supreme leader 's nav roz , or new year , public address on march 21 : " removal of sanctions is part of the subject of negotiations , not of the results ... removal of sanctions should occur without any deal when an agreement is reached
but as the united states and other world powers work fervently toward clinching the long - awaited nuclear agreement with the islamic republic , it is important for western negotiators and politicians to bear two central considerations in mind : ( 1 ) irrespective of mechanisms written into the deal , will verification actually be possible on the ground to ensure iran both limits and becomes fully transparent about its nuclear program ? ( 2 ) would the world collectively or the united states independently be able to enforce punitive actions , such as re-establishing sanctions , if iran fails to comply fully and in a timely manner ? iran 's president continues to suggest that his country seeks a " win - win deal which would serve the interests of all the parties , " as does his negotiating team
but many western and middle eastern leaders fear the united states and its allies will not be able to truly enforce nuclear limits upon iran through any treaty
not surprisingly , influential hard - line iran leaders including ayatollah sadegh larijani , who heads iran 's judiciary , trumpet : " our country and our negotiating officials ... are the real winners in these talks
" four years ago iran 's revolutionary guards declared : " the day after iran 's first nuclear test is a normal day ... but for some of us there will be a new sparkle in our eyes
" even if a deal is done , will iran gamble that with the exception of the united states and israel , nations can come to live with it eventually reaching the threshold of nuclear breakout or wielding nuclear weapons ?
