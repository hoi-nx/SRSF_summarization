more than any other telescope in orbit , hubble has expanded the frontiers of human knowledge
in the april issue of national geographic , some of the most stunning images beamed back for the telescope have been revealed
the horsehead nebula is a cold , dark cloud of gas and dust , silhouetted against the bright nebula ic 434
the nebula is relatively close at 1,500 light years from earth hubble has helped scientists understand how planets and galaxies form , detected black holes and changed our theories surrounding dark energy , a mysterious force that causes the universe to expand faster and faster as time goes on
the hundreds of thousands of images beamed back from hubble have helped scientists unravel cosmic mysteries as well as estimate the age of the universe to about 14 billion years old
among them is the horsehead nebula - a cold , dark cloud of gas and dust , silhouetted against the bright nebula ngc 434 1,500 light years from earth
another remarkable image shows a display of starlight , glowing gas , and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust that forms the spiral galaxy ngc 130
this is one of hubble 's largest images ever made of a complete galaxy
some of the most striking scenes are created during the death throes of intermediate - mass stars , when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space
but observations by the hubble of a phenomenon called a ' light echo ' around the star have uncovered remarkable new features this huge , young stellar grouping , called r136 , is only a few million years old and resides in the 30 doradus nebula , a turbulent star - birth region in the large magellanic cloud , a satellite galaxy of the milky way the telescope captured a display of starlight , glowing gas , and silhouetted dark clouds of interstellar dust in this 4 - foot - by - 8 - foot image of the barred spiral galaxy ngc 130
this is one of hubble 's largest images ever made of a complete galaxy ' launched into orbit aboard the space shuttle discovery on april 24 , 1990 , amid flurries of hope and hype , the hubble promptly faltered , ' explained ferris writing in april 's issue of national geographic an iconic image from hubble captures the dying breaths from planetary nebula butterfly nebula
' taken in 1995 , the team revealed never - before - seen details of three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young , massive stars in a small region of the m16 , or m16
the hubble image shows more than 100 million stars and thousands of star clusters embedded in a section of the galaxy âs pancake - shaped disc stretching across over 40,000 light - years
some of the most striking scenes are created during the death throes of intermediate - mass stars , when great clouds of superheated gas are expelled into space
known perhaps more appropriately as the bug or butterfly nebula , this complex nebula lies roughly 3800 light - years away from us within the milky way click on the image to zoom in the new hubble photo of the pillars of creation is sharper than the original , and also has a wider field of view
