boko haram , the nigeria - based islamist terror group , has pledged allegiance to isis , according to an audio message purported to be from boko haram 's leader , shekau
in the audio , which was posted online saturday , the speaker says boko haram is announcing its " allegiance to the caliph of the islam , ibrahim ibn awad ibn ibrahim al-husseini al-qurashi , " which is another name for isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi
" boko haram joining the isis fold makes sense to both groups , " he said from abuja , nigeria
" boko haram will get legitimacy , which will help its recruiting , funding and logistics as it expands into ( french - speaking ) west africa
it will also get guidance from isis in media warfare and propaganda
" isis gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate
" zenn said the allegiance will be official when an isis leader such as spokesman abu mohammed al adnani issues a statement
the prerequisite for boko haram joining isis coalition was a coming together of two factions
isis connected with former ansaru fighters within boko haram and pressed them to further unify the group 's ranks
the pledge follows a period during which shekau 's faction had been mimicking isis , including praising al-baghdadi and featuring his image in their videos and photos
it appears that a month ago isis set up a twitter account on which saturday 's message was linked , zenn said
the twitter handle was mutually promoted by boko haram and isis
u.s. intelligence officials have some doubts the two groups would get along
