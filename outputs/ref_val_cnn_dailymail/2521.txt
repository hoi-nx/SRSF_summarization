a south africa university has voted to pull down a statue of a notorious britain colonialist after students threw a bucket of excrement at it
bosses at the university of cape town bowed to demands to remove the statue of cecil rhodes after a series of protests on campus
university of cape town , the oldest university in south africa and regularly ranked as the best on the continent , was built on land donated by cecil rhodes , a mining magnate who died in 1902
excrement was launched at the statue during one protest but the ' poo protest ' was launched by a small group of students earlier this month , sparking a series of demonstrations demanding that the statue be torn down
the large statue of a notoriously racist rhodes gazing across an south africa that he coveted for the britain empire made them feel alienated on a campus still dominated by white staff , they said
on friday , the university senate voted 181 to one to remove the statue permanently from the campus , after vice-chancellor max price acknowledged ' the many injustices of colonial conquest enacted under cecil rhodes ' watch '
while the university council still has to endorse the move at a special meeting on april 8 , the statue will be boarded up until it is handed over to government heritage authorities , university spokeswoman pat lucas said
' cecil rhodes ( pictured ) made his fortune with his de beers mining company cecil rhodes was born in bishop 's stortford in hertfordshire and went on to became one of britain 's most successful colonialists
cecil rhodes , famous for dreaming of a eastern cape - to - cairo railway , made his fortune with his de beers mining company during the kimberley diamond rush , and went on to grow his wealth during the ensuing gold rush around modern - day johannesburg
but the disappearance of cecil rhodes is unlikely to end the debate on racial transformation launched by the protest , which gave rise to similar demands for change at two other universities
students have dismissed the argument that cecil rhodes should be honoured for donating land for the campus , saying he stole it from black africans in the first place
a ' poo protest ' was launched by a group of students sparking a series of demonstrations demanding that the statue ( pictured ) be torn down mckaiser , an author and commentator who attended rhodes university and won a prestigious international rhodes scholar to oxford , said in the times : ' south africa universities remain a testament to the country 's colonial heritage in terms of what they teach , who does the teaching , and the morally odious symbols that haunt our campuses or lurk in their very names
many of the students involved in the protests never lived under the injustices of white minority rule , but say they still experience racial discrimination 21 years after the end of apartheid students have dismissed the argument that cecil rhodes should be honoured for donating land for the campus , saying he stole it from black africans in the first place ' mandela told us to expect controversy and embrace it , while remaining certain in the knowledge that what we were actually doing was what mattered , ' johnson wrote
