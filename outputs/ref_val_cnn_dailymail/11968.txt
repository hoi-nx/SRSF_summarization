louise thomas , 43 , from cheam , was convinced she was suffering panic attacks panic attacks are extremely common , with one in ten of us thought to suffer from them at least occasionally
louise thomas - and her doctors - were convinced she was one of the millions affected
a panic attack typically causes a faster heartbeat , dizziness , nausea and an overwhelming sense of anxiety
mother - of - two louise thomas had experienced such episodes regularly for seven years
' in my early 30s , i started having episodes of feeling very nervous and anxious , with butterflies in my stomach and a feeling of being on edge , ' says the 43 - year - old
' she was prescribed antidepressants and tried talking therapies , but nothing helped
that 's because louise thomas , from cheam , surrey , was n't suffering from panic attacks at all , but epileptic seizures
as salkovskis , professor of clinical psychology at the university of bath , explains , the symptoms of a panic attack can overlap with an epileptic seizure
' it 's not unusual for people with panic attacks to get an incorrect preliminary diagnosis of epilepsy , and occasionally , people with epilepsy get a misdiagnosis of panic attacks
unfortunately , louise thomas did n't see a specialist for years
so how can the conditions be confused ? epilepsy , which affects more than 600,000 people in the uk , is characterised by recurrent seizures or sudden bursts of intense , abnormal electrical activity in the brain that disrupt the way it works
dr cock , consultant neurologist at st george 's hospital , london , and the university of london , says : ' the bit of the brain where the seizure starts and the path where the electrical discharge then spreads can vary enormously between individuals - which is why there are so many different ways people can experience an epileptic seizure
' one such example is with gelastic seizures - where patients may burst out laughing for no apparent reason , because the part of the brain involved in the seizure is also involved in laughter
' louise thomas struggled to understand what was happening for seven years after her first episode but a further complication is that seizures may cause someone to panic , adds professor salkovskis
and in panic attacks , people hyperventilate , which can trigger an epileptic attack in people who are vulnerable to it
after her first episode , louise thomas looked up her symptoms online , which suggested she 'd had a panic attack
' the next seven years were fraught as louise thomas struggled to understand what was happening
' i went back and forth to the doctor 's - i must have seen ten gps in total - but , each time , i was told it sounded like panic attacks or depression
i was given antidepressants and , one time , a valium - type drug to calm me down
' but the drugs did n't work , and louise thomas would stop taking them after a few months
vincent took louise thomas to the gp and explained the attacks from his perspective - and her episodes were finally diagnosed corretly ' i was just told to take them again
' meanwhile , her ' panic attacks ' were getting worse : she was having five a day and experiencing urinary incontinence when they occurred
' in 2011 , seven years after the panic attacks began , vincent took louise thomas to the gp and explained the attacks from his perspective
' the specialist diagnosed louise thomas with temporal lobe epilepsy , a common type affecting the part of the brain concerned with emotion and hearing , as well as language and memory
dr cock says : ' in temporal lobe seizures , common warning signs are feelings of intense anxiety , fear and panic , so these are ones more likely to be misdiagnosed as panic attacks
' people with epilepsy may also have involuntary facial or hand movements , as louise thomas did , which indicate the electrical discharge has spread to an area of the brain involved in movement
' whether stress itself causes seizures is controversial , but it 's likely that , in some individuals , it may be a trigger - perhaps because stress leads to other triggers , such as alcohol and sleep deprivation
' louise thomas was relieved to finally find out what was wrong with her - but the diagnosis was frightening
' the thought of all the seizures i 'd had in public - on buses , at school meetings - was humiliating
' it took several months for louise thomas 's psychological and neurological symptoms to become untangled
even after being diagnosed with epilepsy , one neurologist thought she was experiencing non-epileptic seizures as well - seizures that are believed to have a psychological basis and are not caused by disrupted electrical brain activity
after her diagnosis , louise thomas was given antidepressants - which can sometimes help with non-epileptic seizures - along with anti-epileptic medication , which works by changing levels of chemicals in the brain that conduct electrical impulses
' it was a huge relief , ' says louise thomas
