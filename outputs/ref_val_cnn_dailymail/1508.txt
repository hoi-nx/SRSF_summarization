it has been talked about and hyped - up for more than a year , but a basic evolutionary instinct could end up putting people off buying the new apple iwatch
for once it is nothing to do with the price of the wearable technology , but the basic layout of the screen can apparently trigger a sense of ' fear ' in those who are susceptible
the hexagonal appearance of the iwatch 's apps on its small screen can cause trypophobia which is a fear of holes
usually , the fear is caused by shapes created by nature such as the holes in a beehive or the seeds in a pod , but if arranged in the right order , man - made objects such as the iwatch can also elicit a similar response
' the apple watch is a cluster of circles no no no no ' , wrote one , whilst another showed a similar reaction : ' anyone else getting a weird trypophobic reaction to the apple watch ? i 'm sorry i ever learned about that phobia existing ! ' side by side : twitter is now full of comparisons between the iwatch and occurrences in nature of weird : many people do not realize they have the phobia until they see an object that triggers the reaction new found fear ? trypophobia is not recognized as a condition in the american psychiatric association 's diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders or other scientific literature apple unveiled the much - anticipated apple watch on monday
the basic watch sells for $ 349 , but other models sell for $ 10,000 and higher
the study suggested the widespread , predominantly latent phobia is associated with ancient threats such as beehives , poisonous flowers and venomous creatures
