but today , as zayn is signed off the one direction tour due to ' stress ' , many are beginning to question whether fame is beginning to take its toll on the singer
in them , the singer is seen holding hands with a pretty blonde girl named lauren richardson , despite the fact that he is engaged to little mix singer perrie
clearly distressed by the release of the images , zayn tweeted : ' i 'm 22 years old ... i love a girl named perrie
a spokesman for the band revealed zayn 's decision to take some time out saying : ' zayn has signed off with stress and is flying back to the uk to recuperate
' this photograph of zayn caused outrage as he is currently engaged to little mix singer perrie in this , it appears zayn is holding hands with lauren richardson
but even from the early stages of his career , zayn , who is known as the shyest member of the group , struggled with his fame - in particular , after he and his fellow bandmates harry styles , louis tomlinson , liam payne and naill horan were catapulted onto a worldwide platform
in august of that year , zayn caused concerns among the ' directioners ' when he briefly quit twitter
zayn and perrie , pictured here at disneyland have been dating since 2011 , however , he has been accused of cheating on the little mix singer on more than one occasion it was around this time that zayn had been accused of cheating on perrie for the first time
zayn and perrie 's relationship had been rocked , and the singer 's personal affairs were been bought into the limelight , but it was only set to get worse
in february 2013 , zayn was accused of cheating on his fiance with an exotic dancer , australian courtney
in pictures - which were featured in the sun newspaper - the scruffy - haired singer was seen lying on a bed sleeping after allegedly having sex with the 23 - year - old
according to courtney , the pair met whilst out clubbing in london before the one direction star took her back to his Â£ 2.2million north london home
courtney said of the tryst : ' he 's an absolute s * * t. how dare he - not only to me but to perrie ? ' she added : ' i definitely do n't think it 's the first time he 's done this
i feel sorry for perrie - she does n't know this is going on
' zayn is on fifth of one direction with bandmates l - r louis tomlinson , liam payne , harry styles and naill horan zayn has been dating perrie since 2011 with the pair becoming engaged in august 2013
the little mix singer is yet to comment on the recent stories but was spotted last night leaving the house she shares with zayn , her engagement ring still on her finger
and as rumours of drug use flew around the internet , america today show host matt lauer asked the rest of his bandmates : ' there have been rumours of substance abuse , what 's going on ? ' zayn told the sun that he had been hurt by the accusations saying : ' i 'm really angry and upset by what was said
' and zayn has previously hinted that he would have never pursued a career in music it were it not for his bandmates
' in a video obtained by the mailonline last year zayn was filmed smoking what looked like a ' joint ' in the back of a car with his bandmate louis tomlinson of course , if zayn was to leave the band , he would n't be the first person to quit when it all got too much
' although there is no evidence to suggest that zayn has a drug problem , he has previously been accused of substance abuse - something which he has denied
and last year , in a video obtained exclusively by the mailonline , zayn was filmed smoking what appears to be a joint made of marijuana
zayn singing on stage with one direction , it is hoped that he will re-join the boys on tour next week at one point they spot a police officer riding a bike alongside their car , louis is then heard saying : ' one nil b * * * h ! look at this b * * * h ! he 's having a look
' louis also said : ' zayn takes his job very seriously
' one very very important factor of zayn 's warm up of course is mary j herself
then , after a half - hearted attempt to film ' a bit of the culture ' with footage of the street beyond the suv , louis pans back to zayn allowing the focus to drop to the smoking ' joint ' in his hand and asks : ' how 's that kind of culture ? ' zayn replies : ' it 's great
zayn and his one direction bandmates found fame on the x factor in 2010 and have since gone on to have huge global success the boys have grown up a lot in the five years since their career first kicked off on the first occasion that chicken is mentioned one of the band 's support team can be heard saying ' we got a full chicken ' just as the crew member seated in the front passenger seat passes something back and across to his colleague seated in front of louis in the six - seater suv
zayn is yet to make any further comment on his departure from the tour although it is hoped he will rejoin the band when they head to south africa next week
