throughout the 1970s and 1980s in europe , and even beyond , far - left and far - right extremists , the ira , radical palestinian , and a variety of other groups carried out thousands of terror attacks , big and small , that left thousands dead or injured
jews , israel -- and united states -- sites were targets of some of the most notorious attacks : from the massacre of israel athletes at the 1972 munich olympics , to plane and cruise ship hijackings , to attacks on airports , synagogues , and simply places where jews congregated , such as the jo goldenberg kosher deli in paris , where six died and 22 were wounded in a bloody attack in august 1982
in rome , where i lived for parts of the 1970s and ' 80s , we tended to avoid certain streets where el al and united states airlines had their offices
i do n't want to discount the gravity and horror of recent terror attacks against jews targets in europe , such as in copenhagen and paris
post-cold war power vacuums and middle east upheavals have given rise to radical islamist and globalized jihadist terror networks whose message , fanned out via the internet and social media , strikes a chord in disaffected youth
to be sure , jews are being targeted
but it is important to recognize that jews are being targeted as part of a violent campaign against western democracies and western values in general
today 's victims of islamist terror include christians and muslims as well as jews
in some ways , today 's jihadist terrorists can be seen as harnessing various types of terrorism we saw in earlier decades : the anti-jewish / anti-israel terrorism of radical palestinian groups and the anti-establishment , even anarchistic terrorism of homegrown groups whose aim was to sow fear and destabilize society as a means to bring down the system
in 1967 - 68 , after israel defeated arab states in the six-day war , poland 's communist regime staged an " anti-zionist " campaign that forced most of the remaining jews out of the country
at least 13,000 jews emigrated , according to dariusz stola , who is now the director of the museum of the history of polish jews
sound familiar ? after the holocaust , it was common to view jews in europe as sitting with their suitcases packed , just in case
but -- unlike poland 's " anti-zionist " campaign -- terrorism did not prove an existential threat to jews and did not prompt a mass exodus
following the most recent terror attacks , jews and european national leaders have made clear that this is not an option
