jerusalem either netanyahu just staged the most dramatic political comeback in israeli history and beyond , or something was very wrong with the polls before and during the election
polls predicted a tight race coming down to the wire , with netanyahu in a virtual tie with his main challenger , isaac herzog of the zionist union party
only four days before the election , polls showed isaac herzog taking a four - seat lead into the final weekend before the election
exit polls on the night of the election showed netanyahu had closed the gap
the polls suggested he was in a dead heat , with a very even split between right - wing and left - wing parties
not more polls or surveys , but actual counts from the ballot boxes
netanyahu was n't in a fight for his political life after all
he was the clear winner , running away with the election and facing a fairly clear path to create a coalition government
although the results are unofficial , it seems almost certain that netanyahu will remain the israeli prime minister
degani , a pollster , professor at tel aviv university and president of the geocartography knowledge group , saw very different results from his own polls
" but tzemach , the polling expert for cnn affiliate channel 2 israel , suggests netanyahu was in a tight race the entire way and managed to close the gap " like a magician , " using the election polls as his final trick
" likud voters did not participate in exit polls , according to tzemach , and that skewed the results , leading many to believe that isaac herzog had tied netanyahu
" another factor that may have worked in netanyahu 's favor was his likud party cannibalizing votes from other right - wing parties
in the days before the election , netanyahu moved to the political right , making a big push for right - wing voters to choose his party over other ideologically similar parties , such as naftali bennett 's jewish home and avigdor lieberman 's yisrael beiteinu party
during the weekend before the election , netanyahu took part in a right - wing rally in tel aviv 's central rabin square
" in 2009 , in a speech known as the bar ilan speech , netanyahu committed to negotiations for a two - state solution , saying , " let us begin peace negotiations immediately without prior conditions
in the most recent elections in 2013 , exit polls showed lapid 's centrist yesh atid party winning between 12 and 13 seats in the knesset
this time , the unexpected surprise worked in netanyahu 's favor , turning the campaign race into an election night rout
in the 1996 elections , early results showed the labor party 's shimon peres as the winner , but as more results came in , netanyahu eked out a victory by fewer than 1 % of the votes
