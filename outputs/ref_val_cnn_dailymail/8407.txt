hopkins has been reported to police by labour mp danczuk over claims she incited racial hatred in tweets linking pakistani men to the rochdale child sex abuse scandal outspoken former reality tv star hopkins has accused the labour mp danczuk of reporting her to the police to deflect attention from being ' caught watching porn '
mr danczuk said he had received death threats after asking manchester police commissioner tony lloyd to investigate whether ms hopkins had incited racial hatred in a series of tweets linking pakistani men to the rochdale child sex abuse scandal
ms hopkins sent the tweets after mr danczuk attended the raising of a pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark pakistani 's national day
ms hopkins posted a series of messages to her account after the mp tweeted a picture of himself at the event
in response the controversial columnist sent a picture of eight men convicted of child exploitation offences , asking mr danczuk if they were his friends too
he told lbc radio tonight that he had seen the police today and will do so again tomorrow and revealed he had received death threats as a result
ms hopkins sounded unconcerned and said she laughed when she heard mr danczuk had reported her to the police
she added that mr danczuk is ' wasting police time '
the businesswoman said mr danczuk was just covering up the fact that he had been ' caught watching porn ' and because he has a wafer thin majority and ' needs the pakistani vote '
' mr danczuk tonight dismissed ms hopkins ' claim that he had only reported her to cover up his embarrassment
but ms hopkins said she stood by her comments saying : ' for me , in somewhere like rochdale , you ca n't raise a pakistani flag and talk about community cohesion in the same sentence
' ' if we look at why someone did n't call the police earlier when our white girls were being attacked by these gentlemen , if someone had called the police earlier then that would have been a good thing would n't it ? ' hopkins is said to have started sending the tweets after mr danczuk attended the raising of a pakistani flag over the town hall for half an hour on march 23 to mark pakistani 's national day mr danczuk said rochdale has faced up to the ' heinous crime ' of child grooming ' in a way that 's managed to keep our communities together '
' to equate the pakistani flag with child abuse , as she has done on social media over the last week , is absurd and it creates a dangerous environment where extreme intolerance becomes acceptable
' raising a pakistani flag in rochdale is not helping community cohesion , ' she added in another
âª @ simondanczuk you & your party disgust me ' she wrote : ' are these your friends too âª @ simondanczuk ? is this why you are raising the pakistani flag in rochdale ? 77 years inside ' the controversial tv pundit faced calls for her arrest after saying the labour leader could ' gas ' his wife justine in a message on friday
