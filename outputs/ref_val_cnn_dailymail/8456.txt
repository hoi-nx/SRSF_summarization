but now , for the first time , conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept
the feat gives hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories , which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds
for the first time , conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while the sleep
experts have found that when this replay process is disrupted in rodents , so too is their ability to remember what they learned â for example , a new area that they explored â the previous day , new scientist reported
scientists from the industrial physics and chemistry higher educational institution in paris , france , used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice , while they slept
the team , led by benchenane , focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about , or being in , a specific place â and help animals and humans form internal maps
scientists used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice , while they slept - and say it could one day be used in humans while they sleep ( stock image ) in the same way that humans sometimes remember things that did nât actually occur , researchers have found that bees also misremember
this incorrect merging of long - term memories in bumblebees is similar to some types of misremembering information that have previously only been observed in humans
while the mice slept , they monitored the creature âs brain activity and when the specific place cell fired , an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward
when the mice woke up , they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling , showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists
while this is the first time a conscious memory has been implanted during sleep , experts have already managed to create subconscious associations in the minds of sleeping people â so that smokers associate cigarettes with the smell of rotten eggs , for example
experts think that if subconscious learning has been forced on the mice while they slept , they would have explored the area in a more random way , instead of heading straight to the place they associated with reward
