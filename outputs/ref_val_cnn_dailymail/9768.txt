neil jenkins says that wales will be concentrated totally on winning - rather than potential mathematical permutations - when they tackle six nations opponents italy at the stadio olimpico on saturday
wales , courtesy of successive victories over scotland , france and ireland , have put themselves firmly in the six nations title mix alongside england and ireland
although wales ' inferior points difference means they have a mountain to climb in pursuit of silverware , a possible third six nations crown in four years can not be discounted

if other things happen , well , so be it , ' said wales skills coach neil jenkins , speaking at the team 's rome hotel on friday
' i am sure that we will be kicking ourselves if we did n't win and the other games went scotland 's way and france 's way
' england will know what they have to do when they play last on saturday , but no matter what time you play , the focus is still the same for us
' italy 's preparations have been rocked by the absence of their inspirational captain sergio through injury , which has meant the italy back - row being reshuffled and hooker leonardo ghiraldini taking over as skipper
' sergio is obviously a fantastic rugby player , a world - class number eight , and no matter what side he plays in , if he is not playing they are obviously going to miss him , ' neil jenkins added
' it was nip and tuck with ireland early on in that first game , and italy probably just lacked a bit of possession
' key for wales will be to set out their stall and build points , like they did in destroying ireland 's grand slam dream last saturday
' wales performed a title - winning feat in 2013 after losing their opening game - then it was against ireland , this time england - by reeling off four successive victories and taking the championship on points difference
' if you look at the six nations , the unpredictability is what 's great about the tournament , ' wales full - back leigh halfpenny said
' every game is competitive , and that is why it 's a huge achievement to win the six nations
