it has been a bittersweet week for kristin
for last week was also the anniversary of the death of her father , taken from her in a dramatic fighter plane accident almost half a century ago on march 17 , 1966
dame kristin , 54 â nominated for an oscar for her mesmerising role in the english patient â has said little about the loss in public , but recalled that â mummy was pregnant at the time and i can remember when she told us
the exact details of his crash , however , have remained shrouded in secrecy â like so much else associated with the cold war â until now , thanks to the release of a recently declassified air investigation report
heartbreaking : dame kristin was only five when her father was killed in a dramatic fighter plane accident it reveals that lieutenant commander simon thomas was flying a sea vixen jet when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the dorset coast
they were designed for aircraft carriers for night - time flying and one of their tasks would be to attack soviet ships in the event of a war
they were tasked with taking off from air base hms heron , in yeovilton , somerset , and attacking a target being pulled by a frigate , hms zulu , off portland in dorset
horrific : lieutenant commander simon thomas was killed during a dangerous night - time training mission with classic military understatement the report states that they faced â unpleasant conditions â , which included poor visibility , fog patches and a pitch black night
furthermore , it was believed to have been simon thomas âs first attempt at firing glow worm flares since he had returned to frontline duties after working as a vixen flying instructor
as the leader , simon thomas was expected to fire off the flares above the frigate so that they would illuminate the target in silhouette
the three others took off and assumed the attack formation , with simon thomas in the lead , to a point 20 miles south of hms zulu
but then vixen no 2 lost his radar and , after trying to maintain his position , was instructed by simon thomas to return to base
on their first run , simon thomas failed to fire the flares
the report adds that the crew of no 2 heard simon thomas call â turning in â in preparation for his attack and â some five to ten seconds [ later ] the pilot noticed a flash â
simon thomas was killed instantly and his co-pilot , lieutenant john harvey , was listed as missing
dame kristin , born in cornwall in 1960 , later said that after the news of her father âs death â we went down to school and everybody had to be nice to us and we did nât really understand why
kristin âs widowed mother went on to marry another fleet air arm pilot , simon idiens , who died in another air accident in 1972
lieutenant commander simon thomas was flying a sea vixen jet ( pictured ) when it exploded after crashing into the sea off the dorset coast author tony buttler , in his book about the sea vixen , branded the glow worm manoeuvre , for which lieut cmdr thomas was practising , â perhaps the most stupid , and potentially suicidal attack ever invented
all of this was happening while the jet was maintaining a steep bank climb and the pilot was subjected to considerable g - forces
â i can see simon thomas now
there was no better - looking couple and while i can see deborah in kristin , kristin also looks just like her father
simon thomas and deborah had star quality
