in a major report on the impact of global warming on food , scientists have concluded that the quality of many meats and vegetables is due to decline at temperatures increase
the researchers predict that as heatwaves become more common , steaks and other meats are likely to become stringier and tougher - putting the traditional barbecue at risk
beefburgers , like those above , could become far less appetising option on future bbq 's due to climate change popular vegetables like carrots are also likely to become less flavoursome and have a less pleasant texture
onions could get smaller if temperatures early in the season increase while fruit and nut trees in some regions may not get cold enough to signal fruit development
the report , produced by scientists at the univeristy of melbourne , also warned that milk yeilds could decrease by up to 10 - 25 per cent as heatwaves grow more common
lower levels of grain production could also hit dairy cattle , meaning their milk contains less protein , which would result in poorer quality cheese
professor richard eckard , director of the pirmary industries climate challenges centre at the university of melbourne , said : ' it âs definitely a wake up call when you hear that the toast and raspberry jam you have for breakfast , for example , might not be as readily available in 50 years time
avocados will grow less plump and trees will carry less of the fruit as temperatures increase , the report warns the cost of apples could rise as farmers try to combat damage from extreme temperatures on fruits like apples by using shade cloths
heat stress will have a particular impact on meat production with cattle and chickens suffering in higher temperatures and affecting their appetite
dairy cows produce 10 - 25 per cent less milk in heat waves and their amount of protein in milk can also decline temperatures above 27 degrees can cause beetroot flowering stems to grow early and result in smaller bulbs , while the vegetable can also lose some of its distinctive red colouring in warmer temperatures
professor david karoly , an atmospheric scientists at the university of melbourne and one of the co-authors of the report , said countries like australian , where drought is already a major problem , are likely to be worse hit
