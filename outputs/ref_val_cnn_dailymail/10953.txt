it is known as one of the happiest countries in the world , but vietnam 's population is somewhat shy about smiling for the camera
as french photographer , rã©hahn , was travelling through the south east asian country , he observed that many people conceal their smile with their hand , as a mark of modesty or politeness
he decided that the shy gesture would make an interesting subject for to focus on and travelled through the country snapping portrait photos for a series he called hidden smiles
he has been travelling round on a motorbike there since 2001 he noticed that a lot of people cover their mouths when they smile , either out of shyness , or elegance , if there was a lack of teeth he noticed the effect the smile has on the whole face , when the mouth is concealed from view
his portraits focus on the eyes and lines of the face caused by the happy emotion since giving up his hectic life in french , the photographer has spent three years in hoi an , vietnam , ranked the happiest country in the world , and says he has discovered their true meaning of happiness through his pictures
born in 1979 in normandy , the photographer has enjoyed life travelling around vietnam on his motorbike and has so far taken over 40,000 pictures
for rã©hahn , a smile is more than mere muscle twitching and his hidden smiles project aims to celebrate the corners of the face etched by a lifetime of happy emotion
looking past old age , or the wearing of poverty , the photographs reveal an energy and life behind the eyes of the individuals , through their concealed smiles
' every month i am travelling in vietnam by motorbike , to record the vanishing culture of ethnic minorities , ' he said
it 's feng shui : only good energy ! ' he said of the many photographs he has taken , 145 have made it to his first photo - book ' vietnam â mosaic , ' which aims to show vietnam in a natural and spontaneous light rehahn states he has only travelled to a quarter of the country , despite living there since 2011 and travelling there for seven years the 35 - year - old has been featured in numerous newspapers and magazines , and has gained over 182,000 fans in one year on his facebook page ' i think a good photograph is when you can capture the soul , read a story in the eyes
capture emotion is not an easy thing , time is the key ! spending time with people always gave me better photos ! ' renahn said when asked why many subjects cover their mouths rehahn said young girls do it out of embarrassment , and old women tend to do it out of elegance to cover their lack of teeth ' i can speak a little bit vietnam and i always sit with them and try to interact
i think the best is when people feel relaxed ' rehahn said rehahn ( left ) has lived in hoi an since 2011 and launched his book , vietnam - mosaic of contrasts ( right ) , in january of last year
