well , they want continuity and stability at sunderland
it was perhaps fitting , then , that dick advocaat marked his first game in charge with a defeat , a fourth in six matches to leave the sunderland perilously perched one point above the drop zone
not even the re-introduction of top goalscorer adam johnson â on as a second - half substitute after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an under - age girl â could inspire a side who have won just once in 2015

let âs hope he is also immune to criticism , for without wins the honeymoon period will expire far quicker than his nine - game contract
dick advocaat , though , might have celebrated victory on his premier league bow had former defoe not spurned a first - half sitter
it would have made for painful viewing for defoe and dick advocaat , especially as there was a strong suspicion of a foul on larsson seconds before diafra sakho hammered his 12th of the season to lift sam allardyce âs side to ninth
