when louis van gaal has time between figuring out the angel di maria conundrum and plotting man united âs champions league return , hasselbaink would love a coffee
hasselbaink is keen to pick the brains of his former coach , in his words one of the world âs greatest , to help league two burton albion âs promotion push
the former dutch international is doing pretty well so far by himself in his first managerial job in england , leading burton to top spot since surprisingly taking over in november
hasselbaink has impressed since taking over at burton albion ; they are top of league two hasselbaink scores for chelsea , against tottenham , during his playing days in april 2004 sportsmail 's graphic shows hasselbaink 's long and illustrious career across a number of countries but getting advice from the man united manager with whom he shares a bond can only help
â i was always one of his favourites , â smiles hasselbaink , who won most of his 23 holland caps under van gaal
â he wanted to sign me for barcelona from chelsea in 2003
â does hasselbaink recognise the prickly van gaal we have seen during low ebbs this season ? his face lights up
but he is a very loving man and a top coach , one of the best in the world
louis van gaal and hasselbaink get on well , and the burton boss would like some advice from his countryman hasselbaink and van gaal ( centre ) know each other from when the now man united boss was in charge of holland hasselbaink is doing well on his own , but admits he would like to sit down for a chat with the man united boss â of course he has come in for criticism because he is manager of one of the biggest clubs in the world , but let âs not forget , man united is changing
â hasselbaink would hope players under his guidance one day say similar things about him
his first fortnight at burton brought challenges even the most experienced manager might have found daunting
â he is a guy who everybody really likes so that was a big blow , â says hasselbaink
â then , just days after his first match in charge , at wycombe , there was an emotionally crushing event â the funeral of lydia , a 17 - year - old who played for burton âs women âs team
hasselbaink thinks van gaal is one of the best coaches in the world , and insists he was one of his favourites hasselbaink had an esteemed playing career , pictured celebrating a goal for chelsea in 2001 hasselbaink admits that as a player he was more loud - and sweary - than he is as a manager â that was devastating , â says hasselbaink , his eyes dewy
â to hear hasselbaink talk with such sensitivity only underlines why chairman robinson selected him ahead of 60 other applicants when predecessor gary rowett left for birmingham
hasselbaink âs motivation to plunge into the lower divisions was not obvious
this is a man who scored so many premier league goals for leeds united , chelsea , middlesbrough and charlton ( 127 ) he still sits 11th on the all - time list , despite retiring seven years ago
the burton boss sat down with sportsmail 's laurie whitwell at the club 's stadium after a training session hasselbaink 's yearly earnings are believed to be around Â£ 40,000 - minimal compared to his playing days money is not the driving factor
when it is suggested he earns in a year what he once earned per week at chelsea he grins
â still , why burton ? hasselbaink answers emphatically
the burton boss could easily pick up more than he currently earns , but he wants to cut his teeth at lower level scott parker ( left ) and eidur gudjohnsen ( right ) watch on as hasselbaink celebrates a goal at white hart lane â i did nât look at league two , league one , championship or whatever
can i have a hasselbaink feeling there ? what âs the identity of the club ? does it fit with me ? do i fit with them ? â we are sitting in an executive suite at burton âs pirelli stadium , a neat ground with 7,000 capacity , opened a decade ago
hasselbaink finds inspiration in swansea âs incredible rise through the ranks ; bottom of the football league to established premier league force in 10 years
â swansea have the perfect model
â swansea have kept their way of playing
hasselbaink has impressed since taking over at burton in november , and looks to be closing in on promotion the burton boss wants to follow the model of swansea , who rose from the lower leagues to the very top â we are still far , far away from swansea
â hasselbaink âs belief in a passing style has seen burton win 14 , draw five and lose three of his matches to date
they can go five points clear at the top if they beat stevenage at home on monday night
â i find that there are some really technical players in league two
â steve mclaren is another manager hasselbaink speaks to in order to get advice on coaching mclaren signed hasselbaink for middlesbrough during the burton manager 's playing days in the mid 2000 's mcclaren lives fairly close and â at times we go for lunch or a quick supper â , says hasselbaink
mcclaren had one response when hasselbaink asked him about the burton offer : â take it
â hasselbaink says : â he âs a very good manager
â ronald koeman is another hasselbaink has phoned
hasselbaink , studying for his uefa pro licence , is one of only five black managers in the football league , but rejects the proposal of a rooney rule that would ensure at least one candidate for each vacancy is from a minority ethnic background
â it would appear burton , with sights on breaking into the third tier for the first time in their history , need hasselbaink .
