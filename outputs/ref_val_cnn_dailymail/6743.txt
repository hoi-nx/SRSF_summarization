more than 100 nhs hospitals in britain contain fast food outlets , shocking new figures have revealed
critics argue the presence of burger king , costa and greggs around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis
there are 128 outlets in britain hospitals selling junk food , plus a further 32 branches of whsmith , which sells confectionery - often at a discounted price
addenbrooke 's in cambridge operates a food court with a burger king ( pictured ) there are also dozens of coffee shops - with 27 starbucks and 92 costas ( such as this one at the royal surrey county hospital in guildford ) - selling calorie - laden treats the fast food branches include two burger kings , six subways and one greggs , an investigation by sun revealed
this is in addition to all the smaller , independent retailers in hospitals selling junk food
the news comes as figures from public health england show that in britain , 64 per cent of adults are either overweight or obese
and experts estimate treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the nhs around Â£ 6 billion every year - or five per cent of the entire nhs budget
to make matters worse , some of the compass uk 's major hospitals have more than one outlet selling junk food
earlier this month , it emerged the greggs bakery at the new cross hospital in wolverhampton , is the fast - food chain 's second busiest outlet in britain earlier this month it was reported that the greggs bakery based in an nhs hospital is the fast - food chain 's second busiest outlet in britain
' critics argue the presence of burger king ( pictured in addenbrooke 's hospital ) , costa and greggs around sick patients goes as far as being negligent - and is simply adding to the soaring obesity crisis but loughton , chief executive of royal wolverhampton hospitals , said he had heard on good authority that the bakery at the hospital was the chain 's second busiest
' earlier this week , mps called for a ban on fast - food outlets such as mcdonald âs and burger king from hospitals
as fast - food concessions come up for renewal , hospitals should demand healthier , tastier , affordable alternatives , experts say the report on the impact of physical activity and diet on health endorses the views of professor theresa marteau , an expert in public health at cambridge university
in her evidence to mps , she said : ' it is at best anomalous - and at worst negligent - that nhs properties continue to serve foods high in sugar , fat and salt , as exemplified by mcdonald âs and burger king outlets in some of our most prestigious hospitals , including guy âs hospital in london and addenbrooke âs hospital in cambridge
' simon stevens , the chief executive of nhs england , backed the mps â call and criticised hospitals for permitting the sale of fast food
he said : ' the nhs is being pennywise but pound - foolish selling junk food that ultimately just lands more people in hospital with expensive , preventable , obesity - driven illnesses
' so as these fast - food concessions come up for renewal , hospitals should demand healthier , tastier , affordable alternatives
the hospital trust has joined forces with wolverhampton council to tackle the obesity crisis locally
staff were instructed to tell patients they could not order from the fast food restaurant , with bosses steering them towards ' healthier ' sandwiches in the hospital 's smoothie bar instead
croydon university hospital had hosted the fast food chain in its entrance for 14 years , sparking the ire of health campaigners
but in order to terminate the contract it had to pay Â£ 24,000 to compass uk , the company operating the fast food franchise
dr sally norton , an nhs consultant specialising in weight loss surgery , says the nhs is contributing to the obesity crisis coffee shops offering sugar - laden drinks and cakes to hospital patients , visitors and nhs staff should be banned , a leading weight loss surgeon has said
in the place of these popular coffee shops and fast food outlets , dr norton - who works at bristol royal infirmary and southmead hospital - has called for restaurants and cafes championing local food producers and offering healthy and tasty snacks
