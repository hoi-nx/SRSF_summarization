there have been all manner of cricket world cup shambles for england since they should have won the 1992 final here in australia

when the dust settles and england have gone through the motions of their last group match against afghanistan they must have a searching examination of how they play one - day cricket and how they can possibly catch up with the rest of the world before they host the next cricket world cup in four years time
senior players such as ian bell , stuart broad and jimmy anderson have not provided the proper example needed from senior players in a young team and should retire from one - day cricket to allow a new young vibrant team to be built
and the decision to replace cook with morgan as one - day captain on the brink of this tournament has backfired , the new leader falling for his fifth duck in his last nine innings just when his team needed him most
morgan has been given permission to miss england âs first one - day international after this cricket world cup , against an ireland team having a far better tournament than england , so he can play in the indian premier league
that decision frankly stinks and if morgan does not want to lead england into a new one - day era then he should give up the job now and let joe root , who was seriously considered when cook was sacked , lead them from now on
and never mind that tv umpire simon fry gave an atrocious decision to rule that jordan had been run out when surely there was doubt over whether his bat had bounced up once he had made his ground
england 's ian bell walks from the field after he was dismissed by bangladesh bowler rubel hossain ( second from left ) during their match ian bell 's 63 could do little to help england as they were chasing 276 to avoid an embarrassing early elimination in adelaide rubel hossain ( left ) looks towards england batsman ian bell after he is dismissed for 63 during the cricket world cup match england batsman alex hales came in but was caught behind by bangladesh wicketkeeper rahim as bowler mortaza ( right ) reacts england captain morgan went for a duck against bangladesh on monday - his fifth odi duck in 12 innings joe root ( centre ) exchanges words with bangladesh captain mortaza ( left ) at the adelaide oval kevin pietersen tweeted his reaction to england 's embarrassing elimination at the cricket world cup after their defeat by bangladesh 90 - the amount of runs captain morgan scored in five innings at the cricket world cup 12.2 - the overs it took for new zealand to beat england 's total of 123 in their second group game
111 - australia 's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament 654 - total of runs scored by australia and sri lanka against england 1 - number of centuries scored by an england batsman against test playing nations 72 - number of runs scored by sri lanka off the bowling of chris woakes 0 - number of wins registered by england over test playing nations in the tournament 0 - the number of centuries scored by a bangladesh batsman in a cricket world cup before playing england on monday
yet england could not have expected the resistance and then blossoming strokeplay that came from a batsman who had never made a one - day international century before in mahmudullah
the drop - in pitch at the re-built adelaide oval may have been near perfect for batting but the lack of variety in an england attack that has struggled for penetration in this cricket world cup allowed bangladesh to flourish
it should have been well within england âs reach but their chase was old - fashioned and flawed with ian bell , involved in a schoolboy run out that saw the demise of moeen ali , leaving them far too much to do after he had taken 82 balls to reach 63
the dismissals of ian bell and morgan in four balls from rubel hossain , faster than any england bowler , left england deep in the mire and even though buttler , their main glimmer of hope for a better one - day future , hit 65 off 52 balls they ended up 16 short
the brilliant rubel hossain finished it by bowling both stuart broad and jimmy anderson in three balls in the penultimate over , leaving chris woakes stranded on 42 , to spark off wild bangladeshi celebrations
