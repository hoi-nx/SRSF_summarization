wednesday 's terrorist attack , which killed 23 people , hit tunisia where it hurt by targeting its flourishing tourism industry
the deadly attack on the prominent bardo museum near tunisia 's parliament in the country 's capital , tunis , is the latest instance of an armed assault carried out by gunmen willing to fight to the death , a tactic that has been widely adopted by jihadist terrorists in recent years , including in africa
in this week 's tunisia attack , the gunmen took hostages , two gunmen died in the assault , and three survived and are being hunted by the tunisia government
this seems a likely outcome of the attack , as tourism is vital to tunisia 's economy , providing 15 % of gdp
tunisia is also the only country where the arab spring produced a successful , lasting democratic transition , making it attractive to tourists who are avoiding going to countries like egypt , which did not weather the arab spring as well as tunisia
this is a sobering finding for tunisia , which had been largely immune from the kinds of terrorist attacks that have recently plagued libya and other africa countries
while the museum attack in tunisia and the hotel attack in libya may help terrorist groups to achieve their strategic goals , more often than not , armed assaults by terrorists against so - called soft targets such as hotels , supermarkets and malls do not achieve much beyond the tactical successes of global news coverage and causing mayhem
in september 2013 , al-shabaab , the somali al qaeda affiliate , killed 67 people in a fedayeen - style armed assault on the westgate in nairobi , kenyan
the plague of mumbai - style armed assaults by jihadist terrorists is not confined to africa
in january , mumbai - style tactics were used in paris when cherif and said kouachi and coulibaly conducted armed assaults on the satirical magazine charlie hebdo and a kosher supermarket over a three - day period
