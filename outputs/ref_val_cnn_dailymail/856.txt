a terrifying anonymous letter telling the founder of a not - for - profit to ' watch your back ' also included threats against the woman 's daughter , claiming they knew where she went to school

this anonymous letter was sent to palm oil investigations ( poi ) president lorina jane threatening her , and her daughter and claiming to know where they live ' it 's a really gutless thing to do ... the person who sent it has been that gutless they would n't put their name to it
' lorinda is the founder and president of the not - for - profit which provides information to consumers about products that contain palm oil coming from an anonymous source , the letter made claims that should their company feature ' unfavourably ' in the new app , ' we will be your worst enemy '
' we know you are soon to release a phone app about products with palm oil in , ' the letter began
' you have bragged online that your app will be a â game changer â , it well may be only not how you expect , ' the letter concluded , lorinda said in the years since the poi launched their facebook page - which has over 144,000 ' likes ' - they have never encouraged any consumers to boycott particular brands , but are about simply providing information
the threats came a day ahead of the release of the poi app , which aims to inform consumers about the palm oil content of the products they consume the first category is palm oil free , the second indicates the company has signed on to stop deforestation , the third is palm oil certified - which means they use ethically sourced oil , the fourth is for companies or products which used a mixed supply of certified and uncertified oil , and the final is a fail
a fail means the company have refused to provide details when approached by poi , or that they use uncertified palm oil
