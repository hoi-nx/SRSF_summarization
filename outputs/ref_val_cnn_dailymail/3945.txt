examining an ultrasound scan of your unborn child is a nerve - racking moment for most parents
the child was making an unmistakable v - sign â the victory gesture associated with winston churchill and , latterly , with world peace
the baby formed a v symbol with its tiny fingers while in mother dee parson 's womb during a scan â the sonographer could n't believe it â she said she had never seen anything like it before , â said mrs dee parsons , 35
â the couple , who live in godalming , surrey , and run an event production business , are thinking of calling the winston if it is a boy
â mrs dee parsons , who has a daughter , grace , six , from a previous marriage , said that in the 12 - week scan the child had given a clear thumbs - up
â expectant parents dee parsons and ed parsons said the image was ' very reassuring ' because the symbol is so ' happy '
