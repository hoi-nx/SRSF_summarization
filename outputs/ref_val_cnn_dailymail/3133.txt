this is the incredible moment a woodpecker was caught on camera giving a small weasel a lift on its back
the stunning photograph shows the tiny brown animal clinging to the back of the green woodpecker as it takes flight across hornchurch country park in east london
although all appears rather amicable in the incredible image , amateur photographer le-may said the small mammal had actually pounced on the bird as its next victim
it was captured by photographer le-may , who had been enjoying a walk through the park with his wife although all appears rather amicable in the incredible image , mr le-may said the small mammal had actually pounced on the woodpecker as his next victim
however , instead of falling prey , the bird decided to take flight with the animal on its back and soared through the sky mr le-may , a project manager from essex , managed to capture the action photo during a walk with his wife ann yesterday
the 52 - year - old , who enjoys photography as a hobby , told mailonline : ' we decided we fancied popping out yesterday afternoon and my wife has never seen a green woodpecker in the wild before and i knew of this place so we just went there for a walk
' out of the bushes flew a woodpecker so i said to my wife : " there 's a green woodpecker "
the small weasel could be seen clinging to the back of the woodpecker , with its arms wrapped around the bird 's body , as it took flight following a tumble in the grass of the london park , the green woodpecker managed to escape the small weasel who later ran off ' i decided to pick my camera up to have a look and just as i picked up the camera it flew off so i just started snapping at it as it came across in front of us
' it was at that point mr le-may said he noticed the small animal on the back of the bird and realised it was either a stoat or a weasel
mr le-may , 52 , ( pictured ) who enjoys photography as a hobby , said the response to the action photograph had been ' outstanding ' and ' absolutely mind - blowing ' ' we walked further up to where it had all happened and could n't see any sign of the weasel so i assume it had ran back off into the grass , hungry
' mr le-may , who has two grown - up daughters , said he only realised how remarkable his picture was when he downloaded it from his camera onto his computer
he said he had never taken a photograph quite like the one he captured of the woodpecker and said the response had been ' absolutely mind - blowing '
' for over a million people to see your work is quite mind - blowing and outstanding
' mr le-may used his canon 70d camera and his 300m f2.8l lens to take the picture and usually just takes photos of wild birds at rainham marshes bird reserve in essex
mr le-may 's image is much like the one taken by grandmother - of - four andree siwadi , 70 , who spotted a frog clinging to the back of a goldfish in her garden pond in winton , near bournemouth in dorset , in april last year
she took a photo of the incredible moment the amphibian hitched a ride from one side of the pond to the other ( pictured ) and said he had ' never seen anything like it before in her life ' from buzz lightyear to the ' weasel ' john terry : internet reacts to stunning action photo with series of hilarious memes the internet was awash with hilarious memes this afternoon following the emergence of martin le-may 's incredible photograph
