katie 's approach to weight loss is five parts stick , zero parts carrot overweight children are the latest target for serial ranter hopkins
the controversial columnist has said that fat children should be forced to attend special sports schools until they shed excess weight
writing in her column for now ! magazine , the 39 - year - old said : ' the most upsetting thing of all is a fat child
' watching fat parents drop their fat kids off at school in their cars makes me so angry my teeth itch and my nipples twizzle
' the mother - of - three adds in her video blog for the magazine that she blames the parents for children with weight problems : ' i 've always said that a fat child lives in the shadow of a fat parent
' the fat kids go through the school gates and there 's the fat mum in the car , who does n't bother to get out , still wearing her pyjamas ... and that really does my head in
' citing government statistics that say one - in - 10 four - year - olds are now overweight , the celebrity big brother star even goes as far to say that , if she had her way , fat children would be ' sent to special sports schools until they make the grade
' hopkins also opines that she thinks people in england are far too soft on ' fat shaming '
' there 's loads of fat kids and we do n't say anything because that would be fat - shaming , or bullying ... well , i disagree completely
' in england , we 're far too soft on it and we seem to think it 's okay that people are pureeing kfc to spoon - feed to their babies
' earlier this year , the opinionated former apprentice star filmed herself gaining and losing four stone in an effort to prove that obesity is purely the fault of the person carrying the weight
katie has form with insulting overweight people
on her television show making my fat , she was kicked out of an 800lb woman 's house after rows
now , she 's turned her venom to children , saying obese kids should go to ' special sports schools ' until they make the grade ' katie before her own weight gain ( left ) and after ( right ) in the programme , katie was frequently seen bursting into floods of tears over her new body shape , but also over the amount of food that she has to eat every day to put on the weight
she said : ' there are two kids in there who are around 15 or 16 years old and they must weigh between 200 pounds ( 14.2 stone ) and 300 pounds ( 21 stone ) each
' i feel really sorry for those children
' making my fat followed hopkins as she gained 4st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day , then lost the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise the end of the programme saw katie engage in extreme eating to try and put on the weight , gorging on 400 calories every couple of hours
hopkins strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the britain - she recently came second in a poll of the world 's most hated people
she told femail : ' fat people can be quite afraid of me , there is this sort of hopkins fear
last year she made headlines around the world after she revealed that she would n't hire a fat person because they are ' lazy '
so in the last six months , the 39 - year - old decided to put on 30 per cent of her body weight in just three months and then lose it just as quickly , to prove that larger people only have themselves to blame for piling on the pounds
the star has very little time for larger people , admitting than she can hardly bear to touch anyone carrying a little extra fat , but she has even less for their excuses
' nowadays , i hear a lot of women say 12st is nât that big - they say that because you can be 12 stone and a size 14
' the controversial figure claims that while she did n't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children , gaining 3st pushing her weight over 11st ' killed her ' and left her in constant floods but while katie thinks the plus - size models in debenhams shop windows are unacceptable , the super-skinny mannequins that recently caused an uproar in topshop are acceptable in her eyes
' in terms of sizing , mango starts their plus - size collection at a size 12 and i âve always said that size 12 is a size called fat
' because for me , it âs not necessarily that a size 12 is fat , it âs so that people can have a sense of what is normal
asked about a fat tax as a potential solution , making customers pay a heftier tax on junk food than healthy produce , katie scoffs and suggests a far more radical option
' she continued : ' obese people are bankrupting us - they cost us something like Â£ 17.4 billion last year
' that would make people own their problems better than some kind of fat tax
