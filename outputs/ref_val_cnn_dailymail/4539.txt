professor patrick pullicino , a leading neurologist who has criticised plans to ask every ill or elderly person if they want to die at home or in hospital a plan to draw up a â death list â of how every ill or elderly person wants to die has been criticised as a dangerous and worrying idea
the influential commons health select committee yesterday called for a new database listing whether people would prefer to die at home or in hospital
they said two - thirds want to spend their final days at home â but half still die in hospital
but professor patrick pullicino , a leading neurologist , said the plan simply perpetuates the â central flaw â of the discredited lcp
those who wished to die at home might be denied essential care , said professor patrick pullicino , a consultant neurologist with east kent universities nhs foundation trust
the lcp was abolished last july following several examples of â shocking â abuse , many of them unveiled by the daily mail
many families complained that their relatives were sedated with a â chemical cosh â then killed by the removal of food and fluids , leading care services minister norman lamb to denounce the lcp as a â national disgrace â
