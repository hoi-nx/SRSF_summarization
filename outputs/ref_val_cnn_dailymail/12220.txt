london britain needs more women as spies -- and it could do worse than look to recruit them on popular parenting website mumsnet
that 's according to a report released thursday by parliament 's intelligence and security committee
the report recommends targeting women , including mothers and those who are middle - aged or mid-career , to help break through " the permafrost " of men in middle management " who have a very traditional male mentality and outlook
" the idea that a new cohort of britain spies could be signed up via mumsnet , more usually associated with debates on pregnancy , childcare and homemaking , may surprise some
but lawmaker blears , a committee member , said recruiting more women to the three intelligence and security agencies the committee oversees is a crucial way to change the intelligence agencies ' sometimes hidebound culture
but while women currently make up about 37 % of the employees across the britain intelligence agencies , according to the intelligence and security committee report , they make up fewer than one - fifth of those in senior roles
" besides using women - focused outlets like mumsnet to reach a new pool of talent , the committee recommends certain steps to make working for mi5 , mi6 and gchq ( gchq ) more tempting for women
former u.s. secretary of state madeleine albright -- who similarly looked into the position of women in the cia -- backed the britain report and what it said about the value of women in the intelligence agencies
