an illegal immigrant who committed ' revolting ' sex offences on the london underground could receive a Â£ 7,000 payout because he was kept in jail for ' too long ' while officials tried to deport him
naseer chawki , who claims to be 34 and from iran , was detained for more than four years while home office officials fought for deportation , after he was convicted of sexually abusing two women on a rush - hour piccadilly line train
but he has now won a high court battle against home secretary theresa may , after a judge ruled that he had been illegally held for seven months - against his human rights - during that process
naseer chawki , who sexually assaulted two women on a rush - hour tube , could be awarded Â£ 7,000 after the high court ( pictured ) ruled he was unlawfully held for ten months while officials tried to deport him deputy high court judge morris said naseer chawki 's payout is yet to be assessed , giving no indication of what the figure would be
during today 's hearing in london underground , the court heard how naseer chawki - who has failed in a bid to claim asylum - arrived in cardiff from iran in 1999 before moving to liverpool
the court heard how , in november 2008 , naseer chawki was given a three - year jail term for carrying out two sex assaults on the london underground , as well as possessing a false identity document
home secretary theresa may ( pictured ) had claimed naseer chawki was held because he posed a ' serious risk ' to the public but has lost the case naseer chawki had pleaded guilty to the offences , after he pressed himself against the women on a crowded rush - hour train
but he was released from immigration detention in march last year after attempts to deport him failed
after his release , naseer chawki launched a legal battle , claiming he had been held in immigration detention when then was ' no prospect ' of him being deported
judge morris ruled that detention had been lawful for the majority of the four years and four months naseer chawki was held
