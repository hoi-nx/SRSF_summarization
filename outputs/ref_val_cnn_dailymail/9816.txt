it 's a mother 's job to make sure her children learn how to fend for themselves
and it 's no different on the african plains as incredible new images have captured the moment a lioness teaches her cubs how to kill a wildebeest
the images show a reluctant and nervous looking lion cub being taught to hunt wildebeest by his mother on the african plain in kenya even though her cubs look nervous , the mother is insistent that they must learn to hunt and tries to grab the attention of the wildebeest after grabbing the animal 's attention , it is then down to the two young cubs to take over as they begin to chase the defenceless animal but the devoted mother is insistent that her cubs must learn how to hunt and approaches the prey to grab its attention
initially , the horned animal manages to keep the three predators at bay , but after a couple of minutes the wildebeest is overpowered and the cubs catch their first prey
the amazing images were captured by photographer mark dumbleton in kenya 's masai mara national park
at first the wildebeest appears to be holding its own and looks as though he might escape from the clutches of the lioness and her young but he eventually becomes overpowered by the three big cats who jump on his back and attempted to drag the wildebeest to the ground the stunning pictures taken in kenya were snapped by photographer mark dumbleton , who said the whole experience just lasted minutes mr mark dumbleton from johannesburg , africa said : ' it was amazing to watch a mother training her children for when they have to leave the pride
the lions finally get their prey and the wildebeest is dragged to the floor after being given a lesson in hunting by the lioness he added : ' the awe - inspiring wilderness of africa is motivating , it 's captured my attention
