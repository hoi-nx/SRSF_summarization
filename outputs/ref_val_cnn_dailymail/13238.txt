it was always going to take an extraordinary performance from a very talented swimmer to beat michael phelps at his favorite event in an olympic final
when the south african chased down phelps in the final 50 meters of the race to snatch a dramatic fingertip victory by 0.05 seconds he created one of the defining moments of the london olympics
as a 12 - year - old , le clos had gazed into his television set at home in durban watching in awe as phelps , widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all - time , won six olympic gold medals at athens in 2004
" my dream was always to swim like michael phelps so when i raced against him in the final it was actually a crazy feeling , " le chad le clos tells cnn 's human to hero series
" the mind - altering moment quickly morphed into a life - changing experience for the then 20 - year - old who edged out phelps in the final stroke
" it was such a huge moment for south african
obviously , to represent your country is a huge honor but to beat michael phelps at the london olympics was amazing , " he says
" the remarkable victory was memorable not just for le le clos ' reactions -- which went from joy to disbelief immediately after the race -- but for those of his father bert , whose elated response and subsequent tv interview have become an enduring part of the swimmer 's story
the excitable tribute to his " down - to - earth , beautiful boy , " which included repeated mentions of the word " unbelievable , " touched the hearts of viewers and turned le clos senior into something of a household name himself
" everywhere he goes he 's that famous dad and that 's amazing because he really is
" there is now another le le clos in the pool -- teenager jordan is hoping to follow in his brother 's large footsteps , having already competed at south african 's national championships
" originally a breaststroker , le clos switched to butterfly after he tore both his abductor muscles ( in the groin ) in 2008 when he was 16 years old
" while swimming 's toughest stroke remains his favored discipline , le clos has also struck gold in the individual 200m freestyle -- at the short - course world championships in doha last year -- and the 400m medley ( butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke and freestyle ) at the 2010 commonwealth games in delhi
after pipping phelps in the 200m in london , le clos had to settle for silver behind the american in the 100m , but he has n't missed a stroke since
he capped a brilliant 2014 in december with three more titles ( 50m , 100m and 200m ) at the short - course worlds in doha before being crowned fina world male swimmer of the year -- an award he is incredibly proud of
he concedes that it will be " very , very difficult " to get anywhere near phelps ' record haul of 18 olympic gold medals ( and 22 overall ) , but he may get the chance to race him one more time
phelps , who announced his retirement following the 2012 london games , made a shock return to the pool last year although things have n't exactly gone to plan -- the " baltimore bullet " is serving a six - month ban imposed by usa swimming after he was arrested for drink - driving last september
the ban has put his planned appearance at this year 's fina world championships in doubt , but phelps is still hopeful of qualifying for his fifth london olympics in 2016
" i really , really hope that he and his team decide to swim in rio , i really believe it will be great , " le chad le clos told reuters last year
" it 's added motivation for me ... with michael phelps back , it 's really sparked my fire , so to speak
in swimming terms , i want people to remember chad le clos -- the guy that not only beat michael phelps , but who is the best fast swimmer of all time , " he says
" in south african we have a rich history of great champions -- rugby players , cricket players , a lot of great golfers -- so i 'm among really tough competition , but i believe that after 2016 and 2020 i can hopefully be the greatest
