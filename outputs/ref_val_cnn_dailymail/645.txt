when i arrived at eco-chic resort amansala for bikini bootcamp , i was expecting just that â a week full of hard - core beach workouts to tone up my body for spring
i was also escaping new york âs brutal winter and after a quick three - and - a - half hour flight from new york jfk to cancun , bootcamp base is just a 90 minute drive to mexico âs bohemian town of tulum - a decidedly more exotic getaway than miami for seasonally depressed new york
what i was n't expecting at bikini bootcamp was the spiritual journey that accompanied it and how the group of 18 women who had also traveled from americans âs north east , canada and london would be the ingredients to such a unique experience

the fitness instructors â predominantly americans who work seasonally in mexico or moved down permanently for the lifestyle â told us that every group each week is here for a reason
we had all come from different backgrounds , with our different reasons for choosing bikini bootcamp
some were mothers who needed a week to themselves , some were marathon runners who wanted a scheduled workout vacation and others needed a kick - start on their fitness regime before summer
