more than two decades as a judge , prosecutor and defense lawyer could not prepare susan criss for the texas murder trial of millionaire durst
the aftermath of the sensational 2003 trial of the scion of a new york real estate empire in many ways upended the life of the 54 - year - old galveston - born lawyer who presided over the case
durst admitted at trial that he killed neighbor black in galveston and chopped up the body
there was the awkward encounter with durst in an upscale houston mall in 2005
durst had already been acquitted after his attorneys argued that he killed black in self - defense
or the time , month 's later , when the severed head of a cat was left near the doorstep of criss ' home
criss said she believes durst was behind it but admits police found no evidence
fearing for her life , criss said she stashed handguns throughout her house in case of a home intrusion
she put away the butcher knives in her kitchen
" i 've been living with this , " the former judge said in an interview friday
" it 's affected me in many , many ways
" the emotions came rushing back when durst -- the focus of hbo 's true crime documentary series " the jinx " -- was charged with first - degree murder this week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante , berman
durst 's lawyer has denied his client was involved in berman 's death
durst , 71 , appeared to be preparing for life on the run when fbi agents arrested him in a new orleans hotel on saturday
in his room , agents found more than $ 40,000 in cash , a handgun , marijuana and a neck - to - head latex mask to alter his appearance
the last time durst was accused of murder was in galveston
though he was acquitted in the death of his neighbor , durst later served nine months in prison on felony weapons charges stemming from that case
durst , who was on parole at the time , was on his cellphone
it was the first time criss had seen durst outside court , " in the free world , " as she put it
" " hey , i know you , " she said durst told her
fumbling to pick up the pieces of his phone , durst said , " you 're judge criss
" durst told her that he could n't believe she stopped to talk to him
" there was small talk about cases durst 's lawyers were working
" i thought , ' oh my god , how do i get out of this ? how do i exit , ' " said criss , who then wished durst a happy holiday
durst said he was impressed that she had stopped to chat
" the galleria mall was not listed on the places durst could go during his parole , said criss , who was a witness at a subsequent parole hearing
the former judge said police officers told her that durst had also been spotted outside the home where black was killed
a secretary in the district attorney 's office saw durst driving behind the galveston courthouse , criss said
a condition of durst 's parole was that he could only visit places where his parole officer permitted him , criss said
when court officials called durst 's lawyer deguerin to inquire about his presence near the courthouse , the lawyer said his client was visiting a psychiatrist in the area
in " the jinx , " durst described the time he spent living in vermont with his first wife , kathleen , running a health food store in the 1970s
durst said he last saw her when he dropped her off at a train station in katonah , new york , and she headed to their manhattan apartment
her family said they believe she 's dead and that durst is to blame
the case has never been solved
durst has denied any involvement in her disappearance
" it 's a nightmare watching it unfold because you could see that justice is n't going to be done , " criss said of the durst case and its many tentacles
" what was the key piece of evidence in our case that was n't there that would have given no doubt whatsoever that this was not self - defense -- the severed head , " criss said , referring to black , whose dismembered body was recovered but not his head
there was no evidence linking durst to the incident
criss said she thought about evidence at the murder trial
then the judge started receiving instant messages from unknown senders
they found no link to durst
the agent involved in the case did not return requests for comment
" criss ' obsession with the durst case is such that she has been working on a book she wants to title " descent into madness
she knows more than she needs to know about durst and his peculiarities : how he used to prepare for court sessions in the holding cell doing naked jumping jacks
she learned the reason for the last item from listening to 32 hours of durst 's recorded jailhouse phone calls
criss said it was a juror from the durst trial , a man who had befriended the defendant , visited him in jail and dined with him at times
