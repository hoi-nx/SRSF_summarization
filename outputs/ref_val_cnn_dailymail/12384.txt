last summer , amid startling news reports of manipulation , mismanagement and possibly death caused by failures at the va , congress came together and passed legislation to overhaul veterans ' access to health care
now , the va is trying to take the choice away
a mere six months after the choice act was signed into law , and only three months after veterans began to receive their choice cards , the president 's budget attempts to reallocate the law 's emergency funds that are solely meant to pay for veterans ' health care in their communities
thousands of veterans are struggling to access the care they were promised through the choice act because of the va 's flawed implementation of the law and foolish interpretation of the 40 - mile rule in the distance criteria
when congress passed the choice act , the intent was that veterans be allowed to access local health care if they can not receive the va care they need within 40 miles of their home , or their wait time for an appointment is more than 30 days
unfortunately , the va decided to narrow the interpretation of the 40 - mile rule , choosing to take into account only the distance of a va medical facility from a veteran 's home and not whether the va facility can actually provide the services the veteran needs
the va is denying the access the law was intended to provide and forcing veterans to choose between traveling hours to a va medical facility , paying out of pocket or going without care altogether
one would think this veteran could use his choice card to visit a local physician or local hospital to get the shots he needs -- but the va is denying access to this care
congress specifically included language in the choice act that gives the va the authority and flexibility it needs to provide veterans with access to care outside the va when the care needed by a veteran is " either unavailable or not cost - effective to provide at a va facility
