health experts have accused coca cola of â health washing â consumers with the launch of its new â lower - calorie â soft drink as it still contains the full amount of an adult âs recommended daily allowance of sugar
the soft drink giant âs latest product , coke life , is partly made from a naturally sweet plant called stevia , in a bid to target health conscious soft drink lovers
but a 330ml can of coke life still has 22g of sugar , equivalent of six teaspoons and 89 calories
when compared to a 330ml can of regular coca cola which has 35g of sugar , equivalent of almost 10 teaspoons of sugar and 139 calories , that is 35 per cent less sugar
university of sydney nutritionist dr kieron rooney told daily mail australia : â coke life should not be considered a healthy option â¦ it should not even have a seat at the table
â this is health washing , yes it is less sugar than the original but that is still an excessive amount - it is still a sugar sweetened beverage and is no way part of a healthy life or lifestyle
â coke life ( left ) comes in a green can and although it has less sugar than regular coke life ( right ) it still contains six teaspoons of sugar dr rooney highlighted research carried out in the eighties where rats were given a sugar solution , a saccharin [ artificial sweetener ] solution and only drank a certain amount
â it âs called a super mix , a little bit of sugar and sweetener drives over consumption â¦ if this translates to the human population then that is fantastic for coke life âs profit line , â dr rooney said
coke life has its very own â super mix â of both sugar and stevia - a type of sweetener
when it comes to the green colour of the coke life packet it can give off a â healthy vibe â , dr rooney said
he noted coke life would have done a great amount of market research before they launched the product
rosie huntington-whiteley launched coke life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - back in london in september â there would have been some work that went into the association of green with health
â but people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits , â he said
and when it comes to coke life âs claims that they are trying to help battle the obesity epidemic , dr rooney said it is â disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate for coke life to frame their products as healthy
â dr rooney said it is ' disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate ' for coke life products to be marketed as healthy coke life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant stevia , which has been in japan as a sweetener for over 30 years sugary drinks do not just cause weight gain they rot teeth , increase fat on the liver and fat around the waist , he explained â i think it is deceitful and they are sitting there saying the only health worry is weight , which is absolutely wrong
â dr rooney explained that ' liquid calories ' are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food professor amanda lee of queensland university of technology , and former chair of the national health and medical research council 's dietary guidelines working committee , told the sydney morning herald the launch of coke life is an example of â greenwashing â
â there 's a high risk that many consumers could be confused , thinking that it 's a low - energy option when it 's not
we âve achieved the taste you âd expect from coke life with 35 % reduced sugar and kilojoules , compared to coke life
â â coke life is nât simply a new product from coke life â it âs another great choice for people who want a delicious coke life to fit their lifestyle
there is a coke life option for everyone , â she said
peach flavour lipton ice tea has over eight teaspoons of sugar , while vitamin water has seven v energy drinks which promise to give you ' energy ' have 13 teaspoons of sugar in them the new addition to coke life 's range of 3,500 beverages , should also not be mistaken for coke zero , which is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men who do n't like the word ' diet ' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic coke life
however , it has 35 per cent less sugar than classic coke because it uses the natural plant stevia and sugar as sweeteners , rather than just sugar
coke zero ( left ) is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate ' diet ' drinks with women
unlike diet coke ( right ) , which is completely sugar free , coke life still has sugar nutritionist aloysa hourigan from nutrition australia said that stevia is not known to have any health risks but that does n't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink coke life
' if you âre wondering what the need for another low - calorie coke life drink is , the global brand which is worth an estimated $ 74 billion us dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about artificial sweeteners like aspartame , one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives
