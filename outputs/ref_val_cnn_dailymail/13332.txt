during the four years that hillary clinton was secretary of state she used ( brace yourselves ) a personal email account ! perhaps she thought this was a way of ensuring that barack obama did n't read her emails
either way , republicans attempts to turn this into hillary clinton 's roswell fall short of the mark
and we 'll recall , by the way , that officials in bush 's administration did something like this -- using nonofficial email accounts for official business -- and were hounded by the democrats for it
but whenever clinton pinged an email to an official government account , then the conversation would still have been archived , and her office insists that emails from her personal account were handed over anyway
she would have to have been blessed with the gift of clairvoyance to know back in 2009 that there would some day be controversy surrounding her handling of a siege of a u.s. diplomatic compound in libya -- and that it might be best to use personal email so as to cover her tracks in the future
jeb bush is angry about clinton 's email farrago and has tweeted that transparency matters
oh , there are some critical communications in the jeb bush archives
perhaps such conversations took place through bush 's personal account -- in which case , we need to know what he said in reply
of course there is a serious context to all of this : the benghazi hearings
