the oldest known romans camp has been discovered in italian 's northeastern border , revealing clues to how the ancient civilisation gained its military prowess
researchers discovered the structure , built in 178 bc , using lidar ( lidar ) â a technology which uses pulsed lasers to measure distances to the earth
italian scientists say the fort may have been used by to fight off pirates 2,000 years ago , paving the way for what is today the city of trieste a scanner was placed aboard a helicopter which then flew over parts of bay
the method allows researchers to reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways
' these included hobnails used to make the military shoes of roman soldiers and fragments of roman amphorae , widely used to store oil , wine and other food products
the black circles indicate the main pre-roman sites of the area after spotting the site using lidar , researchers then explored the area on foot to find several roman artefacts

the pulsed light can reveal structures that are hidden beneath trees or that have a form that are not easily recognised in other ways
the main fort was on a hilltop 1.2 miles ( 2km ) from the shore of the bay of muggia , and was flanked by two minor forts either side
the fort was built in 178 bc , making it several decades older than any other roman fort ever found
the find has excited researchers studying the roman as the timing of building of the fort coincides with the second istrian war
the find has excited researchers studying the roman as the timing of building of the fort coincides with the second istrian war when a laser is pointed at an area on the ground , the beam of light is reflected by the surface it hits.a sensor then records the light to measure a range
seen here are computer models of the forts the fort was built in 178 bc , making it several decades older than any other roman fort ever found
