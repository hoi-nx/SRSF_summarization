a pair of protesters who came all the way from new jersey to des moines , iowa to lodge a protest against their state 's governor , christie , were thrown out of saturday 's iowa ag summit after they yelled that christie had n't done enough to help victims of sandy
' my people follow me everywhere , ' christie quipped to event organizer bruce as the protesters were marched to the exit and hundreds applauded
' stevens ' sign read , ' governor christie : thousands of families still not home after sandy
christie , the no - nonsense governor known for boisterous outbursts on the campaign trail , reserved his most emotional words for the obama administration 's fast - evolving policy on cuba
the communist island nation , he complained bitterly , has been harboring since 1984 a fugitive who killed a new jersey police officer in 1977
the ejected christie heckler 's sign identified her as a member of the new jersey organizing project , a liberal group that is demanding more government funds to fix hurricane damage power to the ( old ) people ! an elderly protester also interrupted iowa gov. terry branstad with a litany of complaints about ' corporate ' agriculture circus : activists rallied outside the iowa ag summit on march 7 as hundreds listened inside to a procession of republican presidential hopefuls ' you can not start trading with a country that is promoting someone who is a cop - killer , ' he said of joanne chesimard , the 67 - year - old former black liberation army member who escaped from a new jersey prison in 1979 and has been on the run ever since
' the cuba government refused this week to extradite joanne chesimard , who has adopted the name joanne chesimard , as part of trade negotiations designed to give cuba access to us markets after a half - century of political freeze
' i can say it is off the table , ' said gustavo machin , the deputy director for us affairs at the cuba ministry of foreign affairs , during a march 2 interview with yahoo news
in december josefina vidal , cuba âs head of north american affairs , rejected a deal that would have returned joanne chesimard to the us in exchange for 5 prisoners held in the us ' every nation has sovereign and legitimate rights to grant political asylum to people it considers to have been persecuted , ' she told the associated press at the time
' we âve explained to the us government in the past that there are some people living in cuba to whom cuba has legitimately granted political asylum
' christie also attacked the white house on its economic record , hinting that he favors a wholesale rewrite of us 's tax code
fugitive : joanne chesimard killed a new jersey police officer , escaped from a new jersey prison and fled justice in cuba , where she still lives under the raul castro government 's protection ' we tax too much in this country already
' this is the worst recovery in modern history [ and ] the president takes a victory lap , ' he carped
and touting his own record conducting global trade missions for new jersey businesses , christie said the president 's approach has been inadequate
