phones have been blamed for creating a generation of people who can only communicate in so - called â text speak â and smiley faces
but a pair of new york developers is hoping to expand our vocabularies with the launch of its words u app. the app uses an algorithm to automatically replace words in messages with synonyms â and users can collect words to compete with their friends
it changes the words used in text messages while keeping the sentence structure and meaning the same
the original words are shown right and the updated words are shown left â learning new vocabulary can be stressful and challenging , but it does n't have to be , â explained sam mendleson and allan zhang
â they added that words u is â much smarter than an electronic thesaurus â because it maintains the sentence structure and the idiomatic usage of words it replaces
there are more than 800 words that can be used , and subsequently collected , and the aim is to achieve the â words crown â by collecting them all
and once the initial list of words has been learnt and collected users can download extension packs for $ 6.99
