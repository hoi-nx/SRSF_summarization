a new washington , d.c. abortion clinic will have a ' spa - like feel ' , with fluffy robes , natural wood floors and tea on arrival , in an attempt to help destigmatize the procedure
carafem , which opens this week , has a no - frills attitude when it comes to informing people with what they provide
purdy , the clinic 's president and founder , said he was inspired to start carafem after working more than a decade promoting family planning and hiv prevention in developing countries
carafem president and founder purdy ( pictured with health services vice president melissa s. grant ) has begun a new washington , d.c. abortion clinic that presents itself with a ' spa - like feel ' it was there he realized how much easier it was to get an abortion , sometimes as simple as walking into a pharmacy , in places such as ethiopia
melissa s. grant , carafem 's health services vice president , said it was important for the clinic ' to try and present an upgrade , almost spa - like feel '
the clinic will also only provide pharmaceutical abortions , meaning there will be no vacuum aspiration or surgical procedures available - this means that carafem 's clients can not be more than 10 weeks pregnant
purdy told the washington post that not purchasing surgical equipment allows him to charge $ 400 for the procedure , which is about $ 100 less than the average pharmaceutical abortion
the clinic offers fluffy robes , natural wood floors and tea on arrival , in an attempt to help destigmatize the procedure clients who walk into carafem will receive counseling and go through ' basic tests ' before they take the initial pill at the clinic
purdy said the clinic plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically
national right to life president carol tobias believes people will find carafem disgusting
purdy said the clinic , which he described as ' fresh , modern , clean and caring ' , plans to discuss abortion frankly and unapologetically
' we use the a-word ' carafem 's founders are n't the only people speaking publicly and positively about abortion
