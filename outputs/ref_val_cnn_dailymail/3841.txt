supermarkets are blocking efforts to tackle a deadly bug found in chicken , a watchdog declared last night
the fsa has found that up to 79 per cent of raw birds on sale are contaminated with campylobacter â the country âs most common cause of food poisoning
levels are dangerously high in 19 per cent of chickens and the agency has demanded this figure should be below 10 per cent by year âs end
tests last month revealed 73 per cent of chickens in supermarkets contained potentially lethal food poisoning bug campylobacter , which makes 280,000 people ill every year it says however that asda , tesco , sainsbury âs , morrisons , waitrose and the co-op are failing to help
chief executive catherine brown said supermarkets had â pushed back â against providing information and claimed the stores were unhappy over the fsa âs publication of campylobacter league tables
experts fear the stand - off will make it more difficult to tackle a bug that hits an estimated 280,000 people every year , killing 100
