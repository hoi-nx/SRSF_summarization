carragher has hailed the impact of chelsea goalkeeper courtois , who put a first - half error behind him to help the blues to victory against hull
chelsea went 2 - 0 up through eden hazard and diego costa , but hull pulled level after courtois gifted possession to abel hernandez just before the half - hour mark
and carragher , speaking on sky sports after the game , thinks that despite his error , there are few goalkeepers as good as the chelsea man
courtois made an error in the first half to gift hull their equalising goal against chelsea courtois gave away possession under pressure from gaston ramirez to allow abel hernandez to score ' he had a bit of a mix - up in the first half , ' the sportsmail pundit said
' speaking alongside carragher was former arsenal striker thierry henry , who was in agreement at courtois ' excellent game despite the high - profile error
' before the mistake , he made a couple of saves that kept chelsea in the game , ' thierry henry noted
' chelsea 's 3 - 2 win took them back to winning ways after a draw against southampton last time out , and restored their six - point gap ahead of manchester city at the top of the premier league
carragher ( left ) and thierry henry hailed courtois ' impact in the second half to save chelsea courtois made a string of saves , including three in quick succession , to help jose 's side to victory their win at hull was far from convincing , but according to thierry henry , getting three points in the manner chelsea did is a mark of their winning mentality
carragher thinks courtois ( pictured ) will be one of the world 's best goalkeepers for a decade carragher and thierry henry also believe that chelsea 's title hopes will remain successful , even without diego costa chelsea 's strike force is such that diego costa 's absence is unlikely to be a devastating blow , and the presence of remy in the latter stages actually forced a winner for the league leaders
