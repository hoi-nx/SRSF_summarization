five muslim women stand tall in a boxing ring , slowly winding strapping around their hands
" how can we be truthful if we have to hide out of shame , feel humiliated for feeling , for saying , doing , thinking as we please ? how can that be freedom , how can that be truth ? " performed at southbank centre 's wow -- women of the world festival -- common wealth theatre 's " no guts , no heart , no glory , " tells the true story of muslim female boxers from bradford in the north of sport england , and how they are using the sport to transcend religious and gender barriers
the critically acclaimed show -- in which the women stamp , dance , shout , swear , punch , and even crowd surf -- was partly inspired by ambreen sadiq , a former uk national champion , and one of uk 's first muslim female boxers
her journey to success was n't easy -- as a victim of bullying at the age of 13 she found respite in boxing after being introduced to it by her father and brother
boxing helped me to control that anger
" it was a transformative experience for sadiq -- she went from being quiet , having few friends and getting into fights to plucking up courage to start conversations , and thereby build self confidence
" boxing has made me the person i am today , and i 'm so proud of the person i am , " said the 20 - year - old trailblazer , who is now looked up to by girls from all kinds of communities wanting to follow in her footsteps
" i 've had a lot of girls -- not just asian girls -- coming up to me and asking , how do you stop people saying it 's a boy 's sport ? how can you convince your parents to let you box ? " while boxing for many is just a sport -- albeit a violent one -- when it comes to women and muslim participating it can feel more like a cause , with sadiq often finding herself explaining her motivation to girls
" what 's the difference if a boy boxes or if a girl boxes ? when we 're in that ring we look like boxers -- we do n't look like a girl or a boy
sadiq tells the story of how several years ago her coach alwyn belcher , who also worked with adams , originally refused to train women -- that is , until he turned up to coach the gb team ( believing they 'd be men ) only to find an enthusiastic bunch of women ready to work
" he said from that day he thought girls were better boxers -- because they like to listen
" since adams ' success at the olympic games , females boxing once a week increased by 79 % according to a 2013 sport england study , but even the production of " no guts , no heart , no glory " highlighted the barriers women potentially face
cast member and aspiring medical student freyaa ali said there was a girl who had wanted to participate in the show , but was ultimately prevented from doing so by her relatives
" " i think that 's what makes me even more passionate about doing this -- we want to give them a voice and give them a reason , so they know they can have confidence to do stuff like this
" if women do feel restricted by their religion or gender , freyaa ali urged them to take things step by step
