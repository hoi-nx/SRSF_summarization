a raft of ' bizarre ' victorian - style by - laws banning activities such as selling lucky heather have been introduced by councils driving into a retail park after 6pm is now a crime under a raft of ' bizarre ' new victorian - style by - laws introduced by councils
playing music , skateboarding , drinking alcohol in public and even selling lucky heather are among the activities outlawed by local authorities across the country in a drive to restrict freedom , say critics
a group which campaigns against excessive regulation said the measures introduced in the 2014 anti-social behaviour , crime and policing act had created a ' patchwork of criminal law '
but councils say the orders , which allow them to target anti-social behaviour at a local level , have widespread public support
ministers insist the orders are intended to clamp down on anti-social behaviour , such as spitting and aggressive begging
but some councils are also planning to apply them to the likes of pigeon feeding , ' nuisance parking ' and children playing ball games outside schools
playing music , skateboarding and drinking alcohol in public are among the activities outlawed anybody flouting the orders will be liable for a fine , normally ranging from Â£ 70 to Â£ 100 , issued by a police officer , police community support officer , council worker or private security guard employed by the local town hall
a home office spokesman said : ' public spaces protection orders ensure that public spaces are not affected by anti-social behaviour so law - abiding people can enjoy them
' the result is a patchwork of criminal law where something is illegal in one street but not the next
' these orders will turn towns into no - go zones for homeless people , old ladies feeding pigeons , or anyone else the council views as ' messy ' â a return to the meddling and moralism of 19th - century by - laws
