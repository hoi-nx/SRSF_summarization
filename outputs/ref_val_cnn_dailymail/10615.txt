the midwife âs sister by christine within the very sentimental world of sunday night television , call the midwife âs heroine , jenny , was played with gentle reserve by actress jessica raine
call the midwife âs heroine , jenny ( left ) , is based on a real person but a startling new memoir by the sister of the midwife on whom the character is based suggests the real jenny was a more fiery and difficult character
the young jenny actually came to midwifery after being dismissed from her nursing course at the royal berkshire hospital for losing her temper and smacking a small child
but she was deeply in love with a much older married man at the time , and christine now believes that her sister âs romantic frustrations were the cause of her angry outbursts
reading the details of the sisters â childhood , it âs obvious that jenny had cause for anger long before her married lover refused to leave his wife
jennifer was born in 1936 , the daughter of a post office clerk called elsie â a woman with â bedroom eyes , fabulous hour - glass figure and great legs â â and a handsome chancer , gordon , who had whisked elsie away on his milk float from the dance at which they met
the first seven years of christine âs life were idyllic â she had parents who laughed and holiday adventures on the essex coast with her fearless older sister
their mother flirted her way to extra luxuries during rationing
meanwhile , gordon married judith and the wealthy couple moved to a luxurious country home â except for the room set aside for his two girls
the real jenny ( played in the bbc series by jessica raine , second right ) ended up in midwifery after being dismissed from her nursing course at the royal berkshire hospital for losing her temper elsie went on to marry a violent bully called jock , who demanded the girls be out of his sight when he came home from work at 5pm
by this point , christine claims , jennifer had become quite violent , sometimes â grabbing me by the hair and repeatedly banging my head against the wall â
christine had done nothing to provoke the attacks â â her fury was all to do with the collapse of home life â
jock slammed the piano lid onto her fingers and she was thrown out of the house the next morning
while jennifer built a career as a concert pianist then a writer , christine became a sculptor
