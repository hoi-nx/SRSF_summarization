beautiful images have emerged of a new island that has formed off the coast of tonga - although scientists say it could soon disappear
the photographs were taken by three men who climbed to the peak of the land mass 40 miles ( 65 km ) northwest of the capital , nuku'alofa
the island started forming in january after a volcano exploded underwater and then expanded creating a mile long , cone - shaped formation
the volcano gets its name from the two islands it is situated between - tonga and tonga
at the time , geologists said the eruption originated from two volcanic vents - one was located on tonga , while the other was around 330ft ( 100m ) offshore
' it was a perfect day , with fantastic views â bright blue sky and the sea was the same colour as the sky , ' orbassano , one of the locals , told tonga 's matangi online
the holes in the material form when gases that were dissolved in the magma come out of solution as it erupts scientists believe the dimensions of the new island are about 1.1 miles ( 1.8 km ) by 0.9 miles ( 1.5km ) , and that it rises about 328ft ( 100 metres ) above the sea
the hunga tonga-hunga ha'apai underwater volcano , that created the formation , is located between two land masses in the tonga archipelago - tonga and tonga
they said the surface of the island was still warm and , after climbing to the highest point of its crater , they caught sight of a vast green lake which smelled of sulphur

when levels of nitrogen and phosphorus rise , which can be caused by underwater eruptions such as the one off the coast of tonga , algae can multiply

however , the island expanded to 56,000 square metres ( 13.8 acres ) - around three times its size - as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below
the natural beauty of the location could make it into a popular tourist attraction before the island disappears in a few months gianpiero orbassano and branko sugar of nuku'alofa are pictured top of the crater rim of the newly formed island , at tonga , tonga
