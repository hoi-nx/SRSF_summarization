a son whose no - nonsense dad gave him a fitting punishment for being a bully - and sent his story viral - has seen the error of his ways
kayden , 13 , said ' thank you , i deserved that ' to dad timothy , who surprised him with a run , 60 push - ups and gardening chores at 4am in freezing green bay , wisconsin , after finding out he 'd been mistreating a classmate
a photograph showing kayden and timothy posing with a sign explaining his sentence has been shared thousands of times online
spelling it out : robenhorst was shocked to heard his son , kayden , had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him just desserts : kayden , 13 , is pictured above in the midst of a ' knuckle push - up ' , part of his grueling punishment from above : kayden said of the punishment ' i learned my lesson , and he 's a good dad for doing it ' another condition of the punishment is that it remains kayden 's own facebook profile picture and cover photo until kayden relents
the surprise punishment , carried out wednesday in 32 - degree weather , came after timothy got wind that his son had insulted a classmate , and later pushed him into a locker while walking between classes
kayden , who heard what had happened from friends , decided not to let his son know in advance , but sprang the punishment on him at 4am
punished : kayden , pictured , was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs after sitting him down and explaining what was about to happen , he dressed him up , stood over him during the push - ups then sent him out on the run
describing the experience to dailymail.com , kayden said : ' it was stupid of me - i saw a kid and said a stupid , random comment
' he made me do 50 knuckle push - ups , run a mile , then come back and do incline push - ups
' this is what happens when you become a bully ! i do n't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully ! ' please share this to end this behavior everywhere ! nothing changes until you take a stance and it only takes one person to start a revolution ! ' kayden concurs , adding : ' it 's a good message and i hope lots of people see it ' .
