the answer to life âs questions may not lie at the bottom of a bottle of whisky , but a smart label on its side could offer some words of ' wisdom '
a prototype bottle has gone on show at mobile world congress in barcelona the prototype â smart bottle â has gone on show at mobile world congress in barcelona
it is the brainchild of drinks giant diageo and thinfilm , which develops printed electronics
it uses a smartphone âs near field communication ( nfc ) capabilities so that a handset can be hovered over the label to unlock its digital secrets
the bottle has sensor tags using thinfilm 's opensense technology on its label that allows the transmission of adverts either when consumers are looking to buy whisky , or afterwards
it also tells a user that the bottle was properly sealed and when it is open ( illustrated by the prototype ) scanning the label could , for example , give consumers special offers , cocktail recipes or film content
the technology could also be useful for the london - based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes
the sensor tags will remain readable after the factory seal has been broken so that they provide â an additional layer of security in protecting the authenticity of the product , â diageo says
the technology could also be useful for the london - based drinks firm in tracking the movement of drinks from shops to homes the cloud - based software behind the integration is powered by a company called evrything , which is delivering the mobile experience activated through the product label
