my mum lesley , 69 â who is retired and a fine example of someone who likes to splurge her pensioner pounds â last week flounced out of argos , where she âd intended to spend upwards of Â£ 200 on her grandchildren
she was just too daunted by their new space - age shops to buy anything
gone are the catalogues , little jotter pads and blue pens that used to fill the stores
instead , the desks , revamped in clinical white and looking more like a scientist âs lab than a shop , are fitted with white touch - screen ipads
claudia connell says her mother , lesley , 63 , was so daunted by the space - age technology in argos last week that she went to an independent toy seller in another town customers search on the ipads for their items , place an order and pay at a self - service kiosk
i should learn but i do nât want my first lesson to be in argos with other shoppers breathing down my neck and making me anxious
â we know the baby boomer generation have the most leisure , money and time to spend on the high street , so why are retailers doing all they can to make them feel like outcasts ? our high street stores have changed beyond recognition in recent years â and for many older customers it âs certainly not for the better
argos stores used to be known for their weighty catalogues ( pictured ) , little jotter pads and blue pens but instead they now have ipads , self - service counters and barely any customer - employee contact the trouble is , they all seem to be looking for trendy high - tech solutions â gizmos and gimmicks designed to lure in the under - 30s , intimidating the rest of us in the process
â a lot of them were stung by coming too late to the online market and they do nât want the same to happen again by being too late to take on board in - store technology
older people generally have more money to spend but also want some human interaction while shopping ( picture posed by model ) â older people have money to spend , but what our research tells us is that , more than anything , they want human interaction
â for some older women a trip to the shops can be the only human contact they have that day
â even marks & spencer , which relies heavily on the pensioner pound , is focusing too heavily on in - store technology in the form of touch - screen ordering stations and self - service checkouts
â who wants to spend their day wandering around a maze of shops , getting lost , walking miles and not being able to find your car at the end ? â says kate
â it âs why we âre seeing a rise in the independent , with shops offering old - fashioned customer service
â it is nât just department stores that have become a mind - boggling minefield as anyone who has ever attempted to go into a high street coffee chain and order a plain , white coffee or tea will know
the new ceo of the supermarket chain morrisons has decided to stop relying on technology and instead will get more staff manning tills and assisting in the shops ( stock image ) now greggs , once a go - to place for no - nonsense , simple food , is undergoing an image makeover , with cajun soups and mediterranean flatbread wraps alongside the sausage rolls and iced buns
self - service tills in supermarkets are fine â unless you are buying alcohol , single items of fruit or veg , want to use your own bags , require cash back or intend to pay with anything other than the world âs smoothest , crispest banknotes â in which case you âll need to call on the hovering assistant , who is busy helping half a dozen other confused people
