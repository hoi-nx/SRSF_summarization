pictures of this baby elephant learning to walk are testament to the old adage - the bigger they are , the harder they fall
the 200lb week - old newborn was captured collapsing under its own weight as it struggled to walk beside its mother at the samburu national park in kenya
photographed by margot raggett , the images show the elephant mother patiently wandering beside its baby as it repeatedly wobbles and collapses while learning to walk
adult elephants take a great deal of care of calves , helping them climb steep banks and protecting them from predators
