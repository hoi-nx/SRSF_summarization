senior judge lord justice beatson today threw out an application by the rspca for judicial review of the decision to close the case - insisting it was important ' officers of the state ' respected the restrictions on their powers
the rspca was challenging a decision of district judge sheraton at colchester magistrates ' court in june last year blocking the prosecution
the rspca applied to the high court in london for judicial review , arguing that even if the ' dominant purpose ' of the warrant granted under the epa was to investigate a possible statutory nuisance , there was still scope for dogs found to be in poor condition to be seized and a criminal prosecution brought
the rspca went to the high court to have the botched prosecution reviewed , but its claims were rejected dismissing the argument lord justice beatson , sitting with mr justice blake , said local council officers and the rspca had gone on to premises ' intent on carrying out a search for purposes for which they had not been authorised '
lord justice beatson said it was the 800th anniversary of magna carta and important to continue observing legal restrictions on ' officers of the state ' - and bodies like the rspca acting with them - entering private land
