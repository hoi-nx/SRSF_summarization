spurs âs victory came at a cost , though , with hugo lloris taken to hospital on saturday after suffering a nasty gash to his knee in a collision with team - mate kyle walker and jamie vardy in the first minute
the mood picked up , though , as spurs took a fifth - minute lead

mauricio pochettino was desperate to get his team into the dressing room , but his half - time talk made no difference as leicester levelled five minutes after the restart â wes morgan ghosting into the area undetected to head home matty james â corner
leicester midfielder esteban cambiasso could do nothing to stop kane 's effort from close range finding the back of the net kane leads the celebrations after opening the scoring for mauricio pochettino 's side at white hart lane on saturday spurs were dealt an early blow when lloris left the field on a stretcher after a second - minute collision with kyle walker the france goalkeeper looks to be in severe pain as he is seen to by the spurs medic following the early clash with the spurs right back at the time it seemed a pivotal moment , and so it proved as spurs were handed a contentious penalty in the 62nd minute
the commotion did nât concern kane , though , as england âs newest recruit sent schmeichel the wrong way to complete his hat - trick
that should had seen spurs home without fuss but nugent set up a nervy three minutes after some poor jan vertonghen defending , to score leicester âs third
