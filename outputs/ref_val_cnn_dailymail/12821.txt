new figures indicate that about 11 million people have signed up for health insurance during this latest sign - up period of obamacare , of which about half will be from the uninsured population , based on previous estimates
an estimated 71 % of the new insurance arises through medicaid , using 2014 calculations based on analysis by haislmaier and gonshorowski of data from the centers for medicaid and medicare
the harsh reality awaiting these low - income american is undeniable : according to 2013 data from a 2014 merritt hawkins study , 55 % of doctors already refuse new medicaid patients
according to the hsc health tracking physician survey , 2008 , the percentage of doctors that refuse new medicaid patients dwarf by about 8 to 10 times the percentage that refuses new private insurance patients
such " insurance " from obamacare not only fails to provide access to doctors , but research in the top medical journals such as cancer , american journal of cardiology , journal of heart and lung transplantation and annals of surgery , show that medicaid beneficiaries suffer worse outcomes than similar patients with private insurance ... all at an added cost of another $ 800 billion by congressional budget office estimates to taxpayers after the decade
it is not hyperbole to call medicaid a disgrace at its annual cost of about $ 450 billion , and expanding it rather than helping poor people buy private insurance is simply inexplicable
health care access for middle - class american is also significantly worsened by obamacare 's private insurance decrees
along with that forced change of coverage , many suddenly find themselves without access to their chosen doctors
despite the assertion that the law increases insurance choices , the obamacare exchanges do quite the opposite for those dependent on them and their government 's subsidies
the " narrow network " strategy is about to hit even more american in 2015 , as obamacare exchanges from california to new hampshire further restrict access to top doctors and hospitals in an attempt to quell insurance premium increases caused by the law itself , according to an analysis by the los angeles times
obamacare has forced american onto a far more government - dominated health care pathway than in the past
more doctors than ever already refuse medicaid and medicare due to inadequate payments for care , and that will only accelerate as government lowers reimbursements
back in 2008 , a shortfall of over $ 88 billion of payment from medicaid and medicare beneficiaries added more than $ 1,500 extra per year in premiums and $ 1,800 extra in total out - of - pocket costs to every family of four with private insurance
as the government increases its role as insurer , it increases its hold on payments to doctors and hospitals , so it will be able to reduce reimbursements and dictate access to limited networks of doctors and hospitals
any legitimate health reform plan must be focused on three goals : 1 ) help consumers find affordable private insurance suited to their personal needs ; 2 ) liberate the poor from medicaid so they have actual access to medical care , as well as the dignity of personal choice of doctor ; and 3 ) add substantive mechanisms that reduce health care costs by competition and value - seeking by consumers
contrary to the mantra that the gop has no plan other than to repeal obamacare , the truth is that it is the supporters of obamacare are the ones who are single - minded
they are focused on maintaining the obamacare without regard for legitimate reforms to improve health care access and quality and without finally addressing what always was the most important problem with american health care -- its cost
