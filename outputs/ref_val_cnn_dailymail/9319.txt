three in four households are paying up to Â£ 250 a year more on gas and electricity than they have to , official figures reveal
most families are still on their energy firm 's standard variable tariff â two years after cameron promised to force suppliers to put all customers on the best deal
the standard packages are Â£ 180 a year more expensive than the cheapest tariff , with some customers paying nearly Â£ 250 a year more
three in four households are paying up to Â£ 250 a year more on gas and electricity than they have to , because they are on a standard variable tariff rather than the cheapest deal shadow energy secretary caroline flint said mr cameron had promised 17 times in the house of commons to make energy suppliers automatically put all customers on their supplier 's lowest tariff
she said : ' more than two years after cameron promised to make energy companies put all customers on the lowest tariff , millions of households are still being routinely overcharged by hundreds of pounds every single year
' that 's why the next labour government will freeze energy prices until 2017 , so that bills can fall but not rise , give the regulator the power to force energy suppliers to cut their prices and end overcharging once and for all
during pm 's question 's time , cameron pledged to force energy firms to put customers on the cheapest tariff its findings showed 95 % of the uk 's 19 million dual fuel customers - those who take gas and electricity from the same company - could have saved between Â£ 158 and Â£ 234 by switching tariff or supplier
energy uk chief executive lawrence slade said : ' standard variable tariffs are just that , the standard price a company is offering energy to customers
labour 's caroline flint said mr cameron had promised 17 times to make energy suppliers put all customers on the lowest tariff ' part of the cost of energy is an assurance that the gas and electricity has been bought months in advance , making sure energy will be available to customers when it is needed
' ofgem chief executive dermot nolan said : ' while recent price cuts are a step in the right direction , many customers could be better off to the tune of up to Â£ 250 by moving from a variable rate to a fixed rate deal
