research shows that women who makes the dishes they see on tv shows are fatter than others
they are on average 11lb heavier â the equivalent of two dress sizes
it is nât known why but one explanation could be that butter , cream and other â naughty â ingredients that make dishes look so tasty on tv cause us to pile on the pounds when eaten regularly at home
research shows that women who makes the dishes they see on tv shows are fatter than others indeed , previous british research concluded recipes by some of our favourite cooks , including jamie oliver , nigella lawson and hugh fearnley-whittingstall , to be less healthy than supermarket ready meals
the chefs â dishes contained more calories and were higher in fat but lacking in fibre
options included word of mouth , magazines , cookery classes and tv shows
previous british research concluded recipes by some of our favourite cooks , including jamie oliver ( pictured ) , nigella lawson and hugh fearnley-whittingstall , to be less healthy than supermarket ready meals if found that women those watched tv cookery shows weighed 11lb more on average â but only if they tried to make the dishes themselves
those that watched celebrity chefs but did nât follow their recipes were no fatter than those that did nât watch the shows
â this is why it is important for cooks who enjoy watching these shows to recognise these influences and learn to modify the recipes to be more healthy or find recipes from other sources
