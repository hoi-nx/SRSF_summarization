america used to be a place where we said , " give me liberty or give me death
" we live by a credo that " freedom is n't free , " and that our constitution is worth dying for
how inspirational it is to believe that this is the wind of thought that blows underneath the eagle 's wings
unfortunately , whenever that wind becomes just a little too gusty for comfort , we find out just how little relationship our poetic credo has to our collective guts
the latest example : nine seconds of video of a number of boys singing an offensive song
immediately , the university of oklahoma expelled two of the boys for their speech
forget whether you like the speech or not
these boys got kicked out of a public school for singing a song , on their own time , in a privately rented bus , simply because the government did n't like the content of their song
opinion : what 's the right way to face racism ? censors overstepping their bounds is no surprise
what surprises me is how readily the public supported the expulsions , and how many supposedly intelligent people were willing to turn the first amendment on its head , because of nine seconds of video
i do n't like the song or its message either
i ca n't imagine anyone reasonable who would
but i am not willing to trade the first amendment for a society where we do n't need to hear racist words
in abrams , justice holmes wrote a passage that ultimately became the cornerstone of a liberty - based view toward free speech , and which became the dominant theory in first amendment jurisprudence
i believe in a racism - free world
but i feel no kinship with anyone who would harm the first amendment to fight racism
he wrote : " but when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths , they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market , and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out
" the song was a " threat
what about the disruptive nature of the song ? should other students have to go to school with people who clearly despise them , and who carry these offensive racist thoughts ? yes
they should be free to have these thoughts , they should be free to say these things
opinion : the danger society does n't talk about it is easy to claim that these sae boys did not deserve first amendment protection
the first amendment is not there to serve as a comforting blanket of civility
