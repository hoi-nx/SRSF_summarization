for suffering scotland captain greig laidlaw , it is beginning to feel more like groundhog year
greig laidlaw in action during the six nations rugby match between france and scotland at france but behind the forced smile it was clear there is a new fear engulfing him which makes the final six nations match against ireland on saturday an increasingly nervous prospect
the scrum - half with 38 caps to his name does nât want to join chris paterson and ross ford in the record books as a captain who led scotland to a six nations wooden spoon
chris paterson did it twice , in 2004 and 2007 , with ford suffering a similar fate in 2012
since six nations became six , italy have been bottom of the pile 10 times with wales and france finishing last once each
england and ireland have never picked up the wooden spoon
greig laidlaw , who played stand - off rather than scrum - half in the side that was whitewashed under ford , does nât want to experience that feeling again
â i like to think avoiding the wooden spoon is a big driving factor whether you are captain or not , as nobody wants to be in the team that âs failed to pick up any wins
â remember , though , we have nât finished bottom yet and we âve got an opportunity this weekend to finish on a high
greig laidlaw leaves the field after the second half of the the six nations match between against italy â the other side of the coin is that if we lose this one , it âs a long time before we play for scotland again and that âs the worst situation to be in
at least we have a week to try to rectify some of the problems that were there against england and give everybody the boost they want by turning things around against ireland
â greig laidlaw admitted he has been left totally frustrated at how his side had come up short in all their matches and fallen away badly in the second half of key games

a clean sweep is no longer a possibility after their defeat to wales last weekend but , even with tens of thousands inside the stadium cheering on joe schmidt âs title contenders , greig laidlaw still believes the scotland players can be inspired by the atmosphere within murrayfield
â greig laidlaw stands dejected after the final whistle during the six nations match at twickenham a win over ireland would indeed have the fans singing a happier tune
for that to happen , ross ford insists there is nothing to be gained from dwelling too much on the results which have brought scotland to this precarious position
