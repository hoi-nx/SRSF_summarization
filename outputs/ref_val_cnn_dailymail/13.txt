yet it seems that by often choosing the bolder males , women may be missing out on the best possible mate
researchers have found that the shyest males actually have the most to offer a potential lover - at least in the world of hermit crabs
hermit crabs , like the ones above , borrow the shells from other creatures to keep them safe and new research has shown that those crabs that stay in their shells more often tend to be a better mate for female crabs professor briffa , a marine animal behaviour researcher at plymouth university , and his colleagues have found that the most timid crabs tend to more high quality sperm - making them a better option for females looking for a mate
this , they say , is because the crabs that spend more time hiding from the world inside their shells , also have invested the most resources in becoming reproductively fit
males of a species of hairy chested crab , which has been given a nickname hoff , spend their lives largely separate from the females , according to new research
indeed , in many species males have to prove their physical fitness with bold and dramatic displays - like in peacocks and birds of paradise - and even mortal combat in some cases
' the researchers examined the ' personality ' of 100 hermit crabs collected from mount batten and hannafore point in plymouth university
they found crabs that stayed in their shells longer after being startled tended to have higher levels of this protein
hermit crabs , like the one pictured above , hide in their shells when startled , but it also helps them become better mates this is because when inside their shell , the crabs are unable to access the oxygen rich sea water around them and so higher levels of this protein helps use the oxygen already in their bodies more efficiently
again they found in the timid crabs , those that were slower to reemerge from their shells after being frightened , had larger spermatophores and so more high quality sperm stored
as they grow , hermit crabs like the one above , ' upgrade ' their shells by seeking out larger ones as finding the right home can offer them protection from danger but also give them a way of growing better stores of sperm professor briffa and his colleagues said that hiding in the shell when threatened may allow the crabs to conserve their energy for building up greater sperm reserves
