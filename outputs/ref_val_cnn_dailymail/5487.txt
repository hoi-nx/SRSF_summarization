after the week lionel messi âs had , football âs greatest ever knew exactly what was coming
as thierry henry said of lionel messi on wednesday , you do nât get to be this good without having a bit of an ego
a beaming pele prepares to take a bite from a footlong as former liverpool striker fowler looks on the brazilian great was in good form ahead of sunday 's mouthwatering match on merseyside three months after leaving a brazilian hospital following a urinary tract infection and now with a clean bill of health , pele has plenty to tell
he explains steven gerrard âs decision to jet off to america this summer as one taken to wind down , relax and retire , while he considers liverpool âs clash against manchester united to be matched only by el clasico in terms of global appeal
contrary to hysteria , there is nothing fundamentally wrong with english football , he continues , despite a fortnight which may end up serving as a nadir for the game in this country
and he cites the reason for a lack of success internationally as being largely down to our best players finding themselves â too comfortable â in the british bubble and unwilling to move abroad at their peak
but it is when the names lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo are mentioned that pele truly comes alive
fowler , pele and mcmanaman show off a liverpool top with the famous brazilian 's no 10 on the back fowler and pele pose with the shirt behind the counter at a subway outlet in london on friday afternoon cristiano ronaldo is a man who scores goals , but pele reckons he falls behind lionel messi lionel messi gets pele 's vote as the best player of the modern era after his consistent displays of the past decade not shy , he is more than happy to settle debates which have raged in pubs and on concourses across europe for the best part of a decade
â the two best at the moment are obviously cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi , â he says
â which is the best one ? lionel messi has been the best player of the last 10 years
â cristiano ronaldo is that striker who scores goals , but lionel messi does that and helps with assists
â so , lionel messi is top dog ; how does the argentine compare to the original luminary ? the grin emerges
â fowler , pele and mcmanaman laugh at the counter as the brazilian adds another shirt to his collection pele makes his point as our man speaks to the greatest footballer of all time about a smorgasbord of subjects there are more serious matters at hand for the premier league at present
â oh yes , definitely â he says when asked if the premier league remained the best division in the world
â it pains me as a brazilian , but i have to say that
but now the world cup in brazil ... we lost ! it âs the same with the football in english
pele , real name edison arantes do nascimento , was just 17 when he helped brazil to their first world cup pele was captain of the great 1970 brazilian side which won their third jules rimet trophy in five world cups â one thing i would say about english players is that they do nât have experience of playing abroad
the english players should be playing outside , but it âs too comfortable to play here
that âs the only thing you can say about english
â two englishmen who will ply their trade elsewhere come next season are steven gerrard and frank lampard , both set for the mls with la galaxy and new york city fc respectively
it is 40 years since pele was in america âs cultural hub with a cosmos team including franz beckenbauer and carlos alberto
only now is the perception of the country âs major division changing , although the brazilian says stars still head stateside to unwind
â during my time we had franz beckenbauer , george best , zico and carlos alberto
â steven gerrard guided liverpool to their fifth european cup on that unforgettable night in istanbul pele , franz beckenbauer ( second right ) , giorgio chinaglia ( right ) , his wife and mrs franz beckenbauer ( left ) pele places steven gerrard on a pedestal with the great franz beckenbauer , both making his world xi. asked where the liverpool skipper would rank among the best midfielders of all time , he compares him with germany âs biggest ever star
â maybe people do nât remember , but franz beckenbauer had the same style , â he adds
â as for the rumble on merseyside this weekend â it will be the sixth time pele has visited anfield â there is a simple message : the north west has the exact same appeal of el clasico
