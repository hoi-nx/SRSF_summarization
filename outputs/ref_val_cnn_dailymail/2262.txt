an amateur historian has unearthed the identities of the men who captured top nazi himmler ( right ) - discovering that one of them was his own grandfather , lt sgt mannion ( left ) himmler , who was one of the men responsible for the holocaust and was head of the s.s. , was wearing an eye patch disguise and carrying a bag of money when he was captured
he was taken to a checkpoint , quizzed and moved to a camp where he was identified - before killing himself
mr mannion , from manchester , says he discovered who the men were when researching his grandfather 's military career
he spent Â£ 30 accessing military service records of his grandfather - who he knew had served with 196 battery
but he was stunned to find the records show lt sgt mannion was one of the men who found himmler
historian chris mannion discovered documents ( pictured ) revealing his grandfather captured himmler when researching his military career an arrest report he was sent shows himmler was picked up by one non-commissioned officer and three gunners
mr mannion says the documents show they were gunner john fletcher , gunner michael faye , gunner n carlston and his own grandfather
the official records show one of the men fired a shot before faye grabbed himmler - and the group led him to the checkpoint
mr mannion now plans to publish the records and his findings in an upcoming book about himmler 's capture - and the men who found him
there was a rumour in the family about a high - ranking nazi official but i did n't think in a million years i would find out anything like this
they had the records of the capture of himmler - and there was my grandfather 's name
' when himmler received the news of hitler 's death , he travelled to flensburg where he remained for the first week of may
the four british men who first found him - from 196 battery of the 73rd anti-tank regiment ( pictured , with lt sgt mannion third from right , front row ) - has been shrouded in mystery himmler 's group were stopped on several occasions but managed to bluff their way through , until they tried to cross through meinstedt on may 21
mr mannion 's documents showed that his grandfather fought in normandy , belgium , holland and germany
himmler ( left ) - one of the men responsible for the holocaust and head of the s.s. - was hitler 's right - hand man the report reads : ' on 21 may 45 , at about 1930 hrs , one of the patrols which the regt sent out daily to neighbouring villages , saw three men emerging from a wood , at meinstedt
' lt sgt mannion died in in 1948 following complications of injuries sustained in the war
he was made head of the s.s.-the schutzstaffel - a major organisation and hitler 's personal bodyguard , which became one of the most powerful organisations under his leadership during the nazi
himmler developed it from a 290 - man battalion to a huge group with its own military
himmler was obsessed with the idea of the germany as the aryan race and racial purification and encouraged aryans to only breed with each other in special programmes he set up
when it became clear that the nazis were going to lose the war , himmler attempted to bargain with the allies , and hitler consequently stripped him of all his duties
