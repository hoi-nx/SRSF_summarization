the father of a l.a. police officer wanted for murder has been charged with making a false statement to an fbi agent , the fbi said thursday in a press release
victor manuel solis , 53 , was arrested in lancaster , california , in connection with the ongoing search for henry solis , a rookie officer with the l.a. police who is believed to have entered mexico from el paso , texas , the fbi said
an fbi complaint said a video recording at the border crossing showed father and son entering mexico together at 5:40 a.m. march 14 , even though the elder solis told an agent he dropped his son at an el paso bus station and did n't know where he went
victor solis told the fbi on march 16 that his son called on march 13 , said he wanted to spend some vacation time in el paso , and rode with his father to that texas city , the complaint said
