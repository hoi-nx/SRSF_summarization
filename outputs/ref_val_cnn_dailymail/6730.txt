penn has revealed that he watches propaganda beheading videos published by isis out of a sense of moral responsibility
the actor said he chooses to bear witness to the gruesome clips , in which americans , britons and kurdish have been graphically slaughtered , because ' real violence ' is often hidden from us
we are being anesthetized when you do n't see the horror of war
' ' real violence ' : penn , pictured left in his new film the gunman , said he watches isis 's propaganda videos showing hostages like james foley , right , being beheaded when asked whether he felt morally obliged to view the clips , he replied that he did
penn said that the graphic reality of the murder videos counteracts ' political correctness ' , which has led upsetting images from conflict such as that in iraq and afghanistan from being kept off - screen
penn said that staged violence in movies and the real violence such as that being perpetrated in iraq and syria are not the same thing
