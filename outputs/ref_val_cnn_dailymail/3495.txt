it has baffled scientists for years - why the penguin waddles in such a distinctive manner
most other diving birds are able to simply fly on land - but not the penguin
now , researchers hope to unravel the mystery of the waddle - and find out how it evolved watch the penguins on their custom catwalk using a special motion detecting ' catwalk ' professor hutchison and paleobiologist james proffitt have been measuring how the penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle
researchers set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it
the penguins walked over this to get their breakfast researchers also filmed the walk in slow motion , and are looking for the forces the birds excert , how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are
scientists from the rvc and university of texas at austin have visited london zoo to study the way the animals walk
