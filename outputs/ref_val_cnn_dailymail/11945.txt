' he further says in the just jared video : ' he [ barack obama ] does nât want netanyahu to win this upcoming election
israel 's arab make up 20 per cent of the population
celebrity backer : jon voight has also intervened in the israel election , saying barack obama 's ' whole agenda is to control israel
israel are voting following a campaign largely focused on economic issues mr netanyahu , who is seeking a third consecutive term , has vowed he would never allow the palestinian to establish a capital in the city 's eastern sector and pledged to build ' thousands ' of settler homes
throughout his campaign , mr netanyahu has repeatedly accused zionist union leaders herzog and former peace negotiator tzipi livni of being ready to abandon israel 's claim to jerusalem as its indivisible capital
on sunday he pledged to ' safeguard ' jerusalem ' in actions , not just words , more than any other leader ' , and on monday insisted jerusalem would remain forever israel 's ' undivided capital '
former prime minister and labour leader ehud barak came out in support of mr herzog , calling him ' experienced and responsible ' and someone who could be relied upon to ensure israel 's safety
the outgoing israel parliament and the latest opinion poll showing who should end up with what supporters netanyahu , attend his campaign meeting on monday in rabin square in the israel coastal city of tel aviv despite mr netanyahu 's rhetoric , the zionist union is tipped to come out on top in the election
the leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier - as in 2009 when the centrist kadima party then headed by tzipi livni effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought netanyahu to power for a second term
under israel 's complex electoral system , the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes , but to the mp or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61 .
