the sentencing council published plans yesterday recommending that a dog owner receive a lesser sentence if the animal was provoked into the attack
an owner could also avoid prison if they tried to get their dog under control before its victim died , or if the animal killed while they were momentarily distracted or briefly lost control
owners of vicious dogs will not be jailed if their killer animal was provoked into an attack , under proposed changes to sentencing ( file picture ) the changes will now be subject to a three - month consultation period
however , critics accused the changes of undermining the act , put into force last year , which increased the maximum sentence a dog owner whose pet kills can receive to 14 years
the reformed law was brought in after 14 - year - old jade anderson was mauled to death by four dogs when she visited a friend âs house in 2013
but the plans published yesterday say that if the dog owner or handler has â lesser culpability â then a deadly attack by their animal could lead to a community sentence rather than a prison term if they are convicted under the act
jade anderson , 14 , was mauled to death by four dogs in 2013 , prompting the introduction of the act such a sentence could mean less than a month âs unpaid work or four months of electronic tagging
the proposals recommend that the maximum sentence might go to â someone who has bred or trained a dog to be aggressive and uses the dog as a weapon or to intimidate people , whose dog carries out a fatal attack â
circuit judge julian goose , a member of the sentencing council , said : â most dog owners are responsible , care for their pets properly and keep them under control but some irresponsible owners put others at risk of injury or death and we want to ensure that the courts have the guidance needed to help them sentence offenders appropriately
