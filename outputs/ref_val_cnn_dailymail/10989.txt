the canadian model and other occupiers of the top - floor units at the spears building in chelsea are suing the owners of the apartment block over the demand they pay the full cost of the work
linda evangelista is in a dispute with the owners of the building in which she has her manhattan penthouse over a $ 1.5 million bill to replace its roof the spears building , where penthouse residents including miss evangelista want the cost of replacing the roof to be shared by all residents
it is in an area of chelsea where some apartments go for as much as Â£ 5 million in a lawsuit filed on monday , miss evangelista and other fellow top floor residents charge that the owners of the building at 525 w. 22nd st intend to violate the condominium âs bylaws by landing them with the entire seven - figure cost
the lawsuit says the owners got a legal opinion in 2011 that only those with private rooftop terraces on the sixth floor had to contribute anything towards the ongoing cost of maintaining the roof , but that residents of the entire building would be expected to put money towards a full replacement instead of carrying out the replacement then , the board started charging unit owners extra monthly fees to build up a fund to pay for it at later date , the lawsuit alleges
canadian miss evangelista , 49 , was one of the original supermodels who ruled the catwalk in the 1990s but the board reportedly decided last month to go back to the original plan and replace the roof but with penthouse residents only now expected to pay the entire cost , including financing
