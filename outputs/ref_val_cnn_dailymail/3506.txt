a man who walked off a qantas flight after he realised an asylum seeker was on board being deported is taking the airline to a tribunal because the airline banned him from flying after the incident
leary , 51 , decided to leave the february 2 flight from melbourne to darwin before the flight took off , after an asylum seeker advocate on the plane began protesting the deportation
mr leary learned he was on the same flight as a 25 - year - old tamil asylum seeker , known as puvaneethan , when he arrived at melbourne airport to see advocates handing out flyers , and when the female protester refused to sit down as the plane prepared for take - off
' his female colleague decided she was not comfortable being on the plane and mr leary stood by her and also decided not to fly
â mr leary and his colleague pressed the assistance light above their seats and a qantas stewardess came over to speak with them
when the qantas steward came over she indicated she was not comfortable with what was going on , â mr leary explained
mr leary âs colleague told the stewardess she wanted to leave
it was nât until mr leary was returning from darwin four days later after catching a flight with a different airline that he attempted to return to melbourne with qantas and was told he was subject to a no - fly ban
leary was issued with this ' no fly notification ' after he walked off a flight from melbourne to darwin which was carrying an asylum seeker thought to have been taken for deportation â a manager came over and said â you are involved in a security review and wo nât be flying today â , â mr leary recalled
mr leary said he has not been able to find out what the review process entails or if qantas are going to refund the cost of his flights to his employer
mr leary and his colleague have also been banned from flying with jetstar and qantas affiliates flyers were handed out at melbourne airport asking the public to save asylum seeker puvaneethan from torture â it âs like a kafkaesque situation where you just find out the result at the end , â he said
the letter spells out how mr leary can not â travel on any flight operated by a member of the qantas or the jetstar or travel on any codeshare flight operated by another airline ( including emirates ) that has a qantas or jetstar flight number , such as â qf â or â jq â , on your ticket â
â a qantas spokesperson told daily mail australia there was a delay in issuing the no fly notification to mr leary which is why he did not receive it prior to his next flight
' a number of passengers were identified as being involved in the on board incident , causing the flight to be delayed by almost an hour , ' qantas said
