joyce garrard is accused of punishing 9 - year - old savannah hardin for lying about eating candy on the school bus by making her run while carrying sticks and firewood at the family 's home in etowah county in 2012
garrard , 49 , could face the death penalty or life without parole if convicted
defense attorney bone tried to raise doubt about medical evidence in the case by showing jurors a version of the indictment , which mentioned severe dehydration and seizures
however , bone said savannah died because of a fatally low sodium level

the 9 - year - old was rushed to a birmingham hospital , where she later died from dehydration and low sodium , a condition common in marathon runners
savannah was n't supposed to eat chocolates because she was on medication for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and had a bladder problem , but she had eaten candy on the school bus the day before she died
