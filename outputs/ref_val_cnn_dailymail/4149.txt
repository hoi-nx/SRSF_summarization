a texas hunter who is paying $ 350,000 to shoot a black rhino in africa has been granted permission to import the animal 's carcass to the u.s. as a trophy
corey knowlton sparked fury among animal rights activists after bidding for the right to shoot the animal at an auction held by the dallas safari club last year
after news of the auction broke mr corey knowlton received death threats and has had to hire a private security team
trophy : texas big game hunter corey knowlton has been granted permission to bring the carcass of a black rhino back to the u.s. a file picture of two black rhinos
the namibia government issues a small number of licences to hunt the animals with the proceeds used to fund anti-poaching efforts the number of black rhinos left in africa has fallen from 70,000 fifty years ago to just 5,000
namibia controversially allows a small number of the animals , normally older male bulls , to be hunted each year with fees going to fund anti-poaching efforts
more than 150,000 people signed petitions calling on the us fish and wildlife service not to grant mr corey knowlton a permit to bring the carcass home
campaign : more than 150,000 people signed petitions calling on the us fish and wildlife service not to grant mr corey knowlton a permit to bring the carcass home but the agency decided that as the $ 350,000 was going towards conservation efforts , allowing the carcass to be brought to the u.s. would not breach the endangered species act
last year they approved a similar permit for another north american hunter , las vegas - based investor michael luzich , who paid $ 200,000 directly to the namibia government to kill a black rhino
since publishing the initial request in november , the us fish and wildlife service received more than 15,000 comments , as well as petitions with about 152,000 signatures demanding that it be denied
in a letter to the agency in december , the club 's executive director , ben carter , said the money raised from such auctions is ' critical to supporting the namibia government in their efforts to stem the tide of commercial killing of these animals
