former new york mayor giuliani on thursday castigated president obama for setting a ' tone ' that inspires violent behavior in america and advocated for him to emulate cosby when it comes to talking about black crime
' and if an americans - americans president stood up and said - i hate to mention it because of what happened afterwards - the kinds of stuff that cosby used to say
fresh off his trip abroad , giuliani contended on thursday that internationally , america is considered a ' racist state ' imam izak-el mu'eed pasha is a black , muslim leader in new york who giuliani has been friends with more than a decade
i remember pasha saying to his congregation , if there were less crime in the community , there would be less police in our community , giuliani recalled
in on memorable - and controversial - address cosby touched on the perils of stealing and defended police against charges of racism
â ' ' america 's mayor ' has made a few contentious statements of his own as of late , saying late last month he 's not sure , based on the president 's upbringing and behavior , that obama ' loves america
' after several days of spinning , and counter claims that he had racist intent when the made the derogatory remarks about the nation 's first black president , giuliani finally ended the media - frenzy by penning an op - ed in which he explained that he simply wishes the president would speak more highly of americans exceptionalism
striving to avoid another kerfuffle , giuliani was careful to balance out his criticisms of obama on am 970 with a note of goodwill to the president
' i disagree with obama on almost everything , but i think obama 's a good family man , and he 's a good man
earlier in the interview , giuliani suggested the savage beating of a 15 - year - old girl in a mcdonald 's on monday , the shooting of two ferguson police officers this morning and an incident at a city council meeting involving nypd commissioner bill bratton , at which 20 protester heckled him until they were led out by the cops , all occurred because obama had n't done more to verbally build up america 's police
president obama , pictured here boarding air force one today , should seek to emulate cosby when it comes to talking about crimes committed by blacks , giuliani contended , prefacing the statement with his loathe to mention cosby ' because of what happened afterwards ' giuliani , who just returned stateside following a conference in germany on ' tolerance and equality against fundamentalism and misogyny and says he spent a large portion of the fall traveling abroad , contended that internationally , america 's police are considered to be ' racist
' and it turned out to be a justifiable homicide , ' giuliani said of the shooting of michael brown , citing both the state grand jury 's decision not to indite police officer darren wilson and the justice department 's announcement that it would n't bring charges against him , either
one person obama should not be listening to or promoting giuliani said is rev. sharpton , who is not respected by america 's police of all race
giuliani said the sentiment among police officers is , ' if you hang around sharpton you must be anti-police
