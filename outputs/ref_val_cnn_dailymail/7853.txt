peacock tails may be hard to miss , but humans are unaware of the noise created by the bird 's pretty plumage
scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear
male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate

male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate across dusty scrub land , the study claims researchers at the university of manitoba in winnipeg , canada , have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them
most humans hear noises between 20 and 20,000 hertz
male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males ( stock image ) shrieking out charles darwin first suggested that a peacock âs train serves to attract females and studies have since shown that females tend to prefer males with the most exaggerated male characteristics
males with impressive trains have been shown to be healthier , suggesting that the ornament indicates a male âs ability to survive

ms freeman believes that male peacocks may use infrasound to maintain their territory and warn off approaching rivals
she observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers , producing two displays which she called the â shiver train â and the â pulse train â

this could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland , where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes ca nât see each other
