vinegar can kill bacteria when new knee joints become infected vinegar is nât just for livening up fish and chips â doctors are now using its key ingredient to treat infections in knee replacements
surgeons in cardiff are applying acetic acid to kill bacteria when new knee joints become infected , thereby reducing the need for further surgery
in the uk , 82,000 knee replacement operations take place every year
but bacteria can get inside the knee during surgery , causing infection â sometimes years later â leading to inflammation and swelling
untreated , this can cause the joint to loosen and eventually collapse
in such cases , surgeons â only option is to remove the replacement joint , cut away dead tissue , wash out the knee ( using saline , to sterilise , or iodine , which has antimicrobial properties ) and put in a new joint
sometimes , they can put in the replacement knee during the same operation , but this is usually done six to eight weeks later
now , surgeons at university hospital of wales and spire cardiff hospital hope that bathing the site with vinegar when they remove the infected joint means they can replace the joint in just one operation
tests have shown that soaking the biofilm ( the sticky layer of bacteria inside the knee ) in this acid solution effectively kills the bacteria better than standard saline , says morgan-jones , consultant orthopaedic surgeon at both hospitals
â tests have shown that soaking the biofilm ( the sticky layer of bacteria inside the knee ) in vinegar effectively kills the bacteria better than standard saline one patient who has benefited is ron , 69 , a retired major in the royal army physical training corps
after years of pain , in 2002 he had a left knee replacement on the nhs
three months later , he had surgery to remove the joint and â cement â was packed into his knee
â he told me he could take the infected joint out , bathe the knee in vinegar to kill the infection and replace the joint , â says ron
mr morgan-jones hopes that , in future , acetic acid may be used in all knee replacement operations to prevent infection in the first place
nick london , consultant knee surgeon at yorkshire knee clinic and harrogate and district nhs foundation trust , says infection in knee replacement surgery is â a huge problem , affecting around 1 per cent of patients â
mr morgan-jones is planning to use sterile medical honey , surgihoney , in revision surgery to replace an infected knee joint
