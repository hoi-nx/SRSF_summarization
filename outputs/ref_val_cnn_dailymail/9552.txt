the knowledge that your son has committed murder is more than any mother should have to bear
for one mother though , the news was even worse - the victim was her own mother
in 2008 , franky regan lamb faced the news that her 21 - year - old son rakeim had fatally stabbed her mother , pat regan , in her own home , in leeds
rakeim , who had become heavily involved in gang and drugs culture , killed his grandmother whilst under psychosis
his mental state seriously deteriorated after his pat 's son - had died five years earlier and he became heavily involved in the drugs scene
rakeim had been close to his uncle and looked up to him - something that had always worried his family who felt that danny , a notorious drug dealer , might be a bad influence on him
following her son 's death pat went on to be a staunch anti-gun activist and , according to franky , had a close relationship with rakeim
murdered pat regan ( right ) was an anti-gun campaigner , pictured here with fellow campaigner michelle forbes outside downing street in 2008 slain uncle : pat 's son danny was murdered in 2002 in what was thought to have been an altercation over drugs she said : ' if he was in trouble , he 'd go to my mum probably more than me because my mum had probably dealt with it better
' despite this closeness the family began to seriously worry about rakeim as he slipped deeper into a world of gang violence
franky said : ' he kind of lost his way a little bit and i , kind of , guess he dabbled in drugs in his teenage years , in ecstasy , cocaine , and i used to say to rakeim , " you have n't got the mind - set to get through stuff like that , you know , take ecstasy and things like that
" ' rakeim 's uncle shane regan showed off a selection of pictures of his mother
" ' finally - following an incident in which rakeim was found stumbling around a park near his home in a state of psychosis - he was taken to hospital
the day after his release pat , who had taken rakeim in , went missing
shane was horrified when he was called to his mother 's house after she failed to show up to an anti-gun meeting that he was holding , only to find out that she had been killed
however , franky has come to understand that it was his mental health problems which made him act the way he did
' the realisation that your son 's done what he 's done , it 's just gut - wrenching
' part of me sometimes thinks , " would it be easier to dislike , not love rakeim if he had n't been a drug addict and he 'd have killed her because he wanted money for drugs or something , or he was just a nasty person ? ' because he was n't , and it was the mental health , and he loved his grandma , and he was n't a bad person , it just makes it that much harder knowing that - what a nice lad he was
' having pleaded guilty to manslaughter rakeim is now detained indefinitely under the mental health act and franky goes to visit him on a regular basis
' however , shane has mixed feelings about whether he will see him again : ' personally i âve not seen rakeim since the day that he got sentenced
