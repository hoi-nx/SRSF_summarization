robert jason owens , 36 , a construction worker from north carolina , was booked on two counts of first - degree murder , the murder of an unborn child , larceny and breaking and entering on tuesday

but they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a mitsubishi for sale that zebb was interested in buying , police told fox carolina
owens later told police that a short while later , zebb flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over
cancelling the pair 's plans to see the mitsubishi , zebb reportedly told owens he needed to leave and drove off , bumping into his friend 's truck on his way
