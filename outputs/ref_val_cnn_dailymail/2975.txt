american low - cost carrier , spirit , has just acquired its 69th plane and has found an interesting way to celebrate
not only has the airline slashed roundtrip fairs to Â£ 69 in april and may - including taxes and fees - but they also announced such a drastic price drop with some rather cheeky copy
the emails sent around announcing the sale reference a particular sexual act in very blatant terms , with some customers complaining that the new campaign is in poor taste
in much the same vein , spirit spokesman paul berry said , in a statement , that the latest campaign was simply a reflection of the airline 's unconventional and quirky personality
' spirit is n't your typical airline and we do n't want to be
' spokesman , paul berry , has said that the latest campaign is simply a reflection of spirit 's quirky personality however , some customers have took to social media to question if the ad campaign has gone a bit too far ' when it comes to advertising , different means we do n't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares
