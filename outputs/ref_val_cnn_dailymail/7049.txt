home ownership will become a ' distant ' dream for an entire generation , with just one in five under - 35s able to buy a house by the end of the decade , labour claims today
shadow housing minister reynolds warns five more years of the tories ' ' failed plan ' will create a housing gap between those on the property ladder and millions forced to rent
by 2020 , just 21 per cent of under - 35s will own their own home if the current trend continues , according to labour
in 1991 the figure was 60 per cent latest figures show that just 31 per cent of people aged 16 - 35 owned their own home in 2012 - 13 , down from 10 per cent in the year before the last election
labour warns that if the trend continues , it will mean that by 2020 just 21 per cent of young people will be on the property ladder
shadow housing minister reynolds warns five more years of the tories ' ' failed plan ' will create a housing gap between those on the property ladder and millions forced to rent ' a record number of young people are still living at home with their parents in their twenties and thirties because they ca n't get on the housing ladder
' in 2001 more than half of under - 35s ( 55 per cent ) owned their home , and in 1991 it was as high as 60 per cent
at the same time , the proportion of over- 75s owning a property has risen from 53 per cent in 1991 to 76 per cent in 2012 - 13
' five more years of the tories ' failed plan will see a growing housing gap , falling home ownership and unrealised aspiration for the next generation
' while the tories still believe , despite their failure over the past five years , that the housing crisis will be solved by the market alone , labour is clear that to tackle the housing crisis there must be a much more active role for national and local government
