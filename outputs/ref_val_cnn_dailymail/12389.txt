in the two years since " lean in " became a best - seller and sparked countless conversations about gender equality , author sandberg says she has gotten one question over and over from men : what can they do ? now the facebook chief operating officer is giving them some specific answers by aligning with one of the most popular athletes on the planet
if lebron james is encouraging men to lean in for women , do n't you think some of his 19 million twitter followers will get the message too ? that 's certainly what sandberg and her leanin.org colleagues are hoping , following their brand new partnership with the nba and the wnba and the creation of a public service campaign called # leanintogether
in a 30 - second video of nba and wnba all - stars , we see lebron james of the cleveland cavaliers holding up a poster , which says " dad
" dwayne wade of the miami heat says , " when men lean in , everyone wins , " and then touts how he leans in for his wife , mother and grandmother
the significance of the message and the men who are relaying it is twofold , says sandberg
sandberg at blogher : not every woman has to be a ceo " the conversation about equality has long existed by women , for women , in women 's forums where women are , and that will continue , and that 's important
but bringing it to the center of the court , bringing men to the center of that conversation -- people like lebron james and steph curry ( of the golden state warriors ) and dwayne wade , saying ' i 'm in for equality and here 's why ' -- i think that could be transformative , " said sandberg in a phone interview
what sandberg and leanin.org are also hoping to do is show men specifically what they can do , providing a series of tips about things they could start doing at home and at work , and as managers , as soon as they finish reading this story
many of the suggestions might seem like common sense to many women -- such as male managers giving women credit in meetings and men sharing 50 - 50 in household and child care duties at home
but sandberg says with the list of " simple , clear , everyday things , practical things " men can do that are based on real data , men will see not only how they can help but how they individually will benefit
for instance , research shows that boys and girls with a more involved father are healthier , mentally and physically , happier , have stronger emotional attachments and relationships , are at lower risk for substance abuse and are more successful at work and at home , sandberg said
for girls , there 's an extra benefit , she said
by age 14 , if a girl sees her father doing child care and housework , her concept of the array of things she can do professionally is much broader than that of girls who do n't see their fathers doing household chores , she said , pointing to a study by the university of british columbia and published in a journal of the association for psychological science
" the way men react when you tell them children of more active fathers of any income level , no matter how active a mother is , do better -- a lot of men , particularly those with wives who are home ( and who say ) ' i 'm covered
" another huge goal , sandberg says , is showing men they wo n't lose out in the workplace when there is more equality in the executive suites and in boardrooms
she mentioned a recent study by the international monetary fund , which found that if women were in the workforce at the same percentage as men in the america , our country 's gross domestic product would grow by 5 %
" work - life balance not just a women 's issue sandberg 's # leanintogether comes as emphasis seems to be growing on getting boys and men to think about gender equality
sandberg will be one of the opening night speakers at a four - day conference on engaging men and boys that begins thursday in new york
" sandberg says we need to recognize and support the new definitions of masculinity and hopes the message from stars like lebron james and dwayne wade goes a long way toward doing that
do you think nba stars like lebron jones and dwayne wade can help encourage men to ' lean in ' ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace ( @ kellywallacetv ) on twitter or cnn living on facebook .
