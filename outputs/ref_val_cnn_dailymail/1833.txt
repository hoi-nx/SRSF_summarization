hearts were the source of all of gary locke âs childhood dreams
the chance to play , captain and manage the club ensured that , for long enough , the love affair was requited
a year ago , though , a long - standing relationship hit the buffers with a rather dull thud
widely acclaimed for the way he led the club throughout administration and a season of near - certain relegation , the 39 - year - old awoke one day having to digest one of the game âs great truths : no one is indispensable
gary locke is currently manager at kilmarnock after leaving his post at hears last year gary locke chats with ryan stevenson last season brutally axed as ann budge and craig levein made way for neilson , gary locke licked his wounds before returning to kilmarnock , initially as assistant manager to allan johnston
neilson âs side romped to the championship title with seven games to spare to mute anyone still clinging to the notion that they were wrong to dispense with gary locke âs services
yet , in only losing one of seven games since taking the reins from johnson last month at rugby park , gary locke , in turn , has underscored his dug - out credentials and then some
would hearts have won the championship title with him still at the helm ? we shall never know
but , as he puts the finishing touches to a new long - term deal in east ayrshire this week , the growing feeling among observers is that his former employers were perhaps both right and wrong
â i do nât think i have proven a point to hearts , â gary locke insisted
â it is like any football club
â but my focus now is kilmarnock
â privately for gary locke , the irony of what âs gone on at tynecastle over the past year or so wo nât be so much painful as excruciating
gary locke insists his focus is on kilmarnock and wants to end the season strongly in the scottish premiership last season , boxed in by administration and a transfer embargo , he played the kids
some feared for the psychological impact it would have on them but gary locke knew what he was doing
might it be said that the club which binned gary locke now owe him a huge debt of thanks ? â you probably have to ask people at hearts , â he added
â a consummate professional all his days , gary locke âs dedication to kilmarnock is now absolute
gary locke says he is happy to see the youngsters come through in edinburgh after working with them last year â it will be strange going back , â he conceded
â i went back as a kilmarnock player and all i want now is for kilmarnock to win games
â but my only focus now is kilmarnock
it âs football , â gary locke insisted
the 39 - year - old manager admits it will be strange facing his former club hearts next season finally , without the yokes of administration and the intentions of new owners , gary locke is relishing the chance to lead the rugby park side unhindered
diplomacy prevented him talking openly of his desire to see boyd assume a playing / coaching role next term but it âs evidently part of gary locke âs plans
â the prospect of boyd returning to kilmarnock for a third spell will gladden the hearts of the rugby park faithful
the striker may have endured a poor season second time around at rangers but , at 31 , still has the capacity to ensure a return to his first club is a successful one
for gary locke , too , rugby park has largely been a very happy second home
and , after being cut - adrift by hearts last summer , it was kilmarnock that offered him a way back into the game
gary locke was speaking at a tesco bank football festival at rugby park â i played at kilmarnock for seven years and i know what they are capable of , â he added
â when i played here there were a lot of celtic and rangers strips about the town and now there are lots of kilmarnock ones so that âs encouraging in terms of the future
