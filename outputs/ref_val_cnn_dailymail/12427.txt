one - year - old viktoria lives almost entirely in the dark
she was born in donetsk , as the crisis in eastern ukraine was taking hold last year
it takes torchlight to see their faces : children , women , men and the elderly , sitting in a sea of filth
i hear a lot about the politics of the ukraine conflict : which leader has said what to whom , the provenance of arms , the big picture
behind the grand headlines , there are children in desperate need who are suffering now and who will continue to suffer the consequences of the crisis in years to come
around 1.7 million children are affected by the conflict in ukraine -- including more than a thousand who are seeking refuge in bomb shelters in donetsk
we made sure we prioritized the neediest children -- those in underground bomb shelters as well as those who are living with disabilities , who have been orphaned or who are affected by hiv
but this is not the sort of childhood one would imagine for 21st century ukraine
in a country where children are too often institutionalized , the ongoing crisis can only exacerbate the problem
social systems are collapsing and children are bearing the brunt
this area of ukraine had one of the highest level of hiv before the conflict began
elsewhere , we found children in detention in donetsk who had n't seen relatives in more than a year
in a center for children with disabilities , mothers told us they had no insulin for their diabetic sons and daughters
we have to help these children now , but also plan for when the fighting stops -- people will need new homes , and we 'll have to deal with unexploded ordnance and the terrible psychological damage on children , among other things
in december , unicef called for additional support of $ 32.4 million to scale up its humanitarian response to address the urgent needs of children and families in conflict - affected areas in ukraine
