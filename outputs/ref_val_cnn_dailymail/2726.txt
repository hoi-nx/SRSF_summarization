rating : this is going to be special , i tell myself as we pass medieval penshurst , lit up to dramatic effect , with the pretty village church glowing next to it
certainly , the leicester arms hotel , near tunbridge wells , had looked cheering on the website - a village pub given a good wash and brush up without losing its charm
not much good for a weekend of any sort : the leicester arms hotel is in tired and in real need of a makeover the whole place seems in the grip of a collective lethargy
i 'm not even given much in the way of a welcome
' do n't worry , this is n't rubbish , ' says the weary young woman who shows me to a room on the first floor above the kitchen extractor - even though only two other people are staying
the panelled bar , with its saddles on the walls , open fires ( not lit ) and exposed timber beams provide some atmosphere , but the best part is the dining room up a short flight of stairs , with its mish - mash of tables and chairs , some of which are lovely antique jobs
a mere three tables are occupied , but the wait between my indifferent first course ( two tiny bits of rolled - up smoked salmon and some avocado mousse ) and my main course ( sea bass in an overly rich sauce with gnocchi ) is unforgivable
' it 's a wednesday night , but feels like the butt end of a sunday
but calling this old boozer a hotel is a liberty too far
