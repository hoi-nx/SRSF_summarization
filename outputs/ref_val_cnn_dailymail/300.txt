a tennessee church is drawing criticism after it posted a message on its marquee which appeared to link satan and the lgbt community 's quest to secure equal rights
the tabernacle posted the controversial message , but took it down after experiencing some backlash
many people felt the sign was meant to offend individuals who identify as gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender , but the knoxville baptist tabernacle 's pastor said that was not the case
andy henry told wbir : ' it 's clearly a sign that was meant to offend a particular community - the lgbt community
' the sign was changed to read : ' glad you reading , did not intend to offend , we all need christ
it will have another message posted later this week , according to the pastor .
