the world 's oldest mummies buried more than 7,000 years ago in the arid desert of northern chile are being turned into black slime by climate change
scientists have found that growing humidity can cause an explosion of bacteria living on the preserved skin of the chinchorro mummies
the bacteria then feeds on the ancient skin , causing it to break down into a black slime
the preserved skin on the outside of chinchorro in arica , northern chile , have begun to rapidly degrade as bacteria and humid air is turning it into black slime , as can be seen in the photograph above researchers say that rising humidity levels in arica , chile , is putting the 120 chinchorro at the university of tarapacã¡ 's archaeological museum at risk
however , they warn that hundreds of other mummies buried just beneath the sandy surface in the valleys throughout the region are also under threat
while some of the earliest mummies found in the atacama desert desert appear to have been the result of natural preservation in the extremely dry conditions , around 5,000 bc , the chinchorro people began deliberately preserving their dead
' the chinchorro mummies are in some cases nearly 4,000 years older than those found preserved from ancient egypt
the chinchorro were a prehistoric people who lived in scattered communities and used fishing to help them survive on the desert coast of chile and peru
an estimated 282 mummies have now been recovered from the dry , sandy soil in the region , but scientists say there could be hundreds more buried there
the skin on the head of this chinchorro at the san miguel de azapa museum in arica , chile has begun to break down due to the damage being caused by bacteria growing as humidity in the area increases the mummies were found buried in the arid desert valleys around arica in northern chile , shown on the map it is this dry climate that has helped preserve the mummies for more than 7,000 years
scientists at the university of tarapacã¡ museum first noticed black slimy patches appearing on the preserved skin of the chinchorro mummies around ten years ago
as time has gone on they have degraded at ' an alarming rate ' as the preserved skin has broken down into a black slime
they found that bacteria normally found growing on the human skin appeared to become ' supercharged ' when placed on mummy skin in high humidity
some of the chinchorro , like the one above buried in a coffin made from reeds , show highly sophisticated preservation thousands of years before mummification began to be used in ancient egypt if humidity falls below this level , acidification could also damage the mummies
