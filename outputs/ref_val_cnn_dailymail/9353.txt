isis has taken a terrifying stranglehold on nigerian after militants boko haram pledged allegiance to the terror group
an audio recording believed to be from boko haram 's leader abubakar shekau said the jihadists , who have been waging a six - year military campaign in northern nigerian , were merging with isis
the message means that isis now has a foothold in nigerian , as well as controlling swathes of iraq and syria and parts of egypt and libya
this month boko haram released a highly - edited video appearing to show it beheading two men in a similar fashion to the sickening footage released by isis
rita katz , from terrorism monitor site intelligence group , said : ' boko haram is now being elevated from a local jihadi group to an important arm of the islamic state
' the move now means isis controls parts of nigerian , iraq , syria , egypt and libya - where the terrorists paraded police cars sporting black flags through the streets of benghazi last month chilling : the broadcast pledged allegiance to abu bakr al-baghdadi , the leader of isis barbarity : eight men were found hanging from their feet in the iraq city of hawija in the isis latest public display of death earlier today earlier today , four bomb blasts killed at least 50 people in the north eastern nigerian city of maiduguri in the worst attacks there since boko haram militants tried to seize the town in two major assaults earlier this year
