the bodies of mr darren sykes and paul were found in the loft and jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder - but died five days later in hospital from burns

he picked up his sons on the evening of october 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft , he set the fire
