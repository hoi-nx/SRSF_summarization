' reassuring them that they will keep their jobs even though clarkson lost his he said : ' for those of you who still rely on it for work , do n't worry , because the bbc will make sure the show continues
' our stint as guardians of top gear was a good one , but we were only part of the show 's history , not the whole of it
the email was leaked by a bbc member of staff yesterday , which led to mr wilman denying he had quit the corporation
it appears he is a member of bbc staff whereas clarkson , james and richard are self - employed on freelance contracts
final time ? james , richard and clarkson on set in the final episode shown before the presenter lost his job new wheels : clarkson was seen taking delivery of a black mercedes car at his flat yesterday as he prepares for life after the bbc top gear presenter james has been spotted at the bbc where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director alan yentob - who may be in charge of trying to keep may and richard as the corporation confirmed mr wilman is still a member of staff he said : ' the email i wrote yesterday was not a resignation statement , and nor was it meant for public consumption
' i do n't get this modern obsession with sharing , linking , forwarding , re-tweeting ; whatever happened to a private moment ? wilman , top gear âs longstanding executive producer , has known mr clarkson since they were children , when they both attended the Â£ 10,500 - a - term repton in derby
the two men have been inseparable for years , and bbc executives put trust in mr wilman to keep mr clarkson in check , following a string of scandals
the production company set up by clarkson and top gear executive wilman , right , was formed for next to nothing in october 2006 and has now made them millions
the pair went to the same prestigious private school in repton , derbyshire , where they were two years apart , before working together on various tv projects including top gear
there is speculation about where the name bedder 6 comes from , and it is believed it is a pun on ' better sex ' - a reference to an in - joke about one of the dormitories at wilman and clarkson 's former school
' mr wilman has been a regular visitor to his friend clarkson since his sacking a week ago , and was last seen leaving his west london flat in his mercedes sports car on friday
the previous day he had met with clarkson and top gear co-star james for lunch , presumably to discuss the scandal and what the team would do next
last wednesday , on the day the presenter 's sacking was announced mr wilman was again at clarkson 's flat , this time with the star 's girlfriend phillipa sage , james was yesterday spotted at the bbc where he is believed to have been in talks with creative director alan yentob
he also told the media show that it was ' perfectly natural ' for the pair to have reservations about continuing top gear without clarkson
' he added : ' the question of what happens next for top gear is a conversation which must go on between the controller of bbc2 kim shillinglaw , between wilman ( wilman - producer of top gear ) and the team
' sources have told mailonline that itv are prepared to offer him Â£ 10million to sign for the trio , with clarkson 's executive producer and schoolfriend wilman having reportedly met with them
netflix are also said to be keen to sign them up for an exclusive online , worldwide series that could make them substantially more money
what you all ended up making was one of the most iconic programmes in tv history , a show about cars that went global , won countless awards , was devoured by non car fans and ended up in the guinness book of records
our stint as guardians of top gear was a good one , but we were only part of the show 's history , not the whole of it
anyway , when you 're feeling low in your working day at any point , look around at some of the c * * * on tv , then have a think about top gear , 2002 - 2015 , and say to yourself : ' i made that
