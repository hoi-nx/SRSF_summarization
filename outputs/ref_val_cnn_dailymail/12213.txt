in the midst of all the shouting over indiana 's new religious - freedom law , which many fear will lead to increased discrimination against lgbt people , culture warriors marked the grim anniversary of another conservative " victory , " one that left more than 10,000 needy children without their pledged financial support
it all started when world vision , a humanitarian organization i had long supported and promoted , announced a change to its hiring policy allowing people in same - sex marriages to work in its american offices
in addition , funding for schools , hospitals , water projects , and medical care was threatened as churches vowed to cut off support to an organization that hired lgbt people
using wells and hospitals and child sponsorships as bargaining chips in the culture wars had actually worked
many conservative evangelicals count the world vision reversal as a major victory in the culture wars
but as i survey the battlefield a year later , i ca n't help but wonder if even the most strident culture warriors would consider the world vision campaign worth its many casualties
then there are the many gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender people , ( especially christians caught in the middle ) , for whom the campaign represented yet another blow to their humanity
this is the tragic irony of the culture wars : the casualties tend to be the very people jesus went out of his way to serve : the poor , the sick , the marginalized , the outcasts , the people ostracized and deemed " sinners " by the religious elite
and when the world sees christians hurting rather than helping such people , in the name of political gain , our testimony is profoundly diminished
we have lost the way of jesus when we are more committed to self - preservation than service , more occupied with waging war than washing feet
in all likelihood , indiana 's religious - freedom law will not directly affect many people
but the conversation that has surrounded it , in which discrimination against lgbt people has been characterized as a " deeply held religious belief , " will have far more lasting effects , not unlike the effects of the campaign against world vision
so to the culture warriors , i plead : before you wage the next campaign , assess the potential collateral damage and ask yourself if it 's worth it
