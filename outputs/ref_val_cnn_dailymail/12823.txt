marine biologists at the south carolina aquarium are treating a rare , 475 - pound leatherback sea turtle that washed up saturday on a nearby beach
the episode marks the first rescue of a leatherback sea turtle in south carolina and is believed to be only the fifth live rescue of this species in the united states , according to the department of natural resources
staffers with the aquarium 's sea turtle rescue program gave it antibiotics , vitamins and some time to recover at their facilities
for that reason , aquarium staffers are working with the state 's department of natural resources to determine the best place and time to release the turtle back into the ocean -- most likely within the next few days
