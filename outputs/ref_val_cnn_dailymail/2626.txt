it may only be a throwaway line in a recent patent , but apple has further hinted at plans for a range of electric cars
in the patent , called ' power management for inductive charging systems ' , apple details a system of wirelessly charging ' portable electronic devices
' and within the list of examples , alongside phones and tablets , is reference to ' electric vehicles '
in the patent , ' power management for inductive charging systems ' , apple details a system of wirelessly charging ( illustrated ) ' portable electronic devices
' and within the list of examples alongside phones and tablets is reference to ' electric vehicles '
this is the only mention of cars in the patent this is the only mention of cars in the patent and it could simply be that apple is hoping its charging technology works with various types of devices
but it follows weeks of rumours that the firm is developing a fleet of either electric of self - driving vehicles
' many electronic devices include one or more rechargeable batteries that require external power to recharge from time to time , said apple in the patent
' apple added that charging cords are unsafe in certain circumstances including when ' a driver of a vehicle may become distracted attempting to plug an electronic device into a vehicle charger
' apple 's watch is fitted with a form of inductive charging , for example , but the patent takes this technology a step further
recent reports claimed apple has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab. speculation was rife last month when an apple - owned car was spotted driving around california fitted with street view - style cameras
if apple was developing such technology , it would would rival google 's self - driving cars

the mention of electric vehicles could simply be reference to the fact apple is hoping its technology works with various devices
but it follows weeks of rumours about an apple range of electric self - driving cars chris urmson added the cars would still be test vehicles , and google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians
further cars were spotted in florida and hawaii if apple was developing such technology , it would would rival google 's self - driving cars ( pictured )
