a gang that allegedly specialized in organized , armed and violent crime that were often referred to as ' joloperros '-spanish for ' stick - up guys ' - will finally go to trial this summer for their role in the elaborate kidnapping and assault of two men in boston
the fbi says the ' veloz crew ' - headed by veloz , who is known as ' the maestro ' - went to elaborate lengths to kidnap a man they believed to be a major dealer of homemade percocet pills , which deliver a heroin - like high
the plot was one of many underground kidnappings that police say targeted dealers in order to obtain large ransoms of cash or drugs , believing that going after criminals reduced the risk of involving authorities
the joloperros tagged the victim 's car with a gps tracker and monitored his movements for months on a big - screen tv inside veloz 's house , the boston herald reported
on july 12 , 2012 , they were ready to pounce
the gang had a kidnap bag full of police shirts , skeleton masks and guns
scene : the tracking devices would call veloz 's cell phone once the cars started moving , and the maestro would track the cars from a television in the living room of his lawrence home ( pictured ) however the victim was lucky enough to escape through a bathroom window and found his way to a neighbor 's house for help
police in boston have been focusing on this case and others like for over two years
