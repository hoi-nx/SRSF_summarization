collapsed roofs , mangled cages and sunken floors - these are the eerie pictures taken inside an abandoned psychiatric hospital where patients were once locked up and given lobotomies
the abandoned site in north north wales , known as denbigh asylum , has been partially devastated by fire while there are still cages intact that were used to prevent patients escaping from their designated areas
more than 20 patients were selected for prefrontal lobotomy treatments between 1942 and 1944 at the hospital , with one patient dying from the controversial procedure
photographer mathew growcoot described the scene : ' it was by far the creepiest place i have ever been into
mr mathew growcoot added : ' it was in a really poor state
