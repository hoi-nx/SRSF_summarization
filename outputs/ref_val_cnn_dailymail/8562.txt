a bright red miniature statue of marx given to a britain city to commemorate his 195th birthday has been relegated to a back garden because a conservative - run council does n't want it on display
the four - foot tall , plastic sculpture of the communist revolutionary , was presented to gloucester council by dignitaries from his birthplace of trier , germany - which is twinned with the city
trier made 500 of the statues which were placed across the city , and one was donated to gloucester in order to symbolise marx 's journey across europe , because the cities are twinned
charles yates , a member of gloslinks , which maintains the link between gloucester and twinned trier , has instead given the statue a home in his back garden
it deserves a home somewhere in gloucester
' this whole thing started because the germany people asked us what we had done with it
' it is all very well everyone making decisions about the statue but they have n't actually seen it yet

transported to britain on the eurostar , the journey was meant to mimic the way marx drifted across europe
born in trier in 1818 , marx moved to berlin to study law before travelling to paris , where he became a revolutionary communist
despite marx 's significance and political standing , the conservative leader of the council does not believe it should be placed anywhere important
leader of gloucester city council paul james said : ' we value our twinning links so i 'm pleased we 've been able to find somewhere to put trier 's kind gift
