a couple that made headlines around the world when their baby son allegedly spontaneously burst into flames four times are back in the news after their second newborn baby son also caught fire
in the first incident in 2013 the couple 's first baby , rahul , ended up in the intensive care ward at a hospital in south - eastern india 's viluppuram district , in the tamil nadu state , after neighbours had heard him screaming , and rushed into the house from outside to discover the child on fire in his cot
his mother , who was working in the fields , took him to hospital and since then he has caught fire another three times , she claimed
india mother rajeshwari karnan claimed that her 10 - day - old baby son ( pictured ) spontaneously combusted medics at the government kilpauk hospital said that the boy had about 10 per cent burn damage to his feet one of the first serious accounts of it appeared in the august journal philosophical transactions of the royal society in 1745 , which recorded how a 62 - year - old italian countess had gone to bed one night feeling â dull and heavy â
the next morning , all that was found in her bedroom was a pile of ash and her legs
the explanation that alcohol was to blame quickly caught on , especially among moralists who were against the hard stuff
in 1832 , a popular victorian magazine claimed all those who suddenly burst into flames were â habitually drunken â
british research biologist ford argued in two articles , one of which appeared in the new scientist , that spontaneous human combustion may be caused by a chemical called acetone that is produced naturally in the body , the chemical often used as a solvent in nail - varnish removers
professor ford has noted that many of the people who have combusted spontaneously were unwell at the time , and as a result , may have developed a condition called ketosis , in which acetone in the body increases
ketosis can have a range of causes , including alcoholism , diabetes , a high - fat diet , and even , in babies , teething
unable to find a human volunteer to test his theory that a build - up of acetone causes spontaneous human combustion , professor ford made a model from pieces of pork - the animal flesh that most closely approximates ours
the child , not named , was rushed into the government kilpauk hospital by his mother , rajeshwari karnan , who claimed that her son 's feet had spontaneously combusted while she was in the bath and that she had managed to beat out the flames before rushing him to hospital
medics said that the boy had about 10 per cent burn damage to his feet in an incident that happened when he was 10 - days - old
rajeswari said she had heard him screaming and found his feet on fire in a repeat incident that mirrored the ' spontaneous combustion ' of his older brother
after over a month in neonatal intensive care unit , the burns have healed and the baby is now fit for discharge , according to hospital dean narayana babu
' however medics are still reluctant to hand the child over for fears that one of the parents , they suspect the mother , is suffering from the munchausen by proxy syndrome in which a parent seeks to harm their child in order to get attention
' spokesperson for tulir - the centre for the prevention and healing of child sexual abuse-vidya reddy said : ' from all that i have read , it definitely seems like the mother has this syndrome
at the time speculation had circulated around the world that baby rahul was a victim of spontaneous human combustion
professor ford has noted that many of the people who have combusted spontaneously were unwell at the time , and as a result , may have developed a condition called ketosis , in which acetone in the body increases
rajeshwari karnan ( pictured ) has dismissed claims that she is attention - seeking by harming her babies ketosis can have a range of causes , including alcoholism , diabetes , a high - fat diet , and even , in babies , teething
in the case of baby rahul , doctors found average levels of acetone
but many believed the parents and a large amount of money was raised to help them after they were forced out of their village with locals fearing that the baby might start a major fire
