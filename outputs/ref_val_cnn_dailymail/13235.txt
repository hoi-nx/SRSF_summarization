there is only one likely outcome for baghdad 's current military offensive to reclaim tikrit : defeat for isis
however , the task at hand has been made easier for baghdad given that most civilians in tikrit have already fled -- both to kurdistan in the north as well as south to baghdad -- leaving behind mostly isis jihadists who defend the city , according to iraq constitutional specialist zaid al-ali , who is from the city
another crucial element for the success of this battle will be the varied make - up of the groups involved in the fight
the joint iraq forces fighting to retake tikrit include iraq troops , members of the mainly shia paramilitary force , members of the sunni sons of salahuddin brigades , and other sunni tribal fighters
general qasim suleimani , the commander of the iranian revolutionary guard quds force , who has played a key role in the fight against isis , was reported to be near tikrit just hours after the military campaign was officially launched
iran provides military advice , support and weapons not just through the central government in baghdad but also directly to a number of increasingly powerful shia militia groups that now operate under the state - sponsored paramilitary committee , the hashd al-shabi , known as the " popular mobilization units
the battle is an especially emotional one for the shia soldiers and fighters as tikrit is the site of the camp speicher massacre last june , where 1,700 shia soldiers were captured , separated from their sunni comrades and then summarily executed in an atrocity that was documented by isis as a powerful propaganda film
however , it is encouraging that both shia and sunni fighters are supporting the army in its effort to defeat isis
the cooperation between shia and sunni fighters will be crucial not just in the ongoing offensive in tikrit but will also set the stage for further cooperation in the strategic campaign to recapture mosul
politically , these groups may not see eye - to - eye and of course there remain deep ethno - sectarian tensions in iraq and beyond , but regardless of these differences they all view isis as a common threat and enemy that must be defeated
