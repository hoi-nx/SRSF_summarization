he regularly goes head to head with the top defensive players in the nfl and does his best to keep quarterback joe flacco out of harm 's way
but besides his endeavors on the field , urschel also keeps up another demanding pursuit that is rarely associated with nfl players : mathematical research
" i have a bachelor 's and master 's in mathematics , all with a 4.0 , and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals , " urschel wrote in a recent article for tribune
" you are my goddamn hero ( football fan and aspiring complex / functional analyst here ) , " tweeted roy cardenas , who describes himself as a math ph.d. student
but urschel acknowledges that he has faced questions from nfl officials , journalists , fans and fellow mathematicians about why he runs the risk of potential brain injury from playing football when he has " a bright career ahead of me in mathematics
" after every season , he says in the players ' tribune article , his mother tries to discourage him from continuing to play football
" i play because i love the game
i love hitting people , " he writes
" there 's a rush you get when you go out on the field , lay everything on the line and physically dominate the player across from you
