the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , which is the largest sponsor of boy scout troops in the u.s. , says the church has strong measures in place to prevent the sexual abuse of scouts , as claims have been made it has n't done enough
in the first interview about allegations of abuse in mormon church - sponsored scouting troops , clayton told cnn that the church is at the forefront for prevention of child abuse
" we feel like there is really no other organization that we know of -- a church or something like a church -- that does as much as we do , " clayton said
" we have a zero tolerance policy or position with respect to child abuse , and we train our people , we teach our people , we work with leaders , we provide materials online and in hard copy
" over several months , cnn examined allegations of abuse that were detailed in at least five lawsuits filed against the church and the scouts
but clayton said the church today is proactive , even constructing its buildings " in such a way as to try to avoid any situation where child abuse could occur
" " for instance , if you walk down the hallway in an church of jesus christ of latter-day saints chapel , a mormon church , and look at the sunday school classes , you 're going to see windows in the doorways into those sunday school classes so people can look inside and walk by , " he said
the interview with clayton followed a cnn investigation into the case of novak , who was sexually abused by his scoutmaster , a member of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , beginning when he was 14 years old in 1998 , according to the lawsuit novak filed against the church and the boy scouts of america
" the documents , which were made public in 2012 , are lists of scout leaders suspected of sexual abuse or homosexual activity
" bishop moyer , who is now retired , declined to speak to cnn
" this case is probably the most egregious of all of the cases against the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints church , and the reason i say that is because the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints church knew that hein , this pedophile , was already kicked out of scouting by the boy scouts of america , " rothweiler said
however , church attorney pittinsky said it was the boy scouts of america organization that should have done something
" if the boy scouts of america had disclosed to bishop moyer the information they had in their files , there is no way that hein would have ever become a scoutmaster , and he would have been subject to excommunication by the church , " pittinsky said
in a statement to cnn , the boy scouts of america said hein was removed from scouting " for reasons unrelated to child abuse
all but one of the five lawsuits filed against the church and boy scouts of america have been settled
