washington cruz is back in his favorite place : the spotlight
cruz must make inroads with wide swaths of the republican if he hopes to break through as a top - tier candidate
even evangelicals , cruz 's target audience during his launch speech at liberty , are n't firmly in his column
the firebrand 's decision to jump - start the 2016 election season now is an implicit admission of the daunting challenges he will face in a crowded republican field where multiple republican will vie for the same social and evangelical support base
" cruz is clearly a player , " said perkins , president of the family research council , a christian public policy ministry
" by choosing liberty in virginia , which was founded by fundamentalist preacher jerry falwell , to roll out his long shot campaign , cruz made clear he wo n't cede the christian right to another candidate
" from the dawn of this country , at every stage , american has enjoyed god 's providential blessing , " said cruz , roaming the stage with a microphone like a megachurch preacher on a sunday morning
" liberty offered cruz a ready - made crowd : young evangelicals in a vast auditorium who had little choice but to pack the stands , because the announcement came during their compulsory weekly convocation
this is exactly the kind of coalition of youthful christian idealists cruz must win over and get to work in early voting states if his presidential hopes are to catch fire
but cruz wo n't have this political territory all to himself
meanwhile , scott walker , with his governing record and history of facing down a recall and trade unions , seems to have eclipsed cruz in the minds of many conservatives who are desperate to take back the white house
" that 's what i think is dominating cruz -- he has not made as many headlines as in 2013 , as when he tried to stop and defund obamacare
" cruz must also face off against paul , former arkansas gov. huckabee , former pennsylvania sen. santorum and dr. ben carson to win evangelicals -- a tough task
meanwhile , a cnn / orc international poll last week put cruz as the choice of 4 % of likely republican voters
so if he seems unlikely to win , why would cruz get in -- and so early ? paradoxically , the size of the task facing cruz and the tempered expectations for his bid may also mean that the risks that often weigh against a presidential candidacy -- the potential damage to a political career that can be caused by a poorly run campaign -- may not apply
" but should he fall short in his 2016 bid , a successful campaign that positions cruz as the leader of the evangelical right would certainly boost his political brand and position him for a future presidential run
the state is going to be crucial for cruz 's hopes because it is the most fertile early voting territory for his chosen campaign path
a win in the first - in - the - nation caucus could crown cruz as the undisputed champion of the social and evangelical conservative wing of the party
cruz , unlike some other potential republican candidates , may have to work extra hard to raise the campaign funds he needs to mount a viable campaign
