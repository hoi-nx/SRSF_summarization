around 30 people gathered in san francisco on saturday to take part in the sixth annual world naked bike ride by pedaling through city streets completely in the nude
protest : the riders were gathered to protest world dependence on oil cartels , they said solidarity : according to their facebook page , the group rode in solidarity with brazil , australia , new zealand and other cities across the southern hemisphere ' we want to endorse more bike riding and our nudity expresses our vulnerability to these matters
that appeared to have remained the case with saturday 's ride
however , the same was n't true for a group of pro-nudity protesters last month when a demonstration in the castro district was called to mark the second anniversary of the city law , which bans public nudity except at events whose sponsors obtain permits
