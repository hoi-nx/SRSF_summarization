united states are getting older , but not this old : social security records show that 6.5 million people in the united states have reached the ripe old age of 112
but social security does not have death records for millions of these people , with the oldest born in 1869 , according to a report by the agency 's inspector general
only 13 of the people are still getting social security benefits , the report said
but for others , their social security numbers are still active , so a number could be used to report wages , open bank accounts , obtain credit cards or claim fraudulent tax refunds
' that is a real problem , ' said sen. ron johnson , r-wis. ripe old age : social security has not updated the deaths of 6.5 million people , new data has shown , meaning all those social security numbers remain active
she is the oldest known person in the united states ' when you have a fake social security number , that 's what allows you to fraudulently do all kinds things , claim things like the earned income tax credit or other tax benefits
' ron johnson is chairman of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs , which plans a hearing monday on problems with death records maintained by the social security administration
the agency said it is working to improve the accuracy of its death records
but it would be costly and time - consuming to update 6.5 million files that were generated decades ago , when the agency used paper records , said brune , a senior adviser to the agency 's deputy commissioner for budget , finance , quality and management
the internal watchdog 's report does not document any fraudulent or improper payments to people using these social security numbers
for example , nearly 67,000 of the social security numbers were used to report more than $ 3 billion in wages , tips and self - employment income from 2006 to 2011 , according to the report
people in the country illegally often use fake or stolen social security numbers to get jobs and report wages , as do other people who do not want to be found by the government
thieves use stolen social security numbers to claim fraudulent tax refunds
the irs estimated it paid out $ 5.8 billion in fraudulent tax refunds in 2013 because of identity theft
problem : social security does not have death records for millions of people with birth dates stretching back as far as 1869
seen here is president franklin d. roosevelt signing the social security bill on august 13 , 1935 ' the plan is frighteningly simple â steal social security numbers , file tax returns showing a false refund claim , and then have the refunds electronically deposited or sent to an address where the offender can access the refund checks , ' said acting assistant attorney general caroline ciraolo
but none of the 6.5 million people cited by the inspector general 's report was on the list
brune noted that the inspector general 's report did not verify that any of the 6.5 million people are actually dead
