clegg today challenged the tories come clean about where the axe will fall , just 24 hours after the coalition ended
the lib dems leader accused cameron and osborne of ' trying to pull the wool over your eyes ' by promising to protect the nhs without spelling out how he will pay for it
he said that only the lib dems have promised to find the Â£ 8billion which nhs chiefs say will be needed by 2020 , and how the money will be found
lib dems leader clegg , who tried his hand at making pancakes at a panasonic manufacturing site in cardiff , took aim at chancellor osborne , who spent the day making making dough at a pizza express in hove simon stevens , the head of nhs england , has warned that by the end of the decade the health service will need an extra Â£ 8billion - a - year
mr clegg boasted that he would ensure the nhs got the money , but he said labour had not made that pledge and the tories ' try to give the impression they have , but they have n't '
' so , osborne , jeremy hunt - where will the axe fall ? soldiers , schools social workers ? the only people the tories have said they will protect are their friends in big business and in big houses
' the conservatives are trying to pull the wool over your eyes by not telling you how they will give the nhs the resources it needs
' mr osborne was visiting hove on the south coast as a row raged over spending cuts planned after the election the tories have promised to give the nhs the money it needs , but the lib dems say they have not been clear about where the money will come from mr clegg added : ' the dividing lines of this election are becoming clearer by the day
' the lib dems were the first to publicly commit to providing ' in full ' the extra Â£ 8 billion a year the nhs boss says it needs by 2020
mr clegg used a press conference at the national liberal club to claim only the lib dems have spelt out how to fund Â£ 8billion extra for the nhs mr clegg said the lib dems would be ' pretty specific ' about exactly where the party 's preferred tax rises would hit by the time voters go to the polls the lib dems today pledged an extra Â£ 2.5billion for mental health care to end ' decades of institutionalised discrimination ' in the nhs
a commitment to boost funding for health , with a particular focus on mental health , will be on the front page of the lib dems election manifesto , indicating it will be a key priority in any coalition talks after the general election
felicity dormon , senior policy fellow at the health foundation charity , said well - targeted extra funding for mental health could improve the quality of nhs care but questioned what other areas of health would lose cash as a result
' mr clegg went on : ' ed miliband , cameron , it 's time to come clean : will you or will you not give the nhs the Â£ 8 billion a year by 2020 that it needs and tell us how you plan to fund it ? ' the lib dems have
