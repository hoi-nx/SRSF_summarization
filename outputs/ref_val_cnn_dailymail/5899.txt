a team of norwegian researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully - functioning anus , while other only have ' transient ' ones
the study also reveals how some creatures , such as the penis worm , have very similar digestive systems to humans , even though they are very different species
the study , published in the journal zoologischer anzeiger , identified genes known as brachyury and parahox , that are crucial to the development of an anus
according to a report by matt walker at the bbc , their study reveals how the anus is perhaps one of the most important organs in our body , helping our digestive system work
animals that do have an anus , however , often grow to be larger , more sophisticated creatures
a team of norwegian researchers has identified two sets of genes that cause some creatures to have a fully - functioning anus , while other only have ' transient ' ones in 2013 , researchers discovered that one of our earliest ancestors was a worm with no anus
the latest study builds on earlier research which looked at the genes expressed during the development of intestines , stomach and anus in the penis worm
what surprised the researchers was not just that the development was the same in the worms as in humans , fish and frogs , but that exactly the same genes were involved in the process
