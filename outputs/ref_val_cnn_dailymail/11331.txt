against building regulations : the main cathedral in san francisco has been ordered to take down a sprinkler system used to deter homeless from sleeping in its porchways discreet : the hoses outside the front of saint mary of the assumption were apparently installed two years ago without necessary planning permission jennifer friedenbach , executive director of the coalition on homeless , added that the time - triggered mechanisms were ' certainly not formed on the basis of catholic teachings
' however , the church defended the sprinkler idea stating that it was n't safe having homeless people and drug addicts lurking when families were visiting
' wrong move : some branded the sprayers - which used hundreds of gallons of water every night - ' shocking ' , ' rude ' , ' inhumane ' and a ' waste of resources ' roughing it : a homeless man named michael revealed that some people were not deterred by the water and merely ventured out with umbrellas lyford claimed he did not know about the sprinkler system until it was brought to his attention but another church staff member said the spouts were installed over a year ago
the church has 15 days to comply and remove the system
bishop william justice , the rector of saint mary 's cathedral , issued a statement apologizing for any upset the church 's homeless deterrent had caused
justice said since the archdiocese has learned the system may violate the city âs water - use laws , work to remove it would be ' completed by the end of the day ' .
