families are to foot the bill for sky âs decision to pay Â£ 4.2billion for english premier league football rights after the firm sneaked out an inflation - busting price rise on budget day
the firm is putting up the price of its family bundle of channels by nine per cent or Â£ 3 a month to Â£ 36 , or Â£ 432 a year
the bundle does not even include its sports channels , which means those who have no interest in football are subsidising sky âs deal to show english premier league games
critics say the price rises appear to be an attempt to recoup the huge sum that will be paid to super rich clubs like manchester u , chelsea and man city
sky paid Â£ 4.2 billion to show 126 live english premier league matches a season from 2016 to 2019
analysts suggested the tv giant overpaid for the football rights in order to fend off competition from bt and others , however it is clear that the pain is now being passed to viewers , whether they like sport or not
at the time jeremy darroch , sky âs chief executive , said the bill would largely be financed by cost cuts , however , he hinted that price rises would be necessary
sky suggested its customers would not have to foot the bill for the record english premier league tv deal this graphic charts the significant rise of domestic english premier league tv revenue from 1992 until 2019 the timing of the announcement appears designed to limit media coverage
normally , sky would announce any price rise in september , however making the announcement then would have coincided with its loss of the tv rights for the champions league to bt

â critics claim the price rises mean viewers will be funding the ferraris , lamborghinis and Â£ 200,000 a week contracts of the likes of manchester u 's wayne rooney ( left ) and man city 's yaya toure ( right ) eden hazard ( left ) and manchester u 's falcao ( right ) are among the other highest paid english premier league players another , wrote : â if only game of thrones was available elsewhere i could cancel ...
he wrote : â so wait , they âre increasing their prices to cover english premier league costs , yet the sports package is the one that âs increasing least ? way to show your audience who âs important ! â another said : â i think it âs time i dump my sky subscription
â virgin media has complained to the tv regulator ofcom about the way english premier league rights are sold to broadcasters , claiming it leads to expensive subscriptions which do not even provide live coverage of every game
if action is not taken to change the way the english premier league sells tv rights , the rapidly rising cost of watching football at home will see even more people priced out of the national sport
