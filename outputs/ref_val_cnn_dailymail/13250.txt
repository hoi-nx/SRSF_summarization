but china 's great firewall -- a massive internet surveillance and content control system -- has , in many respects , been an unparalleled success
china has internet companies worth billions of dollars and more web users than the population of the u.s. -- all while still being able to block information it deems counter to its interests
" if you are sitting in beijing , what 's the problem ? " asks bishop , china watcher and author of the china newsletter in the latest episode of " on china
" " you are still in power , you have 650 million internet users , you have billions of dollars of economic value going to the internet everyday , you 've used the internet to increase government transparency , investors love us and they ca n't throw enough money at our companies that have more than half a trillion dollars in market capitalization , " says bishop
soon after china tip - toed onto the internet in the late 1980s , it laid down the foundation of the great firewall but critics asserted that an internet with chinese characteristics would be no internet at all
a year later , then - u.s. president bill clinton announced that " liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem " and that any attempt to control the internet in china would be " like trying to nail jell-o to the wall
" currently home to the world 's largest internet market , china is also home to some of the world 's most valuable internet companies including e-commerce giant alibaba and tencent , now estimated to be worth $ 66.1 billion
the ban on western social media sites like youtube and facebook has also given home court advantage to china 's own internet stars like youku and wechat
and contrary to negroponte 's declaration , respecting the strict rules that govern china 's internet has not gotten in the way of innovation as chinese tech developers reinterpret existing business models and build out new mobile apps
last week , the chinese and english news websites of reuters news agency became inaccessible in china , joining a number of foreign media destinations that are barred online in china
' " and that " father " would be lu wei , the so - called internet czar of china who was recently photographed smiling at zuckerberg 's desk during a visit at facebook 's headquarters in california
" lu wei is really pushing this ' internet sovereignty ' model , where we can control the information , we can control the internet within our borders and we will use our model , " says rife , the east asia research director of amnesty international
" amnesty international fears the great firewall could become the next great export from china
" it would be a very attractive model for instance for russia , for egypt , or for other states , " rife says
" it would be obviously in china 's interest for other people and other nation states to agree with them and their interpretation of internet sovereignty
so would global internet users rise up against a facebook that censors its posts and monitors its users to comply with local laws in china ? it 's unlikely , says bishop
that is precisely china 's vision of how the internet should be .
