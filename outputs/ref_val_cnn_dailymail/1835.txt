sir green , pictured with his daughter chloe , has sold the loss - making bhs department chain for just Â£ 1 to a little - known investment firm retail tycoon sir green has sold struggling bhs for just one pound â a fraction of the Â£ 200million he paid for it almost 15 years ago
it was bought yesterday by a little - known investment firm called retail acquisitions , raising fears for the jobs of 11,000 staff in 171 bhs stores across the country
when asked if their roles were safe , sir green said : â i âm a retailer , not a clairvoyant
â the entrepreneur bought the chain in 2000 when it was called bhs
but this failed to kick - start growth , and bhs continued to lose customers to cheaper rivals such as ikea , as well as more upmarket competitors including john lewis
sir green said the chain made a cash loss of Â£ 45million last year
the businessman said he had not been able to give bhs as much attention as he would have liked because of the other brands he owns
it is a challenging marketplace and bhs is in the middle of the market at a time when everyone is discounting
sir green put bhs up for sale in january
he refused to confirm the sale price yesterday , but this was widely reported as being Â£ 1
â i âm a retailer , not a clairvoyant
â fears have been expressed over the job security of more than 11,000 staff employed by bhs retail acquisitions is a new business set up by five directors with little experience in the sector
â we are convinced that with strategic and focused support we will return bhs to profitability and safeguard the workforce
