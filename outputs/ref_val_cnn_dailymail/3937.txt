the us presbyterian church has voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples after a decades long debate
its revised constitution will now read that marriage is ' a unique commitment between two people , traditionally a man and a woman , ' as opposed to just a man and woman previously
' the new language , which was approved by the church 's general assembly last year , had to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies
the church has in fact been losing some of its members as it adopts a more liberal stance on social and religious issues
at last year 's general assembly , the church also gave its pastors a green light to marry gay and lesbian couples in states where such marriages are allowed
