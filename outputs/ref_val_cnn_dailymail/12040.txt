but the then prime minister was about to go into a meeting with yugoslavia president slobodan milosevic in a bid to bring an end to the raging war in kosovo and could not speak
as a result , sir alex ferguson admitted defeat and united ended up going to fifa 's inaugural club world championship in brazil in an attempt to boost the fa cup 's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to win the right to host the 2006 world cup , and pulling out of a competition they had won a year previously

' but both sir alex ferguson and then chairman martin edwards were under incredible pressure from tony banks , the prime minister 's envoy for the world cup bid , and from david davies , the fa cup 's acting chief executive to pull out of the fa cup and go to brazil for the fifa tournament
' it involved moving some of the fixtures to earlier in the season and creating a gap before united were due to go in january during which , if the fa cup would move the tie , they could play their third round cup match
