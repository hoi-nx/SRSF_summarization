the 30 - year - old daughter of formula one billionaire bernie ecclestone and her husband , jay rutland , have just returned from a holiday in italy to celebrate his birthday
before their next holiday , they had the small matter of celebrating daughter sophia âs first birthday this week â and tamara ecclestone was determined it was an event that would never be forgotten
not by sophia , who is too young to have a coherent thought running through her gorgeous little head
but by everyone else who goggled at the Â£ 70,000 or so spent on turning the front courtyard of their london home into sophia âs very own petting zoo , complete with puppies , shetland ponies and a baby zebra
a rather glum - looking zebra , to be honest , but in terms of competitive party - throwing , the little critter certainly earned his stripes
in pride of place was a rather garish gazebo made entirely of pink balloons with sophia âs initials picked out in white
as well as a petting zoo with puppies , shetland ponies and a baby zebra , sophie was also lucky enough to have a decadent princess palace created out of pink and white balloons if you have ever wondered what a doctor would see while performing liver surgery on mr , wonder no more
tamara ecclestone also posted photographs on social media of sophia enjoying her birthday breakfast in her couture pyjamas , surrounded by giant soft toys and a whispering forest of helium balloons
what and who was all this lavish fuss for ? certainly not for the child , who would have been as puzzled as the zebra about what was going on
that âs not to say tamara ecclestone is not a lovely mother
and you do nât have to look far to see where tamara ecclestone found inspiration for her sumptuous birthday party
not only was sophia treated to a fancy birthday breakfast in couture pyjamas but she even had a real zebra attend her first birthday party elsewhere , jay-z and beyonce gave their daughter blue ivy a horse for her second birthday
for daughter harper âs first birthday , they bought her damien hurst âs daddy âs girl painting costing Â£ 600,000
the beckham children , particularly little harper , always look like they have stepped off a kiddie milan catwalk â but what else are rich , fashion - conscious millionaire parents going to spend their money on ? at least they are beautifully turned out â and genuinely look like a loving , well - adjusted family
when the singer j.lo and her then partner marc anthony had twins , their godfather tom cruise threw a â welcome to the world â party for them
and there is no shortage of excess with his own daughter suri , the child he had with ex-wife katie holmes
suri was wearing high heels before she went to school and has a wardrobe of designer clothes that would make naomi campbell jealous
when her parents split in 2012 , her father bought her a mansion in manhattan
not a place for suri , now eight , to live , but as a kind of luxury warehouse to stash and store all the presents and toys he has bought for her over the years
