first - time parents kate and david ogg were heartbroken when they were told one of their twins - born two minutes apart at just 26 weeks - had stopped breathing and had just moments to live
thinking it was the only time they would have with the tiny boy they had already decided to name jamie , kate asked to be able to hold the lifeless child , and told david ogg to climb into the hospital bed for a tender embrace
after years of trying to fall pregnant , the queensland couple were delighted to find out they were having twins - the ' pigeon pair ' of a boy and girl
but just six months into the pregnancy they found themselves in the delivery room and facing premature births
jamie was born first on march 25 , 2010 and his sister emily followed two minutes later
' they were both born in their sac but jamie did n't make a noise when they tore it open
emily let out a big wail , ' ms ogg told daily mail australia
' we looked over and everyone was crowding around jamie - there was about 20 people in the room
when they were told the devastating news , kate ordered her husband to take off his shirt and get into the bed to provide extra warmth - and miraculously he gasped for air and opened his eyes doctors worked on jamie for 20 minutes before they stopped and informed his heartbroken parents the doctor sat on the end of ms ogg 's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out after birth , skin - to - skin contact is recognised as a simple step mothers can take to welcome their baby into the world
for kate and david ogg the point is all the more pertinent
he then informed them that there was nothing more they could do to save jamie
i took jamie off the doctor , asked everyone to leave
' i know it sounds stupid , but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so i was n't going to give up easily
' i know it sounds stupid , but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so i was n't going to give up easily , ' mrs ogg said ' we were trying to entice him to stay
we explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him , ' mrs ogg said ' he suddenly gasped ... then he opened his eyes
' he suddenly gasped ... then he opened his eyes
' jamie and emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story
' emily burst into tears , she was really upset and she kept hugging jamie , ' ms ogg said
' emily and jamie also have a little brother charlie , 4 , and regularly talk about their miracle birth story remarkably , jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth when the twins were first told of their miracle birth , emily burst into tears and would n't stop hugging jamie the david ogg family have set up an online community called jamie 's gift to regularly raise funds for the miracle babies foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns remarkably , jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth
