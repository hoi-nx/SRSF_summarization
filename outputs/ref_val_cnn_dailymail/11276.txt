henderson can become one of the great international players if he starts to add more goals to his game , according to england manager roy hodgson
roy hodgson believes that the liverpool midfielder , who takes on manchester united on sunday and is tipped to take over the captaincy from steven gerrard next season , is only a step away from becoming an exceptional player , with the england manager delighted at henderson 's progress after he was lambasted for picking henderson for euro 2012
roy hodgson said : ' his rise has been fairly meteoric as well
people were saying he was n't getting into the liverpool team and he was being described as a waste of money
roy hodgson believes henderson could become one of the great international players the england manager wants henderson to start adding more goals to his game ' then he went to the under - 21 tournament a year later and got an awful lot of criticism captaining the england under-21 team
so his rise has been quite meteoric , even though he 's been round a long time
and of course i think , as time goes on , the responsibility he 's been given at liverpool now by brendan will help him
liverpool 's success will rub off on him as well as he 's been an important part of it
' henderson has scored some crucial goals for liverpool , including the winner at swansea henderson ( right ) in training as liverpool prepare to take on rivals manchester united on sunday and though roy hodgson hopes that henderson does succeed steven gerrard as liverpool captain , he says it wo n't make any difference to his role in the england team , where he is already considered one of the senior players
