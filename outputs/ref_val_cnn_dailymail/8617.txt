but instead of helping people face a fictional apocalyptic reality , the tractor is the latest in agricultural machinery and is designed to make life easier for farmers
called the challenger mt775 , it can cultivate a staggering 150 acres of land in a single day , which is the equivalents of 100 football pitches
the us - made tractor is guided by gps and steers with an accuracy over the ground of less than an inch
gps systems are used to steer tractors in more precise patterns than humans are capable of
the us - made tractor is controlled by satellite and works and steers with an accuracy over the ground of less than an inch
its rugged appearance bears some resemblance to the vehicles in max ( pictured ) called the challenger mt775 , the tractor ( pictured ) can cultivate a staggering 150 acres of land in a single day , which is the equivalents of 100 football pitches
and unlike the vehicles in max , it 's built to keep drivers comfortable , with leather seats and a dvd player fitted in the cab farmers weekly told mailonline that gps steering systems are farmers â favourite piece of modern farming technology
steering systems got one third of the total votes out of the top 10 favourite farming tools
gps provides accurate location information by calculating the distance from at least three satellites and can also be used on farms to analyse soil fertility , alex thomasson , professor of biological and agricultural engineering at texas a&m university wrote in an article for the conversation
farmers can use a gps receiver to collect soil samples from pre-selected parts of fields
before gps , it was down to the driver to keep the tractor straight to avoid using too much seed , fertiliser or fuel , but today many farmers have some form of gps steering , which means overlapping has all but disappeared and straight lines are easy
despite its rugged appearance , the tractor offers a comfortable ride for drivers
the cab is fitted with climate control and the seat is leather and heated
there is even a dvd player to watch while the tractor follows its pre-set path up and down fields
this truck is one of the extraordinary vehicles to feature in the latest film only 28 of the machines ( pictured ) - which cost up to a quarter of a million pounds each ( $ 373,000 ) - will be made , and britain is set to be one of the biggest markets the tractor 's rugged appearance bears some resemblance to the vehicles in mad max. this still from the latest film , shows tom hardy , who plays max riding a motorcycle in considerable discomfort
however , the tractor features luxuries such as leather seats , for example for farmers , aerial photographs taken by drones offer a quick and easy way to check on the progress of crops and determine where they may need to replant or direct pesticide applications
