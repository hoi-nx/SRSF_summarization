man who would be president : texas senator cruz will reportedly announce his bid on monday cruz will reportedly announce his intention to run for president of the united states this monday , which would make him the first officially declared hopeful in the 2016 election
cruz will hope to triumph against other gop front - runners such as jeb bush , scott walker and rand paul to win his party 's nomination
though he lacks the clout of other candidates within washington and the political establishment , strategists admit , they hope that with the voters of key states like iowa , new hampshire and south carolina , he will be able to carry the day nonetheless
however , cruz remains an outlier in a busy gop field
men to beat : jeb bush , left , and scott walker , right , both command more gop support than cruz
jeb bush has formed an ' exploratory committee ' for his bid , while scott walker has yet to announce in comparison , wisconsin governor scott walker took 18 per cent , former florida governor jeb bush won 16 , with three other hopefuls still polling better than cruz
