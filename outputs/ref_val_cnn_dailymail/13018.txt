thomas might be a world cup winner with germany but at home he has a different title : managing director of carrots
that 's because his wife , lisa , is an aspiring dressage rider with her own designs on conquering the sport she loves
and the hours they spend at stables just outside munich seem to be paying dividends , lisa picking up her first title at national level over the weekend
while the 25 - year - old hones her craft in the world of prancing horses , thomas takes a keen interest in breeding , as well as reveling in the solitude of an environment that is a stratosphere away from the pressurized spotlight he is used to
it 's easy to relax around horses
" at 25 , thomas is as decorated in the world of soccer as they come
he has a glut of domestic trophies , including three german bundesliga titles , and claimed the european champions league and fifa club world cup crowns with bayern in 2013
last year in brazil he landed the ultimate prize when germany powered its way to a first world cup triumph since 1990 , memorably beating hosts brazil 7 - 1 in the semis before edging past argentina in the final
but you wo n't hear much talk of that landmark moment in thomas 's career around the stables
" he 's interested in horses so when we are together we talk about horses and not really about football , " lisa explained
" he knows more about horses than i know about football
" while thomas has enjoyed overwhelming success at an early stage in his career , lisa 's path is a more arduous and exhaustive one
though she has been riding horses since her granddad introduced her to the sport aged four , it takes time to build a strong bond with a horse in dressage
and though her recent victory at the grand prix in the bavarian town of kreuth shows she is clearly in tune with her horse birkhofs dave , lisa says her learning curve is a lengthy one
last year 's qualification for the prestigious piaff-fã¶rderpreis -- a national series for riders aged 25 or below -- underlined her potential
" i 've never had a student that developed that fast no matter what horses they had , " brinkmann told cnn
" i think she 'll be able to be successful on an international level for sure
" thomas is of the same opinion
though he is forbidden from riding himself -- to prevent sustaining an injuries that might impact on his football career -- he has taken a keen interest in the relationship between his wife and birkhofs dave
both the couple 's disciplines rely on a high skill level , but also strong communication , and though the competition is fierce , thomas has high hopes for the pair
" but it 's no guarantee for success because in germany there 's a lot of opponents
a lot of good riders and a lot of good other horses
i want that she 's happy with the horses , with the work and with the competitions
" it 's very tough to get up in germany in the dressage sport
" thomas can also see parallels in the way some horses with potential develop into thoroughbreds , whether in racing or dressage circles , while some fall by the wayside
but he [ birkhofs dave ] stays for sure
" thomas has his own sideline at the stables too -- breeding
" though she often goes to watch thomas play at bayern 's home stadium -- the allianz arena -- lisa does n't even remotely fit the wag stereotype
but lisa , who chose not to travel with thomas to the world cup in brazil last year , has not one scrap of jealousy when it comes to the superstar treatment her famous husband gets
i ca n't do that like thomas can do it
