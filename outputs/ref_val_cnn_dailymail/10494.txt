as many as 200,000 boys and girls are kidnapped in china every year and sold openly online , it âs been reported
child trafficking has been a long - standing problem in china , but despite the efforts of the authorities , the sinister practice is thriving , leading to thousands of families being torn apart
last year hundreds of babies were rescued by police in china after a crackdown was launched on trafficking infants
china 's public security ministry said 382 babies were rescued after four websites were found to be selling children under the guise of adoption
baby boys , who are preferred in china because they âll ensure the family name remains intact , can sell for as much as Â£ 10,500 some critics say the trade is fuelled by the country âs one - child policy
the strict laws limit many families to one child , and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name , many female babies are sold - typically fetching half the amount boys do - aborted or abandoned
