a wind - up iphone case that can charge a phone simply by spinning a handle on the back could spell the end of ' battery anxiety '
designers claim the crankcase can provide up to three hours of power by winding the handle for just five minutes
it also includes a usb port that allows users to charge accessories , or a friend 's mobile phone
he said : ' i realised that without access to power , there was no way i could stay in touch with my friends and family
' with millions of people facing the same issue during events like hurricane katrina , and more recently during hurricane sandy , i knew there had to be a way to keep people connected regardless of access to a traditional power source
' crankcase leverages existing technology in a new way to generate power to keep mobile devices charged without having to depend on traditional power outlets
' crankcase uses a magnetic dynamo generator to produce power
designer mark gabriel said he was inspired to develop the device after being separated from his family by hurricane katrina in 2005
