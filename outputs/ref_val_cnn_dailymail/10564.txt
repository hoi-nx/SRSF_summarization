british aid money may have been used to help corrupt regimes stamp out political opposition , a damning report warns today
the study by the government âs aid watchdog warns that a Â£ 52 million programme to help strengthen bangladesh âs security services could have been used to target opponents of the regime
british aid money was used to train detectives in tracking mobile phones and analysing call data â skills which researchers warned could be used to â monitor and suppress political opposition groups â in the country where corruption is endemic
a report claims british aid money may have been used to help corrupt regimes stamp out political opposition
dfid last night insisted there was â no evidence â that funding had been misused
the commission âs report reveals that dfid also funded training for the bangladesh police in taking fingerprints - including fingerprinting 40,000 convicted prisoners
but researchers questioned the value of the scheme in a country where fingerprint evidence is not admissible in court
the new study raised widespread concerns about the use of british aid to help so - called fragile states strengthen their police and security services
today âs study gives the overall programme its second - lowest â amber - red â rating , meaning that it is performing â relatively poorly â , with â significant improvements â needed to achieve value for money
the study by the government âs aid watchdog warns that a Â£ 52 million programme to help strengthen bangladesh âs security services could have been used to target opponents of the regime but it says that dfid âs projects are â not making enough of a difference to the lives of the poor â
the study was scathing about a project to build â model police stations â in a range of countries , including nigeria , bangladesh , malawi , sri lanka and the drc
a spokesman said there was â no evidence â that funding in bangladesh had supported police repression of political dissidents
