washington democrats who have gleefully watched republicans infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own
as the party works to retake control of the senate in 2016 , democrats are looking at a senate landscape that could feature titanic intraparty clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time
it 's a big shift from recent years when republicans , riven by long - standing ideological fault lines , faced divisive and attention - grabbing primaries , usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots
memorably , in 2010 and 2012 , the fights were so damaging that republicans failed to pick up winnable senate seats by nominating flagrantly unprepared candidates
while the fields of candidates are still taking shape , a platoon of democrats are mulling senate bids in ohio , florida , maryland , california , pennsylvania and illinois
while many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns , none possess the kind of field - clearing star power that could help democrats avoid a primary bonanza , and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity
republicans primary battles are n't going anywhere in 2016 , and on the presidential level , democrats continue to line up behind hillary clinton as their nominee , without a whiff a serious primary challenge
but there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the senate , where the question is whether democrats will cleave along ideological and generational lines in primary fights , jeopardizing the party 's hopes of regaining control of the the upper chamber
" now we 're watching several years of pent - up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their senate chances
" democrats scoff at the idea , claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a senate win against the many republicans up for re-election next year
of the nine senate seats rated as toss - up or competitive the rothenberg & gonzales political report , seven of them are held by republicans elected in the tea party wave of 2010
democrats need a net gain of five seats to take back the senate
" last cycle , barasky said , democrats witnessed hotly contested senate primaries in new jersey , massachusetts and hawaii
republicans , though , are hoping to breathe life into the narrative , especially with democratic primaries brewing in the competitive states of florida and ohio
" democrats are facing messy primaries in key senate races across the country , and there does n't seem to be any end in sight , " said andrea bozek , communications director for the national republican senatorial committee
" the most crowded lane , for now , appears to be in maryland , where five - term sen. barbara mikulski is retiring
with the exception of house democratic whip steny hoyer , nearly every democrat in maryland 's eight - member congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the senate seat
democrats are skeptical that sittenfeld can raise the kind of money to compete against strickland and portman , but if he does , his candidacy will make for a stark contrast against the 73 - year old strickland
in an interview , sittenfeld spoke critically of portman , calling him " a 25 - year creature of washington " who is " out of touch " with ohio
" how can we invest in technology and innovation to solve problems when we are rehashing stale battles ? " as in maryland , there appear to be no major early - stage differences between strickland and sittenfeld on the issues , which again suggests that the democratic primary boom of 2016 is more about timing and opportunity than anything else
democrats have good opportunities in multiple states this cycle , specifically in maryland
" todd , a republicans consultant who worked on several top tier senate races in 2014 , said the primaries might boost democrats
