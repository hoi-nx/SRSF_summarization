a morbidly obese woman , who lost 165lbs in order to qualify for gastric bypass surgery , nearly derailed the impact of the life - saving procedure when she allowed emergency room doctors to insert a feeding tube into her stomach for malnourishment - without consulting her weight - loss surgeon
when angel , from kerrville , texas , joined tlc 's obesity series my 600lbs life , she weighed 570lbs and was consuming between 10 and 12lbs of food a day
but after realizing that her weight was forcing her to miss out on her son andrew 's life , she made the decision to travel to houston to have weight loss specialist dr nowzaradan perform surgery as a final attempt to save her family and her life
following her surgery however , the 42 - year - old mom began experiencing nausea and allowed her boyfriend donnie take her to the hospital - instead of contacting her surgeon like she was instructed â where doctors inserted a feeding tube into her stomach , believing that she was â malnourished â
' dr nowzaradan demanded that angel travel to see him in houston immediately , so he could assess the amount of damage that was done by the doctors in kerrville
' i am hoping i did n't make the wrong decision and will regret it for the rest of my life , ' angel said
in his office , dr nowzaradan had her read the written instructions he had given her after her gastric bypass , which included a line about calling her surgeon if she started vomiting
while angel said she could n't call because she did n't have a phone on her , donnie explained that he genuinely believed she was just sick and would be sent back home
bad decision : angel 's weight loss surgeon , dr nowzaradan , scolded angel and her boyfriend donnie for letting other doctors give her a feeding tube after her gastric bypass , essentially derailing her progress medical mistake : angel experienced extreme nausea after her surgery , but instead of calling her doctor , she went to the emergency room where she was misdiagnosed as malnourished and given a feeding tube ' you do n't have to have a phone , ' dr nowzaradan told her
' why in the world does she need a feeding tube ? ' he added : ' she should not have allowed other doctors to do this
' dr nowzaradan explained that the feeding tube had essentially undone the effect of her bypass and it needed to be closed off , so she could continue to lose weight
while the procedure to rectify the damage she had done went well , it was another road block in angel 's ongoing battle to lose weight
caregiver : before her weight loss surgery , angel relied on her boyfriend donnie to do everything for her , include bathe her out of control : angel said that even though she felt like an ' oversized whale ' , she could n't stop eating
donnie guessed that she consumed 10 to 12lbs of food a day full of love : angel hugged her son andrew , who she was unable to play with outside because of her size before meeting dr nowzaradan , angel 's weight was spiraling out of control
although she had grown up thin , she started to rapidly gain weight after her mother forced her to give up her first child , a baby girl , after she got pregnant when she was just 14 years old
' she continued : ' i turned to food for comfort , and that 's when i started gaining the weight
she could n't believe that she let her weight spiral to 570lbs natural size : angel grew up thin and did n't have a problem with her weight until she got pregnant with her first child at 14 years old seeking solace : after her mom forced her to give her baby girl up for adoption , she went from being thin ( left ) to rapidly gaining weight ( right ) because she turned to food during her time of grief when she met donnie , she weighed 405lbs , but her size did n't bother him
' mental health : as a part of her weight loss plan , angel began seeing a therapist , so she could stop blaming herself for giving up her baby no choice : angel started to cry while she told her therapist how she was forced to put her baby up for adoption angel reached out to dr nowzaradan in order to save her family and regain life because she had hit her ' breaking point '
however , when she traveled to houston in hopes of receiving weight loss surgery , she was ordered to lose 50lbs before they could proceed
months later , angel lost 165lbs and was ready for surgery , but there were even more complications
' this surgery is the last chance to save my family , and i feel like i am losing it , ' angel later explained
dr nowzaradan was eventually able to give her the gastric bypass she so desperately needed , and angel continued to make progress
making memories : angel was finally able to go with donnie to watch andrew 's football game after her weight loss surgery all alone : donnie can be seen helping andrew with his football pads
before angel started losing weight , he said he felt like a single parent life - changing : angel 's weight loss allowed her to get out of bed and spend quality time with donnie and andrew for the first time in years but the feeding tube she was later given threatened to ruin everything
' we are dodging a bullet today , ' dr nowzaradan said when he fixed angel 's botched surgery
after all of her struggles , angel was still determined to lose weight and take control of her life
during one of her sessions angel discussed how traumatic it was for her to give her first child up for adoption
making progress : a year after she started chronicling her journey for my 600lbs life , angel was excited to learn that she weighed 261lbs before and after : angel lost half her body weight and returned to a size she had n't seen since high school for the first time in years , angel was happy to go shopping for new clothes because she knew they would now fit her body ' i do n't want to miss a single thing from here on out , ' she said
' a year after she started chronicling her journey on my 600lbs life , angel had lost 309lbs - more than half of her body weight
