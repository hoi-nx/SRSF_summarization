clarke afforded himself a few smiles on the touchline and who could blame him ? this has been a strange old season for reading , who are one win away from an fa cup semi-final against arsenal but have spent too long being too close to a championship relegation battle
they made it hard for themselves , but they had an in - form player in jamie mackie who was able to get the job done
he put reading in front in the first half and then scored a brilliant winner just moments after chris oâgrady had levelled with a penalty â one of the only legitimate chances brighton had all night , even if clarke was angry about the decision

â the win puts reading 13 points off the bottom three and clarke added : â it gives us a lift in the league because that is what was needed
â brighton , meanwhile , have now gone five games on the road without a win and this one came against a side that had gone 344 minutes without scoring at home before jamie mackie netted midway through the first half
by then , cooper had already seen an effort hacked off the brighton goal - line by jake forster-caskey and hal robson-kanu made a spectacular hash of a chance , launching the ball into the stands when he went clean through
niall keown , son of arsenal legend martin ( right ) , made his senior debut for reading against brighton brighton striker chris o'grady scores from the penalty spot to level the scores at the madejski stadium chris o'grady celebrates his equaliser for the seagulls but brighton went onto concede just three minutes later and brighton ? not a chance of note in the entire first half for a side that had lost only once in six coming in
reading winger hal robson-kanu is crowded out by brighton duo rohan ince and emmanuel ledesma goalscorer o'grady holds off the challenge of reading during tuesday 's encounter chris hughton waved on brighton but his side found no way of turning decent possession into reasonable chances
reading added a line of reinforcement by bringing on niall keown â son of martin keown - for his debut in stoppage time
