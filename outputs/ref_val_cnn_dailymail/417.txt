vince wilfork 's 11 - year spell as a pats looks to be over after the franchise informed the defensive tackle they will not be picking up the option on his contract
please know how blessed my family and i have been to be able to play 11 years in pats for an amazing organization , ' said vince wilfork , who bookended his time at foxborough with two super bowl wins
the move gives the pats $ 8.06m in cap space , but the parties could yet reach a new , reduced , agreement for vince wilfork to remain in pats .
