falcao 's miserable career at united reached a new low on tuesday night when he was dumped in the reserves by manager louis van gaal
falcao has not played a minute of football for united 's first team since being dragged off midway through the home victory over sunderland last month and was left on the bench as van gaal 's stuttering team were knocked out of the fa cup by arsenal at home on monday night
now the Â£ 250,000 - a - week loan signing from monaco has suffered the indignity of being made to play in the under 21 team in their game against tottenham hotspur on tuesday night

however , the united boss usually asks senior players to play at this level only if they are on their way back from injury
united officials say falcao , one of the most feared strikers in world football before he suffered a cruciate ligament injury last january , was chosen to ensure he would be sharp for the first - team 's clash with tottenham hotspur at the same venue on sunday afternoon

having only scored four times during his six months at united , the chances of falcao being retained in the summer are almost nil
