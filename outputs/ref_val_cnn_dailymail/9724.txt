there are many things believed to make a woman more attractive in a man âs eyes â but a curved spine is nât usually thought to be one of them
however , researchers claim men are particularly attracted to a women with a back that curves exactly 45 degrees above the top of her bottom
such an angle would have given a woman an advantage while pregnant in early hunter - gatherer societies and so has evolved as being seen as attractive around the world , they claim
perfect angle : jennier lopez has an attractive curve as scientists discover that extra mass around the buttocks can often enhance the curvature of a woman 's spine j-lo , pictured above , may have the ideal spine curvature that evolved to be attractive in early hunter - gatherer societies because it gave women an advantage to forage for food while bearing children kim kardashian , shown above , has become famous for her curvy figure and buttocks , but her appeal to men may be tapping into something rooted in our evolutionary past when they gave an evolutionary advantage the scientists found that extra mass around the buttocks could often enhance the curvature of a woman 's spine
however , the researchers also found that a physical curvature of the spine - known as vertebral wedging - was seen as more attractive than extra buttock mass. curvy hips and buttocks may provide vital ' fat banks ' that help to fuel the development of newborn babies ' brains , claim scientists
dr lewis , a psychologist at bilkent university in turkey , said : ' it 's an independent and previously undiscovered standard of attractiveness
' consequently , ancestral women who possessed this degree of lumbar curvature would have been able to forage longer into pregnancy and would have been able to carry out multiple pregnancies with a reduced risk of spinal injury
an example of the silhouettes shown to men during the study with different curvature of the spine
a curved angle of around 45 degrees was rated the most attractive and is also an optimum angle during pregnancy dr lewis said : ' one can think of vertebrae that are n't wedged like ( ice ) hockey pucks - they are the same height in the front and the back , ' he said
' a 45 - degree angle was optimal because it would have aided movement , yet would not have been so great so as to expose women to the back pain and risk of slipped discs that can come with excessive spinal curvature
the participants found the vertebral wedging was most attractive for the study , which was published in the journal evolution and human behaviour , the psychologists showed 300 men silhouettes of women with different angles of curvature
he said : ' men may be directing their attention to the butt and obtaining information about women 's spines , even if they are unaware that that is what their minds are doing
