six months after a machete was carved into his thigh , brook finds himself in a situation where he has to walk like he talks
the fact that he is walking at all is a measure of progress , considering the damage caused during the vicious assault he suffered on holiday in tenerife last september
the answer will finally come on saturday , when the 28 - year - old faces jo jo dan , a tough romanian who is mandatory challenger for the ibf welterweight world title brook brilliantly won weeks before he was assaulted
brook is ready to return to the ring against jo jo dan just six months after he suffered a machete attack brook showed off the scar on his thigh from the attack ( left ) before putting in more hours ahead of his return brook feared on the night of the attack that he would die , or that he would be unable to walk ever again ' i went from being on top of the world to the bottom of the ocean , ' was how brook put it in an interview with sportsmail last september , his first since the attack
then , like now , brook 's outlook was dominated by fighting talk and attempts at positive thinking
jo jo dan has earned his shot at brook after becoming the mandatory challenger for his ibf world title until he steps into the ring in front of sky 's cameras , only brook himself truly knows if there is any residual physical consequence of the attack , after which he left a trail of blood across a holiday resort before collapsing unconscious and being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery
but i remember , when i woke up in hospital in tenerife , no - one had come to see me yet and i was looking down at the leg
' brook at home shortly after he was stabbed ( left ) and showing his scar ( right ) on the week of his fight it 's a fascinating junction in brook 's career
brook said : ' i think the amir khan fight is gone for this year
the attack left brook needing 32 metal staples in his left thigh after blood was ' spurting everywhere ' out of it hearn has so far held productive talks with the representatives of legendary mexican juan manuel marquez , as well as former lightweight world champion brandon rios , over a summer bout
brook said : ' i was born to do this
i keep telling myself that i wo n't stop , not just winning one world title but i want to do it at different weights
brook seemed in good spirits as he got back into the ring at the workout on tuesday afternoon ' it 's been horrible going through everything since the attack , all the rehab and everything else but now i am the fittest i have ever been and ca n't wait to get back in the ring again
