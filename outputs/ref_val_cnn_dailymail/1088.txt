most afternoons i can be found huffing and puffing my way up primrose hill in london , pushing what feels like the world 's heaviest baby in a buggy
the view of the city from the top is spectacular but for a few precious days i swapped it for an even better one - with the magnificent backdrop of the italian dolomites
after a two - hour car journey from innsbruck we were greeted at rosa alpina - a five - star , family - owned hotel and spa tucked in a valley in the tiny village of san cassiano - with a local speciality : a sweet and comforting hot apple juice
rosa alpina - a five - star , family - owned hotel and spa is tucked in a valley in the tiny village of san cassiano in the sunshine , the village looked pristine , with pretty wooden chalets stacked against mountain pastures which would have been snow - covered in winter but were now a vivid green
the grass was impossibly neat and as i wondered how many cows it must take to maintain , i spotted sit - on mowers weaving up and down the slopes
having picked out a buggy from the hotel lobby , with map in hand we set off on a mountain walk but took the lazy way up - in a cable car
as the cable car lurched , my four month - old daughter romilly wobbled in my lap , lip trembling ; looking back down the mountain and up to the peak seemed a long way off
there was a restaurant , playground , park and fountain
rosa alpina boasts st hubertus , a stunning michelin - starred restaurant , where chef norbert niederkofler uses seasonal vegetables - so no tomatoes in winter at one hilltop restaurant , deckchairs overlooked the spectacular view like a sort of mountain beach , and children played on swings
it makes for a wonderful outing for energetic children ( and their parents ) and rosa alpina has produced a brilliant educational booklet which encourages little ones to look out for flora and fauna , plus answer questions on their surroundings
