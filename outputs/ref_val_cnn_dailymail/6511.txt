at old trafford i could actually understand how roger east thought that wes brown had clipped falcao but the clear and obvious foul was clearly by john o'shea
east 's statement , in which he felt wes brown had made the foul for the penalty , makes it impossible for the fa to transfer the red card to john o'shea as they can only do so when the referee accepts that he has disciplined the wrong player
wes brown was sent off for a foul on falcao even though it appeared john o'shea made the contact poyet 's side are appealing wes brown 's red card but an overturn is n't certain roger east sends off wes brown ( right ) and poll admits he can understand his decision to show him the red card now the red card will be issued to wes brown , although he has appealed it as he did not foul falcao
another example is that crystal palace captain mile jedinak should be charged for his clearly deliberate forearm smash on west ham 's diafra sakho towards the end of crystal palace 's win at upton park
it appeared to be unseen by referee mike dean but was around the area of active play , where the ball was present , so could that be deemed as 're - refereeing ' an incident ? i hope not as the australian certainly deserves a ban for the mindless assault
mile jedinak 's elbow was labelled a ' mindless assault ' and poll says he should be punished the crystal palace midfielder caught west ham striker diafra sakho and was lucky not to injure him there was more dissatisfaction , and this time by both mangers over the performance of referee neil swarbrick at the britannia stadium
two acts of serious foul play escaped neil swarbrick 's detection and stephen ireland was involved in both
stephen ireland lies injured after a after a tackle from maynor figueroa which left him needing stitches the honduras international is unlikely to receive any ban from the fa as the officials saw the incident
