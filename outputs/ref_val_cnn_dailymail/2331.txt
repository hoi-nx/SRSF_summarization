for rangers captain lee mcculloch , the spfl championship table has become a torment
a headache the arrival of a new board of directors simply ca nât cure
lying 22 points behind relentless leaders hearts , there is now no hiding place for the ibrox players
the off - field problems have eased , stuart mccall is in place as manager and , simply put , there are no excuses left
â it is time for everybody to stand up and be men , â said lee mcculloch
â take the ball , demand the ball in front of a crowd , do nât hide and go and show that you â re good enough to be here
â rangers captain lee mcculloch has urged his team - mates to stand up and be counted under mcdowall , rangers played as if a grey , leaden cloud hung over ibrox
in comparison , a home game with doomed livingston offers stuart mccall the chance to be a breath of fresh air around the place
rangers need something to rescue a flailing season and advance from the play - offs to the premiership by hook or by crook
â it âs been a frustrating season for everyone , fans , players , off - the - field , â added lee mcculloch
everything else seems to have been sorted out , so it âs basically up to us now to try and get a play - off place and see what happens
rangers have two games in hand and winning them would ease concerns they might slip out of the play - offs altogether â a state of affairs which would be completely unacceptable to their captain
â it âs not as if i âve been going home and made a cup of tea and thinking everything âs all right , â lee mcculloch insisted
â the weeks ahead will reveal much about this rangers team
off - field turmoil drew attention from their failings
lee mcculloch says rangers must finish in the play - off positions this season lee mcculloch and stuart mccall referred to a crisis of confidence repeatedly yesterday
for many of these players , the suspicion is that rangers may simply be too big for them
but even though there has been a lot of off - field stuff going on , you ca nât really make an excuse for how we have been playing
lee mcculloch is one of them and , while some of the players wo nât be sorry to leave , the 36 - year - old wants to complete the journey back to the top division as a rangers player
stuart mccall begins his reign at rangers with home game against livingston â it would be amazing , it would be brilliant to go back to the top and it would be nice
nicky was a stand - out under stuart mccall at motherwell and for the new manager bringing the best out of him and others is the key to earning the job on a permanent basis
â i want everyone to go out and express themselves , â said stuart mccall after his second training session
â haris vuckic has been absolutely outstanding in training , bright and bubbly and a fantastic lad , â reported stuart mccall
â in reality , remie streete is ill and injured , kevin mbabu played an under - 20 game on thursday but is well short , shane ferguson has yet to cross the border and gael bigirimana has a medical condition
â one out of five is nât bad , â grinned stuart mccall after waking at 5am in anticipation of his return to ibrox as a rangers employee
â hopefully tomorrow at 5pm â or when i get home tomorrow â i will look back on it
