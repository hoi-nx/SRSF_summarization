shortly before kick - off the officer - who had never previously overseen a major football match - ordered a gate to be opened in order to ease overcrowding outside the ground , but this allowed fans to rush into to already packed terraces
when fans started dying , mr david duckenfield told fa officials that ' some fans have got in through a gate ' , which he now admits was a ' terrible lie '

' crush : 96 liverpool fans were killed by being pushed up against barriers on the overcrowded terrace he denied saying anything inaccurate to fa officials kelly and glen kirton , but confessed he had told a ' lie by omission ' for failing to mention that he gave the order to open the gate , and added that it was his family who told him what he had done
