president obama is in ' denial about the threats we face ' and is ' making grave miscalculations ' that threaten the safety of the global community , former texas gov. perry charged on thursday morning while speaking at a breakfast in new hampshire
' ' to deny the fundamental religious nature of the threat and downplay the seriousness of it is naive , it 's dangerous , and it 's misguided , ' the self - described ' wannabe ' presidential candidate said at a saint anselm college event

other maybe - presidential candidates who have headlined the event in the ' first in the nation ' state so far this year are former hewlett-packard ceo carly fiorina , former united nations ambassador john bolton , florida sen. marco rubio and south carolina sen. graham , whose appearance came earlier this week on monday
but at the end of the event , possibly unaware that his mic was still hot , the texas republican revealed that he was being coached on foreign policy by his friend - and likely presidential candidate - graham
asked to sign what appeared from a distance to be a program of this political season 's saint anselm college speakers , perry announced that he would sign his name next to graham
' graham 's my buddy
i am a big graham fan , ' perry disclosed
' continuing , perry said , ' i talked to him night before last , just ... picking his brain a little bit about what 's going on in ukrainian , in particular ... [ russia president vladimir ] vladimir putin is , is a dangerous guy
perry , possibly unaware that he was still being recorded , admitted today that the senate armed services committee member - who is plotting his own presidential bid - is advising him on foreign policy obama said in a december interview with national public radio that he 'd learned throughout his nearly six years in office the value of ' having some strategic patience ' when it comes to russia
spelling out how he 'd handle russia 's aggression , perry said , ' i think you have to fund the lethal weapons to the ukrainian military
' keynote speaker of a monday politics and eggs program , graham signs wooden eggs for guests at the political speech series in bedford , new hampshire a spokesman for perry did not immediately return the daily mail 's request for clarification on whether the former texas governor and 2008 presidential candidate knew he was still being broadcast when he made the remarks about graham and vladimir putin
graham , a defense hawk and member of the senate armed services committee who is building his presidential bid around his foreign policy credentials , has also been critical of obama 's ' strategic patience ' claims
' i doubt isil , the iranian mullahs , or vladimir putin will be intimidated by president obama 's strategy of " strategic patience , " ' graham said last month in response to obama 's announcement that the mantra would drive his national security strategy moving forward
' ' applying more " patience " to president obama 's failed foreign policy just prolongs failure
