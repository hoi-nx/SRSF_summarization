england coach moores should be removed from his current position and put in charge of the ' kids ' , according to former captain vaughan
moores , handed a second stint as head coach last april , has come under intense fire since england 's defeat by bangladesh on monday condemned them to an early return from the world cup
vaughan believes moores ' talents have been wasted : ' moores was at his best working with the lions ( development team ) many years ago , ' vaughan said in the daily telegraph
moores ( centre ) oversaw a disastrous world cup campaign with england in australia and new zealand moores would be better off working with young cricketers , according to vaughan ' the job of england coach has become about man management , helping with tactics and picking the right team
' ' i always say the best coach works with kids and development programmes between the age of 15 and 20
' vaughan said england 's conservative approach to the one - day game had resulted in them being left behind by the likes of australia , new zealand , sri lanka and india , while even ireland , vaughan said , were playing better one - day cricket
