they say one man 's trash is another man 's treasure and that has certainly proved to be the case for entrepreneur dan cluderay
while supermarkets regularly throw away food that has gone past its ' best before ' date , mr dan cluderay , from worksop , nottinghamshire , is now a millionaire after setting up an online business selling out - of - date food to busy mums and bargain hunters
the 40 - year - old says the secret to his success is that his business , approved food , provides just what the savvy shopper is looking for - quality food at prices which save mums around Â£ 60 off their weekly bill compared to a similar shop at one of the big supermarkets
however , the dragons ' den team , which consisted of duncan bannatyne , kelly hoppen , deborah meaden , piers linney and peter jones , unanimously turned them down
not to be thwarted , mr dan cluderay and mr andy needham managed to source Â£ 400,000 through loans and investments from elsewhere which has seen approved food achieve a Â£ 4million turnover
' it 's all very exciting and we have lots of plans to take the business further , ' said father - of - two mr dan cluderay
andy needham 's idea did n't excite dragons ' den investors , from left to right , duncan bannatyne , kelly hoppen , deborah meaden , piers linney and peter jones inside the approved food warehouse which stocks a range of products from toilet roll to dog food bag a bargain : slim - fast mix available for Â£ .199 and 99p pineapple juice are some of the drinks on offer together with his wife , nichola , the pair set up market stalls in hull , leeds and doncaster selling branded chocolate , fizzy drinks and crisps which had been shunned by a range of supermarkets as they were either fast approaching or past their ' best before ' date
however , it was after taking delivery of a crate of twinings nettle tea that mr dan cluderay said he had his ' eureka moment '
' i suddenly realised that while there might not be the demand for nettle tea in doncaster , if i could match the goods with customers looking to buy , i 'd be on to a winner , ' said mr dan cluderay , who has two sons , nine - year - old rudi and jay , five
while still working seven days a week on the market stalls , he utilised all his computer skills to start forming a plan to launch his business , approved food

' it was on 14 august 2008 , that mr dan cluderay received his very first order , the day after his website went live
' there are only two dates people really need to know about , ' explained mr dan cluderay
' the " best before " date which means that the food will be at its optimum before that date and acts as a guide to the quality , and then there 's the " use by " date which is concerned with the safety aspect
' it 's only the " use by " date that means food has to be eaten by then or it could make you ill , which is the case with fish and meat , for example
' food is perfectly fine to be eaten way past its " best before " date , as people know , but the large supermarkets wo n't do that and that 's where we come in

use by ... you will see ' use by ' dates on food that goes off quickly , such as smoked fish , meat products and ready - prepared salads
do n't use any food or drink after the end of the ' use by ' date on the label , even if it looks and smells fine
once a food with a â use by â date on it has been opened , you also need to follow any instructions such as â eat within three days of opening â
