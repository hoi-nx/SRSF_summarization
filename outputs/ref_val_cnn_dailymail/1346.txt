sickle cell trait means someone is carrying a gene for a serious condition called sickle cell disease , which can cause red blood cells to change their shapes , potentially causing pain and infections
people with sickle cell trait have red blood cells with abnormal hemoglobin ( a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs and returns carbon dioxide from tissues back to the lungs ) but they have enough normal hemoglobin for red cells to successfully carry oxygen around the body
while it is extremely rare for sickle cell trait to cause any complications , there can be problems in conditions of severe physical stress , including low oxygen conditions , severe dehydration , severe physical exercise or very high altitude
sickle cell trait , which is more commonly found in african - americans than other races , is diagnosed with a simple blood test
