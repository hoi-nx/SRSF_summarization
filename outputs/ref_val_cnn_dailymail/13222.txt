cnn global affairs correspondent elise labott has been covering the israeli election in depth and took to facebook to answer your questions about the election
here are five highlights from the chat : 1 ) how did the race go from exit polls saying it was a neck - and - neck race to netanyahu claiming victory within a matter of hours ? i know , right ? it 's a great mystery as to how the exit polls got it so wrong
there 's one pollster here in israeli named avi degani who predicted that netanyahu would win all along

i think both sides realize that the americans - israeli relationship is too important to continue as it has been
opinion : will netanyahu win seal iran deal ? 3 ) what is netanyahu 's plan regarding the israeli - palestinians conflict ? in the final days before the election , prime minister netanyahu made a big push to energize his right - wing base
