consultant - level care and scans will be offered every day to end the scandal of poor out - of - hours treatment
the prime minister will admit that britons are â more likely to die â if they turn up at weekends and outline plans to use Â£ 2billion to fund the move in england
his announcement ensures that the two main parties will now go head - to - head on the nhs at the start of the general election campaign
but labour said the conservative had promised a seven - day nhs before the last election and failed to deliver it
the prime minister will insist that maintaining funding for public services is only possible with a strong economy , urging voters to stick to the tories â â long - term economic plan â
his reforms would be rolled out step by step , starting with emergency and urgent care and support services such as scans
some hospitals are already providing services at the weekend
salford royal nhs foundation trust , rated outstanding by watchdogs , offers consultant - led emergency care from 8am to midnight , seven days a week
chesterfield royal hospital nhs trust offers services such as ct scans on weekday evenings and from 9am to 5pm at the weekend
at sheffield teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust , an increase in consultants on weekend duty saw a 34 per cent rise in patients being discharged the same or the following day
in his speech at the conservative spring conference in manchester today , the prime minister will say : â for years it âs been too hard to access the nhs out of hours
â and the truth is that you are actually more likely to die if you turn up at the hospital at the weekend
â with a future conservative government , we would have a truly seven - day nhs
but labour health spokesman andy burnham said mr david cameron was making the same promise he did five years ago
he added : â it will , for example , take much longer than five years to train the extra doctors needed , and without a considerable increase in staff and resources , weekday services might face being scaled back , affecting patient care
but last night a former labour health minister accused his party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care
ed miliband yesterday pledged to cap the profits of private firms providing nhs care , bringing in a five per cent profit cap mr ed miliband said yesterday that another five years of conservative government would mean â the disintegration of our public services â
â we âll scrap david cameron âs market framework for the nhs and stop the tide of privatisation , â he said
no company working with the nhs will be able to profit by cherry - picking : rejecting patients with the more complex and expensive needs
