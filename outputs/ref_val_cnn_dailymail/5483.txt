and while it might not seem unacceptable to charge corkage for when you bring your own wine to an eatery , there are now a number of london restaurants who charge cakeage fees - a sum to serve diners birthday cake - which can sometimes come up to Â£ 9 per person
playing with numbers and omitting dollar and pound signs restaurant menus tend to attach prices that end with the number nine to dishes as it indicates a bargain is being had
when you use dollar signs , your food looks more expensive
kaspar 's seafood bar & grill in london 's savoy hotel ( pictured ) charges Â£ 9 per person for birthday cake anchoring another key trick is known as ' anchoring '
this is where a restaurant places a highly expensive dish prominently on the menu â solely in order to make the other dishes nearby appear relatively cheap
that is not their job â instead they are simply there to make the other dishes look like good value
so menu consultants have a limited time to make their sell to us , which is why more expensive items of food are always place on the top right hand corner of the page ( this is where the eye naturally falls when we look at a page )
menu boards which omit prices ( left ) and classical music such as works by beethoven ( right ) are some of the ways restaurants make diners pay more for their experience tests , which were carried out over three weeks by university of leicester researchers , monitored the effects of classical , pop music and background silence on spending
they found that when subtle classical melodies were played , diners spent more than Â£ 24 per head on average on food and drinks
in the same test , diners were spending over Â£ 1 each on coffee with classical music , compared to only 80p with pop music and 54p without any background noise
james davis , proprietor of softleys restaurant in market bosworth , where the research was carried out , said : ' the sort of music you play does affect people 's mood
for instance a lot of restaurants have dishes that include the name of the butchers or suppliers , which makes it seem like the dish has been carefully chosen â and thus justifying the price hike
manipulation through music while music may well be the food of love , mozart , bach and beethoven could also burn a nasty hole in your pocket , research has suggested
scientists have discovered that classical music makes restaurant diners feel more affluent and encourages them to spend more money
researchers at the university of leicester found that classical music , often associated with affluence , was the most successful in encouraging people to part with their cash
if you hear classical music , it has got all sorts of connotations of sophistication , affluence and wealth and it makes you feel a bit posh
' cakegate while corkage fees have become the norm , there is now a trend to charge diners ' cakeage ' for when they bring in their birthday cake
prices can go up to as much as Â£ 9 per person at kaspar 's seafood bar & grill in london 's savoy hotel , which is the same price at dessert
duck & waffle in london , charges Â£ 7 per person serving charge although their staff inform punters that they can provide a cake if you would rather that
other restaurants charging cakeage include gordon ramsay 's savoy grill and maze restaurants in london , which demand Â£ 5 a head , and barbecue chain bodean 's , charging Â£ 1.50
