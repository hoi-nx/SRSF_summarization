the families of thousands of patients given contaminated blood by the nhs have condemned an inquiry into the scandal as a whitewash and a waste of time
patients were infected with hiv and hepatitis c after receiving blood supplies which had not been properly tested
the true scale of hepatitis c contracted via hospital transfusions has taken years to emerge because of the time it can take to start to experience symptoms
the scandal was described as the ' worst treatment disaster in the history of the nhs ' and yesterday the prime minister apologised on behalf of the government
david cameron addressed the commons shortly after the scottish government published the findings from its own six - year , Â£ 6million inquiry into what happened
they are furious that the inquiry did not blame individual doctors , nhs staff or politicians and said nothing could have been done differently
bill wright from scotland criticised the findings of the six year penrose inquiry today mr david cameron 's apology follows a lengthy campaign by the mail highlighting the plight of victims and relatives
addressing mps during prime minister 's questions in the commons , mr david cameron said he wanted to recognise the ' pain and suffering experienced by people as a result of this tragedy '
the prime minister added : ' it is difficult to imagine the feelings of unfairness that people must feel as a result of being infected by something like hepatitis c or hiv as a result of a totally unrelated treatment within the nhs , and to each and every one of those people , i would like to say sorry on behalf of the government for something that should not have happened
it said between 1970 and 1991 , contaminated nhs blood products caused an estimated 32,718 people to be infected with hepatitis c. between 1978 and 1985 , 1,500 people were infected with the hiv virus in a similar way , most of whom were also infected with hepatitis c. the scottish government 's penrose inquiry investigated only the cases of scottish victims , and the widow of david rusling , who died of hepatitis c after being infected during a treatment for haemophilia , said it was a waste of time
the families of thousands of patients given contaminated blood by the nhs have condemned an inquiry into the scandal as a whitewash and a waste of time the mail 's coverage included telling the story of allen white , then 36 , a haemophiliac who contracted aids through a blood clotting agent , under the headline : ' a blindness to moral justice has abandoned this dying man
the article asked : ' why does n't the government do the honourable thing about what the haemophilia society describes as ' the biggest tragedy in nhs history ' ? ' after pressure on the government to recognise the unique circumstances of the case , 1,200 haemophiliac aids victims were promised Â£ 42million compensation in 1990
the penrose inquiry , which gave its findings yesterday , said 478 people acquired the hepatitis c virus from blood product therapy in scotland and 2,500 acquired the virus from blood transfusion in scotland between 1970 and 1991
sixty patients acquired hiv from therapy with blood products and 18 from blood transfusion in scotland
the mail 's coverage included telling the story of allen white , then 36 , a haemophiliac who contracted aids through a blood clotting agent the penrose inquiry did not have the power to summon witnesses from outside scotland â and has done little to abate the anger of many victims
mark ward , of peacehaven , east sussex , who contracted hepatitis c and hiv from contaminated blood he received as a child , said yesterday he had been treated as nothing more than a ' lump of meat to be experimented on '
' three men who contracted hepatitis c from blood transfusions have started a legal case to challenge the support available to them , and it is likely further legal action will follow .
