in tennis , a hitting partner is someone who often does more than just practice with a big star
two years ago , for example , the father of bernard tomic , one of the most hyped players in the last decade , was found guilty of assaulting the player 's former hitting partner , thomas drouet
bajin , a constant in williams ' life the past eight years , suggested on twitter earlier this week that he was no longer working with the 19 - time grand slam winner and has instead begun a partnership with williams ' friend and tennis rival , azarenka
their split was confirmed by williams ' agent , jill smoller , in an email to cnn.com , and azarenka 's coach , wim fissette , confirmed that bajin is indeed the two - time grand slam champion 's new hitting partner
" i 'm very excited about having bajin in the team , " wim fissette told cnn.com in an email
" bajin is a great guy ... and has so much experience in working with williams
" no one has disclosed what led to the parting of ways but bajin was n't with williams as she won the australian open in january
wim fissette , who was formerly alongside kim clijsters , simona halep and sabine lisicki when they either won or reached grand slam finals , said he was " very surprised " that bajin became available
" bajin was working so many years with williams and i felt they had an excellent relationship , more than just player and hitting partner , " he said
" williams , about to make her return to indian wells after a 14 - year absence , once likened bajin to a brother
" outside of my parents , i think he 's probably the most important person on the team , " williams told usa today in 2013
" he 's much more than a hitting partner
" bajin 's alliance with azarenka serves as another change for the belorussian
" from the first meeting , i felt a good connection ( with azarenka ) and after the first two weeks i feel a very good connection , " said wim fissette
