an amazing image revealing some mysterious phenomena in a gigantic galaxy - cluster collision has been revealed
in the region , where clusters of hundreds of galaxies are colliding , a rich variety of objects are visible only to radio telescopes
scientists created a â true colour â image of the region to reveal what it would look like if humans could see radio waves , rather than just visible light
researchers have released an amazing image of abell 2566
blue objects are radio galaxies with streams of plasma , and in green is the ' large relic ' , which could be a shockwave as the clusters collide
researchers at the nrao ( nrao ) made the image using the vla ( vla ) in new mexico
in the image , red colouration shows longer radio waves , moving down to blue , which is composed of shorter radio waves
â star formation in such galaxies is a strong source of radio waves , which come from supernova remnants and cosmic rays that are energised in the star formation regions
â there is also a handful of objects known as radio galaxies , which each have a massive central black hole that emits jets of plasma
â in clusters like this the unusual shapes of the radio galaxies are due to the interaction of those jets with the cluster atmosphere , â dr eilek continued
