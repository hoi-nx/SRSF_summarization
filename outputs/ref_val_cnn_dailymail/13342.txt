as more details about the infamous isis executioner " jihadi john " become known , certain basic questions continue to be raised
is islam as a faith to be blamed for mohammed emwazi 's voyage to isis , otherwise known as the islamic state ? or is the " war on terror " responsible , and is this merely " chickens coming home to roost ? " the temptation is to come to simplistic answers
confronted with such brazen depravity as shown in isis propaganda videos , many take what their propagandists say very seriously : that they are , indeed , doing what their faith tells them to do
on the other hand , few believed isis when it was claimed they would negotiate with the japanese authorities to release one of their citizens captured in syria , who was later killed
taking isis at their word is probably not the most sensible course of action -- it is obviously quite wrong -- and duplicitous -- about a number of things
the " assassins , " for example , which began in the 11th century , was a radical , heterodox movement of muslims , which eventually died out -- in its own time , similar to isis today , it was decried and depicted as deviant by muslims religious authorities as well as most muslims
" why , then , are we not prepared to expunge islam from the mix when interrogating isis ideology ? while most churches , protestant and catholic , rejected the " christianity " of nazi germany , there is no corresponding action from the world of islam
since the dawn of isis , numerous muslims religious authorities have denounced the claim to authenticity by isis , on religious grounds -- none have given it that prize of legitimacy it so craves
that is , except for isis itself , and for some odd reason , some in the west who insist on taking isis at its word
religious authorities at large , and muslims in general , may recognize isis members as muslims , albeit gravely deviant ones who ought to be treated as criminals
in one interview , the lobby group , cage prisoners , insisted in response to a question about responsibility for the beheadings in syria : " the man who cut off their heads , and if you take that back a step , the people who potentially helped in his radicalization ; in this case , the security services
there are many high - profile members of isis in syria and iraq who underwent no harassment of any sort -- for example , lotfi arrifin , a youth leader in a malaysian political party
the reality is , however , there is no template for explaining the voyage an individual takes in becoming a member of isis or any other radical islamism group
more often than not , a recruit will find him or herself looking for some kind of " meaning " in this world -- and repugnant though isis ideology may be , it does provide a sense of certainty
we must understand the context of the paths these recruits go through , to avoid others doing the same -- and we must always keep in mind that regardless of the context , only one person has responsibility for their actions
