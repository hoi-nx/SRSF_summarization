invisibility glasses by avg , a software security company , were created in a bid to help protect people 's online identities in the digital age
with the increased use of cell phone cameras in public , the glasses make it difficult to capture a person 's identity in facial recognition software , for example the kind used on facebook the glasses , through the use of infrared light and retro - reflective materials , blocks attempts to get a clear facial capture of the wearer , developers claim the wearable technology , which does not hide the rest of the person 's body , debuted on sunday at technology showcase pepcom in barcelona , according to gizmodo
the developers of the privacy glasses , innovation labs , said that with the advancement in facial recognition technologies like facebook 's deepface system , they began investigating how technology can be used when it comes to securing online privacy
the glasses , through the use of infrared led light and retro - reflective materials , block a clear facial capture of the wearer , developers claim
the retro - reflective materials on the glasses are designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful only during flash photography ( above how retro - reflective materials work on the glasses ) the infrared lights , placed around the eyes and nose areas of the glasses , breaks facial detection software
through the use of infrared light and retro - reflective materials , the glasses are designed to protects people 's online identities
2 ) retro - reflective materials : they are claimed to help maintain privacy at the moment that the image is actually taken
while most surfaces reflect light by diffusing or scattering it in all directions , retro - reflective materials are specially designed to reflect light back at the same angle as it arrived - which is useful during flash photography
