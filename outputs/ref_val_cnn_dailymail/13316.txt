novak djokovic led serbia to the quarterfinals of the davis cup after answering a late call to play in saturday 's last 16 doubles victory over neighbor and rival croatia
teammate troicki had been due to play in the doubles rubber alongside nenad zimonjic , but a draining five - set singles match with croatian teen starlet borna coric on friday convinced serbia coach bogdan obradovic to draft in the fresher novak djokovic
serbia has won the davis cup once before , in 2010 when it defeated croatia on the way to the final
meanwhile , defending champions switzerland , playing without roger federer or stan wawrinka , are on the brink after falling 2 - 1 behind belgium as michael lammer and adrien bossel lost 1 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 2 to ruben bemelmans and adrien bossel .
