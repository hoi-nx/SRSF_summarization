armed with a sharp sense of smell , dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers , and soon there could be sniffer elephants too
researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell , stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives
elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones

a stock image is shown the research was conducted in south africa and involved the us military
sniffing at buckets , they were rewarded with a treat of marula - a tasty fruit - when they showed that they recognised samples of tnt by raising a front leg

this image shows an a warning sign in an area littered with explosives last summer , researchers confirmed that south africa elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom
the elephants detected tnt samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered in a line of buckets , according to ashadee kay miller , a zoology student at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg
in an experiment conducted at a game reserve , elephants ( stock image ) sniffed at buckets some of which contained tnt
the creatures have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom all other buckets were filled with acetone and filter paper only
however , in the real world , making an elephant walk around a mine field would not only put the animal in danger , but would be impractical too
to overcome this problem , unmanned drones could collect scent samples from mined areas and bring them to a trained elephant , which would smell them and alert handlers to any sign of explosives , mr hensman said
the elephants detected tnt samples 73 out of the 74 times that they encountered its odour in a line of buckets , and could be used to sniff out landmines from a distance
here , a member of thailand 's first humanitarian mine action unit uses a mine detecting dog to search for land mines another possibility would be to replicate an elephant âs sense of smell and incorporate it into electronic sensors that detect dangerous materials , building on research with dogs and rats , mr lee said
research last year revealed that elephants have the best sense of smell in the animal kingdom , partially because they have 2,000 genes that are dedicated to scent
