damien and jenny markey were summarily dismissed by the university after articles in the daily mail highlighted how the institution spends public money , a union said
the couple , who have three young children , deny being the source of stories revealing that the university was lending vice-chancellor professor holmes Â£ 960,000 to buy a new house and spending up to Â£ 100,000 on staff away days to the lake district
mr damien , 42 , was dismissed as a senior lecturer in visual effects for film and television after a 45 - minute disciplinary hearing last friday for â leaking information to the press aimed at damaging the university â
according to his union he was told he had been overheard talking on his mobile phone using the words â boats â and â lakes â , and accused of being the source of the story that the university was sending its 700 staff to a lake district hotel in a series of away days for pep talks by professor holmes , who has a yacht moored nearby
details of the trips had been sent to all staff , while the two - year loan to professor holmes appeared in university accounts
the struggling university paid up to Â£ 100,000 to send all 700 of its staff for stays at four - star lakeside hotel and spa ( pictured ) in the lake district mr damien was also accused of making malicious statements about colleagues and bringing the university into disrepute for highlighting concerns about a shortage of equipment following an Â£ 800,000 flagship project , the union said
the couple have denied revealing that the university lent vice-chancellor professor holmes ( pictured ) Â£ 960,000 to buy a new house mr damien , who is said to have had an unblemished disciplinary record , was secretary of the local branch of the ucu ( ucu ) and led a walkout in 2013 in protest at a planned 1 per cent pay rise
nobody likes looking a bit silly in public , but to start axing staff without evidence is the response of a desperate despot , not a university vice-chancellor
â bizarrely , the university âs official twitter feed briefly â favourited â a ucu tweet branding 53 - year - old professor holmes a desperate despot
