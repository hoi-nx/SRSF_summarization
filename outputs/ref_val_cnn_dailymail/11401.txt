a grandmother was left shaking with worry after being sent an energy bill demanding more than Â£ 9,000 - despite her really only owing her energy supplier Â£ 59
corey , 72 , was sent a letter by british gas claiming they were planning on taking the huge sum from her bank account within days
she was told she owed more than Â£ 8,000 for gas and over Â£ 1,000 for electricity - 150 times more than the amount she actually had to pay
' mrs corey said she ' could n't stop shaking ' after opening the letter , that outlined how her direct debit arrangement had changed after she 'd agreed to a new tariff
' mrs corey said she feared the money would automatically be taken out of her account after getting the letter she added : ' and what if people do n't check things like i do and british gas try to take all that money out of their bank ? ' not many people will have that kind of cash in their account , so the payment wo n't go through , and that could cause all kinds of long - lasting problems
leigh francis said : ' when mrs corey contacted us about her energy tariff we set up her payment plan incorrectly
