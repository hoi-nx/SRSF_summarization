when a legendary figure like pat jennings says none of the other 1,097 matches in his career was comparable with the 1979 fa cup final between arsenal and united , you know it was something special
forever known as wembley 's ' five - minute final ' , arsenal threw away and then regained the trophy in an incredible late sequence that saw them squander a 2 - 0 lead going into the 86th minute before winning 3 - 2 in the final moments with a goal that put alan sunderland 's name in fa cup folklore
it created a superstar in arsenal 's man - of - the - match brady and broke the career of united manager sexton

he said , ' congratulations ' as we shook hands but as soon as i saw the cup , i turned around to lift it up to the arsenal fans
' mcilroy , who had scored united 's dramatic equaliser on a baking hot may afternoon , says the impact of the game has not diminished with time

' i played two short of 1,100 games and i have never known four minutes like that , ' adds pat jennings , a gentle giant of a goalkeeper who otherwise stayed unflappable in a 23 - year career with watford , spurs , arsenal and northern ireland

arsenal had not won a trophy for eight years , while united were rebuilding after the glory days of best , denis law and bobby charlton
for 85 minutes , the match appeared routine , with brian talbot scoring for arsenal after 12 minutes and frank stapleton adding to it with a 43rd - minute header
i 've got a picture on my trophy cabinet showing me kicking the ball and alan sunderland kicking my boot , ' says brian talbot
with arsenal leading 2 - 0 going into the final minutes , complacency crept in
