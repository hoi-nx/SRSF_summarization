two china men have been jailed for selling military intelligence , including hundreds of photos of china 's first aircraft carrier , to foreign spies , state media reported
according to the dalian daily , the two men , surnamed han and zhang , were sentenced to eight and six years in prison respectively earlier this year
last summer , he traveled to beijing and liaoning , in china 's northeast , to take photos , including images of exhibits at a national defense technology promotion show
the other man , zhang , 23 , had sent more than 500 pictures of the liaoning aircraft carrier , named after the province where it was refitted , to a person who claimed to be an editor with a foreign magazine before being detained last august
some internet users questioned whether it was really espionage to take photos of china 's aircraft carrier -- even former u.s. defense secretary chuck hagel visited the vessel in 2014
" i have photos of the aircraft carrier , too , " one person with the handle @ gablio posted on weibo , china 's equivalent to twitter
