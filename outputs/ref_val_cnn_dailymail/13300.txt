britain 's hamilton made the perfect start to his world title defense by winning the opening race of the f1 season in australia sunday to lead a mercedes one - two in melbourne
polesitter hamilton controlled the race on the albert park street circuit to win from teammate nico rosberg of germany
four - time world champion sebastian vettel took the final podium position for his new team ferrari , holding off felipe massa in the willams
it was the 34th career victory for two - time world champion hamilton and underlined the continued dominance of mercedes as he and nico rosberg pulled well clear of their nearest challengers
hamilton , who was forced to retire early in last year 's australia grand prix , was taking the checkered flag in melbourne for the first time since 2008 , when he claimed his first world title for mclaren
" then taking his courage in his hands , hamilton cheekily told ' the terminator ' " i thought you were taller ! " after getting the thoughts of nico rosberg and sebastian vettel , who said it was a " very big honor " to gain his first points for ferrari , schwarzenegger turned his attention back to hamilton
with hamilton winning his seventh race from eight starts , his f1 rivals would probably rather he stayed away and nico rosberg admitted " he was driving to his max " but could not match the pace of his teammate
