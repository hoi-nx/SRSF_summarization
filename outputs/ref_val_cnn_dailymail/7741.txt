look out for barbary apes , grins our guide : ' we often get raided , especially in the harvest
' ahmad , aged 72 , finds most things funny
he owns a donkey called ' easyjet ' and tells us that most of his neighbours will live to 105
our week in the rif , a mountainous region of morocco , follows this pattern - it is full of surprises
the tops of the mountains are dusted with snow , and yet , around the bottom , you can buy oranges as big as a baby 's head
a rif you 'll want to hear forever : the rif mountains are a beautiful - yet less known - part of morocco on ahmad 's country walks we see mountain women wearing wide - brimmed hats festooned with pom - poms
' the long - haired ones do n't come any more
the old parts are all a bluey - purple , as if the entire medina has been flushed with ink
this is not a place for ordinary shopping
after a few days , we head north
country and city : a woman from the rif region in traditional dress ( left ) ; the back streets of tangier ( right ) the rif may not be morocco 's tallest range , but it 's thrillingly wild
then , suddenly , we tumble out into tangier
this fabulous antique city feels only half - african
for a long time , it was ' the international zone ' ( 1923 - 1956 ) , and european appeared in droves
captivating : tangier - with its medina to the forefront - has long tempted european travellers to morocco deep in the medina , little alleyways turn into grand arabian palaces ( like al-makhzen ) , or perhaps the house of barbara hutton , once the richest woman in the world
enjoy this mad city , walk everywhere , do everything and then retreat to the hotel 's roof
in one direction lies spain ( only eight miles away , across the med ) and in the other lies the rif , now looking pink and mysterious and deceptively tame
