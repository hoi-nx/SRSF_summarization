you may have heard that israeli politics is extremely complex
understand that , and you will understand israeli -- and why president obama may have inadvertently given benjamin netanyahu a helping hand
this reality helps explain how benjamin netanyahu and his rightist likud party pulled off an upset victory this week , despite opinion polls showing them trailing the main opposition zionist union heading into tuesday 's election
benjamin netanyahu 's opponents also failed to address security issues , believing a focus on pocketbook matters would be enough
when benjamin netanyahu traveled to washington a couple of weeks ago to warn the u.s. congress about an impending " bad deal " with iran over its nuclear program , obama refused to meet with him , claiming he did n't want to influence israeli 's elections
by appearing to dismiss benjamin netanyahu 's warning of a " nuclear nightmare " over the iran talks by arguing that the prime minister was offering no " viable alternatives , " obama missed an opportunity to reassure security conscious israeli that the u.s. will safeguard their survival
opinion : will benjamin netanyahu win seal iran deal ? the fact that obama has become one of the key reasons why benjamin netanyahu continues to win elections in israeli is ironic considering israeli are profoundly worried about the deteriorating ties with the u.s. , a relationship they consider key to ensuring their country 's survival
one recent poll showed only 37 % of israeli believe obama has a " positive " position towards israeli , a mood that has undoubtedly helped benjamin netanyahu enormously , despite the fact that large numbers of former security officials have said benjamin netanyahu is endangering the country by undermining ties with washington , and despite israeli saying close relations with the u.s. are the second most important factor for israeli 's security , behind only israeli 's own military strength
5 questions about benjamin netanyahu 's apparent victory yet despite the positive sentiment in principle , israeli voters -- especially on the right -- have been skeptical that obama has their best interests at heart
this point was underscored in a recent poll that asked israeli recently if they believed president obama would agree to a deal that israeli officials considered harmful to israeli 's security
however , 95 % of labor supporters said no , obama would do no such thing , while 93 % of likud voters said they believed obama would disregard israeli 's security
and despite the last - minute statements from benjamin netanyahu dismissing the idea , it is important to remember that polls have consistently shown israeli continue to support the establishment of a palestinian state , as long as israeli 's security can be assured
so when rightist leaders such as benjamin netanyahu say israeli will not be safe with a palestinian state , voters are inclined to believe them
