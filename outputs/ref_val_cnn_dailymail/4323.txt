scientists say sharing sad emotions helps women bond
but now scientists have come up with a suggestion â sharing sad emotions helps women bond
a research team at cardiff university found that by sharing their emotions women found the happy parts of films more joyful and the sad bits less sad
â the study involved 30 pairs of female friends aged between 20 and 33 who were shown emotionally powerful images and asked to rate them on a scale from â very negative â to â very positive â
the scientists put one of each pair in a brain scanner to monitor their reactions , and the volunteers were also asked to view and rate the images while on their own and also while together
the researchers found the images were seen more positively when the pairs were together , the sunday times reported
