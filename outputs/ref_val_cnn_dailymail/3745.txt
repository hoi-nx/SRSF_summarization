so architects have now designed skyscrapers which do n't block out the light by diffusing it onto a wide area in a bid to tackle the problem of shade encroaching on public space in london
the revolutionary ' shadow ' design is the brainchild of architects nbbj , who used a computer program to design two buildings , which work together to disperse and refract sunlight
architects have designed skyscrapers which do n't block out the light by diffusing it onto a wide area the theoretical development has been touted for construction at the greenwich , close to the o2 arena , but similar buildings could be constructed in cities all over the world
coop , nbbj 's design director , said : ' the relationship between the sun and shadow is the relationship between the two buildings
the revolutionary ' shadow ' design is the brainchild of architects nbbj , who used a computer program to design two building the theoretical development has been touted for construction at the greenwich , close to the o2 arena he said the method could also be adapted to control how much sunlight is reflected at different times of year
' they are designed so that when one building creates shade , the other can act as a huge curved mirror , allowing the light to be reflected downwards into its shadow planning permission has been approved or is pending approval for 236 new high - rise buildings in central london , pictured is the gherkin , the cheesegrater and the walkie talkie dr philip oldfield , an expert in tall buildings at the university of nottingham 's department of architecture , said : ' what 's great about the project is the focus on tall - building form and shape , not only to look dramatic , but to contribute to creating a comfortable space at ground level
