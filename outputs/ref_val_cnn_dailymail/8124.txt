the most surprising thing about new york fashion week this year was n't what the models were wearing , but what they were drinking
the elixir on every fashionista 's lips was bone broth , which is being sold by the cup from a hip new manhattan shop
aficionados claim that it is rich in amino acids - the building blocks of protein - calcium and collagen , and that drinking it will do everything from warding off illnesses to curing joint pain , and giving you healthy skin , nails and hair
and at just 86 calories per cup , it 's a very slimming lunch option
it 's catching on here , too - celebrity chefs jasmine and melissa hemsley , whose healthy cookbook the art of eating well knocked jamie oliver and mary berry off the top of the amazon charts , advocate ladlefuls of bone broth in everything from stews to scrambled eggs
it may sound like old - fashioned stock , but fans claim bone broth is different because it simmers for eight hours longer , which helps break down the protein you get from the bones
