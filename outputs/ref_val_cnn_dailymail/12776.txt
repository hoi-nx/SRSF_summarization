instead of bees hovering around a tree , imagine cheese balls
solo cups in the place of birds , glow sticks as locusts
what seems like a figment of a wild imagination becomes reality in thomas jackson 's " emergent behavior " series
thomas jackson grew up in rhode island and worked in publishing in new york for 13 years , ultimately landing his dream gig as an editor with forbes magazine
after a charming series featuring a robot , he struck a cadence in creating " swarms " with inanimate objects such as post-it notes and plastic plates
" i started creating these whimsical , fantastic scenarios in which the environment is exploiting us , " thomas jackson explained
more than half of thomas jackson 's " emergent behavior " series is digitally untouched
how thomas jackson gets a tubful of cheese balls to hang purposefully around the trunk of a tree seems nonsensical
the cups , already at odds with nature , look as though they are a flock of birds flying along the rocks
thomas jackson seemingly casts a magic spell of manic movement , creating what an internet commentator calls " a frat party being sucked into a black hole
" the idea of a swarm -- be it insects or " thank you " bags -- fascinates thomas jackson
