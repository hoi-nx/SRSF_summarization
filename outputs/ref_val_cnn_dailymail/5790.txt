mary bousted , general secretary of the atl , has warned of a ' crisis ' in the teaching profession almost half of new teachers leave the profession in their first year because of an excessive workload and ' exhausted and stressed colleagues ' , a union leader has warned
the most recent statistics show that in 2011 , around 10,800 newly - qualified teachers did not take up a teaching post â up from 3,600 in 2005
around 40 per cent of newly - qualified teachers were not in the classroom after a year in 2011 â compared to 20 per cent in 2005
she spoke of a â crisis of teacher supply â because trainee teachers are put off during work placements by the prospect of heavy workloads , excessive monitoring and poor pay
; she added : ' why are we losing the next generation of teachers - that new blood for the profession which should be bright - eyed and bushy - tailed , full of promise and ambition ? ' is it , i wonder , because trainee and newly - qualified teachers see very early on just what teaching has become and decide that they do not want to be a part of it ? she said trainee teachers are put off during work placements by the prospect of heavy workloads , excessive monitoring and poor pay ( posed by model ) ' is it that they learn as they work with exhausted and stressed colleagues that teaching has become a profession which is incompatible with a normal life ? ' trainee and newly - qualified teachers can not fail to understand that , despite michael gove 's intentions , teaching has become a profession monitored to within an inch of its life
' dr mary bousted added : ' seeing what teaching has become , and what the prospect of a career in teaching holds for them , is it in any way surprising that trainee and newly - qualified teachers make the decision to make use of their talents and abilities in a different profession ? ' it is sad - but true - that students and nqts are being told by the teachers they meet during training that with current workload , inspection and pay , this is no career to enter
