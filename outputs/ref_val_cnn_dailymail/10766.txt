the race for places in the champions league among the premier league 's top clubs has just become more urgent after uefa announced significant increases in prize money for their top competition from next season
cash for appearing in the group stages onwards is leaping by up to 50 per cent , and for english clubs there will also be steep hikes in ' market pool ' money from uefa 's tv incomes
the upshot is that if an english club were to win next season 's champions league , they would earn around â¬ 100m ( or Â£ 74m at today 's exchange rates ) from central uefa funds alone
real madrid 's financial reward for retaining the champions league would be even bigger than last year chelsea 's champions league exit at the hands of psg has cost them a share of more lucrative prize money to put that in context , england 's highest - earning club in last season 's champions league was manchester united , who earned â¬ 44.8m ( Â£ 33m ) from uefa for reaching the quarter - finals
as things stand , the four champions league slots for next season are filled by chelsea , manchester city , arsenal and manchester united - with that quartet the favourites to reach uefa 's top club competition
but liverpool in fifth , southampton in sixth and tottenham in seventh will still hold out hopes they can finish strongly and perhaps squeak into the top four
under current prize money arrangements , clubs reaching the group stage receive â¬ 8.6m ( Â£ 6.4m ) each plus â¬ 1m ( Â£ 750,000 ) per group win and â¬ 0.5m ( Â£ 370,000 ) per draw
danny welbeck will have extra reason to celebrate if arsenal qualify for the champions league next season manchester united won Â£ 33m after losing their quarter - final last year - but that will soon look relatively small brendan rodgers and raheem sterling will now be even more desperate to finish in the top four this term manchester city flopped again among uefa 's elite , but they are set for another windfall next season the most any team will be able to win will from ' basic ' prize cash - before tv market share cash - will jump from â¬ 37.4m ( Â£ 27.7m ) to â¬ 54.5 ( Â£ 40.4m ) , a hike of 46 per cent
sevilla won the uefa europa league last season , and uefa 's second - tier club competition is getting a cash boost the likes of tottenham will benefit from the extra uefa europa league cash , if they do not finish in the top four whichever way the sums are calculated , being in the champions league is about to become hugely more lucrative for english teams in particular
currently for every pound uefa give in prize money to uefa europa league clubs , champions league clubs get Â£ 4.30
