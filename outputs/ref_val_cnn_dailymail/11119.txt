italy researchers have discovered a way to convert the liquid state of extra virgin olive oil into a gel , without the need for other solids
the so - called gel oil comes in different flavours ( shown above ) known as gel oil , the food scientists said it can be added to salads and sandwiches , used in cooking and can be flavoured
variations include lemon and basil
olive oil ( pictured ) has long been linked with lower levels of cholesterol , blood pressure and a multitude of other health benefits the discovery was made by 10 chemical engineers from the italy university of calabria in the southern town of arcavacata
they used a technique called ' organogelazione ' which involves subjecting the properties of certain molecules known in the food industry , such as emulsifiers , to a range of temperatures
when these molecules are heated and mixed they were found to form new structures
the university 's food engineering department headed by professor bruno de cindio said : ' in this network structure , the oil remains ' trapped ' within the changing texture and transforms itself , in the first stage , into a gel form and , in a second stage , into a creamy spreadable paste
' he added that said that this also means it can be produced in various consistencies from a slightly stickier version ideal for dressing salads and other foods to a more solid variation that can be spread like margarine or butter on bread
the team are now hoping to create a company to sell gel oil and already developing variations flavoured with lemon and basil
' people are increasingly being forced to have fast food meals and that means ready to eat products , but at the same time there is reluctance to compromise on quality and taste and our product very much caters to this market
it added just 20mls a day â about four teaspoons - to the diet of healthy adults , which is the amount used in a salad dressing or mopped up by bread during a meal
