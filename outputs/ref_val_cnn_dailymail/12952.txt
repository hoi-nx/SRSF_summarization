the first official visit of afghan president ashraf ghani to washington comes as excitement mounts over the possibility that direct peace negotiations between the afghan government and the taliban are imminent
the reality is that an agreement with the taliban that is good for the afghan government is probably impossible right now
negotiations to end the taliban insurgency face a series of significant challenges , and an imperfect deal could harm afghan 's nascent unity government , encourage the formation of splinter groups of hardened fighters , boost existing terrorist groups like al qaeda and isis and plunge the country into an era of renewed violence and instability
that said , the u.s. should remain broadly supportive of these talks by promoting conditions that could make the possibility of success more likely down the road -- history has shown that successful negotiations most often occur when each party has some vulnerability to the other
militarily , the taliban is not the afghan government 's equal , but that does not mean the insurgents lack a strong negotiating position
for a start , the international presence in afghan is declining , freeing the taliban to operate more openly in the rural corners of the country
meanwhile , afghan security forces are being killed at rates that are probably not sustainable and civilian casualties are at an all - time high
a second key to negotiating a path toward peace in afghan is devising a strategy to contain splinter groups
what can the u.s. do ? two things : first , the obama administration could agree to the afghan government 's request to slow u.s. troop withdrawals
this would allow the u.s. to assist the afghan government to stabilize the country and contain any splintering anti-government factions
second , the u.s. could remain actively engaged in promoting the success of the afghan national unity government
for example , the u.s. could support emerging efforts to build a meaningful relationship between afghan and its neighbor pakistan , which would increase public confidence in the government 's ability to protect its people
sowing the seeds of future success in bringing peace to afghan requires no new u.s. boots on the ground or extravagant financial commitments
