one of the skiing highlights is a 42 kilometre loop of slopes around the sellaronda which offers mouth - wateringly panoramic views of the valleys below
the loop links the four valleys , encouraging experienced thrill - seekers to ski the clockwise route , while those still getting their bearings are best going the other way
