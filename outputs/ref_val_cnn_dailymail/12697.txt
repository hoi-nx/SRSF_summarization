nearly 70 years ago , comic strip detective dick tracy showed off his first two - way wrist radio , inspiring baby boomers to babble into their knuckles in pursuit of bad guys like pruneface and the mole
a half - century later the future is finally here , with a new wave of tracy-esque devices certain to accelerate following the much anticipated debut of apple watch in april -- which became official with the company 's " spring forward " preview on monday
in classic fashion , consumers huddled around apple watch stores to get a peek , some even showing up wearing padded wrist " hoodies " to make room for the watch when it goes on sale next month
naturally , apple watch faithful were urged on by tim cook , who tweeted : " got some extra rest for today 's event
" arianna huffington weighed in on twitter , too : " looking forward to a smart watch that tells me not to cram too many things into too few hours
prices for the new watch range from $ 349 to a reported high of $ 17,000 for an 18 - karat gold version to make any rolex show - off feel at home
enthusiasm for apple watch -- and its long line of apps -- could lift the fortunes of samsung , sony , pebble and others pitching their own interactive watches , making the human wrist the most coveted piece of real estate since the redevelopment of times square
if apple watch does indeed take off , it would reignite the emerging -- but tricky -- market for wearable devices following google 's sudden move in january to halt public sales of its glass product , which failed to catch on in light of what the wall street journal said were concerns over " privacy , technical shortcomings and a lack of obvious uses
as the wearables wrist race heats up , it 's worth considering how these meta - timepieces -- with their tactile messaging , biometric loops and eye - controlled display screens -- could alter everyday behavior and spur new codes of etiquette , not to mention a few novel personality disorders
one of the most awaited features of apple watch will be its " taptic " engine , a sensory feedback tool derived from gamer joystick technology that allows for personalized tapping vibrations -- a " yo " - like blip for a work pal or an echo of your own heartbeat captured through an embedded cardio sensor
of course , your intended recipients will need their own apple watch watch to " feel " your greeting
as an accessory , smart watches are perfect for new spatial positioning technology , such as apple watch 's ibeacon , which can triangulate a user 's exact location inside a building and allow targeted messaging when deployed in , say , a supermarket
anyone who 's ever been trapped in an interminable business meeting or on an awkward date knows there are only so many ways you can discreetly glance at your watch before it becomes obvious
definitely expect to see more people fiddling with their sleeves , admiring their nails and earnestly cupping their brows with their opposite hand , in order to get a better look at the action on their watch
as an unexpected boon to evolution , apple watch may soon be responsible for helping humans achieve a new level of ambidexterity , along with super-strong eye muscles
of course , a constantly raised wrist puts a strain on the shoulder , which suggests we 'll soon be hearing about exercises designed to prevent watch fatigue
with so many digital features to track personal fitness -- including apple watch 's " accelerometer , " which will measure total body movement , as well as the number of steps and calories burned in a day -- the new wearables aspire to promote extreme wellness
