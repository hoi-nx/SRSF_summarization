ed miliband today admitted the race for number 10 is ' neck and neck ' as he launched labour 's election campaign at the olympic park
the labour leader used a speech at the top of the orbit tower overlooking the london 2012 stadium to urge a ' spirit of optimism ' and a belief that ' britain can do better ' he signalled once again that the nhs will be at the heart of his bid for power , announcing a new cap on the profits private firms can make from the health service
polls suggested david cameron secured a narrow victory over his rival , but labour strategists believe it exposed the prime minister 's refusal to go head - to - head in a debate
' but he insisted that labour has ' a better plan , a better future '
mr ed miliband laid out his pitch for power the morning after his mauling at the hands of jeremy paxman in the first tv contest of the campaign mr ed miliband announced a labour government would act to ensure health services are no longer ' threatened ' by privatisation mr ed miliband announced a labour government would act to ensure health services are no longer ' threatened ' by privatisation
but he was forced to defend himself against claims that he was scaremongering by referring to ' privatisation ' when no patients are expected to pay for their treatment up front
under labour 's plans , a new profit cap - usually 5 per cent - would be set on outsourced healthcare contracts worth over Â£ 500,000 , private companies would be blocked from ' cherry - picking ' lucrative treatments and the nhs would become the ' preferred provider ' for all services
' tory health secretary jeremy hunt said : â if you bankrupt the economy like labour did last time â then you âll put our nhs at risk
â we all know labour want to â weaponise â the nhs but this is another policy from ed miliband that looks ill - thought through
