the allegations were as vindictive and damaging as they were utterly false
yet they all but destroyed primary school teacher brendan
brendan , 45 , had for 16 years been an exemplary teacher : popular with pupils and respected by colleagues
brendan o'brien ( pictured with his wife , jane ) had 18 charges made against him concerning child abuse a Â£ 25,000 legal bill exhausted his entire savings and ate into those of his parents
and this awful ordeal was caused by five boy pupils from his west yorkshire primary school who accused him of sexual abuse
it âs the worst accusation that could be levied against a teacher
and in today âs climate , where historic cases of the abuse of children are as prolific as they are disturbing , the police , quite rightly , had to act
but once the boys â present and past pupils aged ten to 12 â had made the allegations that their teacher had inappropriately touched them and instigated sexual activity , the machinery of the law was set in motion
in january , a year after brendan was first arrested , a jury at leeds crown court acquitted him , swiftly and unanimously , on all charges
he had pleaded not guilty to 17 counts of sexual assault on a male child under the age of 13 and one count of causing or inciting a male child under 13 to engage in sexual activity
brendan and jane 's ( pictured ) lives were destroyed when the allegations against brian were made so how could brendan be left with a life in tatters while five malicious trouble - makers are carrying on with their lives , without so much as a telling off ? these are questions brendan and jane , 43 , a reflexologist and sales assistant , are asking themselves
brendan says : â when i was charged , i was no longer mr brendan , a respected village primary school teacher
i became introverted , and i lost 2 st. yet the boys who accused me have been able to hide behind a curtain of anonymity while my name was publicised
â shattered is the correct word : brendan âs teaching contract was terminated in july
brendan âs nightmare began in january last year
brendan had already spoken about him to the school âs headteacher
brendan ( pictured ) had , for 16 years , been an exemplary teacher : popular with pupils and respected by colleagues â i was completely , utterly dumbfounded
on that january day , brendan spent nine hours in police custody where every aspect of his teaching style was scrutinised
â child sexual abuse costs the uk an estimated Â£ 3.2 billion a year because of social care , health problems and legal bills jane , his wife of ten years , was by now dealing with her own shock
jane recalls : â my initial thought was that brendan had been in an accident
although i knew brendan had done nothing wrong , i felt as though we were criminals
â when brendan arrived home at 6.30pm , he was exhausted and bewildered
last march , brendan was arrested again
the youngest had boasted he would â get mr brendan fired â
even his own mother admitted in a meeting at his school , after brendan âs arrest , she âd seen nothing in her son âs behaviour to indicate he had been abused
â brendan had always been so full of life and very jovial , but overnight his character changed
â brendan endured further distress when a local radio station misinterpreted the charges against him and broadcast that he âd had sex with young boys
brendan and jane â whose daughters are 19 and 22 â had long dreamt of having a child of their own
â but with abuse charges hanging over brendan , we would never be considered , â says jane
the legal proceedings consumed their savings , and brendan âs parents â in no doubt of their son âs innocence â chipped in
brendan ( pictured ) says he became consumed by fear and was prescribed antidepressants for his anxiety and tremors as the case approached , a swell of support buoyed them up
brendan recalls : â parents of ex-pupils would stop me in the street and give me a hug , all of them telling me they did nât believe a word of the claims
mercifully , the jury took just an hour to dismiss each of the charges against brendan
â i just wanted to run to brendan and hug him
â justice had prevailed , but at what cost ? â i do nât know whether i will ever completely recover , â says brendan
â jane adds : â i can never forgive brendan âs accusers
â and one thing is certain : i do nât want brendan to return to a classroom ever again
