shankar had the idea for " power / rangers " when he was 7 years old
" this was before the internet , and my access to tv and video games was pretty limited , " the producer recalled thursday , in the midst of the " power / rangers " frenzy
but the producer , now 30 , got his wish when his dark version of the " power rangers , " directed by friend kahn , made it online -- and proceeded to rack up more than 11 million views on youtube in less than two days
fans buzzing over bloody ' power / rangers ' ' bootleg ' in some ways , shankar is still getting into trouble
not only did the video explode the power rangers mythology , showing the impact of serving as " child soldiers , " in shankar 's phrase , but the video became a legal football after the owner of the franchise , saban entertainment , claimed infringement
i claim no rights to any of the characters ( do n't send me any money , not kickstarted , this film is free )
" saban entertainment has its own plans to reboot the popular ' 90s franchise with a theatrical film scheduled for 2016
' an interesting experiment ' so who are these guys , anyway ? kahn is a famed music video director , probably best known for britney spears ' " toxic , " eminem 's " without me " ( for which he won a grammy ) and taylor swift 's " blank space
" shankar is a producer of such films as " the grey , " " killing them softly " and " dredd
" this is n't the first time he 's made a " bootleg " short
in a reddit ama , kahn said that " power / rangers " was " self - funded
shankar declined to give a budget for " power / rangers , " which was shot over a few days last year , but says it was mainly financed through favors and the principals ' money
" the film also starred " battlestar galactica 's " katee sackhoff
kahn said he was drawn to " power / rangers " because " it was an interesting experiment to play with reboot culture and tone control
... i did n't come into it to please a fan base , per se , but to experiment with pop culture
in the video he made to explain " power / rangers , " he 's wearing eye makeup like the 1970s alice cooper , a look he adopted " because i do n't want to be ( an indian ) stereotype , " he told cnn
there was no consistency for me in a cultural context " except for american movies and pop culture
" though both men were successful before , " power / rangers " has given them new visibility -- partly thanks to the bottom - up enthusiasm for the project
" internet changes things , " kahn tweeted after congratulating supporters
" shankar observes that " power / rangers " is just another marker in a continuing debate between creativity , intellectual property and fan - driven culture
