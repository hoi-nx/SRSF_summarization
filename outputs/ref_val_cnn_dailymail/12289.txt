one of the two oklahoma students expelled for their role in leading a racist chant has issued an apology , the dallas morning news reported
" i am deeply sorry for what i did saturday night
it was wrong and reckless
i made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same , " parker rice said in a statement printed by the newspaper
earlier tuesday , parker rice and another student were expelled over their alleged " leadership role " in a racist chant by sae fraternity members , a decision that president boren says speaks to his school 's " zero tolerance " policy for such " threatening racist behavior
" the decision comes two days after a video of frat members singing a racist song surfaced and hours after boren told cnn he would suspend or expel the group 's ringleaders if at all possible
" at this point , all i can do is be thoughtful and prayerful about my next steps , but i am also concerned about the fraternity friends still on campus
apparently , they are feeling unsafe and some have been harassed by others
hopefully , the university will protect them , " parker rice reportedly said in his apology
already , the greek letters sigma , alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house 's facade , the house will be closed as of midnight tuesday and the university will board up the windows , following up on separate decisions by the university and the sae national headquarters to shutter the oklahoma chapter , boren said
fraternity 's house mom sings n - word parker rice has not responded to multiple requests from cnn for comment
" for me , this is a devastating lesson and i am seeking guidance on how i can learn from this and make sure it never happens again
my goal for the long - term is to be a man who has the heart and the courage to reject racism wherever i see or experience it in the future , " his apology read
it was only a nine - second clip , but the backlash has been disastrous
party - bound students are seen on a bus clapping , pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , " there will never be a ni * * * * sae
you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me
there will never be a ni * * * * sae
" after the campus organization , unheard , and the school newspaper received the clip via anonymous messages and publicized it , the university and the fraternity 's national chapter acted swiftly to shutter the sae house in norman
boren promised the university 's affiliation with the fraternity was done
it 's likely that if the university had n't acted , the justice department 's civil rights division could have stepped in , said arnwine , president and executive director of the lawyers ' committee for civil rights under law
title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 " prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , color , and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance , " according to the justice department
in this case , arnwine said , the university likely found that fraternity members appear not only to have discriminated in their membership -- and backed that discrimination with the threat of lynching -- but they 've also created a hostile environment
the university , she said , " would 've been compelled to do something to sanction and prevent this fraternity from engaging in racial discrimination
" arnwine said she was n't personally familiar with the school 's code of conduct , but she 'd be surprised if the fraternity members ' actions were n't in violation of university rules as well
just as they protested loudly monday , students on tuesday were emphatic in expressing their relief and satisfaction that those allegedly responsible for leading the racist chant got their due
" for people who do n't know the oklahoma , are n't part of the student body , it 's a black eye that does n't really deserve to be there
" another student , junior jake hewitt , applauded the university and the fraternity 's national president for their handling of the incident
shortly after the expulsions were announced , senior humphrey , an american modern dance student , told cnn , " i think it 's rightfully so that they were ( kicked out )
i am , as most of the student body -- not just the american students -- we 're all disheartened by the situation
" he is still a " proud student , " he said , and he understands that the fraternity members in question represent " just some microbial infestation that 's on campus
sae is no stranger to scandal and sanctions davis said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend , as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved
