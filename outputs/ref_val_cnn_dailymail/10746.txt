a teenage boy has described the bizarre moment he was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test
byron geldard , from huntingdon , cambridgeshire , was given the test by doctors because the disease can cause the body to make the same hormone produced during pregnancy
after getting a positive result , the 19 - year - old was given the devastating news he had the disease and began seven months of treatment
the disease can cause the body to produce the same hormone as produced during pregnancy after the ' positive ' result , the 19 - year - old began months of treatment at addenbrooke 's hospital , cambridge mr byron geldard said : ' it was all very surreal to be honest
' there i was with a positive pregnancy test and something growing inside me
' home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta
experts say beta hcg can also signal testicular cancer
dr danish mazhar , consultant medical oncologist at cambridge university hospitals , said : ' the pregnancy hormone ( hcg ) is often ( but not always ) produced by testicular tumours
' in cases where the cancer has spread , the level of the hcg can be very high and if the clinical picture fits with a testicular cancer then a pregnancy test , which effectively is a test for hcg in the urine , can be used to make the diagnosis
' home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta
experts say beta hcg can also signal testicular cancer
cornes , male cancer information nurse at the charity orchid , told mailonline : hcg is one of three blood tests performed in all men with testicular cancer - it identifies how active and possibly widespread the cancer may be
' however he stressed there are two types of testicular cancer - and hgc is not present in the majority of cases of the most common form
and any man worried should not use a pregnancy test as a diagnostic tool
mr cornes added : ' to be picked up by a urine pregnancy test , the level of hcg has to be very high which will not be the case for many testicular cancers
' it is not and never has been a standard test ' hcg can also be raised in the presence of other things such as illegal performance enhancing drugs ( used by athletes etc. ) ' mr byron geldard claims his hospital experience was as bizarre as his diagnosis
' mr byron geldard had just returned from a boy 's holiday in kavos last august , when a niggling pain in his side became too hard to ignore
' i was told that it was cancer - but they were n't sure what type - and that i would probably need chemotherapy
' mr byron geldard was referred to the teenage cancer trust unit in cambridge , where doctors tried to determine what type of cancer he was suffering from
it was there that he was asked to provide a sample for a pregnancy test , to determine if the tumour was producing the hormones linked to both pregnancy , and testicular cancer
looking back , mr byron geldard said : ' it 's really hard to describe how it felt - you do n't really come to terms with what 's going on , you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me ' after getting a positive result from the pregnancy test , mr byron geldard was diagnosed with stage four testicular cancer - which had spread to his abdomen and lungs
in 2012 , a man credited the popular social news site reddit with helping him catch his testicular cancer at an early stage
' if this is true , you should check yourself for testicular cancer
he said : ' i gave the hospital a urine sample , the pregnancy test came back positive , and i started chemotherapy the day after i was diagnosed
' i 'm doing stand up comedy about testicular cancer , as i think people need to be educated about it more
testicular cancer ( pictured ) is one of the most treatable forms of cancer cancer of the testicles most commonly affects men aged 15 to 45 , with around 2,200 cases diagnosed each year
if caught at an early stage , men can expect a high cure rate with 98 per cent of sufferers disease - free a year after treatment
unlike many cancers , there are few known risk factors for testicular cancer
having a brother or father affected by testicular cancer can also increase a man 's risk
