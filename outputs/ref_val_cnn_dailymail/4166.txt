south africa won their first knockout match ever in a world cup as they cruised to a nine - wicket victory over sri lanka in their quarter - final on wednesday
in what proved to be kumar sangakkara and jayawardene âs final one - day international matches for sri lanka , south africa showed they are not a side willing to hold on to the tag of â chokers â
an immense display with the ball , from spinners imran tahir and jp duminy , and in the field helped south africa bowl out their opponents for a paltry 133 , before the under - pressure quinton de kock hit a sublime unbeaten 78
