atlanta nearly 30 years after the first u.s. stealth bomber took flight , the air force 's aging fleet is primed for a makeover ; albeit an expensive one
the pentagon is looking to upgrade its stealth aircraft for the first time since the 1970s , developing a high - priority , super-classified , next - generation bomber
the air force plans to award a contract to build and develop the long range strike bomber to one of the industry 's most powerful firms later this year and hopes to integrate them into the fleet by the mid- 2020s
competing for the prize are northrop grumman , the developer of the air force 's current bomber , the b-2 , and a partnership between aeronautic juggernauts boeing and lockheed martin
before the house armed services committee earlier this month , laplante , assistant secretary of the air force for acquisition , suggested the air force will offer a " cost - plus " contract to the winning firm , meaning the government will take on the risk of any cost overrun
the air force has said it plans to leverage existing technologies to help keep the long range strike bomber affordable
" along with the f-35 joint strike fighter and the kc-46 tanker , the long range strike bomber is one of the air force 's top modernization priorities , and some experts say its development will go far beyond simply upgrading an aging bomber fleet
retired air force lt. gen. deptula told cnn this week that it is inaccurate to label the long range strike bomber as simply a " bomber " and that officials need to shed the " old think " way of categorizing airplanes into different mission areas
pentagon officials have stressed the importance of developing the new long - range strike bomber calling it critical to national security and nuclear deterrence
officials have been tight - lipped as to the specific capability expectations for the long range strike bomber , but indications are that it will be stealth , able to carry conventional and nuclear weapons and could possibly operate both with or without a pilot
" generally speaking , deptula said the long range strike bomber must have long - range capabilities , be able to carry a large payload , have high survivability and have sufficient adaptability to incorporate evolving sensor and weapon technology
the mysterious long range strike bomber program is the most expensive weapons system under the air force 's $ 17 billion research , development , test and evaluation funding request for 2016
the air force requested $ 1.2 billion for the program under the president obama 's $ 534 billion proposed 2016 pentagon budget
since 2011 , the pentagon has said the long range strike bomber bomber will cost close to $ 550 million per airplane , projecting a $ 55 billion price total for 100 planes
critics insist the actual cost of the long range strike bomber will exceed the initial $ 500 million estimate ; yet pentagon officials continue to publicly tout the cost figure
the pentagon 's future years defense program projects the long range strike bomber 's budget will increase to $ 3.7 billion for research , development , test and evaluation in 2020 , bringing the total development cost to roughly $ 24 billion , according to the csba
