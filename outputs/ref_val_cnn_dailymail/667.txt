button found a glimmer of hope in mclaren 's dismal start to the formula one season when he at least finished sunday 's australian grand prix
mclaren driver button finished last at the season - opening australian grand prix button waves to the crowd ahead of the race
mclaren have endured a difficult start to the season ' today also really helps in terms of development
' button missed out on a championship point but he said that was almost irrelevant after a weekend when everything went wrong for the sport 's second most successful team , who have not won a race since 2012
' mclaren had low expectations after button and kevin magnussen were the slowest qualifiers
kevin magnussen is presented to the crowd before the race , but the dane failed to make the start after his honda engine blew on the way to the grid ' even though i could n't make the start , the team can learn something from my car 's problem , ' said kevin magnussen , who was recalled after fernando alonso was ruled out on medical advice following a crash in testing
' we can take positives from button finishing the race , too - we came here to learn , and that 's what we did
finishing is a small victory for the team - i do n't think we expected to be able to do that
