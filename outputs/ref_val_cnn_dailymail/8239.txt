roy hodgson is holding his cards close to his chest with three lions âs squad due to be announced this week
three lions meet lithuania at wembley in euro 2016 qualifying on march 27 before travelling to the juventus stadium in turin for a friendly with italy four days later
the last time three lions played was in mid-november , when they beat scotland and slovenia with wayne rooney , danny welbeck , rickie lambert and saido berhaino
harry kane , daniel sturridge , charlie austin and danny ings are among those that could be selected , and roy hodgson is set to pick four from the eight available
three lions captain wayne rooney , pictured celebrating against scotland , looks a certainty to be picked harry kane , tottenham against arsenal on february 7 , harry kane scored twice in front of watching three lions manager roy hodgson to win the north london derby
harry kane is used to leading a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 at tottenham , and would have to adapt to a partnership in roy hodgson âs classic 4 - 4 - 2 midfield diamond formation
even so , the question is not should roy hodgson pick the highest scoring english , but rather how could he not ? verdict : should go tottenham striker harry kane beats qpr goalkeeper robert green last week harry kane celebrates one of his many goals this season as the striker gets noticed in the premier league harry kane will hope to be involved in roy hodgson 's three lions squad when it is announced this week charlie austin , qpr qpr vs tottenham was billed as the battle of the two best kids on the playground yet , with teacher watching on , harry kane overshadowed his potential three lions team - mate
austin ranks first in total shots ( 61 ) and shooting accuracy ( 67 per cent ) out of the eight potential three lions forwards , having played more minutes ( 2,169 ) than any of the others this season
charlie austin âs goals have contributed 45 per cent of qpr âs points this season , and manager chris ramsey reckons he and harry kane would complement each other in a front two partnership
verdict : should go qpr striker charlie austin scores against arsenal at loftus road earlier in march in the premier league three lions hopeful austin is in contention to be selected by roy hodgson when his squad is announced this week wayne rooney , manchester united wayne rooney , no longer being restricted to deep midfield , was restored to an attacking role recently , and scored twice against sunderland to show he has nât lost his touch
wayne rooney looked comfortable up top against arsenal on monday night , scoring manchester united âs only goal in a 2 - 1 defeat
verdict : should go wayne rooney has become the regular face of three lions and is set to be selected once more by roy hodgson wayne rooney celebrates young 's wining goal at st james ' park for louis van gaal 's manchester united daniel sturridge , liverpool daniel sturridge is just returning from a thigh and hamstring injury that cost him five months , but has the third best minutes - per - goal ratio ( 175 ) of the eight strikers
easing daniel sturridge back in to middle of liverpool âs 3 - 4 - 3 is only natural , but he should be fit enough to be used internationally this month
roy hodgson has put plenty of faith in his young lions previously , and could well choose to give the 21 - year - old his three lions debut in march
but the fight to be roy hodgson âs fourth striker arguably rests between berahino , danny ings , austin and danny welbeck
verdict : should not go west brom striker berahino is in contention to be selected by three lions manager hodgson berahino runs away in celebration after scoring for west brom in the premier league against aston villa berahino could be selected as he continues to show why he deserves a place in the three lions team danny ings , burnley what about the chap wanted by liverpool , both manchester clubs and real sociedad ? danny ings has scored nine goals for second - bottom burnley â five of them in 2015 alone â and has the joint-most assists of the lot ( four )
verdict : should not go ... yet danny ings is wanted by a number of top premier league clubs and could be called up by three lions danny ings is being looked at by manchester united , manchester city and liverpool as he is likely to leave burnley danny welbeck , arsenal against slovenia in november , danny welbeck scored twice in the euro 2016 qualifier as three lions won 3 - 1
verdict : should not go danny welbeck trains with arsenal as the premier league club look to clinch champions league football danny welbeck has had a dip in form recently but will be looking to clinch a place in the three lions team once more rickie lambert , liverpool rickie lambert got 10 minutes against scotland in november , having gone to brazil for the 2014 world cup , hardly getting a look - in
it would be bold to argue those with more than a decade on the liverpool striker are less worthy to be included in roy hodgson âs squad , and it seems rickie lambert âs time has been and gone
verdict : should not go rickie lambert has found life difficult since joining liverpool and is unlikely to be selected by roy hodgson it would be surprising if rickie lambert ( pictured right with fabio borini in training ) was picked for the three lions team should go : wayne rooney , kane , sturridge , austin should not go : danny welbeck , berahino , danny ings , rickie lambert
