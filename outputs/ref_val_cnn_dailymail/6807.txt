distractions - especially talking with passengers and using cellphones - play a far greater role in car crashes involving teen drivers than has been previously understood , according to compelling new evidence cited by safety researchers
the aaa foundation for traffic safety analyzed nearly 1,700 videos that capture the actions of teen drivers in the moments before a crash
it found that distractions were a factor in nearly 60per cent of moderate to severe crashes
the most common forms of distraction were talking or otherwise engaging with passengers and using a cellphone , including talking , texting and reviewing messages
caught on camera : a teen driver loses control of her vehicle after she was driving distracted finding the source of the problem : the aaa foundation for traffic safety analyzed nearly 1,700 videos that capture the actions of teen drivers in the moments before a crash other forms of distraction observed in the videos included drivers looking away from the road at something inside the vehicle , ten per cent ; looking at something outside the vehicle other than the road ahead , nine per cent ; singing or moving to music , eight percent ; grooming , six percent ; and reaching for an object , six per cent
the most common forms of distraction leading up to a crash by a teen driver included : interacting with other passengers : 15 percent of crashes cell phone use : 12 percent of crashes looking at something in the vehicle : 10 percent of crashes looking at something outside the vehicle : 9 percent of crashes singing / moving to music : 8 percent of crashes grooming : 6 percent of crashes reaching for an object : 6 percent of crashes the car crosses a lane of traffic and runs off the road , stopping just short of railroad tracks that run parallel to the road
the national highway traffic safety administration has previously estimated that distraction of all kinds is a factor in only 14per cent of all teen driver crashes
the videos provide ' indisputable evidence that teen drivers are distracted in a much greater percentage of crashes than we previously realized , ' said peter kissinger , the foundation 's president and ceo
eyes down : the most common forms of distraction were talking or otherwise engaging with passengers and using a cellphone , including talking , texting and reviewing messages new findings : the national highway traffic safety administration has previously estimated that distraction of all kinds is a factor in only 14per cent of all teen driver crashes the opposite is the case for adults - for older drivers , having a passenger with an extra set of eyes on the road can make driving safer
teen drivers using cellphones had their eyes off the road for an average of 4.1 seconds out of the final six seconds leading up to a crash , the aaa foundation for traffic safety study found
aaa foundation for traffic safety and other traffic safety groups who previewed the findings said the study shows states should review their licensing requirements to restrict the number of passengers in cars driven by teens and change their laws to prohibit cellphone use by teen drivers
proof : the videos provide ' indisputable evidence that teen drivers are distracted in a much greater percentage of crashes than we previously realized , ' said peter kissinger , the foundation 's president and ceo high numbers : about 963,000 drivers age 16 to 19 were involved in police - reported crashes in the u.s. in 2013 , the most recent year for available data ' the findings of the aaa report confirm what safety groups have suspected for a long time - distraction is more severe and more common in teen driver crashes than previously found in government data , ' said jackie gillan , president of advocates for highway and auto safety
