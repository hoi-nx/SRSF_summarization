the us government has made a bizarre internet gaffe by posting a british muslim extremist âs photograph of veiled women calling for sharia law , citing it as an inspirational example of free speech in the west
the campaign posted the picture on its twitter account last week , adding : â in open societies , all faiths enjoy freedom of speech ; under isis rule , no such thing as freedom of expression
which is better for mankind ? â an investigation by mail on sunday has found the banner was used in an extremist campaign called muslim , do nât vote , which calls for strict sharia law to be imposed on british , as well as urging muslims not to vote in elections
the photo was given the caption â muslims coming out inviting society to islamic â â which was copied by the state department â by a man calling himself abdulrahman muhajir , whose twitter account is suspended
the photo appropriated by the state department was first placed on twitter last week by a woman calling herself umm usmaan , who is a leading figure in the anti-democracy campaign
â us twitter users were also quick to ridicule the state department , with one calling it an â epic fail â
conservative us commentator mark steyn added : â why is the state department promoting sharia for the british ? are nât they supposed to uphold the constitution of the us ? sharia âs incompatible with that constitution , as it is with the legal inheritance of western civilisation
