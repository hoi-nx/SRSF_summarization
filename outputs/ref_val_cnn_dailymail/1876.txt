the robbery of a south african news team has sent shock waves through the country after the brazen muggers were filmed on the crew 's camera stealing their equipment at gunpoint
vuyo mvoko , a contributing editor for sabc , was preparing for a 7pm live report outside johannesburg 's milpark hospital when the incident occurred
the men can then be seen demanding mr mvoko 's mobile phone before also taking a collection of the crew 's possessions and their work laptop
in a later interview with a sabc host , mr mvoko said they had spotted his phone , which was still in his hand after just having spoken to his producer in anticipation of going live on the news bulletin
mr mvoko later tweeted a link to the mugging video ( pictured ) and said he was ' safe and sound ' a police spokesperson said that minutes after the robbery the news crew spotted and approached a policeman who happened to be driving past
' every south african lives with the reality of crime , but to see thugs brazenly ignoring television cameras and robbing media workers in the course of their work , yet again brings home the level of criminality in our society , ' the editors ' group said in a statement
