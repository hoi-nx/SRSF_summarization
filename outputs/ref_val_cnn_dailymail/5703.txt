to make sense of many of these experiences , babies and toddlers ' map ' names to objects by assessing their surroundings and associating words with the item 's location
and now a new study has found that this association is not only affected by the child 's proximity to the object , it can also be influenced by their specific posture
when the target and another object were placed in the location , and the robot was positioned in a different way , it failed to recognise the object cognitive scientists from indiana university began by assessing the learning capabilities of a child - like robot called icub
this was repeated so icub learnt to associate between the objects and its two related postures
as with the robot , the infants failed to recognise objects if their position and posture changed , or the object was moved
in step 5 of the baldwin task , the objects are hidden while in the interference task , their location is switched
the participant is then asked to identify an object this experiment was replicated using children aged 12 to 18 months ( stock image ) and the researchers noticed only ' slight differences in the results
' like with the robot , the infants failed to recognise objects if their position and posture changed , or the object was moved the study was carried out by smith , a professor in the iu bloomington college of arts and sciences ' department of psychological and brain sciences
' this study shows that the body plays a role in early object name learning , and how toddlers use the body 's position in space to connect ideas , ' professor smith said
' a number of studies suggest that memory is tightly tied to the location of an object
' the creation of a robot model for infant learning ( icub pictured ) ) has far - reaching implications for how the brains of young people work ' the humanoid called icub has been under development for 10 years
when icub concedes a goal , it frowns and furrows its light - up eyebrows , sometimes swearing like an ill - tempered human
when a human strokes its arms it affects icub 's reactions and emotions and the robot says on one occasion in the video : ' i like when you touch me this way '
' the research , ' posture affects how robots and infants map words to objects , ' is published in the journal plos one
