up to 80 per cent of women fake orgasms , according to recent research - and that might not be a bad thing
turns out some women fake it in order to make it a real orgasm happen
researchers surveyed 481 heterosexual females , all sexually active but not in serious relationships
the women gave four main reasons for faking orgasm
the women said by pretending to orgasm , they were attempting to increase their arousal levels
sexpert tracey says for some women pretending to climax could actually bring on the real thing the women in the study said if they pretended to orgasm , their partner got more excited , which got them more excited
first up , the study was based on women who were nât in relationships so the overall percentage of â fakers â ( 80 per cent ) is hopefully lower in couples who are more comfortable with each other
it âs also best not to use the â fake it to make it â technique at the beginning of relationships ( unless you explain that âs what you âre doing , which is unlikely )
how is your partner ever going to learn to give you a real orgasm if they think they âre doing it already ? the absolute worst time to fake an orgasm is at the start of a relationship , which is , of course , when most women ( and some men ) do it
