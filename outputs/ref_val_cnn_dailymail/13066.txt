my name is mark goodacre , and i am a professor of new testament and christian origins in the department of religious studies at duke university
i was series adviser and one of many on - camera experts on cnn 's " finding jesus , " which premiered sunday evening
i also appear in each episode of the program
viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions to facebook during the show
below are some of the most interesting , and my answers to them
vance lipsey : is there a better way to check the shroud than carbon dating ? i 've been told carbon dating is very inaccurate
mark goodacre : actually , carbon dating is an excellent way to ascertain the date of an artifact
but the scientists doing the carbon dating were not amateurs , and the samples were tested in three separate labs
moreover , the carbon date cohered with other evidence that the shroud was a medieval forgery , like the fact that there is no evidence of its existence until the 14th century
cynthia restivo : so i know the carbon dating was off , but was n't it later shown that the piece of cloth used for the testing was a section that had been repaired after some fire damage or something ? which would explain why it dated different ? mark goodacre : no , that 's not been established
professor christopher ramsey noted that the unusual weave on the sample matched the weave on the rest of the shroud perfectly
mark goodacre : one of the curiosities about the shroud of turin is that the figure appears to be nailed through the wrists
mark goodacre : well , you will be pleased to hear that there is an entire episode devoted to mary magdalene in this series , and her identity and role are fully explored , including her presence at the empty tomb
jacques lemire : about the @ cnn program on finding jesus
mark goodacre : i found adam bond 's portrayal of finding jesus ' death in the drama really compelling , and his cry is quite arresting
it is apparently fulfilled in finding jesus ' silence during his trial ( e.g. john 19:9 - 10 ) , but in all four gospels , finding jesus is vocal on the cross , and in the end he cries out with a loud voice ( e.g. mark goodacre 15:34 and 37 ) , so the drama makes good sense there
