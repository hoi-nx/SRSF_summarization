this week : scarlett 's legs
it 's just months since she gave birth to her daughter , but actress scarlett was showing off perfect pins on the red carpet recently
the fringe detail gave the dress movement , making scarlett 's sheath seem fun and effervescent
the actress kept the focus on her bold choice of apparel by keeping the rest of her styling to a minimum
she paired her preen dress with some simple black pumps and stayed jewelry and accessory free
her swept back pompadour - inspired hair mimicked her youthful and effortless elegance
scarlett 's time spent living in pairs is clearly rubbing off on her sense of style , shifting her aesthetic towards a more sophisticated , yet whimsical taste
