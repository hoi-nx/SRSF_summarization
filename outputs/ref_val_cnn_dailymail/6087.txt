no police officers will be disciplined despite failing to properly investigate the systematic rape and abuse of young girls in rochdale , it was revealed today
seven greater manchester police officers were served with misconduct notices but after a four year investigation six were given ' management advice ' and one was allowed to retire
the rochdale scandal saw hundreds of vulnerable young girls fall into the hands of asian grooming gangs because the authorities failed to protect them over at least six years
in 2012 nine asian men were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13 , plying them with drugs , alcohol and money before passing them round the group for sex
no further action : seven police officers who were served with misconduct notices over the abuse scandal in rochdale ( pictured ) , will not face disciplinary action a subsequent report said the girls were allowed to fall into the hands of pakistani grooming gangs because police and social workers may have been scared of seeming racist
its report , published today , concludes that the officers placed too much emphasis on the credibility of the victims , and not enough on the crime
the seven officers investigated were interviewed about their decision - making , handling of investigations , and victim care
nine men , including these eight , were jailed for a total of 77 years for rape and trafficking after they preyed on girls as young as 13 - years - old by the summer of 2013 force investigators had identified the det insp should attend a formal misconduct hearing but they left the force in january 2014
shame : the abuse of the jailed gang began at two takeaways in the heywood area of rochdale , including the balti house ( pictured ) , which is under new ownership the investigation identified one detective sergeant who made individual errors in his handling of the investigation , but it found that he had raised concerns about a need for more resources but was not supported by his superiors
others who were served notices included the former divisional chief superintendent , a superintendent , two detective chief inspectors , and two detective inspectors
the report was split into two parts , one looking at the handling of the complaints made by two separate children , and the other looking into the wider decision - making by the rochdale senior leadership there were signs for many years that men were using vulnerable young girls in rochdale for sex , but no action was taken
social workers from the outset , social workers failed to regard the teenage girls being passed around for sex among a gang of asian men as victims
that was despite more than 100 reports of abuse from the victims , health workers and elsewhere linked to men working in taxi and takeaway businesses dating back to 2004 , and involving children as young as ten
victims as young as ten were seen as ' making their own choice ' and ' engaging in consensual sexual activity '
police just as social workers failed to protect the victims from the rapists preying on them , so the police failed for years to grasp the nettle and launch a serious investigation
the muslim community members of the community would have known about the abuse of white girls being carried out by pakistani men but did nothing to stop it
