thought the black and blue dress was an optical illusion ? it 's nothing compared to these mind - boggling pictures by a swedish photographer , artist , and photoshop genius
erik , 30 , who is based in berlin , germany , says he does nât capture moments , but instead captures ideas
in this image called the architect the subject seems to be both inside and outside the house erik , born in gotene , swedish , who aims to challenge and perplex the viewer , uses his artistry to confuse people who look at his work
from cars seemingly driving upside - down on bridges to spaces that , at a glance , appear to be a bedroom and then suddenly look like a field , his work is challenging , clever and full of subtle detail
erik explains that he wants his work to evoke a problem - solving approach
although one photo can consist of hundreds of different images merged into one , he always wants it to look like it could have snapped by a camera
he said : ' it âs the challenge : can i put this very weird idea in a photograph and make it look like it was just captured ? ' in a series of behind - the - scenes videos he gives an insight into his painstaking method
to make landfall , a work of visual trickery that looks as though green fields - rather than water - are pouring over a cliff edge , he layered 235 separate images
erik says each idea starts with a sketch and if he thinks it 's good enough he will start planning how to do it
this image , entitled do n't look back , shows a woman walking down a winding road that 's crumbling behind her every step is it a bedroom or a field ? in closing out , interiors and exterior meld as one in this seemingly simple tableau in the optical illusion cover up , a man is hiding his real view with a better , more idealised image on wallpaper which he hangs on a line he said : ' once i âve come up with an idea that i think is good enough to realise i need to find the places i need to shoot to put the photo together
reverse opposite is mind - bendig as , with an mc escher drawing , the car seems both on and under the bridge at the same time in erik 's description of this picture , called cutting light , he describes it as ' the strongest light bulb there is
cutting through wood , concrete and stone in just moments ' this image is called dreamwalking and captures the state between dream world and reality although one photo can consist of lots of different images merged into one , he always wants it to look like it could have been captured as a whole picture
