ella draper and her partner abraham christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture an evil mother tortured her children to make up sickening allegations about a satanic cult based at a primary school in the midst of a seething child contact dispute , a high court judge ruled yesterday
ella draper and her partner abraham christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture in hampstead , london , mrs justice justice pauffley said
she named and shamed the pair in a written ruling on care proceedings brought by a local council and said their internet campaign about the cult was â evil â and â baseless â
the judge suggested the couple may have fed the two youngsters , aged eight and nine , cannabis soup to gain their compliance
more than four million people worldwide have viewed the â fantasy â online material and police had to protect worried parents at the gates of christchurch primary school where the â main action â was alleged to have happened , the ruling said
â the two children , who are now in care , were repeatedly named in the internet campaign and films of them uploaded to the internet â with flagrant disregard for their welfare interests â
mrs justice pauffley was asked to investigate by social services bosses in care proceedings brought by barnet council after the two children were said to be at the centre of the cult âs abuse
but the judge said they were in fact forced by ella draper and christie to â provide concocted accounts of horrific events â in filmed mobile phone recordings and to lie to police when interviewed after the allegations were brought to the attention of officers in september last year
internet campaign : more than four million people worldwide have viewed the â fantasy â online material â torture is a strong word but is the most accurate way to describe what was done to the children by christie in collaboration with ella draper , â the judge said
the judge completely cleared mr dearman and all others named in the campaign of any abuse and called the material published on the internet â nothing more than utter nonsense â
â i am entirely certain that everything ms ella draper , her partner abraham christie and the children said about those matters was fabricated , â she said
