incredible before and after images have revealed a fresh lunar scar created by the biggest explosion ever recorded on the moon 's surface
the moon is pelted with cosmic debris all the time , but this relatively recent crater was created by an object the size of a small boulder
scientists watched the object explode as it hit the surface in mare imbrium creating a flash of light 10 times as bright as anything ever recorded on the moon before
slide the middle bar to see how the moon 's surface changed after impact when a meteoroid strikes the moon , a large portion of the impact energy goes into heat and excavating a crater
the images reveal intricate details of the resulting impact crater and could help scientists learn more about how craters form
the brightest flash occurred on march 17 , 2013 with coordinates 20.6 Â° n , 336.1 Â° e. the team predicted the crater 's size based on the energy , and then eagerly awaited lroc ; s next pass over the location to confirm their calculations

the brightest flash occurred on march 17 , 2013 with coordinates 20.6 Â° n , 336.1 Â° e comparing the actual size of the crater to the brightness of the flash helps validate impact models
the crater itself is small , measuring 61.7ft ( 18.8 metres ) in diameter , but its influence is large ; debris excavated by the sudden release of energy flew for hundreds of metres
scientists could be closer to finding water on the moon - a discovery that could help create rocket fuel and breathable air for future colonies
