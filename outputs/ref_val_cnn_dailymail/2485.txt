when on the bbc it was suggested to sunderland manager gus that the dvd of their thrashing at home by aston villa would n't make very edifying viewing , the phlegmatic gaffer replied ' you can not pick what you like to watch '
well , if gus tuned in to watch his centre half brown on all star family fortunes on sunday evening , he might well have decided to pick up the dvd of that aston villa game again , and stick it straight back in the recorder
playing against soap and strictly star jill halfpenny and her family , things were actually looking pretty good for the browns at the start
brown ( left ) appeared alongside his family in all star family fortunes , where his team lost heavily the browns appeared to have got host vernon onside early , but soon lost their advantage the halfpennys hail from the north east , while brown was playing a flat back four of sister , brother , wife and mother - in - law from manchester
this had the man in the middle , bolton 's own vernon , immediately looking to favour the team from the north west
brown was first up at the buzzer with jill
yet a couple of the browns ' other answers - namely ' a child ' and ' the elderly ' - were n't far off , surely , from an actual correct answer ' somebody else ' ? brown is brushed off the ball by gabriel agbonlahor in one of two poor performances this week gus did n't enjoy watching his side 's defeat to aston villa , but brown 's tv appearance was even worse soap star jill halfpenny and her family made it a torrid weekend all round for the sunderland midfielder frankly , the fact the browns were n't surrounding the official on that one showed remarkable restraint on their part
and this time , it was very much through a brown own goal
' pigeon ' , said brown
' compared to an ostrich ' was how he defended the defender 's answer , but suffice to say ... that noise again
brown shares a joke with the host , but he failed to produce the goods on the pitch or the telly this week i 'm writing this sentence here now to give you a bit of time to think about a few possible answers for yourselves
i 'll even point out , to give you a little more time , that vernon did acknowledge that wearing trousers at work was not exactly in brown ' area of expertise
that 's right , brown 's fellow footballers
the sunderland defender did however manage to raise plenty of money for charity perhaps something along the lines of the fact that he clearly could n't von trapp a house brick ? no , too much knowledge , that
but all i can say if that if gus had been in charge of this team 's performance , chances are he 'd have cleared his desk at the training ground and said goodbye to the players before you 'd even had the chance to read this
