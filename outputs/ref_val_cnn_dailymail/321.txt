you begin to believe tim sherwood after a night like this
aston villa âs first win since december 7 came in the 94th minute through their first penalty award of the season
tim sherwood , hugged and lifted by goalkeeping coach tony parks , looked like he was emitting the most decibels
in the instant christian benteke rolled the ball beyond foster from 12 yards the mood in this stadium lifted
christian benteke sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to score a dramatic late penalty and seal the win for aston villa christian benteke celebrates his goal with aston villa team - mates jack grealish and weimann aston villa manager tim sherwood celebrates the winning goal that gave him his first win in charge at the club agbonlahor threads the ball through foster 's legs to open the scoring for aston villa in the first half agbonlahor salutes the crowd in celebration after opening the scoring at villa park brad guzan looks on in horror as saido berahino nods home from close range after a knock - down from lescott west brom 's top scorer for the season saido berahino wheels away in celebration after equalising for the visitors hutton was lucky not to be sent off after this dangerous high tackle on saido berahino - both players were booked for the melee aston villa ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : brad guzan 6 ; hutton 6.5 , okore 7 , ciaran clark 6.5 , matt lowton 6 ; cleverley 6.5 ( bacuna 77 ) , westwood 6.5 , delph 7.5 ; nâzogbia 7 ( grealish 59 6 ) ; christian benteke 7.5 , agbonlahor 8 ( weimann 82 )

tim sherwood owes a large dose of gratitude to foster , mind you
in the third minute of added time the west brom goalkeeper launched into a calamitous dive after fumbling a bouncing ball , bringing down matt lowton in the process
christian benteke was the calmest man in the ground , placing the ball the other side of foster
no longer do aston villa hold the unwanted tag of only side in england âs top four divisions without a league win in 2015
agbonlahor , scorer of aston villa âs first , played his best game in recent memory
moss booked saido berahino and hutton , meaning retrospective action from the fa on the scottish right - back is unlikely
before christian benteke struck , it had seemed saido berahino âs equaliser would crush aston villa
in the 66th minute the west brom striker applied a simple header from two yards out after lescott had headed back chris brunt âs corner
his 12th premier league goal of the season is only three behind aston villa âs total â an example of their struggles as much as his fine form
foster capped a terrible performance by bringing down matt lowton in the third minute of added time for a penalty saido berahino celebrates while being chased by his team - mates , it was his 18th goal of the season in all competitions aston villa manager tim sherwood ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after agbonlahor 's goal agbonlahor beat foster again shortly after but lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line foster saves himself from a howler during the first half after the ball slipped out of his hands and almost ended up in his own net foster initially caught the shot from agbonlahor but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly agbonlahor reacts after west brom keeper foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line in the first half tim sherwood , who had seen his team lose to an injury time penalty to stoke in his first home match in charge , was in no mood to downplay his first win as aston villa manager
agbonlahor spun and hit a tame shot that foster looked like he had collected until the ball squirmed through his legs and apparently over the line before the keeper reclaimed it
brad guzan fired a clearance high and long , christian benteke leapt to win the flick - on and release agbonlahor , whose pace left lescott in the dust
as villa park erupted , agbonlahor ran in front of the west brom supporters cupping his ear
late in the second half , foster is beaten by a shot from delph but his shot hits the woodwork one team 's star striker chases another as saido berahino looks to evade belgium international christian benteke at villa park west brom midfielder yacob tackles aston villa goal scorer agbonlahor during the premier league clash aston villa captain delph tackles west brom midfielder james morrison during the first half west brom 's record signing brown ideye contests an aerial duel with aston villa defender ciaran clark west brom midfielder craig gardner and former tottenham full back hutton collapse in a heap after colliding christian benteke strides through the west brom half while being tracked by west brom midfielders yacob and darren fletcher aston villa manager tim sherwood signs autographs for young supporters before kick - off on tuesday evening
