sakinah shah has released a statement in defence of her brother , captain mh370 , who headed the crew on the missing jet , where she claims there is no proof of ' wrongdoing '
her statement comes as malaysia âs transport minister has admitted that if the missing malaysia airlines plane is not found by may search efforts will go â back to the drawing board â
ms sakinab 's statement on behalf of the family was released through the star in malaysia , just days ahead of the one - year anniversary of the disappearance of mh370 on sunday
â as things stand today , with no tangible evidence to show no - one , be you politician , scientist , aviation expert , plane crash investigator , pilot , retired pilot , media or whoever else , none of you have the right to blame captain mh370 for any wrongdoing
she recalled how at the time of the â tragic occurrence of mh370 â her brother , a father - of - three , was 53 years old and married to his childhood sweetheart faizah khanum
â he was very open - minded , coming from a family with a pretty wide range of nationalities through intermarriages
' back to the drawing board ' : malaysia âs transport minister seri liow has said that the search area would be extended if the missing mh370 jet is not found by may missing : this sunday marks the one - year anniversary of the disappearance of flight mh370 still lost : the boeing 777 plane was carrying 227 passengers and a crew of 12 when it suddenly disappeared off the radar on march 8 , 2014 â the rollercoaster ride since march 2014 has never really stopped , except perhaps momentarily
' with the current chatter about mh370 involving big name media organisations like national geographic , i feel compelled to divulge some information about captain mh370 's scholastic â prowess â and academic achievements
it was there he served as a pilot and later as a training captain
â as a training captain he often expressed joy and satisfaction with the camaraderie he shared with all his students
â i know for certain mh370 opted to remain loyal to malaysia airlines despite a few challenging offers from other airlines that came his way
â when the devastating news of mh370 was broadcast , like everybody else , we were also in a state of shock and disbelief
â the last time we met with mh370 was some two weeks prior to march 8th when we were together for dinner
' ms sakinab 's statement was released as malaysia âs transport minister seri liow suggested that the search area would be extended if mh370 is not found by may
this means that once again , the search will be carried out from the southern indian ocean to the himalayan mountains , as far west as the maldives and as far east - and beyond - as the south china sea
mr liow âs admission is unlikely to provide any comfort to the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew who were on the boeing 777 when it vanished on march 8 last year about an hour into a six - hour flight from kuala lumpur to beijing
search efforts : australian âs prime minister tony abbott said this week that the search for mh370 off the coast of australian might have to be scaled back after the year - long - search he told the new straits times that any decision to re-strategise the search - or look again at the methods employed - would only be done if the current scouring of the ocean floor in the southern indian ocean did not find the aircraft âs wreckage
â it is important to continue the search and hopefully we can complete it by then , â he said in a reference to may
â if the plane is not found we will have to evaluate the figures and rely on the experts to guide us on what to do next
â we are confident that the plane is situated in the identified search area in the south indian ocean and we are looking forward to finding it , â said mr liow , speaking in kuala lumpur
he was responding to a comment by australian âs prime minister , tony abbott , who said this week that the search and recovery effort might have to be scaled back after the year - long - search
â this is because as far as we are concerned , it is a tripartite decision ( between australian , malaysia and china ) that has made a commitment to complete the search in the 60,000 square kilometers
despite the massive search currently taking place in the southern indian ocean and requests for coastal villagers to keep their eyes open for debris that might have washed up on beaches , not a single piece of evidence from the aircraft has been found .
