john bilardi is paralysed with an unbearable sense of guilt as he tries to make any sense of what would possess his son , now known as jake , to volunteer to sacrifice his own young life for the islamic state
john finds it even more difficult to comprehend that his son had plans to orchestrate what would have been a deliberate act of mass murder right in his very own city where he had lived his whole life
jake 's father shared pictures and cards with the programme , showing a happy father 's day cars with the words ' i love you ' written inside jake 's father admitted to 60 minutes reporter usher ( pictured right ) that you did n't have to dig very far to realise that the 18 - year - old was a very troubled soul ' he can barely talk about it all he struggles for words with the fact that his son had plan b which was to commit a major act of terror in melbourne and had begun buying the chemicals for the bombs before he disappeared out of australian , ' usher said
as the youngest of six children , jake had an atheist upbringing ' that atrocity john can not understand at all - the family are desperately trying to now go back and understand who jake was because he was n't the kid they thought he was and tragically all of the warning signs were there of a kid in trouble
' when usher suggested there were clear warning signs that his son had issues , john agreed saying : ' yes they were and i 'm so sorry i did n't do anything about it
isis leaked a photograph of 18 - year - old australian jake bilardi ( pictured ) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it to add to jake 's complexities , his mother died from cancer in 2012 and was then looked after by his five older siblings as his parents had divorced years earlier
his father described his son as an ' extremely shy ' loner who felt alienated from his family and even expressed in one of his blogs that he felt unsafe with his siblings
he said he felt he should have known about the full extent of his son 's bullying

although it was unusual that the child from an atheist background converted to muslim there was nothing to suggest that he was acting radically in his public life but online he was in active contact with islamic state recruiters
' however , these feelings were short - lived as john had a growing concern for his son 's welfare by the last time he ever heard from jake again in the form of a facebook message when was in the middle east
' then he could n't contact him and had no further communication from him and john learned of his son 's death as it appeared in the media last week
' john send a warning out to all parents to be more aware about who their children are interacting with online
john was optimistic that his son was on a good path and had finally found happiness and peace jake 's father warns all parents to take note of who their children are interacting with online ' it 's going on , it 's happening , it 's real it 's not just from a muslim background , it 's anybody they can find , any soft target they will aim , human life means nothing to them , ' john told usher
