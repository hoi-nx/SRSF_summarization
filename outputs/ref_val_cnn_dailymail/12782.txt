london a photo of a weasel hitching a surprise lift on the back of a flying woodpecker near london has gone viral on twitter , with more than 7,000 users retweeting the original post of the image
it was first posted by photographer jason ward on monday and credited to martin le - may
after # weaselpecker gained momentum , british media soon picked up the story , and television channel itv interviewed martin le - may
the amateur photographer from essex , near london , told the broadcaster he had been walking with his wife in hornchurch country park , essex , when they heard " a distressed squawking " noise and spotted the woodpecker
eventually , martin le - may told itv , the weasel -- known as a " least weasel " in some countries -- lost its grip and the bird flew away
pacheco , chief executive of britain 's mammal society told cnn the image looked genuine and that it was possible an omnivorous weasel would take on a woodpecker
" the pluckiness of the weasel spawned a number of parodies on twitter , with manipulated images showing the creature in turn being ridden by russian president vladimir putin , popstar miley cyrus , football star john terry -- and even what appears to be a dog red panda dressed in a darth vader costume
sorry , darth ! ) as for the bird ? the green woodpecker is also known as a " yaffle " for its laughing call
