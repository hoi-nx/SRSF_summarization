here , kalpana , financial journalist and founder of blog mummymoneymatters.com , reveals her top tips to help you cut the cost of living and become savvy savers
parenting charity nct holds regular nearly - new sales offering clothes at knock - down prices - such as baby grows from as little as 50p for not one , but five
toys - often in very good condition - cost as little as Â£ 2 and children 's dvd are on offer from just Â£ 1
and it 's not just baby bargains savvy shoppers will find - there is a great selection for children too
there 's little point buying all - new clothes for little ones as they grow out of them so quickly
2 ) de-clutter and sell unwanted goods now is the time to go through your cupboards and get rid of anything you no longer need or use
to make a few extra pennies that could go towards pocket money for the kids , or spending money for your family holiday , why not consider selling these items ? at nct sales , table hire is around Â£ 20 , but , if you have plenty of decent things on offer , you could walk away with hundreds of pounds
you can sell furniture - so for mothers with items like cots and even wardrobes , it 's the perfect marketplace
instead , take pictures of any bulky goods to place on a noticeboard on the day
for non-child - related goods , try a boot sale
car - boots sales are a great way to have a clear - out of unwanted goods and also pick up a little extra cash 3 ) buy school uniforms from the supermarket school uniforms are expensive â but there are ways to cut costs
if this is the case , and if you 're looking to save some pennies , see if you can get them second - hand
many schools will sell once - worn clothes , but you may have to ask
you could also ask other parents if they are willing to sell anything that their child has outgrown
4 ) use cashback sites these are n't anything new , but if you 're not already using a cashback site , it 's the perfect way to easily save some money and earn rewards
they work by giving shoppers a percentage of their purchase total every time you shop online via a specific cashback site
the purchase is tracked and the cashback site will give you back some money ; rates can vary from as little as 1 per cent to as much as 10 per cent
and it 's not just limited to retailers , you can also earn cashback for utilities ( broadband , tv , phone ) , insurance and even days out
new sky customers , for example , could get Â£ 151.50 cashback for tv and broadband packages via topcashback , Â£ 30 cashback for using uswitch via quidco and 2 per cent back on amazon purchases using kidstart
you really could end up with hundreds of pounds back into your pocket - but only ever use reputable cashback sites
6 ) plan your meals for a family , food is a huge weekly cost
as well as shopping smart and buying own - brand products where possible , the next thing to do is to plan your meals
recent research from the family & childcare trust showed a 33 per cent increase in the past five years , and a report last week from single parent charity , gingerbread , found half of single parents have had to borrow money from friends , family or banks to pay for childcare in the last two years
