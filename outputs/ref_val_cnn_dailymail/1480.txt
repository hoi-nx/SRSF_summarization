photographer rã©hahn spent eight days among the sea nomad children in borneo , learning about their fascinating aquatic lives
' the bajau tribe 's beliefs centre around a combination of animism and islam , with their relationship with the ocean and its inhabitants being at the heart of the nomads ' existence
happy and content ! rã©hahn said the sea gipsies were like fish in the water , and spent a lot of their time jumping happily into the water from a bridge due to extended periods under the surface , the sea nomads have an enhanced underwater - vision , perfect for spearfishing rã©hahn said : ' when i arrived , children jumped on the boat to come near me
regardless of their age , everyone in the bajau tribe has a place and helps in some way to catch the fish splashing around ! bajau children enjoy their water existence and play in the turquoise waves the best divers are able to stay underwater at depths of 20 metres for several minutes , while they hunt for fish rã©hahn , who has over 180,000 fans of his work on his fan page , said : ' they are very welcoming and friendly
' although some of the seafaring tribe are born on the ocean and never live on the land , more frequently the sea gypsies are heading to the shore for trade and to gather materials to build boats
rã©hahn said the bajau roughly know about age but time does n't matter much to them , and they live in the present , and live only for and by the water
some female sea gipsies give birth on their huts with stilts , although many come to land to trade and get supplies , there are a small number who have lived entirely on the ocean throughout their whole lives the tribe 's beliefs centre around a combination of animism and islam , with their relationship with the ocean and its inhabitants being at the heart of their existence
