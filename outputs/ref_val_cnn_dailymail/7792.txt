rome was n't built in day , and it certainly was n't for rural postman le palais idã©al , who dedicated 33 years of his life constructing an incredible limestone palace , complete with pillars , buttresses and grottoes
the widower would often find unusually shaped rocks as he delivered mail in france , and ended up pushing a wheelbarrow each day on his 18 - mile route to collect stones of beauty
' le palais idã©al would haul his findings to a site in hauterives every day after work , and thus began the ambitious 33 year project , completed with no outside help
le palais idã©al would construct the palace at night , after work , by the light of oil lamps
the outer walls , measuring 24 metres in length , and 10 metres high , took 22 years to complete , with le palais idã©al binding the stones together with lime , mortar and cement
the structure is beloved by visitors today , 100 years after it was constructed , and was even featured on the french stamp in 1986 when le palais idã©al died , he requested that he could be buried at the palace
