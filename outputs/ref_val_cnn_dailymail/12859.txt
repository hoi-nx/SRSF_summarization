there is a controversy brewing about starbucks and its new " race together " campaign
but what 's so bad about that ? should n't we commend starbucks for trying to be good corporate citizen , to walk the talk , as it were ? starbucks ceo howard schultz announced the company 's new campaign this week , which he described as " an opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society
" in other words , grab a cup of coffee and let 's talk about race
thegrio.com : creflo dollar is further proof that prosperity gospel is full of ' false profits ' of course , we would be foolish to think that starbucks or any company would engage in such a strategy separate and apart from a profit motive
and yet , there are different pathways to getting there , and maybe starbucks is showing us a new way
clearly some people do want to talk about race , and there is a desperate need to confront the issue head on
it only makes sense that actors and players in society , including corporations such as starbucks , would want to become part of that new dynamic
at a time when so many corporations are coming under fire for their questionable , exploitative , even deadly business practices , starbucks is trying to be a responsible corporate citizen and part of the solution
of course , we can not pretend that having a talk about race over coffee will solve americans 's problems , just as president obama 's " beer summit " over the racial profiling of harvard professor henry louis gates fell short of fully capitalizing on one of those " teachable moments
" thegrio.com : let 's stop the ' struggle equation ' race in the americans is not merely about who likes or who does n't like you , or who calls you the n - word or does not want to live next to you
and who knows what can happen when people start to talk about race ? maybe they will even think about things in a different way
so , let 's not attack starbucks for doing the right thing and getting the ball rolling on race
