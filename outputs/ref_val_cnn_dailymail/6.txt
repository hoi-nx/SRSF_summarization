mats hummels is in the frame to leave for manchester united , ilkay gundogan has yet to sign a contract extension and can leave in 2016 and even the much - vaunted re-signing of reus might have simply been a stalling tactic to wait for a move to barcelona next summer
on top of all that , borussia dortmund , the club which charmed the world two years ago on their rampaging run to the champions league final , have battled relegation all season and were comprehensively beaten by juventus in the champions league last week
borussia dortmund are starting to look up again following a nightmare start to the season part of borussia dortmund 's remarkable 10,000 - strong support in hannover for their bundesliga match last weekend defender mats hummels has been strongly linked with a summer move to manchester united for most of the world , their last sight of borussia dortmund 's plight in the bundesliga were those infamous photos of captain hummels and goalkeeper roman weidenfeller climbing the surround fencing to reason with angry fans from the ' yellow wall ' after the home defeat by augsburg last month left the team bottom
while manager jurgen klopp and mats hummels struck some sensible middle ground
' reus man reus has signed a contract extension but could still move to barcelona in 2016 ilkay gundogan ( right ) has yet to commit to a new borussia dortmund contract and could leave in the summer after an upturn in form , borussia dortmund find themselves just five points off a europa league place manager jurgen klopp ( second right ) with sebastian kehl and jakub blaszczykowski after saturday 's win whether europe is realistic or not - they are five points off the europa league places with eight games to play - borussia dortmund are in a much better place than a couple of months ago
but reus signing a new four - year contract was an enormous boost , all the more so as it contained no release clause
it may well be that reus joins barcelona in the summer of 2016 , the catalan club where his friend marc-andre ter stegen already plays understood to be his preferred destination
louis van gaal attempted to bring him back to bayern munich when coach there ; he will undoubtedly try to do the same again this summer , though he will have to meet the Â£ 35m asking price
interestingly , sources at borussia dortmund are already putting it about that Â£ 35m would make up for the shortfall of missing out in the champions league , which sounds like a pre-sale process of softening up the fans
the lowest point in borussia dortmund 's season came when players like mats hummels had to front up to the fans but an upturn in fortunes has lifted them out of relegation danger - pierre-emerick aubameyang ( left ) and reus here wear masks to celebrate a goal in the 3 - 0 defeat of rivals schalke the borussia dortmund player salute their travelling support after last weekend 's 3 - 2 win at hannover the key question remains about the man who has come to personify borussia dortmund , jurgen klopp
like sir alex ferguson at manchester united and arsene wenger at arsenal , jurgen klopp 's personality , tactics and energy seem to embody every area of the club
striker pierre-emerick aubameyang poses for a photo with borussia dortmund fans after saturday 's win former manchester united man shinji kagawa celebrates with reus after scoring at hannover and there is a feeling that many teams are now adept at dealing with the frenzied counter-attacking style and that he needs to add nuance to the tactics that so recently shocked europe 's best sides
for now it looks as if jurgen klopp and borussia dortmund 's fates are bound together
at times , the rollercoaster season has seemed a projection on the ups and downs of jurgen klopp 's own volatile personality
