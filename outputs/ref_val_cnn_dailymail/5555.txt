the equality and human rights commission , chaired by baroness onora o'neill , said the human rights act has ' proved its value ' tory mps reacted angrily last night after a supposedly impartial Â£ 19million - a - year taxpayer - funded quango tore into the party âs plans to reform human rights law
despite there being under two months to the election , the equality and human rights commission piled into the political debate over the future of labour âs human rights act
in a statement posted on the commission âs website , backed by a letter to mps , it claimed that changes â to human rights laws that would water down the protections we all enjoy , would be â regressive â and undermine great britain âs reputation as a global leader that can challenge human rights abuses abroad â
the quango also declared the human rights act a success , saying it had â consistently proved its value â
this is despite the way it has been repeatedly used by foreign criminals and terrorists to avoid deportation
the tories have a manifesto commitment to scrap the human rights act and replace it with a uk bill of rights
â this taxpayer - funded quango of labour âs creation is deliberately trying to play politics on the eve of an election
the post said uk courts were not bound by the echr ( pictured ) , when in fact they are ' this country was protecting human rights when many members of the eu were under dictatorships and well before labour âs human rights act , which has only served to create extra tiers of bureaucracy , legal costs , delays and an imbalance of justice
equality and human rights commission chief executive mark hammond said : â we are at a crossroads for human rights
