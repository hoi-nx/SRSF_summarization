zachary chesser is suing the fbi and his own mother , alleging that agents interfered with his parental rights by conspiring with his mother and her partner to ensure that the boy could not travel to jordan to live with his wife
instead , the boy is being raised by his mother , barbara chesser , a senior lawyer in the office of the attorney general in the dc. , and her partner , who is also named as a defendant
zachary chesser was behind bars and nzabanita was facing deportation when his mother initiated custody proceedings , but both still enjoyed full parental rights , and they ' opposed placing the young boy with his grandparents , who did not share zachary chesser and his wife 's conservative islam beliefs , ' his court - appointed attorney , lafond , says in their appeal
