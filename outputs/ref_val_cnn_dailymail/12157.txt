it 's a golfing paradise forged from the ashes of the space race
and , according to owner pelz , it might just be the best back garden on the planet
one thing is certain , no self - respecting golfer would emerge from a stint patrolling the perfectly coiffured turf at chez pelz in austin , texas any worse around the greens
" they say it 's the world 's best backyard , " one of golf 's most renowned short game coaches , and former nasa employee , told cnn 's living golf show
" it 's no wonder pelz is content
his students , including five - time major champion phil mickelson , have amassed a combined 20 majors between them and as one of golf 's most fertile brains , pelz has 26 golf patents to his name
the 70 - year - old still works with phil mickelson prior to major tournaments and the player known as " phil mickelson " credits pelz with helping to elevate his game to the elite level
" i was 0 - for - 43 in majors before i met him , and i 've won four , plus a players championship since , " phil mickelson was quoted as saying prior to capturing his fifth major -- the british open -- in 2013
" the septuagenarian pioneered the use of statistics back in the 1970s and 80s , his analysis of the game sculpted by a 15 - year stint working for space agency nasa
his insistence on short game practice , and invention of clubs to help players hone their skills in that department , have informed the modern professional 's approach
" i did space research and golf research on my own time , " explained the brains behind the two - ball putter , one of the best - selling clubs of all time that helped golfers line up their putts more accurately
" nasa has the most unbelievable equipment in the world and that was the dawn of the space race
" pelz banked a place at indiana university thanks to a golf scholarship and chose to study physics
he famously played the legendary jack nicklaus 22 times and lost to the 18 - time major champion on every occasion , but made significant improvements to his game once he began working for nasa
using the one variable at a time method favored by scientists , pelz began grading his own performance using the methods he 'd picked up at the goddard space flight center
" i started measuring my short game
" i finally started understanding my game after 10 years of research
it 's funny to say from a person who went to college for four years on a golf scholarship
" all of a sudden i qualified again for the u.s. amateur ( america 's leading competition for amateur golfers ) and i 'm not practicing at all like i used to but my game was better
" while pelz 's brain power is not in question , his business acumen is -- by his own admission
after taking a year - long leave of absence from goddard and securing funding from a group of friends , he embarked on a journey that would eventually lead to his space age backyard in austin
" however , by this time pelz had hit upon the idea that would help him make an indelible mark on golf -- the importance of the short game
after three years studying players on the pga tour he deduced they were neglecting one of the most important areas of the game -- from 100 yards in
his calculations underlined the short game accounted for as much as 65 % of golf , and also happened to be the one area in which most professionals struggled
pelz said : " thirty five years ago nobody even talked about short game -- the term was n't used
" so the truth is there are two long shots and three or four or five short game shots every hole and people do n't think about these
" if all you practice is the long game , practicing that for the rest of your life will not help your short game because they take different swings
" pelz 's breakthrough came just at the right time
with money running out he had mortgaged his house , resigned from his role with nasa and was relying on the players he was working with to fund his fledgling start - up
by this time his portfolio of players was ever expanding , and grew to include phil mickelson , widely regarded as one of the finest short game exponents ever
" i 've worked with over 100 players now on the tour and phil mickelson and everybody says , ' oh he has a natural god - given talent with a short game , " pelz said
pelz is still as enthusiastic about golf as he ever was , especially about the dynamics of the short game and how important it is to keep practicing
while some players will never be able to match the game 's power hitters no matter how hard they train , short game is one area pros and amateurs can make huge strides in
now you give me that kind of ( extensive ) practice and i will kill him in the short game and putting
" that 's saying a lot because he 's good at short game and putting
" so i 'm saying no matter what you do you 'll never conquer the full power game as much as you can conquer the short game and putting for amateurs
