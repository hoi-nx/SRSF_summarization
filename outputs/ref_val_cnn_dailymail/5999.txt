a drug dealer will be paid compensation by the government for the injuries he suffered in a high speed crash , despite being found with cannabis on him to sell - after a ruling by judges at the appeal court
sean delaney , of bedworth , warwickshire , was left with long term disabilities and personality changes after the mercedes he was in , driven by an acquaintance , crashed in 2006 near nuneaton
delaney , a father of four , had to be cut free from the wreckage of the crash by firefighters and a football sized portion of cannabis - worth around Â£ 1,000 - was found in his jacket
the department had initially refused to pay delaney any compensation because he was caught in a criminal act , namely the sale of cannabis
senior judges at the court of appeal have ruled that the government must pay costs and compensation , likely to run into millions , to a man severely injured in a car crash who had cannabis
judges said a uk law that allowed insurers to refuse paying people involved in crime compensation contravenes an eu directive however senior have ruled that the uk policy of refusing to compensate accident victims who have been knowingly involved in crime contravenes eu directives concerning motor insurance
the government must now pay around Â£ 180,000 of delaney 's expected Â£ 250,000 costs as well as pay him compensation for his multiple injuries , a sum that is likely to run into millions because of the extent of his injuries
delaney had ' gone for a spin ' with his acquaintance , pickett , who lost control of the Â£ 80,000 mercedes 500sl sports car at high speed after trying to overtake on a bend in november 2006
a fireman found a package of cannabis hidden in pickett 's sock and , when delaney was pulled out of the car , a block of 240 grams of herbal cannabis fell from his bomber jacket
delaney attempted to sue his friend for damages for his injuries , but his claim was thrown out by judge gregory at coventry county court in january 2011
' delaney , who was a vocational tutor for students interested in mechanics , had sought a multi-million - pound award to pay for the lifetime of care he will need
in december 2011 three appeal court judges dismissed delaney 's appeal saying he would , or should , have known the mercedes was being used for ' the furtherance of crime '
it was claimed that the insurers ' exclusion clause in uk law was incompatible with this european directive
mr jay said : ' i conclude with little hesitation that the dft 's breach is so serious that ... it must pay compensation to mr sean delaney
at the latest hearing at the appeal court , three senior judges unanimously rejected an appeal by the dft
the amount of damages now payable to delaney has yet to be finally assessed but , given the severity of his injuries and the extent of care and support he will need in the future , it is likely to to run well into seven figures
