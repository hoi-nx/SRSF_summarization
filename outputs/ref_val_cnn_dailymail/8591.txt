official records claim a staggering 6.5million ' super-centurions ' have reached the grand age of 112 in the u.s. - but it is all down to missing death certificates
but in fact there are only 19 people who say they are over the age of 112 in the u.s. today , and social security admits there are only 13 still getting benefits
mistake : a record - keeping blip means social security records appear to show u.s. has a group of super-centenarians equal to the population of el salvador ( stock picture ) record - holder : just 19 women are over the age of 122 in u.s. , with gertrude weaver , of arkansas , pictured , the oldest among them at 116 years and 255 days old the error has been caused because social security does not have death records for millions of people , the oldest of whom was born in 1869
but far from being something to chuckle about , ron johnson senator ron johnson , who represents wisconsin , has raised it as a cause for concern
problem : senator ron johnson , pictured , says the active numbers are an issue as they can be used illegally ' that is a real problem , ' said senator ron johnson
' ron johnson is chairman of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs , which plans a hearing monday on problems with death records maintained by the social security administration
however , it would be costly and time - consuming to update 6.5million files created at a time when the agency used paper records , said brune , a senior adviser to the agency 's deputy commissioner for budget , finance , quality and management
but the social security administration is trying to combat the problem , generating a list of dead people known as the ' death master file ' , so employers can compare the numbers they are given with those which should no longer be in use
