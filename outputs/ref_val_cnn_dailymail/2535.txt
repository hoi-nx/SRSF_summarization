nascar driver busch will not face criminal charges after his ex-girlfriend driscoll claimed he grabbed her by the throat and slammed her head into a wall three times
but the state attorney general 's office has now said it could not establish ' beyond a reasonable doubt ' that busch committed a crime during the september incident
last month busch was indefinitely suspended from nascar after driscoll was granted a ' protection from abuse ' order from the family court
state prosecutors said there was not enough evidence to establish ' beyond a reasonable doubt ' that busch committed a crime during the september incident busch has lost two rounds of appeals for his reinstatement and has missed the first two races of the season , but officials said he will be following their recommended guidelines to be eligible in the future
his attorney jim liguori said busch knew ' all along ' he was going to be exonerated and that driscoll tried to destroy the racecar driver 's image in the press
' driscoll 's attorney carolyn mcneice said they were disappointed with the state attorney general 's decision , but that it only made the no - contact order from the family court ' that much more important '
under the order , busch is not allowed to buy or possess firearms or ammunition , must undergo evaluation for ' mental health problems related to anger control ' , and must stay 100 yards away from driscoll - with the exception of nascar races and related events - for one year
driscoll , 37 , testified that she and her son went to busch 's motorhome at the dover the night of the assault after receiving a slew of worrying texts from the racecar driver that seemed to indicate he was depressed
