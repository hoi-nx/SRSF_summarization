clinton 's lawyer , kendall , said no. in his letter to gowdy , kendall said the former secretary of state " chose not to keep her non-record personal emails
" " thus , there are no ... e-mails from secretary clinton 's tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review , even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized , " he wrote
but she " has maintained and preserved copies " of work - related , or potentially work - related emails she turned over to the state department late last year
" representatives of secretary clinton 's office have been in touch with the committee and the state department to make clear that she would like her emails made public as soon as possible and that she 's ready and willing to come and appear herself for a hearing open to the american public , " clinton spokesman nick merrill said in an email
the chairman subpoenaed clinton 's emails regarding libya and , last month , the state department turned over about 300 emails to the committee
