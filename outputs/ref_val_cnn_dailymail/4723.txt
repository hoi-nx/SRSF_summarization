that was a big wake - up call for england but i would nât panic or over-react to a defeat against a very good ireland team in dublin
they wo nât be the first or last england team to experience that
england were competitive against what i believe is an ireland team capable of winning a world cup but there were some major disappointments and areas which quickly need working on
former england coach sir clive woodward would have brought on cipriani in place of burrell england 's players look dejected after they conceded the only try of the match against ireland the discipline was very poor , especially in the first half when they gave eight of their 13 penalties away and went down the tunnel 9 - 3 down
in fact , it should have been 12 - 3 because johnny sexton missed a penalty he would usually have popped over
you are always going to be under pressure in dublin but england compounded that massively yesterday
when england were 6 - 3 down midway through the first half chris robshaw opted for the corner when england had won a very kickable penalty
robbie henshaw ( centre ) is congratulated by his ireland team - mate jared payne after scoring his try that was a very high - risk throw england called to the back of the line - out , where devin toner was guarding against just that possibility
again , in terms of decision - making , england got it wrong with their use of the bench
johnny sexton was clinical with his kicking and the points he scored provided the backbone for ireland 's win instead at that crucial stage we had burrell , who was nât enjoying one of his best games , and billy twelvetrees at centre , which is the england midfield line - up ireland would have felt most at home defending against
another thing which england must continue to work on is their kicking game and exit strategies , which were again very much second best to ireland âs

i was convinced they would dominate the set - piece but actually ireland did a fantastic job and you have to give praise to them and especially the veteran mike ross who was being written off by some a while back
i âm hoping that âs a one - off because the england scrum has been outstanding prior to this
there will be no grand slam this year and possibly no championship so , for me , the final two six nations games are all about the world cup now and england need to make those games against scotland and france count
