he admits it is â the biggest gamble of his life â and is terrified that his latest television venture will be a flop
and it would seem comedian corden , who makes his debut this month as anchor of the late , late show â one of american âs top talk shows â may be right to be concerned , according to some members of the test audience at a rehearsal last week
corden and his new employers , cbs , could be worried that american audiences wo nât get his british brand of humour and they want to ensure he is word perfect for his first live show on march 23 , when hollywood superstar tom hanks will be a guest
response : corden is to make his debut as anchor of the late , late show later this month - but cbs bosses could be worried about how he will be received , so a rehearsal was held this week a source on the programme revealed they needed to â iron out the glitches and find out what works â , adding : â the american audience is totally different to anything james has experienced before
â the mail on sunday gained exclusive access to corden âs rehearsal last week , and while some of the 200 invited audience â many of them professional actors paid to â fill â seats â seemed charmed by his laid - back delivery , most complained that they were â baffled â by his sense of humour and found his estuary accent difficult to understand
though he told interviewers last week that he intends to â shake up â late - night tv in the american , the new show is surprisingly formulaic
corden , 36 , sits behind a desk topped with an old - fashioned rotary phone , while guests sit on a blue sofa in front of a fake backdrop of la
guest susan wittan , from rockville , maryland , who attended thursday âs rehearsal said : â i âd never heard of corden until today
â revolutionary : despite corden - seen here interviewing cummings , of sitcom 2 broke girls , and eric christian olsen , from crime show ncis : la - promising the shake up the tried - and - tested format , some audience members complained there was little to differentiate it from other talk shows another woman , christine , who revealed she was being paid as a â seat filler â said : â i do nât think enough people know who he is
â the dress rehearsal came amid increasing concerns that corden , who has lost 6st in the run - up to the show âs launch , has been under tremendous stress , doubtless mindful that many other british , such as ant and dec , and russell brand , tried and failed to crack the american audience
risk : corden has moved his family - wife julia , son max , three , and four - month - old daughter julia - to la , but admits taking the role is the biggest gamble of his life so far in recent weeks he has displayed obvious signs of anxiety
â corden , who relocated to la at christmas with wife julia and their children max , three , and 14 - week - old carey , is on a reported Â£ 1.5 million - a - year deal
he admits cbs has taken â a huge gamble â bringing him to the american , saying : â i do nât know if i âm making a huge mistake
â before thursday night âs rehearsal began corden , clearly on edge , spoke to the audience
if you âd told the 12 - year - old me that i would be doing this i would never have believed it
â he interviewed comedian cummings , of sitcom 2 broke girls , and actor eric christian olsen , from crime show ncis : la
when cummings joked about british being â a nation of alcoholics â corden replied : â i would refute that although i am aware that i âm the only late - night host with a bar in his studio
â family man : corden told the audience about his newly expanded brood , saying : â when you have one kid it âs like having a pet
â unknown ? : some said they thought corden was not well - known enough to do well as a talk show host in the states - but cbs have been doing a lot of promotion to spread his name around , like this billboard stunt afterwards one british audience member said : â the show was pretty predictable
â amelia darwin , who also watched the show , added : â corden worked really hard and is a likeable man
â nick bernstein , cbs vice president , late night , west coast said : ' the studio audience reception to the practice shows has been terrific
a late night host with an accent is hardly a foreign concept to cbs
we find james british accent quite charming
