fifty years after the bound body of a dairy farmer was pulled from a river , a new theory has emerged in the unsolved case of his death
prosperous but unpopular dairy farmer gibson disappeared in the wee hours of new year 's eve 1957 in newbury , vermont
searchers pulled his bound body from the river nearly three months later
the case remains officially unsolved , but it 's been widely accepted for decades that a small mob of drunken townspeople incensed by rumors that gibson had beaten his elderly hired man kidnapped him , tied him up and threw him in a car trunk , where he suffocated
they threw his body into the river
gibson was a successful dairy farmer who had many enemies in the community of newbury ' you can go anywhere , quite a ways off , and if you say you 're from newbury they 'll bring it up , ' said placey , 72 , who was related to gibson by marriage
so what really happened ? judge martin , who as a new lawyer in 1960 helped represent one of the accused , recently published a book in which he argues gibson killed himself , with some ingenuity and difficulty , in a largely successful attempt to get revenge on his neighbors by pinning the blame on them
in orville 's revenge : the anatomy of a suicide , martin argues that gibson , broken by the criminal charge he was facing in the hired man 's beating and by the enmity he had created among his neighbors , staged evidence at his farm , walked over a bridge to new hampshire , climbed out on a pier , tied himself up and rolled himself into the water
they could reclassify the case and remove it from the list of vermont 's unsolved homicides
' i do n't know why a supposedly intelligent man like judge martin would say that , ' said mcclintock , 75 , gibson 's niece , who still believes some of her neighbors know what happened to her uncle
the idea that gibson could have tied himself up was brought up during the second trial , but investigators did n't accept it
gibson 's barn following his disappearance in 1957
his body , which had been bound at the feet and with his hands behind his knees , was pulled from the river three months after his disappearance on new year 's eve 1957 judge martin demonstrates how it would be possible for someone to tie themselves up and roll themselves into the water and then came the last straw â the story about the beating of his hired man
gibson was charged with a crime , though some argue the man 's injuries were exaggerated by the town rumor mill. the day gibson disappeared , he had planned to visit a lawyer
placey 's husband , david , now 71 , responded the day of the disappearance to a call from gibson 's wife when her husband did n't return from the morning milking
police dragged the river but found nothing until the end of march , when troopers discovered gibson 's body miles downstream
it was n't until fall 1958 that a doctor told investigators he had driven by gibson 's barn the morning the farmer disappeared and saw a car he recognized and two men he knew

almost 60 years after he disappeared and was later found dead , a retired vermont judge is arguing in a new book that gibson 's death was a suicide
for decades many thought gibson 's death was vigilante revenge for his beating of a hired man society member stephenson said he believes martin 's explanation
if vigilantes had killed gibson , his body would have been beaten to a pulp
gibson 's wife died in 1973
despite the ugly memories it dredges up , gibson 's niece said she thinks it 's good people are talking about her uncle again
