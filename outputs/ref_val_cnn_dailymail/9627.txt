the party was one of the regular swingers ' events put on by retired management consultant stanley , 66 , and his partner janet harrison , 58 , at their eight - bedroom home in radlett , hertfordshire
the couple , who appeared in a channel 4 series last year , say they do not run the sex parties as a business , but ask for contributions to their costs
the event on friday night featured 007 references including a roulette wheel , a woman covered in gold paint inspired by goldfinger and chocolate replicas of the weapon from the man with the golden gun
the man got into difficulties in the water just after midnight
the death happened at a swingers party run by stanley and janet harrison , pictured in the channel 4 documentary jon richardson grows up the owner of the house , who organised the sex party , said there were safety notices around the pool ' the party was really only just getting started , ' a guest told the sun. ' i was in the garden when a naked couple walked into the heated pool
' there is a steep incline in the pool , which is about 3m deep , and the guy went in deeper by himself and started whacking the water
' after a while the woman screamed and i saw the guy lying on the bottom
his body looked like it was moving , but then i realised it was ripples in the water
the woman who entered the pool with him , who was not well known by other guests , was left distraught
the group 's website states that there are health and safety rules for using the large indoor swimming pool the couple have been hosting sex parties at the mansion - which includes a dungeon - for 10 years he added : ' i heard a shout and ran over
mr stanley and his partner decided to go ahead with a planned alice in wonderland - themed party on saturday night after receiving messages of support from their regular guests
the property features a converted attic which mr stanley calls the ' dungeon in the sky ' the tragedy struck in the early hours of saturday at the mansion ( pictured ) in radlett , north of london the mansion 's owners say the pool complies with all health and safety rules and has been inspected ' my first reaction was that having a party the following night was not going to be appropriate , ' mr stanley said
