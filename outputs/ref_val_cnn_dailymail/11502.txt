the woman who was once the apple of sterling 's eye until she cost him the los angeles clippers was forced thursday to answer questions about recordings in which she and the billionaire discussed how to hide a house he bought her
several of the 500 recordings stiviano made during a nearly four - year relationship with sterling were played in los angeles superior court in his wife 's lawsuit to reclaim millions of dollars he lavished on the younger woman
sterling foresaw the trouble the gifts posed for stiviano , pointing out in one recording that they were community property - owned jointly by him and his wife of nearly 60 years
stiviano ( above ) is seen leaving court with an apple after testifying on thursday in a recording heard in court on thursday , stiviano and sterling discuss the best way to try and hide the purchase of the $ 1.8m duplex from his wife ( above ) that is the basis for her lawsuit
after two days of testimony attempting to show that sterling paid the full $ 1.8million price for the spanish - style duplex , there 's little to hide
the question is whether a judge will make stiviano relinquish the home , three luxury cars , including a ferrari , and millions of dollars in cash , jewelry and clothing that an accountant valued conservatively at $ 3.6million
judge richard fruin jr. cast doubt on shelly sterling 's case thursday , saying there 's no clear documentation that funds went from the sterling family 's real estate company to stiviano 's bank accounts
when asked if it was mere coincidence that identical amounts left sterling 's company and then showed up in accounts used to purchase the home , stiviano pleaded ignorant and said she had n't signed the checks
the sterlings are demanding back items worth $ 3.6 million that they claim stiviano ( above with sterling ) swindled from them - including cars and a $ 1.8 million duplex on the stand thursday , stiviano called sterling 's wife shelly ( above ) a ' bully ' the trial has provided a backstory of sorts to the saga that played out last year when the recording of sterling telling stiviano not to publicly associate with blacks culminated with his lifetime ban from the nba and the record $ 2billion sale of the team
stiviano admitted that sterling had bought her cars , gave her $ 100,000 to invest in stocks and helped her buy her house with at least $ 727,000
accountant shapiro testified that he had traced funds from sterlings and found it unbelievable stiviano 's drawer could have made a significant contribution
