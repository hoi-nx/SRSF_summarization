us girls at style album are self - confessed jewellery junkies , they say diamonds are a girl 's best friend , but we are just as happy with some bright coloured beads
jewellery can really make an outfit and shows your individuality
it can equally work the other way , when going for a dressier style a few cool jewellery pieces can instantly relax the look
louise and emma thatcher 's discovery of the year so far is jewellery brand say what you c , which designs simple gold or silver bar necklaces that can be engraved with a special message , name or date say what you c necklaces are designed to be layered - up , so mix and match the colours , chain lengths and engravings , to really personalise the look , say louise and emma thatcher mia lia has been a long standing favourite jewellery brand of ours , and we 're rarely seen without the fashionable keepsake bracelets piled up on our wrists
louise demonstrates how she piles up colourful mia lia beads , to give both casual and more formal outfits a pretty , bohemian touch stylist and blogger emma thatcher co-ordinates her mia lia beaded bracelets to complement her outfits for a bit of fun , the brightly coloured jewels from rainbowlink ticks all the boxes
a cool , quirky concept and perfect for summer , we love these for an instant wardrobe update
perfect for summer , the brightly coloured jewellery from rainbowlink are all stamped with a cool , quirky mantra
louise chose a maria black earring for a recent red carpet event
louise celebrated her 40th birthday with two pieces from the anita ko fine jewellery collection , bought for her by best friend emma thatcher , and husband jamie redknapp another fine jewellery designer we adore is rosa de la cruz , especially the love ring
the pieces are easy to wear , and are classic yet edgy
the rosa de la cruz range features hand - crafted necklaces , bracelets , earrings and rings designed to be layered for a luxe aesthetic
fine jewellery designer rosa de la cruz is another favorite of louise and emma thatcher , though they suggest looking to the high street for more purse friendly alternatives if you 're not ready to splash out louise wraps a beautiful hermes twilly scarf around her wrist for a hint of colour without any bling
both emma thatcher and lou say this is a brilliant alternative , if you 're not into wearing jewellery if jewellery is n't your thing , then try using silk scarves or bandannas to accessorise your outfit
