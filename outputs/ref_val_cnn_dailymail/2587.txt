myleene explains : ' soshma gave birth at home but realised rhythm was very unwell so she walked for hours to reach the nearest hospital
' he had pneumonia , but in nepal a day in hospital costs a month âs salary so after eight days soshma had no choice but to take rhythm home
' soshma 's father then burned the body of the young baby in the hills , leaving soshma to grieve
myleene continues : ' soshma was clearly still in shock and said this was the first time she âd really talked about it
