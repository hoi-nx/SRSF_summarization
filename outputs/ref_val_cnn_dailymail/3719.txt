aston villa face a major fa inquiry , a substantial fine and the threat of a ground closure after west brom players appeared to be assaulted as the fa cup quarter - final at villa park descended into chaos with an unrestrained pitch invasion joined by thousands of aston villa fans
in alarming scenes , which were a throwback to the football hooliganism of the seventies and eighties , west brom players were left defenceless as fans rushed on to the pitch
scorer fabian delph claimed he was bitten , while boaz myhill , dawson and callum mcmanaman all appeared to be barged aggressively , and the latter seemingly struck on the back of the head by one fan as dawson attempted to shepherd him off
on the final whistle , thousands of fans came on and even aston villa players were threatened by the melee
aston villa captain fabian delph , who scored the first goal in the 2 - 0 win , said : ' it was very , very scary
' aston villa seemed to exacerbate the problem by playing the celebratory song ' que sera sera ' over the pa while fans were still streaming on to the pitch , and put a video of fans celebrating on the pitch on their official twitter feed
meagre numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play a club statement read : ' the club does not condone supporters invading the field of play under any circumstances
' the club extends its sincere apologies to the fa , the west brom directors , manager tony pulis and all his staff and players
' west brom manager tony pulis said : ' it 's disgraceful

' the fa , who are believed to have had a ' crowd control advisor ' present , will begin investigations tomorrow , asking aston villa for their observations and their plans for stewarding
though aston villa had a significant presence of stewards by the west brom fans , there were far fewer by the villa park where the aston villa fans sit and they were quickly overcome by the scale on the invasion
