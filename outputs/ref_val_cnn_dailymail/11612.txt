an indonesian minister has threatened to release a ' human tsunami ' of asylum seekers towards australia if the federal government continues to fight for a stay of execution for the bali nine duo
the warning came from the coordinating minister for political , legal and security affairs - tedjo - to remind the government who was working to keep asylum seekers away from australia shores , fairfax media reported
' mr tedjo - who is an outspoken politician in indonesia - added it was ' no big deal ' if trade relations with australia fell apart following the executions of andrew chan and myuran sukuraman
tedjo ( pictured left with president joko widodo ) is the coordinating minister for political , legal and security affairs in indonesia it comes after indonesian government officials took offence to prime minister tony abbott 's comments about australia donating $ 1 billion in aid to help recovery after the boxing day tsunami he said australia was the nation that benefited most from the agreement , not indonesia
' australia will in fact receive pressure domestically if it stops its livestock exports to indonesia since indonesia is australia 's main market , ' mr tedjo said
the minister also labelled julie bishop 's earlier request to spare andrew chan and myuran sukuraman in exchange for three indonesia drug smugglers held in australia as ' unethical '
