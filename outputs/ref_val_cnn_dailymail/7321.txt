astronomers believe mysterious signals - previously dismissed as stellar bursts - are coming from an earth - like planet
the gliese 581d planet has conditions that could support life , and is likely to be a rocky world , twice the size of earth
signals from the planet were initially discovered in 2010 , but last year dismissed as noise from distant stars
the gliese 581d planet was initially discovered in 2010 ( artist 's impression pictured ) now , a further study claims that the 2014 research was based on ' inadequate analyses of the data ' and that gliese 581d does exist
it was the first earth - like planet found in the ' goldilocks '-zone around another star
but soon after the discovery , a group of scientists said the signals thought to be from a planet were in fact simply magnetic bursts from stars
the latest study claims that the stellar bursts research was based on ' inadequate analyses of the data '
' if their way to treat the data had been right , then some planet search projects at several ground - based observatories would need to be significantly revised as they are all aiming to detect even smaller planets
the gliese 581d planet is likely to be a rocky world , twice the size of earth
' we hope to find a planet that 's earth - like and measure its atmosphere to work out if it has enough water on it to make an ocean , ' he said in an interview with ' i think that will be in around ten to 15 years from now
to find gliese 581d , university of california , santa cruz astronomers originally looked for subtle changes in light caused by the gravity of an orbiting planet tugging back and forth on the star
gliese 581 ( the bright star shown in the centre ) , which is 22 light - years away , has three other confirmed planets , none of which lie within its habitable zone
