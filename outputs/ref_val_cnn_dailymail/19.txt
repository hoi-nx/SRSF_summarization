chelsea clinton went by the pseudonym diane reynolds , and hillary clinton used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the state to plan her daughter 's wedding , a new report has revealed
at the center of the controversy is hillary clinton 's email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com , which was set up a day before she was confirmed in 2009 by a senate committee to join newly elected president barack obama 's cabinet
the times reports that clinton used the address for everything from official government business to matters relating to the clinton foundation , and the state confirmed on wednesday that was clinton 's only email alias during her tenure in the barack obama administration
news articles detailing the former secretary of state 's arrangement to have her government correspondence run through a private domain name and self - run server have set off alarms about the possibility of her sensitive communications being hacked or destroyed
a news report reveled that chelsea used to go by the pseudonym of diane reynolds , and hillary clinton used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the state to plan her daughter 's wedding at least one of hillary clinton 's longtime aides , huma abedin , who is still on clinton 's payroll , had one of the coveted clintonemail.com addresses , as well , the times reports
concerned that hillary clinton could appear too closely tied with the clinton foundation if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family , clinton ran his email through presidentclinton.com
the clintonemail.com domain name was originally registered to clinton confidante eric hothem , the times discovered
hothem is the same aide who was charged with packing up and carting off furniture from the white house at the end of clinton 's presidency that he said was ' clinton âs personal property
' the furnishings were later determined to be government property , however , and the clintons were required to pay $ 86,000 in restitution for the items they kept
hothem now works in finance in washington , d.c. , and another former clinton staffer 's name is on the server registration - cooper
concerned that hillary clinton could appear too closely tied with the clinton foundation while at state if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family , chelsea migrated to chelseaoffice.com and clinton ran his email through presidentclinton.com while the email addresses of all secretaries of state before john kerry doubled as both their personal and professional points of contact , clinton 's deliberate decision to keep her exchanges out of the reach of the federal government has come under intense scrutiny
the white house and the state have been careful to state that to their knowledge , all of clinton 's emails have been secured , and additional questions should be directed at clinton and her team
a spokesman for clinton has said that the top - ranking diplomat transmitted all of government - related communications to the state , but no proof positive of that assertion exists
another expert , threat intelligence analyst alex mcgeorge told bloomberg that clinton 's encryption system was misconfigured and could be hacked
house oversight and government reform chairman chaffetz said wednesday of the debacle that , ' it does beg the question : were there any sort of classified pieces of information that were flowing through her personal email account ? ' comparing the disclosure to that of former cia chief david petraeus , who plead guilty this week to mishandling classified information , chaffetz pointed out that sharing classified information over email '' with somebody who did n't have a classification ' is a crime
at the center of the controversy is hillary clinton 's email account - hrd22@clintonemail.com , which was set up a day before she was confirmed in 2009 by a senate committee to join newly elected president barack obama 's cabinet
a special house committee exclusively focused on auditing the executive branch 's response to the 2012 benghazi terror attack is subpoenaing emails from clinton 's personal account
' clinton 's request that state make public her emails ' does nothing to address the key questions of whether official communications were deleted or whether sensitive classified information was put at risk , ' the group 's executive director , dan epstein , said in a statement
