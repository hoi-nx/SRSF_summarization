moscow this was supposed to be a rally led by boris nemtsov , had he lived two more days to see it
but after the russia opposition figure was gunned down friday night , sunday 's rally in moscow took on a different theme
instead of gathering to criticize russia 's policies on ukraine , thousands of people came together to mourn the death of the former deputy prime minister
and as they united near the site of boris nemtsov 's death , conspiracy theories swirled over who killed the staunch critic of president putin as he walked near the kremlin with his ukraine model companion
ukraine president poroshenko added fuel to the conspiracists ' fire by saying saturday that boris nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to russia interests , according to ukrinform , the state - run news agency
" a few weeks ago i had a conversation with him on how to build relations between ukraine and russia , as we would like them to be
boris nemtsov said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the russia armed forces in ukraine
russia authorities originally declined to issue a permit for the march when it was billed as an opposition rally
the model later called yashin , a friend and political colleague of boris nemtsov 's , and said several men had pulled up in a car , and one opened fire , yashin said
police say they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 - foot - 7 and 5 - foot - 9 , russia 's sputnik news agency reported
" the committee is also exploring the possibility that the killing is related to the charlie hebdo terror attack in paris or boris nemtsov 's business activities , it said
she was reportedly being kept under guard at an apartment , and ukraine 's foreign ministry has requested that duritskaya be allowed to return to ukraine , according to tass , a russia news agency
the president also wrote to boris nemtsov 's mother saying he shared her grief and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice , the kremlin said
but some of boris nemtsov 's fellow critics suspect involvement by either putin 's administration or a supporter of the president
" i do n't know who killed boris nemtsov , but i know that it 's the government and personally putin who are responsible for it
" putin had a different theory : that the killing was a contract hit , but one meant to fire up political strife , putin 's spokesman peskov said
he told the russia newspaper sobesednik last month that he was " a little bit " afraid his mother 's fears putin would have him killed would come true
" last year , boris nemtsov spoke to cnn 's anthony bourdain
last year , a moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of russia journalist and fierce kremlin critic anna politkovskaya
russia spy alexander litvinenko accused state security services of organizing a coup to put putin in power
and before his death , boris nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against putin 's government
while boris nemtsov certainly had his share of enemies in russia -- especially those who disagree with his stance on the ukraine conflict -- many left notes for the slain politician on the bridge where he was killed
" in a column on how boris nemtsov had been harassed for his regular criticism of the kremlin , human rights watch 's tanya cooper lambasted peskov , the putin spokesman , for saying the killing appeared to be an attempt to destabilize russia -- a statement cooper said could prejudice the investigation
" russia has become the kind of place where a top opposition leader can be murdered just steps away from the president 's office , " she wrote
