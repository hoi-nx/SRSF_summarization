los angeles three area residents were arrested and charged wednesday for allegedly operating four southern california schools for korean and china students who never attended classes and lived in other states on student visas in a " pay - to - stay " scheme
the three educators collected as much as $ 6 million in annual tuition from an enrollment of about 1,500 foreign students who were largely from south korea and china , said federal prosecutors
the arrests came after a federal grand jury indicted the three defendants tuesday on charges of conspiracy to commit immigration fraud , money laundering and other immigration offenses
an allegation in the indictment would also require the defendants to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the fraudulent scheme , authorities said
the two other defendants are each charged with one count of that same offense : they are hyung chan moon , also known as steve moon , 39 , of los angeles who assisted in the operation and management of the schools ; and eun young choi , also known as jamie choi , 32 , of los angeles , a former employee who also assisted in the operation and management of the school
" prodee university / neo-america language school was located on the fifth floor of a los angeles office tower near the koreatown neighborhood , but homeland security investigations agents said they found the school " abandoned " during their raid on wednesday
the agents allowed cnn to attend the raid
in fact , the abandoned school brought to mind a movie set , filled with props and decorations , but no actors
one federal agent said many of the students listed on the school rolls were older , in their 30s , 40s and 50s
prodee 's 2011 - 2012 catalog describes the facility as an english as second language school and states " it is our mission that all students be able to flourish in their ability to use and understand english in all facets of life by providing a top quality esl educational environment , " according to a copy of the document on the website of the california bureau for private postsecondary education
the schools were authorized by the federal government to issue a document that certified a foreign student had been accepted to a school and would be attending classes full time in the u.s. , authorities said
in exchange for that form , students paid $ 1,800 tuition to enroll in one of the schools for six months , authorities said
during their investigation , authorities interviewed 35 students , mainly from south korea , and found none resided in los angeles , officials said
an unannounced federal inspection of prodee 's main site in 2011 found only one english class with three students , though the school listed an enrollment of 900 students for its two sites , prosecutors said
on the same day , federal authorities also visited the american college of forensic studies found only one religion with one student , though the school claimed an enrollment of more than 300 foreign students , prosecutors said
some students transferred to one of the four schools after attending other u.s. schools also participating in the federal student and exchange visitor program , prosecutors said
those targeted residences are believed to have catered largely to women from china , who paid $ 15,000 to $ 50,000 for lodging , transportation and food , according to a statement by u.s. immigration and customs enforcement
