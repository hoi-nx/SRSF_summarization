they say a nutrient in garlic offers the brain protection against ageing and disease
it could even prevent age - related neurological diseases such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's
' most people think of it as a ' superfood , ' because garlic 's sulfur - containing compounds are known as an excellent source of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protection
a thousand year - old potion made out of onions , garlic , wine and bile from a cow 's stomach can kill hospital superbugs , scientists claim
' our research focused on a carbohydrate derivative of garlic known as fruarg and the role this nutrient plays in protective responses
' gu 's team looked at the nutrient 's ability to inhibit â and even possibly reverse â brain cell damage caused by environmental stress
' however , increasing the number of microglial cells wo n't provide age - defying protection for the brain , gu said
' excessive production of nitric oxide leads to brain cell damage and promotes neurodegenerative diseases such as cerebral ischemia , parkinson 's disease and alzheimer 's disease
gu 's team looked at the nutrient 's ability to inhibit â and even possibly reverse â brain cell damage caused by environmental stress
by creating a cell model of neurological stress and monitoring microglial cell function , gu 's team was able to study fruarg 's contribution to brain health
' this helps us understand how garlic benefits the brain by making it more resilient to the stress and inflammation associated with neurological diseases and aging
