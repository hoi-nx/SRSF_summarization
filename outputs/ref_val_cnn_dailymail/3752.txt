dozens of cheap and popular southern california wines are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic , claims a new lawsuit filed this week
sutter home , korbel , franzia and trader joe 's charles shaw , also known as ' two-buck chuck , ' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe
kabateck said 83 wines , almost all of which sell for below $ 10 a bottle , contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water
the environmental protection agency standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard
' the us does not have a set standard for safe levels of arsenic in wine , according to the san francisco chronicle
the lawsuit claims 83 of the 1,306 wines that were tested contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water but wines are allowed to have arsenic levels up to 100 parts per billion in canada - and other countries allow even higher levels
according to institute spokeswoman gladys horiuchi , southern california wines have never come close to exceeding the arsenic levels that are accepted in other countries , she told the associated press
a trader trader joe 's spokesman said the grocery store chain had ' no reason to believe the wines we offer are unsafe , including charles shaw white zinfandel '
the 83 bottles of wine cited in a lawsuit this week as having dangerously high levels of arsenic came from 28 southern california wineries and were bottled under 31 different brand labels
