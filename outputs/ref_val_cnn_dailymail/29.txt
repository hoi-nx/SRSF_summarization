campaigning mp simon danczuk , a member of parliament âs communities and local government committee which will grill mr stone today , said : â it brings shame on the honours system if these awards are not removed
â if these people have any decency , they will give back their honours
these people have badly let down vulnerable young girls and turned a blind eye to the most horrendous abuse
local labour mp sarah champion said the number may be as high as 2,000 as more young women are coming forward all the time
it undermines the integrity of the system if these people retain their awards
they should be forced to give them up
