clegg insisted yesterday his party was ' here to stay ' as he predicted the lib dems would defy the odds to serve a second term in government
despite consistently dismal poll ratings , the lib dems leader claimed it would win more seats than forecast and could still hold office with fewer mps
he went so far as to claim that only his party could stop a ' rag - tag mob ' of mps from ukip or the scottish national party from holding the balance of power after the election on may 7
the latest polls have consistently put the lib dems on just 7 per cent , with experts predicting they will lose at least half the 57 seats they won at the last election
but , bizarrely , mr clegg compared their hopes for the future to last november 's landing of the rosetta space probe on the surface of a comet

mr clegg 's 46 - year - old wife â a partner at a us law firm â does not get on stage to embrace her husband as other political wives do after their speeches
yesterday , it was mr clegg who came down the steps â as at previous conferences â and hugged her before they left to cheers from the party faithful .
