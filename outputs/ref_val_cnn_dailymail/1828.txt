killer : triple killer ian mcloughlin , pictured , stabbed to death graham buck , 66 , while allowed out of prison on day release a triple killer was allowed out on day release , leaving him free to murder a good samaritan in a decision today branded a ' catastrophic failure ' by the chief inspector of prisons
ian mcloughlin stabbed to death graham buck , 66 , while allowed out from hmp springhill in buckinghamshire , where he was serving a 25 - year jail term for killing two men he believed were paedophiles
ian mcloughlin had travelled to the home of former prisoner and convicted sex offender francis cory-wright in hertfordshire in july 2013 , and filled a pillowcase with cash and family heirlooms in a robbery
mr graham buck heard his neighbour 's screams and went to investigate what was happening , but was dragged inside by ian mcloughlin , who slashed his throat
in a report drawn up in january last year but made public today , hardwick , the chief inspector of prisons , highlighted a catalogue of failings that allowed ian mcloughlin to be released
he said : ' the decision to release ian mcloughlin had catastrophic consequences
' in a highly critical report , mr hardwick warned that the system for identifying and managing prisoners released on temporary licence ( rotl ) are woefully inadequate
the number of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences , which are handed out to the most dangerous convicts , and allowed out on day release has increased from 38,000 to more than 90,000 between 2008 and 2012
' wanted : ian mcloughlin met convicted paedophile francis cory-wright , 88 , in prison , and during a subsequent manhunt he was last seen at this hotel cctv , released by police at the time attack : ian mcloughlin burgled convicted sex offender francis cory-wright and neighbour graham buck heard his neighbour 's screams and was dragged inside by ian mcloughlin , who slashed his throat he said protection arrangements ' are not routinely reviewed when prisoners transfer to open prisons ' and ' risk assessment processes are inadequate '
ian mcloughlin had a history of violent attacks towards men he suspected of paedophilia and had failed to return to prison after being allowed out on day release before
but despite these warning signs , poor leadership and a failure to properly assess the risk he posed meant officials waved through his day release in july 2013
the convicted killer failed to return to hmp springhill while released for the day in december 2010
he went out drinking all day and returned to a man 's house where he was found by police called out to reports of two men having a row
ian mcloughlin was arrested , but not charged , for being drunk and disorderly and returned to a closed prison
crime scene : ian mcloughlin killed mr graham buck at the home of francis cory-wright in the hertfordshire village of little gaddesden , near berkhamsted
he was on temporary day release from jail at the time of the murder mr hardwick warned that officials had failed to appreciate ian mcloughlin 's dangerous ' pattern of drinking , identifying single male targets who he believed to be paedophiles and / or homosexuals , returning to their houses , getting involved in an altercation and attacking them '
despite these worrying signs , ian mcloughlin was sent back to an open prison in march 2013
but his multi-agency public protection arrangements ( mappa ) were not properly reviewed on his return , and his new offender manager did not even see him before he was cleared for day release , the report found
mr hardwick concluded : ' it was not appropriate to release mr ian mcloughlin for the first time since his previous failure in 2011 for such a lengthy , unaccompanied , unstructured and unmonitored rotl
this was his first opportunity to be released on temporary licence since his rotl failure in 2011
at his trial , ian mcloughlin told the jury that delgatty , 49 , â who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys â had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under - age sex with a teenage boy
ian mcloughlin âs 25 - year minimum term would have meant he was eligible for release on licence in 2017 but he was moved to a category d â open resettlement prison â so he could prepare for life outside
