an aspiring foreign manager emboldened by radical ideas meets a settled , ego - fuelled dressing room that âs enjoyed no little success
sound familiar ? for peter lawwell , the warning signs upon appointing ronny deila to the celtic manager âs post last summer were to be found not a million miles from home
when paul le guen arrived at rangers in the summer of 2006 , there seemed solid grounds for fans of the ibrox club not to question if the frenchman would be a runaway success , but to just what extent
celtic manager ronny deila ( left ) and chief executive peter lawwell launch new kit deal at parkhead peter lawwell has dismissed comparison between ronny deila and former rangers boss paul le guen ( right ) after a difficult start , ronny deila has started to turn things around at parkhead this was , after all , not only a coach who had brought three successive titles to the ligue 1 club lyon , but one who had made them a name to be feared across european
if le paul le guen could drop just a little of his je ne sais quoi into the ibrox water , the sky would be the limit
yet , by january 4 the following year , the frenchman was already history â his departure a cautionary tale of too much , too soon , resistance to change and the importance of unstinting backing from the boardroom
disastrous though le paul le guen âs short tenure was , to this day it âs only natural for the rump of the rangers support to wonder what might have transpired had he been afforded more time
fast - forward eight years to the start of this season and â on the other half of the city â parallels with the frenchman were being drawn
whilst stromsgodset were much further down the football food - chain than lyon , ronny deila still arrived with the pedigree of being a league winner as a manager
and , just as le paul le guen had faced resistance from a squad used to alex mcleish âs methods for so long , much of the norwegian âs methodology was bound to grate with a squad that had thrived under neil lennon
lyon 's former league winning manager le guen arrived at ibrox with a big reputation in 2006 the frenchman left rangers the following january after losing games and the dressing room â when we set off with him , we knew we were going to give him time , â peter lawwell insisted
â if you go back to le guen â i always say to ronny deila about the â le paul le guen hump â
â when he came in , he âd won three - in - a - row in frenchman , had new ideas , a new philosophy and a new culture
earlier this week , john hartson eloquently described how he now looks at celtic â s early struggles under the norwegian as almost being in a different season and few who witnessed them will find that difficult to relate to
but , asked if â in the dark moments of autumn â he privately harboured doubts about the man he championed , peter lawwell was unambiguous
the norwegian manager looks on during celtic 's 1 - 0 defeat to st johnstone on wednesday despite the defeat , the hoops are six points clear at the top of the scottish premiership table â we âre paid for these judgment calls and there was never any question of knee - jerk reactions to a bad result , or a bad couple of results , â he insisted
â genuinely , when ronny deila came in , we understood where he was strong and where he was weak ; he was weak in terms of experience
â nothing prepares you for celtic , as a manager or even a player coming here
but hopefully in the short and longer term , he will create a fantastic team for celtic
in terms of a turning point for a season that at one point threatened to implode , peter lawwell feels the injury - time win with 10 men at pittodrie in early november â followed by the ronny roar at its most ferocious â was it
ronny deila trains with his players , with peter lawwell insisting the former stromsgodset boss ' creates ' a team ronny deila shares a laugh with manchester city loanee john guidetta ( left ) during a training session â i think that was a change , yes , â peter lawwell reflected
â ultimately , ronny deila âs appointment was sanctioned by the board but it was the chief executive who first put his neck on the line for him
this was the big one
i have supported celtic all my life
â ronny deila will get his first chance for silverware when celtic face dundee united in the league cup final peter lawwell has given deila 8/10 for results and 10/10 for showing progress in his debut season the destination of the season âs major prizes may yet be unknown but peter lawwell isn â t of a mind to hide ronny deila âs light under a bushel
asked to rate his success to date in terms of a mark out of 10 , peter lawwell replied : â in terms of results , eight
he is fitting in to the environment here and outside , which again is a big change for him
