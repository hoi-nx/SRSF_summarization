â there are very few moments in a man 's existence when he experiences so much ludicrous distress , â dickens wrote about having to chasing a hat in the pickwick papers
now researchers have turned to the great victorian author to help find a way of making passwords both secure and more memorable
researchers have turned to the works of dickens ( illustrated ) to generate secure but memorable passwords according to new research by us - based computer scientists
they used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within mr dickens ' a tale of two cities to generate new passwords they used a model from probability theory to examine the occurrence of letters within mr dickens ' a tale of two cities to generate new passwords
millions of internet users still rely upon easy - to - crack passwords such as â qwerty â and â 123456 â , but many people are choosing to use more complex sets of characters for our online accounts
however , a new study has found these seemingly random passwords may be more obvious to hack than you realise
researchers have shown that passwords such as â mnbvcxz â , â qaz2wsx â and â adgjmptw â can be cracked in seconds - and adding numbers to your codes does little to boost its strength
the same approach is used to generate the third character using the second and third letter and so on
the result is 56 - bit passwords that look like english but are not , making them easy to remember but harder for hackers to guess
according to dr clements , a computer and software engineer at the california polytechnic state university who devised the approach , these are easier to remember than random strings of letters and characters that are often recommended by password generators
' today , the general assumption - evidenced by the lack of systems using randomly assigned passwords - is that users can not be expected to recall secure passwords ' if we âre convinced that random passwords are a good idea , and that recalling a 56 - bit password is at least within the realm of possibility , we must try to find a set of passwords that are as memorable as possible
' research on passwords has shown that most people tend to use letters or words that are easiest for them to remember
mark burnett , a utah - based password researcher who recently published a list of 10 million passwords taken from those shared over the internet , found that the most commonly used password is 123456 followed by the word password
these are easy to break as most hackers will use easy to remember passwords when trying to break into an account
the graph above shows the distribution of letters following ' ca ' in a tale of two cities by dickens
by randomly generating letters using an algorthim that selects those letters based on meeting certain pobability rules of it appearing with the two preceeding letters in a piece of text , the method produces random but familiar looking passwords
dr clements said that the approach is not just limited to the works of dickens
indeed it could be used to generate passwords from a person 's own emails , for example
