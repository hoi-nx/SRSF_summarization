confirmed : miliband will take part in the three leaders ' debates during the election miliband has said he will take part in all three televised leaders ' debate during the election campaign - the day after david cameron flatly refused
the labour 's campaign chairman douglas alexander confirmed in a letter to broadcaster that mr miliband was prepared to appear
his willingness to appear is in stark contrast with that of mr david cameron , who last night made it clear he was willing to do one seven - way debate at the end of march , but no more
in a joint statement , the broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven - way debate involving mr david cameron , labour 's miliband , nick clegg of the lib dems and the leaders of the greens , ukip , snp and plaid cymru on itv on april 2
they urged the prime minister to ' reconsider ' his refusal to take part in these shows
but mr david cameron 's chief spin doctor oliver said their response was ' disappointing ' and restated the prime minister 's ' final position ' was for a single debate to take place in the week starting march 23
in a speech to his party 's scottish conference mr miliband is expected to say : ' today the labour party has written to the broadcasters saying with or without david cameron , i will be at the debates
' and every day up to these debates he [ mr david cameron ] will be asked : what are you hiding from ? ' mr miliband is expected to use his conference speech to accuse mr david cameron of ' duplicity ' and of trying to ' chicken out ' of the debates
contrast : the labour 's confirmation is in contrast to david cameron 's refusal to take part ' chicken ' : mr miliband is expected to accuse the conservative leader of ' running away ' in his speech a labour grand coalition could be needed after the election to stop the snp holding the balance of power and provoking a constitutional crisis , a former conservative home secretary has said
writing in the independent , the former cabinet minister accepted that a deal between david cameron and miliband was ' quite unthinkable ' at the moment , but pointed out it worked in germany
lord baker 's intervention follows a warning from former prime minister sir john major that the snp would enter any deal with labour with the ' overriding aim ' of ' prising apart ' the union
' in a letter to mr oliver , the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if mr david cameron decides not to take part - effectively ' empty - chairing ' the prime minister
but mr oliver replied : ' i made the prime minister 's final position clear in my last letter - he is willing to do a seven - way debate in the week beginning march 23
' with neither side in the stand - off backing down , the debates are set to go ahead without mr david cameron 's participation .
