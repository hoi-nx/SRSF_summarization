the 95 - year - old raf squadron leader , now the only surviving pilot of the legendary raid , is to auction the medals to help pay for the upkeep of uk âs recently built memorial to the 55,573 airmen killed in the war
the medals are expected to fetch around Â£ 50,000 when they are sold with his flying logs and other memorabilia this month , but squadron leader munro has pledged to donate the proceeds to the raf benevolent fund , the welfare charity that maintains the memorial in green park
he added it was a â travesty â that the â magnificent memorial â â dedicated to uk and commonwealth airmen and ground crew after a campaign led by the daily mail and others â was not unveiled until 2012 , more than 67 years after the war ended
it costs Â£ 50,000 a year to maintain , and les munro wants to help pay for it service : les munro leaning out of the cockpit of his lancaster , which he flew on the 617 squadron raid

but permanent memorial for bomber command was n't built for 67 years due to the controversy of thousands of germany civilians who died during the bombings of its cities
in 2010 germany politicians called for plans for the memorial to be abandoned out of respect for the civilian casualties
' but 67 years after the war ended the Â£ 3.5million raf memorial was created at the piccadilly entrance to green park in london
foremost among them was the 1943 precision raid that destroyed dams in germany âs industrial heartland , crippling armament factories along the ruhr valley
les munro , then a flight lieutenant , was piloting one of the lancaster bombers to the dams when the aircraft was hit by flak , smashing a gaping hole into the rear fuselage , damaging equipment vital to sighting the target and wiping out all communications
against difficult odds , les munro saved the lives of his crew by flying the plane home safely , still carrying its specially designed mine
les munro , promoted afterwards to squadron leader , went on to lead successful raids on germany arms factories , rocket sites and u-boat pens all over europe
