lawyers for pistorius have failed in their bid to stop prosecutors appealing against the athlete 's negligent killing conviction for shooting his girlfriend reeva steenkamp dead two years ago pistorius 's lawyers have failed in their attempt to stop prosecutors appealing against the double - amputee athlete 's negligent killing conviction
judge masipa dismissed their application to challenge the appeal by prosecutors , who want pistorius convicted of the more serious charge of murder for shooting his girlfriend , reeva steenkamp , multiple times in a bathroom in his home on valentine 's day in 2013
in december , judge masipa granted prosecutors permission to take the case to south africa 's supreme court of appeal and challenge her own ruling to acquit pistorius of murder and find him guilty instead of a lesser charge comparable to manslaughter
if prosecutors succeed in their appeal against the culpable homicide conviction in the supreme court of appeal and have it upgraded to murder , pistorius would face a minimum of 15 years in jail
failed bid : the athlete 's lawyer roux ( pictured ) argued that prosecutors had ' mistakenly ' been given permission to appeal against judge masipa 's initial trial verdict of manslaughter prosecutor nel ( above ) said there was no basis for the application by the defence , which wanted a ' never - ending case ' to prevent it from going to the appeal court the judge heard arguments by roux , pistorius 's chief defence lawyer at trial , and nel , the chief prosecutor
pistorius 's trial now looks set to be reviewed by a panel of judges at the supreme court of appeal , which sits in the central city of bloemfontein
