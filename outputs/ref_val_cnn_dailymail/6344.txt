but while the handsets they are used in have developed and evolved significantly during that time , sim still look the same - albeit smaller - and are still lodged inside devices
a university of cambridge computer science experts believes the small microchips ' days are numbered and we should be signing into our phones in the same way we log into online accounts
dr markus kuhn from the university of cambridge said the sim ( stock image ) could have been replaced long ago
he believes alternatives include typing in a user identifier and password directly into a phone ' the fact is , the sim could have been replaced long ago with a simpler alternative : typing in a user identifier and password directly into the phone is an option - just as we do to access wi-fi , ' said dr markus kuhn from the university of cambridge
or qr codes - the square , 3d barcodes - are a more convenient alternative for smartphones with cameras , where an app can read the details encoded in the qr codes straight from the camera
dr markus kuhn continued : ' sim cards were a useful feature when they came onto the market in 1991
' at the time mobile phones were bulky devices , usually mounted in cars [ and ] a sim would help customers quickly and easily transfer their phone number and contacts from one phone to the next , without the need to type in long identifiers and access codes each time
alternatively , qr codes ( example pictured ) are a convenient way to store and access data using a smartphone camera ' but the days of huge or rented car phones are gone , and today smartphones are lightweight , personal devices that we entrust with passwords to many sites and services - access to wi-fi , email , social networks , app stores , and online shopping
in terms of security , dr markus kuhn explained that sim cards are also vulnerable to attack
although the firm said that little information was stolen , ' the reality is that sim cards are now more of a drawback than a benefit , ' added dr markus kuhn
the university of cambridge lecturer also believes the time is right to switch from sim cards because modern cryptographic techniques mean passwords no longer have to be very long
dr markus kuhn said sim cards were a useful feature when mobile phones were mounted in cars ( pictured ) and customers wanted to transfer contacts from one phone to the next
but as phones have become more mobile , he believes the technology is outdated and should be replaced with a modern alternative password - authenticated key exchange ( pake ) techniques exist that use passwords as a five - digit pin to create highly secure encrypted connections that even the supercomputers of eavesdropping intelligence agencies ca n't break
meanwhile , app stores use modern authentication technique and these could be used to easily transfer all the functionality of a sim into the phone using an app. ' all that âs needed is a new standard interface for mobile operating systems such as android or ios that would allow software to take over the functions of the sim , said dr markus kuhn
