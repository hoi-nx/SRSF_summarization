undergoing oxygen treatment in a pressure chamber , this is a survivor of the deadly explosion at a ukrainian coal mine that killed 33 people
andrei serebrennikov , who was exposed to dangerous levels of methane , is being treated at the regional hospital of occupational diseases in donetsk after the incident on wednesday
the last missing miner was found dead tonight , following the blast that happened before dawn more than 3,200ft underground at the zasyadko mine in the city
rebel officials said the accident was caused by methane gas
zasyadko mine has a history of deadly accidents , including one in november 2007 that killed 101 workers , and two more the following month that killed a total of 57
although the latest gas explosion was not directly caused by the fighting , miners say war may have contributed to the death toll
other parts of the mine had been damaged in the past by artillery strikes , which cut off access routes and may have made escape more difficult for those trapped below ground
