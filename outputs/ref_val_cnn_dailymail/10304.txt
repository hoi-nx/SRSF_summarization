ownership of the 180,000 carat bahia emerald has come down to two parties : an idaho businessman who says he was once swindled into buying a stake in the gem and the government of brazil , where the stone was first unearthed before embarking on 10 years of international intrigue
on one side is kit morrison , a mormon investor who says he and two associates have successfully beaten back half a dozen rogues and thieves to gain legal ownership of the 840 - pound rock
on the other stands the nation of brazil , whose lawyers contend the cartoonishly large green jewel should be repatriated after it was illegally mined and shipped out of the country in 2001
legendary gem : the bahia emerald , one of the world 's largest , has wound up in the custody of the dept after over a decade of changing hands and being shipped , stolen and fought over in court crystals the size of a man 's arm protrude from the 840 - pound stone and make the bahia one of the largest emeralds ever unearthed ' we 've beaten six people , ' kit morrison told cbs news
' kit morrison says he received it as collateral from gem dealer biegler for a shipment of diamonds for which he paid $ 1.3 million but never received
biegler in 2008 claimed to kit morrison -- who was still awaiting his diamonds -- that he 'd been kidnapped by the brazil mafia , according to bloomberg
biegler had tried to pacify kit morrison with two buckets of low quality emeralds he sold for just $ 20,000 and kit morrison realized he was unlikely to ever receive his diamonds
the bahia , one of the world 's largest emeralds , has had a long journey since silicon valley entrepreneur thomas had himself photographed with it in a carport in brazil in 2001
the la sheriff 's dept came to possess the internationally known stone after at least eight gem dealers , investors and thieves had one - by - one come to own -- or believe they owned -- all 180,000 carats of it legend has it , the emerald was originally ' carried out of the rain forest by a team of pack mules
along the way the mules were attacked and killed by a pair of black panthers and had to be carried by a team of men and a hand made stretcher the rest of the trip , ' according to thebahiaemerald.com the emerald came into the u.s. in early 2005 and was kept in san jose , california , for a time before being taken to new orleans , according to a lawyer for the remaining group of claimants , including kit morrison
kryptonite for investors : the rock at one point was used as ill - fated collateral for business investment and a diamond purchase but now sits in legal limbo after slipping through the fingers of so many during his trial that began in september 2010 and was delayed several times , thomas testified that he paid $ 60,000 to the brazil miners who dug it up
most gem - quality emeralds are mined in colombia , not brazil , where they tend to have more impurities
the gem has remained in an undisclosed los angeles facility ever since -- through years of legal wrangling between eight different parties who claimed ownership at one point or another
but just as kit morrison and company neared the end of the battle , brazil authorities threw their hat in the ring
in september 2014 , brazil petitioned to make all claims of ownership over the emerald void , claiming the rock was taken out of the country illegally
' the simple fact of the matter is when it was mined out of brazil and illegally exported , it should not have been , ' the country 's los angeles - based attorney nadolenco told fox news
' brazil asked the los angeles judge to dismiss kit morrison 's case on monday , which the judge refused and instead allowed the country to put forward its own formal claim of ownership as eight parties have done before
