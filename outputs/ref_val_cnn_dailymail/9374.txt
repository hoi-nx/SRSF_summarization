with its own private beach and sublimely tranquil surroundings , this norway house is up for sale - for just 5p
there is a condition however for any prospective buyer - they must focus their efforts into restoring the ramshackle property to its former glory
the house is located on the island of buoya on the fringes of the arctic circle , and it has been uninhabited since the last tenant moved out in the 1970s
one challenge you could set on buying the house would be to find your neighbour ... the house is located on the uninhabited island of buoya ( to the left of picture above ) on the fringes of the arctic circle the current owner describes the house as ' an exciting project , and a ' unique opportunity he added : ' i do n't really think it 's worth taking more money anyway , because the house is currently a catastrophe to say the least
