the probe into an alleged paedophile network at the heart of the british establishment took an explosive turn last night with the revelation that powell âs name has been passed to police
the mail on sunday can reveal that the late tory mp , one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the 20th century , has been named to scotland yard by the bishop of durham
the claim is being examined by operation fenbridge , one of a number of police probes into â establishment paedophile rings â â including an investigation by the independent police complaints commission into claims that officers dropped their inquiries under pressure from powerful individuals
a church of england spokesman said : â the name of powell was passed to operation fenbridge by one of our safeguarding team on the instruction of bishop bishop of monmouth
report : bishop of monmouth , the bishop of durham , passed the name to scotland yard after hearing it from the former bishop of monmouth however , the ongoing scandal over how serial paedophile jimmy savile was able to evade detection for decades has led institutions to take a safety - first approach , so the church of england felt it had no option but to pass on the information to police
powell âs frontline political career ended abruptly in 1968 after he made his infamous â rivers of blood â speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration
last night , simon heffer , powell âs official biographer and former confidante , branded the allegations â absolute nonsense â and without foundation .
