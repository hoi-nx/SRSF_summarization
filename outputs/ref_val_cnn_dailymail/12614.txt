the morning after the 2004 election , when voters in 11 states passed constitutional bans on marriage equality , i never thought i 'd see committed and loving gay and lesbian couples getting married in my lifetime -- in alabama of all places
what 's more , i certainly never thought that , 50 years after a march for voting rights went from selma to montgomery , that the first couple to get married there would be a courageous american - american couple , tori and shantã© wolfe , who camped out overnight on the sidewalk outside the courthouse just to be the first in line
they slept on that chilly pavement despite the ravings of chief justice moore of the supreme court , who has issued baseless edict after baseless edict urging the state 's probate judges to ignore a federal court ruling ( which supersedes a state ruling ) and to refuse to treat lgbt people equally under the law
in an interview with cnn 's chris cuomo on thursday , chief justice moore even compared refusing marriage licenses to gay couples to refusing to enforce the 1857 dred scott v. sandford decision ( which upheld the legal status of slaves as property )
the 13 states that still ban same - sex marriage many are highlighting the echoes of the past in alabama right now ; of gov. george wallace actually blocking two american students from entering the auditorium of the university of alabama as they tried to desegregate the school ; of civil rights battles come and gone
in just a few months , the u.s. supreme court could end this chapter of our history once and for all
even with alabama entering the marriage equality column , there are still 13 states that deny these couples their equal rights
that 's why this spring , the supreme court will hear a case that will determine whether the u.s. constitution can tolerate that kind of discrimination
federal judge : alabama judges must issue gay marriage licenses we 've all got to raise our voices in support of couples like tori and shantã©
the people 's brief marks the first time that the american people -- the 58 % of u.s. who support marriage equality , anyway -- can make their voices heard in an official brief to those justices
the people 's brief will serve as a poignant reminder to the supreme court that gay marriage is an issue that impacts the lives of both gay and straight , of those who are the family , friends , and loved ones of gay people , and of those who simply value a society where the rights of all people are treated with equal dignity
in past civil rights struggles , such as the one that took place half a century ago in selma , alabama , well - intentioned people far from the fray had no easy way to express their support
i 've signed my name to the people 's brief , and i hope u.s. from all backgrounds will do the same or just try to learn more about marriage equality
today , i 'm optimistic that if change can come to alabama , there is no reason why it ca n't come to all 50 states
