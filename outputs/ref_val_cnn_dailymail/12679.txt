there are the requisite grey ladies in fur and chapeaux , as well as twenty - somethings in backpacks huddled in groups , downing their drinks before walking into pace 's booze - free exhibition space for the opening of a strong , sweet smell of incense : a portrait of fraser
while his name may ring few bells outside of the seasoned london art community , eminent gallerist fraser , who ran a gallery in london during the swinging sixties and again in the eighties , was a seminal part of the swinging sixties scene
this is the eminent dealer who sold art to paul mccartney , and hosted john lennon and yoko ono 's first joint exhibition ; the savile row-clad etonian whose mayfair galleries attracted the likes of marlon brando , marianne faithfull and william burroughs in the 60s and 80s ; the silver - tongued heroin addict who introduced warhol and basquiat to britain , and was arrested -- and , in his case , imprisoned -- for drug possession with mick jagger and keith richards during the 1967 redlands bust
curated by the artist brian clarke , a strong , sweet smell of incense -- a winking reference to the police report describing the bust -- aims to blend the rebel , the art connoisseur and the hedonist to present a rounded image of an unsung star of the 60s
i first met brian clarke three weeks before the opening at his spacious cottage - cum - mansion in london 's tony notting hill neighborhood
a literal portrait of fraser painted by basquiat hangs prominently in the living room , surrounded by works by warhol , bacon and others
brian clarke , who was a close friend of fraser 's and was the first artist exhibited at his 80s gallery , is still finalizing the exhibition selection , but his energy is easy , if a little manic
vyner , a long - time friend of brian clarke and fraser , and author of the fraser biography groovy bob : the life and times of fraser , has been collaborating with him on the catalog
" the idea for the portrait came from pace 's managing director dent-brocklehurst a year ago , when brian clarke told her he 'd been entrusted with fraser 's archive
) " the ' light bulb moment ' really struck when we realized that pace founder , arne glimcher , was setting up his first gallery in boston at the time fraser was opening his own gallery in london , " dent-brocklehurst writes in an email
" there 's a buzz in london right now around the exhibition and many artists , museum directors , celebrities , aspiring artists , art students are all very keen to rediscover fraser 's personality
" to hear brian clarke speak about fraser is to have assumptions alternately challenged , rebuked and confirmed
works from the luminaries fraser knew , showed or admired are on the walls , while personal effects -- a thank - you note from ed ruscha , a sex pistols never mind the bollocks poster , arrest warrants , an opium pipe with the gold rim worn to silver -- are kept behind glass cases
take a few steps , and you 're looking at the drum from the beatles ' 1967 sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band album cover , which fraser art directed
an inscribed copy of an edward burne-jones biography was gifted from fraser to brian clarke
" there is always around fraser this aura of all these celebrities and things like that , and it 's true that they were there , but it was n't anything that he either curried or boasted about , " brian clarke says
brian clarke remembers discussing capote with fraser at length during a stay in new york
) " for all of the inevitable references to the hedonistic side of fraser , he had a very sophisticated intelligence in terms of visual art , and genuinely in terms of culture , " brian clarke says
a party - goer and i get to chatting about the exhibition , the party , and fraser
i recall something brian clarke told me a few weeks prior , an effort to summarize the spirit of fraser 's galleries and its infamous parties , studded with stars and doused in glamor and excitement
" a strong , sweet smell of incense : a portrait of fraser is on at london , burlington gardens until march 28 , 2015 .
