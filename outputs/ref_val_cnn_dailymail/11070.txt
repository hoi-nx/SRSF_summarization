a teenager who was searching for her missing pet was relieved when she was told someone had found the dog and taken it to the vet , only to find out the animal had been put down
lawson , 18 , put an appeal on facebook when her homer sneaked out of the garden of her family home in washington , tyne and wear , and disappeared
her despair initially turned to joy when she was told it had been found by a member of the public who took the animal , which had arthritis which makes him drag his back leg , to a vet
but she was then told by the vet that they had put homer down because of his condition - without telling his devastated owner first
lawson said she was distraught after she found her missing dog had been handed in by a member of the public to the vet , only for staff to decide to put the animal down - without informing her first ms lawson said : ' homer did have a few health problems , but he was not as bad as the vet said he was
' after homer , who was 16 - years - old , disappeared he was found by a member of the public and taken to cestria vets in chester-le-street
vets said he was having trouble breathing and within 24 hours he was put to sleep
ms lawson believes the arthritis in his legs , which caused him to drag his back leg and look ill , was known to the vets after homer was injured in an accident 12 years ago
miss lawson said her pet had arthritis in his legs , but claimed veterinary staff had known about his condition ' we had no way of knowing he 'd been taken to the vets
' homer was not microchipped but ms lawson said he had a docked tail and cauliflower ear , making him more distinctive
veterinary staff said they were forced to take action after the labrador was found ' thin and experiencing breathing difficulties
' a spokeswoman for the practice said staff take their responsibilities to animals very seriously and said it would not have been ethical for them to have admitted such an unwell animal , thought to have been a stray , in such a ' desperate ' condition
' the woman said the animal was examined by two veterinary surgeons who found he was agitated and distressed
they also found 46 per cent of uk dog owners do not update their animal 's microchip with address details when they move
' it is not acceptable , either legally or ethically , for us to admit a stray animal in such a desperate clinical condition to the hospital , in the hope that an owner comes forward
