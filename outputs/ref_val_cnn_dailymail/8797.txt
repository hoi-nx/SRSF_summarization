a huge step towards recreating the woolly mammoth has been taken by scientists who inserted more than a dozen of its genes into the live dna of an elephant
researchers studied the structure of dna from mammoths preserved in the arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal âs genes
these were then integrated by experts at harvard university in massachusetts into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal dna
there are at least three teams trying to rebuild the whole mammoth genome - which could one day become a template to recreate actual mammoths , reported the sunday times
