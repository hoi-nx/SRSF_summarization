moscow ever since putin came to power , there have been killings of politicians , of human rights activists , of journalists
boris nemtsov , one of russians 's most prominent opposition figures , is only the latest victim
of course , the kremlin will issue condemnation and condolences , as it has done over the assassination of boris nemtsov
boris nemtsov and his girlfriend anna duritskaya , a ukrainian model , had eaten dinner at plush restaurant on red square
the kremlin looks spectacular at night
it was on this short journey , in the heart of moscow , that the gunman struck , leaving boris nemtsov dead within sight of the red kremlin walls -- walls which , by the way , bristle with security cameras
it 's this : if you oppose the kremlin , if you criticize its power , if you stand for greater democracy and reform , as boris nemtsov did , this could happen to you too
and while the hope among opposition activists is that boris nemtsov 's killing may at least invigorate their ranks , one very real possibility is that it will do the exact opposite : further silence an already very quiet minority opposed to the rule of putin .
