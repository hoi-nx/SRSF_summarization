a top clinton aide is at the center of a lawsuit filed by a government watchdog group , which claims the state department hid emails it was required to hand over as part of a freedom of information act lawsuit
on wednesday daily mail online reported that abedin , a former clinton deputy chief of staff and a member of her inner circle , had a private address on the now - infamous email server clinton kept at her chappaqua , new york city home and used exclusively while she was in office
one day later judicial watch , a center - right group known for blanketing washington with freedom of information act requests , has demanded that a federal court reopen a case it agreed to drop last year because abedin 's emails were never properly searched
farrell , the group 's research and investigations director , told daily mail online on thursday that nine more closed cases could be reopened in light of clinton 's email-gate scandal
stay tuned , ' he added at the time the abedin lawsuit was wending its way through federal court , the state department said in writing that it had exhaustively searched its archives and provided everything judicial watch asked for
state ' does not oppose reopening the case in this particular circumstance , ' the legal filing says
according to federal court rules , a lawsuit can be reopened due to ' fraud , ... misrepresentation , or misconduct by an opposing party
' tom fitton , the group 's president , said there was misconduct at the state department and demanded ' immediate court action ' ' at no point did the state department inform judicial watch that the secretary âs emails and the emails of ms. abedin and other high level officials could not be searched , ' the court petition reads
' ' had judicial watch known that the state department âs search excluded secretary clinton âs emails and the emails of ms. abedin and other high level officials , judicial watch would not have stipulated to the dismissal of this case
' tom fitton , the group 's president , said thursday in a statement that ' clinton âs misconduct and the resulting fraud by the state department disrupted and ended our federal freedom of information act lawsuit about abedin , one of clinton âs closest political associates
the federal records act puts responsibility for archiving public records on the heads of government agencies â a group that included clinton while she ran the obama administration 's state department for four years
