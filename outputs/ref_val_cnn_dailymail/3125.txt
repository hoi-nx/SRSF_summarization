step out onto the surface of the planet 30 ari b in daylight and you would see not one , not two , not three suns in the sky - but a remarkable four stars , all of which are in its system
the amazing discovery , the second of its kind , suggests that planets in four - star systems are much more common in the universe than thought
and studying the system could reveal the effect multiple stars can have on a planet - and whether they make them more likely to turn into ' hot jupiters '
nasa astronomers in california have found a planet in a multi-star system
30 ari b ( illustration shown ) has four stars in its system - two sets of binary stars
the primary star is known as 30 ari b ( upper case ) , and the planet is 30 ari b ( lower case )
this pair , in turn , is locked in a long - distance orbit with another pair of stars about 1,670 astronomical units away - one astronomical unit is the distance between earth and the sun. astronomers think it 's highly unlikely that this planet , or any moons that might circle it , could sustain life
this pair of stars is itself locked in a long - distance orbit with another pair of stars , known as 30 ari a. the fourth star , found using instruments fitted to the palomar observatory in san diego , marks only the second time a planet has been identified in a quadruple star system
this latest discovery is important , though , because it suggests that one in 25 sun - like stars are in a quadruple system , whereas previously they were thought to be much rarer
' about four per cent of solar - type stars are in quadruple systems , which is up from previous estimates because observational techniques are steadily improving , ' said co-author dr andrei tokovinin of the cerro tololo inter-american observatory in chile
this quadruple star system consists of two pairs of stars : 30 ari b and 30 ari a. the gas giant planet ( red ) , 30 ari b ( lower case ) , orbits one of the stars in 30 ari b about once a year
one of the stars in sky of 30 ari b , if viewed with a large enough telescope , would be revealed to be a binary system , or two stars orbiting each other
there can be single stars , binary stars , triple stars , even quintuple star systems , ' said dr roberts of jpl , lead author of the new findings appearing in the journal astronomical journal
in addition to this discovery , made by studying hundreds of stars each night for stellar companions , the astronomers also identified a triple - star system called hd 2638
