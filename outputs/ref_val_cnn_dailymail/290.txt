earth may have been witness to a stunning aurora displays , but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on mars
because mars has a very thin atmosphere , the sun 's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper creating incredibly bright and vast light shows
nasa scientists were recently stunned to discover aurora that reaches deep into the mars atmosphere
maven observations show that aurora on mars is similar to earth âs " northern lights " but penetrates deep into the atmosphere earth has a magnetic shield , known as a magnetosphere , that protects its atmosphere from radiation from the sun. aurora take place on earth because some of the sun 's energetic particles have managed to break through this shield
' for five days just before dec. 25 , maven saw a bright ultraviolet auroral glow spanning mars ' northern hemisphere
' what 's especially surprising about the aurora we saw is how deep in the atmosphere it occurs - much deeper than at earth or elsewhere on mars , ' said arnaud stiepen , iuvs team member at the university of colorado
they also made the unexpected discovery of dust about 93 miles ( 150 km ) to 190 miles ( 300 km ) above the red planet 's surface
a map of maven 's auroral detections in december 2014 overlaid on mars â surface
the map shows that the aurora was widespread in the northern hemisphere , not tied to any geographic location
the aurora was detected in all observations during a 5 - day period ' if the dust originates from the atmosphere , this suggests we are missing some fundamental process in the mars atmosphere , ' said laila andersson of the university of colorado 's laboratory for atmospherics and space physics ( cu lasp ) , boulder , colorado
however , no known process on mars can explain the appearance of dust in the observed locations from any of these sources
earth may have been witness to a stunning displays of the aurora ( pictured ) , but they are nothing compared to what can be seen on mars because has a thin atmosphere , the sun 's energetic particles hit it directly and penetrate deeper
