los angeles former rap mogul knight collapsed in court friday shortly after a judge set his bail at $ 25 million in a murder case , an amount knight 's attorney said was excessively high
the attorney earlier indicated such a bail was probably higher than his client could post
knight bent over in his chair at the defense table , with his attorney beside him , and two deputies rushed to him as he was facedown
moments earlier , the judge ruled that knight " has a great potential to flee and apparently has so in the past
attorney fletcher told cnn affiliate kabc that knight hit his head on a chair and knocked himself out
fletcher later saw knight in the holding cell , and " he was dripping sweat ... like somebody threw a bucket of water on him , " fletcher told the station
knight , who suffers from diabetes and blood clots , was taken to the hospital , the attorney said
knight 's condition was not immediately available
when asked about the $ 25 million bail , fletcher said , " it 's just laughable
knight is charged with one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and two counts of hit - and - run , with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail , prosecutors said
that prison time -- along with shakur 's death , feuds between knight and a number of rappers , and desertions by dr. dre , snoop and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006
at the time of his most recent arrest , knight was free on bail in a robbery case
