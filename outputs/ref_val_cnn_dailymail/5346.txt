early humans are widely regarded as having been voracious hunters whose appetite for meat contributed to the extinction of many of the large mammals that once roamed the planet
the findings could help to explain how early humans made the significant shift in their diet to consume meat and became one of the top predators on the planet
she estimates that early humans like homo erectus could have obtained enough meat to provide an entire days worth of energy from the scraps left behind by prehistoric predators
she told mail online : ' early humans would have scavenged carcasses of animals that ranged in size from medium sized animals like wildebeest all the way up to huge extinct elephants , and animals that lived in a range of different habitats from more open grasslands to closed woodlands
' lions , like the two eating a zebra kill above , leave large amounts of their kills untouched , meaning there would have been plenty of meat for early humans to scavenge from carcasses left by prehistoric feline predators she added that early humans probably survived though a combination of both hunting and scavenging
' dr pobiner found that modern predators leave large amounts of meat on their kills ( as shown above ) and believes that prehistoric carnivores could have left even more to be picked clean by early humans speaking in a video on the smithsonian website , she added : ' i 've found in some of the fossils i studied that early humans got to these carcasses first and were able to eat the best parts of the animals
' sometimes carnivores got their first and early humans probably only got scraps
' in research published in the journal of human evolution , dr pobiner examined the carcasses of carnivore kills on the modern africa savanna in kenya 's ol pejeta conservancy
dr pobiner ( above ) claims to have found evidence that humans butchered carcasses after large predators had eaten meat from the bones first speaking to popular archaeology she said : ' the site is a great analogue for the kinds of africa savanna environments where hominins are thought to have lived
' dr pobiner found that in modern africa even a ' defleshed ' wildebeest hindlimb killed by a lion could still yield around one kilogram of meat while a zebra hind limb could have two kilograms of flesh still left on it
' dr pobiner says there is also evidence within the fossil record that suggests predators had eaten carcasses before early humans arrived to butcher the animals
hyenas are the main scavengers of lion kills on the african savannah but there are few examples of them in the fossil record in areas where early humans have been discovered and they could have scavenged instead 55 million years ago - first primitive primates evolve 15 million years ago - hominidae ( great apes ) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon 8 million years ago - first gorillas evolve
they had brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's 2.7 million years ago - paranthropus , lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 2.8 million years ago - the first species in the homo family appeared 2.3 million years ago - homo habalis first thought to have appeared in africa 1.9 million years ago - homo erectus begins to appear in fossil record 1.6 million years ago - hand axes become the first major technological innovation 800,000 years ago - early humans control fire and create hearths
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across europe and asia 200,000 years ago - homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in africa 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach europe she said that at around the time homo erectus were alive there were also few species of bone - crunching carnivores like hyenas in africa
' dr pobiner said her findings had helped to dispell the idea that early humans would have struggled to find enough meat to survive by scavenging the meat left by larger predators
writing in the journal of human evolution , dr pobiner said : ' this study supports the hypothesis that passive scavenging from abandoned larger felid kills could have a been a high - yield , though potentially dangerous , strategy for early hominins even without considering within bone nutrients
