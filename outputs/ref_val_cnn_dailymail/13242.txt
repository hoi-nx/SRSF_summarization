jerusalem netanyahu appears poised to keep his job as israeli 's prime minister , declaring victory wednesday following a bitter campaign punctuated by his last - minute appeals to right - wing voters
for weeks , netanyahu 's likud party trailed in opinion polls to the zionist union alliance that characterized him as a divisive leader not up to the task of making the lives of ordinary israeli better
instead , the likud party grabbed at least 29 of the 120 seats in the knesset , israeli 's parliament , according to unofficial numbers from the israeli election committee , based on 99 % of the vote
its leaders will have the first chance at forming a coalition government
" against all odds , against all odds , we achieved this huge victory for likud , " netanyahu told jubilant supporters not long after the polls closed tuesday
" rather than courting voters in the middle , netanyahu pivoted more to the right with appeals concerning israeli 's security
arab make up about 20 % of israeli 's population
if the likud leader does so -- as expected -- it will leave israeli not much different than it was before the election , with a conservative netanyahu still the dominant force facing a dug - in opposition
5 questions about netanyahu 's apparent victory herzog , who led the zionist union , called netanyahu to concede defeat
' " official results will not be released until next week , with the process of building coalitions expected to take much longer
no party has ever won a majority of seats in the knesset , meaning coalition governments are as old as the modern state of israeli
miller , an ex-adviser to the united states government on arab - israeli negotiations now with the wilson center , predicts former israeli communications minister moshe kahlon will be the " kingmaker " in any coalition government deal based on the support his kulanu party got tuesday
how does israeli 's parliament work ? there 's no guarantee netanyahu will form such a coalition and stay as prime minister
many woke up wednesday questioning all those polls suggesting that netanyahu 's latest six - year term could be coming to an end
israeli media outlets released surveys suggesting that either the zionist union would win the vote or , at least , finish in a dead heat with likud
exit polls from israeli 's three major broadcasters showed the two parties neck and neck , not the apparent five - seat advantage that likud appears to have secured
" as netanyahu 's win reverberates , one question remains : did he gain extra seats because of an 11th - hour surge , or were the major polls skewed from the beginning ? why were the election polls so wrong ? netanyahu maintained hard - line positions on settlements and negotiations with palestinian , but his opposition appeared more open to talks and more focused on economic , social and other issues within israeli
erakat , the palestinian chief negotiator with israeli , said , " the results of the israeli elections show the success of a campaign platform based on settlements , racism , apartheid and the denial of fundamental human rights of the palestinian people
" miller , the wilson center scholar , says he does n't think that netanyahu will necessarily hold his hard campaign line on the palestinian forming their own state if and when he starts his next term
