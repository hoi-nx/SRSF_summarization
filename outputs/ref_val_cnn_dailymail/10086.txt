a woman who spent the money she had saved for fertility treatment on a diet instead , says she has ' never been happier '
natalie , 31 , who lives in halifax , west yorkshire , blew Â£ 4,000 on a weight loss regime that originally put aside for fertility treatment after failing to become pregnant
in five months she transformed herself from a size 22 to a size 12/14 by losing six and a half stone and now hopes to become pregnant naturally
she said : ' the gp was horrible
he said he would not send me for any tests - he just took my hand and said " well you are very overweight , are nât you ? " ' i felt patronised
' she continued : ' i was told to go away and come back when i had lost three stone
' natalie felt she had reached a low point in life but now admits that day was the trigger for her amazing transformation
they also have skin tightening treatments to stop their skin sagging from the rapid weight loss natalie was a size 22 and weighed 18 and a half stone , despite being a top martial artist , practising taekwondo regularly for 14 years , and even winning the english championship in her category
' natalie initially tried a weekly slimming group and lost a stone - but it took her eight long months
' so natalie made the decision to spend the Â£ 4,000 the couple had saved in case they needed fertility treatment on a new diet regime - and five months later she is a svelte size 12 - 14 after losing a total of six and a half stone
natalie lost 11lb in the first week of her new weight loss regime
' within a fortnight i had last a stone
i never felt hungry and managed to keep going through my birthday and christmas ' natalie signed up to the alevere leeds clinic to take part in their diet scheme
in her first week on the diet she lost an incredible eleven pounds and continued to lose more every week
natalie , who has a degree in chemistry , said , ' i did my research and everything the clinic told me about this diet made sense
' the diet , called alevere weight reduction and body contouring therapy , costs around Â£ 200 a week and is designed to help very overweight clients lose weight quickly and safely
natalie said , ' within a fortnight i had lost a stone
' natalie believes that she was almost invisible when she was at her heaviest before her dramatic weight loss , natalie says she spent many years feelings invisible
' natalie was badly bullied at school for being overweight and during one incident a group of boys kicked her down a flight of stairs she continued : ' i started putting weight on when i was aged six and from then on i was the big girl
' but life got better for natalie at the next school , and she went on to study at the university of manchester
weekly sessions of ultrasound and skin tightening treatments are then used to stop the common problem of loose skin after major weight loss the diet is in three stages and at each stage , a wider range of natural foods is reintroduced
by the end of this the client is back on a healthy , normal and balanced diet
' that all changed when natalie , who has always been musical and played the violin from the age of six , was introduced to music teacher and musician john eight years ago
we were mates for about eight months while he taught me to play the bass guitar and we even play together in a band now
' but now natalie is gradually learning to live with her dramatically altered body
' ' now we are renovating a lovely home and hoping that i can become pregnant without having to go back to that doctor again - but if i do i ca nât wait to see his face when i walk in
