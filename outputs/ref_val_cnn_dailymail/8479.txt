â toxic â pollen from gm corn can travel miles to contaminate the countryside , researchers claim
watchdogs have launched an investigation into gm corn following a study showing â toxic â pollen from the plants can travel miles to contaminate the countryside critics say that if this is correct the rules must be redrawn to protect the countryside and stop the pollen contaminating conventional and organic farms and food over vast areas
the european food safety authority is now reviewing the approval process for the corn â known as bt maize â following the german study
its investigation is particularly important because the european commission is in the final throes of approving a type of gm maize that was assessed under a safety regime that did not take account of the new information
