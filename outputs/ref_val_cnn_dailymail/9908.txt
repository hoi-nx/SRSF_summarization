we âve all got photographs that bring back happy memories and for those that are cringeworthy or upsetting , there âs always the detag or delete button , or the bin
however , one us artist is asking members of the public to send him images they just ca nât live with before they delete them or instead of binning them â with no explanation attached
chicago - based jason lazarus , 39 , began the project â an online archive called t.h.t.k , or too hard to keep - in 2010 and now has over 150 photographs that include a huge range of scenes
for instance , the collection contains photographs of a blood - soaked leg , a female with a black eye and a corpse
mr jason lazarus told mailonline that the idea for the project began when he thought about why he kept photographs that held bad memories
i started asking friends and friends of friends if they had photographs too hard to keep , and the response was powerful - the project started to grow itself
' some of the images are very moving and mr jason lazarus , who has two of his own in the collection , has to suppress his emotions on occasions
so far , nothing has been sent in that 's too disturbing to display , but mr jason lazarus , an adjunct assistant professor at chicago 's school of the art institute , emphasizes that ' part of the project is to occasionally view harrowing images '
mr jason lazarus said : â i âm hoping to reach anyone who feels the project gives them a sense of grace or greater meaning by participating
the photographs have been put on public display in several cities around the world , including the museum of contemporary art in chicago , future gallery in berlin , the contemporary jewish museum in san francisco and gallery tpw in toronto
some respondents had photographs that were so upsetting for them that they did n't want them displayed ever again - so these appear face - down in the archive a photograph of a newly arrived submission for the project some of the t.h.t.k images have been displayed in public including at the museum of contemporary art in chicago
