everywhere you go on the isle of man , you 'll see isle of man flags - three conjoined white legs on a red background
for the isle of man , the triskelion is a powerful symbol of independent spirit and endurance , the motto being : ' whichever way you throw , it will stand
independent spirit : the harbour at ramsey , the isle of man 's second biggest town legend : a carving of the sea god manannan can a place with a reputation for being safe and sleepy really also be home to spies , killers and evil spirits that feature in my books ? i like to think so , and here are a few reasons why
the rich variety of locations is something i 've grown to appreciate in my books , and something the isle of man film industry has thrived on during the past decade
my first isle of man - set thriller , safe house , grew out of a rumour i heard almost as soon as i moved here - namely , that it 's used as a place to relocate people enrolled in uk witness protection schemes
the isle of man also its own very distinct identity
where else could the population swell for a fortnight every june in celebration of a controversial motorbike festival that pits man against machine over a course run on almost 38 miles of public roads ? the isle of man is isolated , with some out of the way spots , lush glens and lonely coves racing glory : every summer the island hosts the world - famous tourist trophy races , with motorbikes reaching 200mph the tourist trophy ( tourist trophy ) races have been in existence since 1907 , with recent competitors recording top speeds of 200mph
another local oddity is hop - tunaa - the isle of man 's version of halloween
taking place every october 31 , it shares many similarities with halloween , but is still marked by some unique isle of man twists
it 's a short step from rumours and hearsay to myths and legends , and the isle of man has some of the most interesting i 've ever heard : from the sea god , manannan , who cloaks the isle in a veil of mist to protect it from outside threats , to the moddey dhoo , a big black hound that haunts peel castle
