they 're in your face
face love fitness , a pop - up boutique in downtown manhattan , offers face workouts and massages to keep the skin and muscles of the face and neck healthy , looking young and feeling good
" the popular notion that one should avoid touching one 's face for fear of creating wrinkles is completely incorrect
skin responds beautifully to mindful touch , " says rachel lang , an esthetician ( skin care therapist ) , who co-founded the face love skin gym with massage therapist heidi frederick and personal trainer gyllenhaal
but proponents of massage say healthy , youthful skin is well - worked skin
" when you stimulate pressure receptors under the skin , as you do in a moderate pressure massage , you increase the temperature of the skin , you slow down the physiology , you reduce the release of stress hormones and enhance immune function " according to tiffany field , ph.d. , director of the touch research institute at the university of miami school of medicine
" just as massage and exercise contributes to health in general , it would also be expected to contribute to skin health
" this is the philosophy at the skin gym , where they say the massage and movement is detoxifying and increases oxygen and blood circulation to the skin , which can result in fewer wrinkles , a firmer jaw line , improved skin tone , and even reduced headaches and eyestrain , according to lang
exercising the facial muscles tones and lifts the skin because your facial muscles are attached to your skin and the bone like a web that forms the shape of your face
through the massages and resistance training , face love fitness claims muscles in the face become stronger and taut , rejuvenating the appearance of the face
