military security experts have successfully managed to stop a truck in its tracks by destroying its engine with a laser
the 30 - kilowatt fibre laser called athena burnt through the manifold in seconds , despite being fired by a team from lockheed martin positioned more than a mile away
the security firm said the test signifies the next step to fitting lightweight laser weapons on military aircraft , helicopters , ships and trucks
during the test , the 30 - kilowattfibre laser burnt through the truck âs engine ( pictured ) and disabled it from more a mile away the demonstration was the first field testing of lockheed martin âs integrated 30 - kilowatt , single - mode fibre laser weapon system prototype
athena is based on the firm âs area defense anti-munitions ( adam ) laser weapon system
â this test represents the next step to providing lightweight and rugged laser weapon systems for military aircraft , helicopters , ships and trucks
â by using a technique known as spectral beam combining , the system blends multiple laser modules to create a single , powerful , high - quality beam

â the high - energy laser serves as the heart of a laser weapon system , â said dr. johnson
â this 30 - kilowatt milestone shows our commitment to producing the high beam quality and high power needed to address a variety of military â speed - of - light â defensive operations
