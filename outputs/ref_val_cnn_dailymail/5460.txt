pietersen remains as far away as ever from a return to england colours after it emerged on friday that surrey are no nearer an agreement to re-sign the maverick star
sportsmail can reveal that pietersen has told surrey , who released him at the end of last summer , that he will not play all county cricket for them next season â even though he was urged to do so when offered a lifeline by new ecb chairman graves
pietersen played for surrey in last year 's natwest twenty20 blast yet it seems unlikely the county will be surrey , who have not been able to reach agreement with pietersen over a deal to play in red - ball cricket as well as the white - ball game
the fact pietersen struggled to attract a contract in this year âs indian premier league , before sunrisers hyderabad signed him in a cut - price deal , seemed to suggest the path may be clear for a return to domestic cricket
