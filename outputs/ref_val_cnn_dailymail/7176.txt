take a look at the amount of fuel for star formation in the universe , compared to the number of stars , and you 'll notice something strange - there should be 10 times as many stars as there are
researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology and michigan state university have proposed a new theory for the lack of stars
based on the amount of stellar fuel there should be 10 times as many
but the reason is because temperatures stop them forming
the hubble image is shown here for a star to form , it relies on a cloud of gas to cool sufficiently so that it can gather into the large mass required for stellar formation
but just a handful of stars in are born every year in some galaxies , despite an abundance of this gas , so there must be something hindering the gas from cooling and forming stars
the amazing discovery - led by dr camargo of the federal university of rio grande do sul in porto alegre , brazil - marks the first time that star - forming clusters that are part of the milky way have been found this far from our galaxy
â ' the amount of fuel for star formation outpaces the amount of stars 10 times , so these clusters should be really star - rich , ' said dr mcdonald , a hubble fellow in massachusetts institute of technology 's ( massachusetts institute of technology ) kavli institute for astrophysics and space research
' you really need some mechanism to prevent gas from cooling , otherwise the universe would have 10 times as many stars
' the theory proposed by the researchers from massachusetts institute of technology and michigan state university suggests a number of reasons for why this is so
' for these hotter clusters , they 're stuck in this hot state , and will never cool and form stars , ' dr mcdonald says
' he added to mailonline that maybe , over tens of billions of years , they would cool down enough for stars to form
dr mcdonald told mailonline that one of the only clusters observed to be ' cool ' enough to allow rapid stellar formation was the phoenix cluster , shown here
meanwhile , for so - called ' cool core ' galaxy clusters , the gas near the center may be cool enough to form some stars
however , a portion of this cooled gas may rain down into a central black hole , which then spews out hot material that serves to reheat the surroundings , preventing many stars from forming - an effect the team terms ' precipitation - driven feedback
' the researchers hope to look deeper into the theory to see whether the mechanisms regulating star formation in clusters also apply to individual galaxies
' if we can use all this information to understand why or why not stars form around us , then we 've made a big step forward , ' dr mcdonald said
