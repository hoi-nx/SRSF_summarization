forced into a head brace , bound and held up by police officers , or sitting down with their eyes rolled back in their heads - these are the harrowing faces of mental illness in the victorian era
diagnosed with conditions such as â imbecility , â â simple mania , â and â acute melancholia â , all of them were patients at the west riding pauper lunatic asylum , west yorkshire , in 1869
its first superintendent sir william ellis , and later superintendent sir james crichton-browne , actually paved the way for ethical treatment of the mentally ill. crichton browne is renowned for bringing science to the asylum when he started a laboratory for anatomy , neuropathology and histology
these pictures , taken in 1869 at the west riding pauper launatic asylum near wakefield , west yorkshire , show some of the patients interred there
while some of the treatment looks barbaric to modern eyes , in fact the centre pioneered the way for ethical treatment of the mentally ill the photographs are part of a 5,000 - strong collection of detailed documents on patients taken by sir james crichton-browne , the chief neurologist at west riding pauper lunatic asylum , who helped lead the way in medical treatment of mental disorders the west riding asylum , based near wakefield , was the sixth institution of its kind in the uk to take those with mental conditions out of the way of regular society to a place of relative protection
davis , author of voices from the asylum , a book on the west riding pauper lunatic asylum , said : ' this new , relatively compassionate approach was driven by tuke the founder of the york retreat which opened in 1796 after hannah mills , a quaker , died at the york asylum in 1790
' alongside each of the pictures are detailed notes including height , weight , religion , and eventual fate of the patient
the patient on the left is recorded as suffering ' general paralysis ' , while the woman on the right has ' acute melancholia ' the west riding pauper lunatic asylum was actually comprised of four different hospitals , this sketch shows the building at wakefield where these pictures were taken mr davis added that life inside the asylum was still austere , with residents who were able to work given jobs in the laundry , gardens or working on farms that were sometimes attached to the hospitals
sir james crichton-browne also used the security of the asylum to begin his groundbreaking research into mental illness , investigating whether there was a biological cause behind the conditions he help to diagnose
he helped to take some of these portraits of patients , meticulously labelled with notes on the patient âs appearance and ailments , and three years later collaborated with charles darwin on his book â the expression of the emotions in man and animals
â james crichton-browne pioneered a medical approach to the treatment of mental disorders at west riding pauper lunatic asylum , banning the use of restraints unless necessary , keeping sedation to a minimum , and allowing patients to indulge in leisure activities and take up jobs as part of their healing process
he also published in - depth journals from his time at west riding pauper lunatic asylum containing observations from himself and his team on mental illness , treatments with various drugs known to affect brain function such as cannabis , nicotine , alcohol , and nitrous oxide
west riding pauper lunatic asylum was one of the first institutions to treat the mentally ill. previously those with disorders would have been locked in cells , put on display in bedlams , or chained up in workhouses ( left , a woman suffering from ' senile dementia ' , right a man with ' mania of suspicion ' ) while west riding pauper lunatic asylum started out as a poor - house for the mentally ill , it eventually became so successful and well - known that it started taking paying residents ( left , a woman with ' simple mania ' , and right another patient with ' mono - mania of pride ' ) the records kept at west riding pauper lunatic asylum were so detailed and extensive that they are now recognised as being of huge historic and medical importance , and are protected by unesco
james crichton-browne ( pictured ) took over at west riding pauper lunatic asylum in 1866 when he was just 26 years old , and ran it for the best part of a decade
but while the project initially set out to improve the treatment of those with disorders , overcrowding and a lack of funding eventually led to horrible conditions developing , with several patients killed during disease breakouts inside the facility
sir james crichton-browne 's research helped pave the way of treatment for the mentally ill , including the theory that some illnesses occurred naturally , while others were due to outside factors ( left , a man with ' organic dementia , and right a woman with ' constructive dementia ' ) two men interred at west riding asylum are pictured
