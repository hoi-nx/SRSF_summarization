there was something unwholesome about the way fabregas â romance with barcelona ended
the post read : â despite glowing starts to each campaign , fabregas âs contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close
â from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season
he only scored one , six and one goals in the last 24 games of each season
fabregas ( left ) has a history of going quiet during the second half of the season in terms of goals â for some reason , he was never as good in the second half of a season as in the first
maybe the close relationship with fabregas , the prodigal son who returned and then left for again , meant they felt compelled to explain the step of letting him join chelsea for Â£ 30million
the talented playmaker had a blistering start to the season and has racked up 15 assists despite his slump but whatever the motive , there was a deep and intriguing point in the message
barcelona had spotted a real trend and the rational among chelsea âs fans are probably starting to see it
his previous longest run without a goal or assist this season was two
looking at league figures alone , he managed 15 goals or assists in the first half of the season and has so far scored or created only two in the second half
it is a trend that goes back all the way to the 2009 - 10 season , fabregas âs penultimate campaign at arsenal , when his respective figures were 19 and nine
fabregas clashes with blaise matuidi during a night of frustration in the champions league in london last season , it was even more pronounced â 16 going out and five coming back in
the spanish international is setting a trend and began to show signs of flagging during his time at arsenal
