charlottesville police said monday that investigators found no " substantive basis " to support a uva female student 's story that she was raped at the phi kappa psi house , an account that rolling stone published last november
" jackie " told the magazine that in late september 2012 , she was assaulted at the house , the article said
police chief longo noted that just because police found no evidence to support her account , " that does n't mean that something terrible did n't happen to jackie " on the day in question
longo said he welcomed any information that might still be out there about the case
longo said jackie did not give police a statement during their investigation
hostin pointed out that only about 2 % of rapes that are reported are false , and only about 40 % of rapes that occur are even reported : " so the suggestion that she just sort of made this entire thing up flies in the face of the statistics
" nine out of 11 people at the fraternity house at the time the sexual assault allegedly occurred talked to police , longo said
the rolling stone reporter , sabrina rubin erdely , talked to police , authorities said , but there were some questions she declined to answer for journalistic reasons
after the story 's publication , uva suspended the fraternity 's activities , and outrage spread throughout campus as many struggled to comprehend the horrific experience that jackie said she endured
the article also suggested the school failed to respond to the alleged assault
coll , dean of the columbia university , has been leading the independent review , cnn senior media correspondent stelter reported sunday
columbia university 's review will be published in early april in the magazine
" i ca n't really say i 'm surprised since so much of the evidence was already called into question , " a former friend of jackie 's said in response to what police found
" i think it 's great that they 're staying open to considering any new evidence that comes up
