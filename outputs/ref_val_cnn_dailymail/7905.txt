at least three top hillary clinton aides used email addresses hosted on the former secretary of state 's private server while she was in office , according to reports from two different news outlets
a conservative magazine reported wednesday that clinton 's state chief and deputy chief of staff both had the private addresses
' two of hillary clinton 's top aides used personal email while they were employed at the state , ' weekly standard senior writer hayes said in a fox news interview , naming ' abedin and cheryl mills , hillary clinton 's chief of staff
separately from claims by weekly standard , the gossip website gawker reported this month that abedin and phillippe reines , clinton 's top communications strategist , had the private addresses
daily mail online was able to confirm abedin 's email address through nexis , a commercial service that compiles public records
' huma@clintonemail.com ' was one of several of abedin 's email addresses nexis collected in conjunction with other public records
cheryl mills ( left ) was clinton 's chief of staff at the state and reportedly used an off - the - books email address to trade messages with the then - secretary of state , potentially putting their work emails beyond the reach of government investigators searches for similar email addresses belonging to phillippe reines and cheryl mills were unsuccessful , as were searches for email addresses belonging to current and former state spokeswoman victoria nuland , jen psaki and marie harf , along with current clinton spokesman merrill
merrill told gawker this month that phillippe reines ' has never had ' an email address on the private clinton server , ' not for communicating with anyone about anything
' but merrill would n't say whether phillippe reines used a separate private account to conduct government business with clinton
clinton acknowledged tuesday that she deleted more than 30,000 ' personal ' emails but insisted she first gave everything work - related to the state for inspection her first public words about ' email-gate ' attracted a crush of reporters at the united nations clinton 's state was criticized in the attack 's aftermath for interfering with cia talking points which originally made it clear a specific islamic militant group , ansar-al-shariah , was responsible for the bloodshed , which claimed the lives of two security personnel and ambassador chris stevens
now congressional republicans want to know if all of clinton 's work - related emails , hosted not on a secure government computer but on a server she personally kept at her chappaqua , new york home , have been archived as federal law requires
longtime press aide philippe reines ( left ) insists that he did not have a private clinton - linked email address , but gawker reported otherwise gowdy seemed to agree with hayes , saying tuesday on cnn that emails sent to a '
' earlier in the morning on msnbc , gowdy demanded that clinton allow an outside arbiter to examine the email server to determine what deleted information might be salvaged and who was using it
