the palestinian issue dominates international news coverage of israel , with images of missiles , terror tunnels and failed peace negotiations frequently splashed across tv screens and newspapers
so you would think that security would be the central issue in tuesday 's israel elections , right ? the short answer is no. poll after poll in israel has confirmed that the public views the high cost of living as the top issue for voters in this election
indeed , even a majority of israel 's arab citizens within the pre- 1967 borders -- most of whom identify with the palestinian in the west bank and gaza -- view socioeconomic issues as the priority for tuesday 's parliamentary poll , rather than advancing the israel - palestinian peace process
what explains this apparent indifference ? first , despite what the polls suggest , peace and security actually remain the most important underlying issue in israel politics
however , in practice , that same majority believes that even if an israel government were to agree to more compromises than they view as acceptable , israel would still not obtain the minimum required in terms of peace and security to make the deal worthwhile
why ? experience has certainly taught middle israel to be deeply skeptical of the possibility of peace with the palestinian , irrespective of the complexion of the israel government
add in the fact that subsequent unilateral israel withdrawals from south lebanon and gaza resulted in tens of thousands of rockets being launched at israel civilians , and the 2008 decision by palestinian authority president abbas to reject israel prime minister ehud olmert 's peace proposal -- a plan similar to the clinton parameters that arafat rejected in 2000 -- and israel wariness is easy to understand
since then , leaks from the recent round of peace talks have only served to strengthen the israel public 's skepticism -- the likud leader benjamin netanyahu was reportedly prepared to accept a palestinian state based on the 1967 borders , only for abbas to refuse to engage positively with a wide - ranging american peace outline including this element , according to israel 's channel 2 , even when he was presented with it directly by president obama himself
