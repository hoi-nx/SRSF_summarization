childcare centres around australia are sending children home with poo - filled underwear in plastic bags to the shock of parents who have labelled the practice disgusting
nationwide guidelines prevent childcare centres from rinsing or washing clothing , so if a child has an accident , their pants the underwear must be bagged and labelled and left in a communal bucket for parents to take home at the end of the day
leah spender , 34 , said that she was presented with her son ethan 's underwear after being informed that the staff were not allowed to touch faecal matter
cristal jamieson , from brisbane , took to facebook to express her frustration over the practice , after she had repeatedly asked her daughter 's childcare centre to throw out the soiled underwear rather than send it home
the final straw came when she opened a three - day old bag with her daughter 's name on it
ms cristal jamieson posted on media personality em rusciano 's official facebook page , asking for advice on how to handle the situation
' outraged parents were quick to comment , with many adding that their childcare centre had a similar practice of sending home packaged poo
