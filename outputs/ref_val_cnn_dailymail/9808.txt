fa chairman dyke challenged more clubs to grow their own harry kane as he unveiled his new quota proposals designed to boost the numbers of elite england footballers
dyke wants to change the rules until nearly half of each 25 - man squad in the premier league is ' home grown ' under his stricter definition of what makes a ' home grown ' player
together with new home office rules on work permits for non-eu footballers , agreed with the fa and set to be introduced in may , he believes this can increase the ratio of england players in the premier league from 35 to over 40 per cent and produce an england team to win the world cup in 2022
dyke has challenged more clubs to grow their own harry kanes to help england win the world cup fa chairman dyke has proposed three rule changes to what makes a home - grown player while there is a slight increase in the number of england players in the premier league this year â up from 32 % last year to 35 % â that is largely down to burnley being promoted
of that 18 - man match - day squad , only four have gone on to play more than 20 top - flight games , while double that from the spanish squad have done so in la liga
of the 12 clubs who have played in each of the last five premier league seasons , the average number of home - grown players per squad has gone from 11.4 to 9.4
only 62 % of current home - grown players are qualified to play for england
dyke set this target 18 months ago when he established a commission to investigate the diminishing number of england players at the top level and a clock on the wall of the coaches ' room at st george 's park is counting down to the world cup final in 2022 , albeit the wrong date since fifa confirmed the qatar tournament will be moved to winter
dyke warned he is prepared to force his rule - changes through the courts if agreements can not be reached with the premier league and the football league
1 ) a home grown player is a player irrespective of nationality who is registered to play in england or wales for three years before his 18th birthday ( rather than his 21st birthday as currently stated )
2 ) reduce the number of non-home grown players in a 25 - man first - team squad from 17 to 13
dyke 's vision is to open pathways for those like harry kane to make the final step from talented development player to the first - team without unexceptional foreign players blocking the route
' how many more harry kanes are out there who just ca n't get a game ? ' said dyke , summoning the example of the 21 - year - old tottenham striker who has broken into the first - team this season , took his goal tally to 29 with a hat - trick on saturday and has been rewarded with his first senior england call - up
harry kane scored his first premier league hat - trick for tottenham at the weekend and has a bright england future england manager roy hodgson has called up harry kane to the england senior squad for the first time ' suddenly an england kid who was out on loan and touch - and - go to get a game in the first - team is the top - scorer in england football
' if bayern munich , real madrid , barcelona , juventus , atletico madrid , psg and monaco can do it , why ca n't our clubs ? ' dyke ( centre ) has a vision that he hopes will enable england to win the 2022 world cup only 23 england players appeared in the champions league group stage this season , and three - terry ( left ) , steven gerrard ( centre ) and frank lampard ( right ) - have retired from international duty only 23 england players appeared in the champions league group stage this season , compared with 51 brazilians , 55 germans and 78 spanish players
' that 's the grim picture at the top of the game , but it 's hard to argue we don ' t have the talent , ' said dyke , who applauded the work of the academies and the premier league 's elite player performance plan
the fa chairman reaffirmed the his commitment to improving coach education and grassroots facilities but has abandoned the idea of allowing b - teams to compete within the football league framework
we will ask : are you sure you have n't got a harry kane playing in your youth side ? ' it 's not an option i 'd like to go down but the fa could change the rules
