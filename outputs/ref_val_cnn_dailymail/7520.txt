several business owners in austin were horrified this week to find large stickers bearing the message ' exclusively for white people ' affixed to their storefronts
as thousands partied and pitched new technologies at the sxsw , staff at an austin bakery were wondering who would want to announce to their customers ' maximum of 5 colored customers / colored boh staff accepted
' shocking : these stickers appeared overnight between tuesday and wednesday on the storefronts of at least six austin , texas businesses the stickers also appeared during the night between tuesday and wednesday on a mexican restaurant , clothing store , bicycle shop and others
the glossy stickers also feature what looks like an official city of austin seal and the message ' sponsored by the city of austin contemporary partition and restoration program
' but austin mayor steve adler wants the world to know his city had absolutely nothing to do with the stickers
' this is an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city
while austin appears to agree the stickers are wholly inappropriate , no one is sure what their point is
video from keye-tv ' some jokes are not funny ' : business owners ca n't agree on what the stickers mean -- is it racist or a message about gentrification ? -- but all say they 're inappropriate ' appalling and offensive display of ignorance ' : the stickers said they were sponsored by austin 's ' contemporary partition and restoration program ' along with an official - looking city seal , which led the mayor to condemn the confusing prank some say the creator is attempting to make a statement
