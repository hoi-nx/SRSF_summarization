italian football 's new anti-racism campaign will use the friendly against england in turin on tuesday as the focus of its efforts to change attitudes in a country that has an uncomfortable history of race relations in the game
the italian campaign is being headed by fiona may , the england - born former olympic long - jumper who chose to represent italy after marrying an italian , and she admits she has a tough challenge
mario balotelli was subjected to racial insults while training with the italian national team in coverciano fiona may ( centre , pictured in turin ) has been tasked with improving race relations within italian football since then , former italy coach sacchi caused a storm in february by saying there were ' too many black players , even in the youth teams ' in italy , while racist abuse of players by extremist fans is relatively commonplace compared to the british - liverpool 's mario balotelli was even subjected to racial insults while training for italy at the italian fa 's ( italy ) training centre in coverciano before the world cup last year
may admits she had to think long and hard before taking on the ' daunting ' task of heading the italian fa 's anti-racism committee in september last year , but has taken heart from the response to the recent launch of a 20 - month campaign
it is holding 20 events in 20 months in 20 different cities across italy , and the second of these takes place in turin on monday ahead of the england game
the events around the italy vs england match will mainly target registered players aged between 10 and 18 , and will include educational programmes in regional schools , a talk show targeted at teenagers plus a social media campaign
may , who was raised in derby and is still a keen rams fan , admits all those efforts will seem a waste of time if england players are on the receiving end of racist abuse from italian fans on tuesday
' may , 45 , who has become a well - known actress after retiring from competition , also hopes italy will learn from british that part of the key to eradicating racist abuse is through legislation - italian anti-racism laws are nowhere near as tough as they are in the british
