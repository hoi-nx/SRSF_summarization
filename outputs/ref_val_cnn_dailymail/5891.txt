researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary â costing the nhs Â£ 290 million
doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover , their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair
more than four million a&e visits each year are unnecessary â costing the nhs Â£ 290million , a survey claims doctors have even reported patients showing up because their children had headlice , or because their false nails were hurting the analysis of data from 15 a&e units by consultancy firm ims health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a â self - treatable condition â
the problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a gp , particularly out of hours
but the unnecessary visits are adding to the pressures of busy departments and diverting staff from treating patients who are very seriously ill. it all came to a head in january when 13 hospitals declared major internal incidents in a two - day period as they were unable to cope with the numbers coming through the door
matthew speers , from the proprietary association of great britain â which represents medicine manufacturers and commissioned the research â said : â pharmacists are well placed to provide advice to people with minor conditions , ensuring they get support without diverting nhs resources from people who really need them
â figures show that 21.7 million patients attended a&e in 2013/14 - a rise of more than a third in a decade but dr mann , president of the college of emergency medicine , which represents a&e doctors said attempts to divert patients did not work
