cash invested only in fortune 1000 stocks from companies with female ceos had a return of 348 per cent over the past 12 years , researchers found
the discovery was made by finance technology company quantopian , which ran two imaginary $ 100,000 investment funds using stock data from 2002 - 2014
bringing home the bacon : a study found that fortune 1000 companies with female ceos produced returns of 348 per cent from 2002 to 2014 , as shown in green on the graph above
for comparison , the s&p500 index , in blue , had a return of 122 per cent in the same period top of the pile : mindy grossman , ceo of hsni ( left ) , debra cafaro of ventas ( center ) and marissa meyer of yahoo! ( right ) all brought in substantial returns for shareholders during their tenures at the end of the experiment , the women 's fund was calculated to be worth $ 440,158 , while the s&p fund was at $ 222,306
the women 's fund would hold stocks by all fortune 1000 companies with female ceos for as long as the woman was at the head of the company
hsni has been run by mindy grossman since 2006 , and ventas by debra cafaro for the whole 12 - year period - both women returned more than 500 per cent on initial investments
other high - performing female ceos were marissa meyer at yahoo! , linda lang at jack in the box and carol meyrowitz at tjx , a homeware and clothing retailer
some women dragged the pack down , however , including new york times ceo janet robinson , whose eight - year tenure saw the company shed 80 per cent of its worth
mindy grossman , one of the best - performing female ceos of recent times , told forbes that high - powered women are more at risk of burning out , too
the result , she said , is that any women who wants to lead a huge company must be extremely competent - and so good financial performance follows
she told fortune 1000 : ' there âs a lot of the theorizing around why the results are dramatically higher for the women , but most think it has to do with how hard women have to work to become ceo at such big companies in the first place '
