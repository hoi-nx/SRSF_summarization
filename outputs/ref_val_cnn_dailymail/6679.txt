america has long been known for its cultural diversity but the rise of the hispanic population is unlike any other minority group in the country 's history
' the economist reports that more lenient immigration laws in the 1960s took the hispanic population from just 7m in 1970 to 57m today , a number which is predicted to double by 2050
for nearly two centuries and up until the time ronald reagan was president , white european immigrants made up to 80 per cent of the u.s. population
the u.s. hispanic population jumped to 58.2 million in 2015 , an increase of 2 million during the past year , says the same report
the growth of the hispanic population is due to both convenient geography and rising birth rates , says the economist
increase in numbers : more lenient immigration laws in the 1960s took the hispanic population from just 7m in 1970 to 57m today , a number which is predicted to double by 2050 rapid growth : close geography of latin countries to the u.s. and growing birth rates among hispanics in america is causing rapid population growth compared to other minorities currently , 85percent of hispanics are legal residents and latino growth is not so much from immigration anymore as it is from births in the u.s.
u.s. companies have also been advised to shift their focus to hispanic consumers who will be making up a majority of the u.s. population and will account for much of the nation 's future spending habits
the future : it is predicted that by 2050 there will be double the amount of hispanics than there are today shift from immigration to native births : currently , five - sixths of hispanics are legal residents and hispanics growth is not so much from immigration anymore as it is from births in the u.s.
