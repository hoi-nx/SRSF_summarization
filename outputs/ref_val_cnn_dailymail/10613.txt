a judge is considering whether 50 pounds of potatoes and a produce box can be used as evidence in the trial of a man accused of killing six - year - old etan patz in manhattan in 1979
the suspect , pedro hernandez , told authorities that he choked etan in the basement of the convenience store where he worked after luring the boy down the stairs with a promise of a soda
he told investigators he put the boy 's body in a plastic garbage bag , then put the bag inside a banana box and walked it about a block and a half away and put it down in an alcove with other trash
part of pedro hernandez 's job at the store was to lug boxes of produce , soda and beer up and down the basement stairs into the shop in soho
bizarre request : the defense for pedro hernandez ( pictured in court in november 2012 ) have asked to use 50lbs of potatoes in court to show he would not have been able to life etan patz 's body as he claimed ' i put it on my shoulder
' victim : etan patz was just six when he vanished while walking to his school bus in manhattan in 1979 but attorneys for pedro hernandez , now 54 , say the confession was made up and pedro hernandez is mentally ill. attorney harvey fishbein suggests pedro hernandez was scrawny , weighing only about 115 pounds , and could not have carried a heavy box that far
he is asking to bring in the 50 pounds of potatoes and the produce box for jurors to demonstrate the weight of the body
on the missing - child poster , etan 's weight was listed as 50 pounds
but prosecutors say the measurement was a mistake made by frantic parents , and medical records from just a few months before etan vanished have the boy weighing about 37 pounds
earlier in the trial , prosecutors showed jurors a photo of a little boy crouching in a produce box , intending to show that etan 's body would have fit into such a box
he moved from soho , where he had been staying with his sister and brother - in - law shortly after etan disappeared , to new jersey , where he has been living ever since , most recently in maple shade
