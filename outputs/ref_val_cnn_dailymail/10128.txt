amnesty has concluded that hamas committed war crimes during the 2014 gaza conflict by firing rockets ' indiscriminately ' at civilian areas and using non-combatants as human shields
' in launching these attacks , [ palestinian jihadis ] displayed a flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law and for the consequences of their violations on civilians in both israel and the gaza , ' said philip luther , amnesty 's director for the middle east and north africa
other rockets aimed at the jewish state fell short and killed at least 13 palestinian civilians , 11 of them children , on the beach in gaza , in an attack that was wrongly blamed on israel
amnesty described them as ' indiscriminate ' , and said that they killed more palestinian than israel when they misfired palestinian witnesses had claimed that an israel f - 16 warplane had killed palestinian civilians on the beach
but the amnesty report has corroborated the israel army 's account of events , which said that the deaths occurred when militants misfired their own rockets
it confirmed that during the 50 - day war , palestinian terrorists launched unguided rockets and mortars from civilian areas toward other civilian areas , constituting a breach of international law
