chester striker oliver mcburnie has vowed to prove scotland 's under 19s do n't need real madrid superkid harper by firing ricky sbragia 's youngsters to a winning start in their elite round against hosts austria on thursday
ricky sbragia 's decision to omit the promising bernabeu talent for the tournament has caused uproar , mixed with bemusement , after the former sunderland boss ' comments about harper not being physically strong enough
harper 's replacement does not have zinedine zidane as a coach or the luxury of a five - year deal with real madrid
in fact , oliver mcburnie is currently on loan from bradford at conference mid-table outfit chester
on loan chesterfield striker is ready to step up for scotland under 19s against austria on thursday oliver mcburnie in action for scotland under 19s against holland under 19s during an international challenge match however , the 18 - year - old is in agreement with ricky sbragia that scotland need to be physical in their three games which starts on thursday in vienna against hosts austria , before facing italy on saturday and croatia next week
oliver mcburnie said : ' obviously , harper has n't made the squad , but it 's good to know it ' s not just about reputations
if we stick to the game - plan and play how we know we can play we 've got a chance
real madrid youngster harper has been left out of the latest scotland under 19 squad oliver mcburnie says that he has had to toughen up playing against conference opposition ' you have to grow up fast and it 's very different to bradford , although chester like to try and play a bit to be fair
in the conference it 's tough to play football on some of the pitches against some of the teams
' but the harper issue does bring back memories of a depressingly frank admission from stark , then scotland under - 21 boss , in june 2009
' it 's hard to say because you 're looking at two different cultures but the answer is - probably not
scotland under 19s manager ricky sbragia claimed harper is not big enough physically harper is currently midway through a five - year deal with real madrid and is tipped to have a big future ' but the spanish approach is working for them and it deserves to be copied , ' he added
former scotland manager brown has urged caution in the rush to condemn the under - fire sbragia
so i 'd like to hear more on the context of the words spoken by him ( about harper )
' but i would say this : people are saying this young lad is a real madrid player
he 's not ; he 's never played for real madrid
' real madrid will have hundreds of kids in their system
i 'm not for a minute saying harper is not a good player
former scotland boss brown ( second right ) revealed his admiration for under 19 coach ricky sbragia ' but i think people get hypnotised by the name real madrid
' here 's my example : when i was scotland under 21 manager , i got a phone call from the late alex wright , manager of dumbarton , saying he had a good player for me
