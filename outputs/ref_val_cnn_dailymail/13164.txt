russian police moved with surprising speed to arrest five suspects , all of them chechen , in the killing of opposition figure boris nemtsov
yet that speed has only raised more questions about who wanted boris nemtsov dead -- and why ? conspiracy theories are rife , but so far , none seem totally convincing
some members of russian 's opposition -- and boris nemtsov 's daughter -- are convinced russian 's government was behind boris nemtsov 's killing
but why ? and why now ? boris nemtsov , 55 , had been an opposition leader for years and had recently been overshadowed by younger members of the opposition such as alexey navalny
some of boris nemtsov 's supporters claim he had become a bigger threat to the kremlin , pointing to information he was allegedly uncovering on russian 's military role in ukraine that could undermine the kremlin 's claims that its forces fighting in ukraine have been just " volunteers
some russian politicians and media personalities close to the kremlin charge that putin 's foes in the west orchestrated the killing to damage the russian president 's image and ignite a civil war in russian
but then , russian media reported , he denied involvement
russian officials have alleged that dadayev , a former security officer and fervent muslim , decided to punish boris nemtsov for supporting the rights of the french charlie hebdo journalists to publish cartoons of the prophet mohammed
but boris nemtsov 's allies point out that he was not anti-muslim and rarely spoke of the cartoons -- he was by no means a central figure in the cartoon story
) that 's led some back to the theory that boris nemtsov was killed because of his allegedly explosive information on russian 's role in ukraine
photos of opposition leaders labeled " traitors " have been posted in russian cities , while at an anti-ukraine rally in moscow just days before boris nemtsov 's assassination , russian loyal to putin carried signs and placards with pictures of those " traitors , " including boris nemtsov
now , with boris nemtsov 's killing , russian officials and kremlin - friendly media have whipped up a sandstorm of theories , confounding the most intrepid attempts at establishing the truth
