tunis the bodies of four italy tourists slain in a terror attack on tunisian 's bardo museum three days ago arrived back in italy on saturday , an official with the tunis crisis center told cnn , but 14 victims ' remains still lie in the morgue
as tunisian gets back on its feet , the investigation into wednesday 's shooting at the tunis landmark continues
most of the 23 victims were foreigners , making the process of identification more complicated
nineteen of them were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis
french , spanish , italy , british , japanese , russian and colombian citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far
the bodies of the italy were met in rome by italy prime minister matteo renzi , who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony
tunisian prime minister habib essid identified two suspects in the attack , yassine and saber khachnaou , in an interview with french radio station rtl on thursday , though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces
an uncle of yassine , abeld malik labidi , told cnn on friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26 - year - old nephew
but he said yassine was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum
" it 's true that yassine carried out this terrorist attack , he was killed ; his head , his body , we do n't have it back , " he said
although his nephew said he 'd gone to the tunisian city of sfax to work , his family now suspected he had been in libya because of the phone numbers he called from
a cousin of yassine , who asked not to be named , told cnn that the family was shocked by what had happened
those he killed were innocent , why would you go and harm australians or japanese ... our islam does n't mention about killing people , islam has never been this , " he said
he also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized , saying he was " a normal tunisian guy ... but not an extremist
