the family of summers may have reason to be hopeful again
in may 2013 , when police discovered three young women who had been imprisoned inside a nondescript cleveland home for nearly a decade , summers ' family and law enforcement hoped one of the women would be summers , who disappeared in cleveland around the same time as the other women
but the discovery turned out to be unrelated to summers 's case and there was no new information about her whereabouts
but nearly eight years since she was last seen or heard from , the family 's optimism has been restored by an unlikely discovery her step - grandmother made on the rhode island most wanted website in january
an atm surveillance photo -- released by the warwick , rhode island , police department in late october -- depicts an unidentified woman with a familiar face , special agent vicki anderson of the fbi cleveland division said
the woman in the photo , along with an unidentified man she appears with , was being sought by rhode island police as a suspect in a string of check and identification thefts in rhode island and massachusetts , the fbi said
summers 's step - grandmother alerted the fbi about the photo , anderson said
still , she considers the surveillance footage to be a breakthrough in the case , given that the fbi has found no legitimate sightings or social media activity by summers since she disappeared on july 6 , 2007
