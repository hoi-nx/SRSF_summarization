but despite her experience , the presenter has revealed she was left â upset â after watching hours of hardcore pornography in preparation for the radio 4 show âs latest debate
the mother - of - two , 50 , said she may have been â naÃ¯ve â but was shocked by the way women were treated in the explicit clips , with many looking like they were in pain
she also raised concerns that pornography is â no longer limited to the top shelf â as it was in her own childhood but has become easily accessible as â erotica has gone mainstream
â speaking during the debate â can porn empower women ? â , miss jane garvey said : â i have to say i spent an informative hour or so last week watching porn at work
â when i watched it last week , if i am really honest with you , i am probably a bit naÃ¯ve and vanilla in my taste , i do nât think upset is too strong a word , but i was upset by the expressions of some of the women
i do not want to watch women in pain
why should i ? â other members of the panel , which included sex workers , defended pornography , claiming that not all porn is the same and that it can empower both men and women
miss jane garvey , who divorced television presenter adrian chiles , 47 , in 2009 , said access to pornography has changed since her childhood and that she worries what impact this could have on society
since the release of the fifty shades of grey film , the site has seen a spike in searches for explicit videos about â domination â of 55 percent among men and 40 percent among women
she said : â i think there is porn in every women âs magazine
â since the release of the fifty shades of grey film , pornhub has seen a spike in searches for explicit videos about â domination â of 55 percent among men and 40 percent among women other panellists were keen to defend pornography
blake , 29 , who describes herself as a feminist porn performer , said it is wrong to tar all explicit videos and images with the same brush
â i have produced porn for nine years
we should not be judging porn on whether it empowers women as capitalism is degrading as you have to exchange your labour for money
â to those who said the internet was to full of pornography that they would rather not see , she replied : â you can scroll past
â â as the industry stands i do nât believe it holds women in a safe place
â the debate , which was recorded at the weekend , will be broadcast in an edited version on sunday march 8 to mark international women âs day .
