devon has inspired many writers , such as thomas hardy , michael morpurgo and sir arthur conan doyle
but today , one of its jewels , haldon ridge , in the heart of an officially designated area of great landscape value close to the dartmoor , is being desecrated
thanks to a company controlled by harry lopes , the former underwear model who is the son - in - law of the duchess of cornwall , running along the road at the top of the haldon ridge for close to a mile is the edge of a giant 50 - acre solar panel energy farm
belltown and solstice share the same investor , berti investments , while â green â financier seth tabatznik is a director of all three firms
without the huge subsidies added to consumers â bills , the solar panel business would not be profitable
ms fearnley-whittingstall refuses to divulge how much solstice â in which mr harry lopes owns 115,000 shares - has been paid , saying this information is â commercially sensitive â
an internal report by the local council âs heritage and landscape officer , olwen maidment , described the solar panel development as â not sympathetic to the character of the locality â , warning that it would â detract from its scenic quality â
on its website , lopes âs firm , solstice renewables , claims the farm â sits within its own bowl , largely hidden from the surrounding landscape â
as maidment âs report makes clear , the farm is visible from hay tor , a popular hiking and picnic spot ten miles away on dartmoor
the solstice website makes much of a pledge , issued by sophy fearnley-whittingstall , to pay Â£ 6,500 a year for a â community benefit fund â for projects such as improved local internet connections
the the mail on sunday asked john constable , director of the renewable energy foundation , a specialist think - tank , to compute the sums , given the panels â supposed output of 6.5 megawatts
he said : â the total annual income will be about Â£ 770,000 , of which about Â£ 430,000 a year will be from subsidy under the renewable obligation scheme , ie over 50 per cent of their annual income will be from subsidy
this referred only to the legality of the farm âs planning permission , adding that the site would eventually be surrounded by newly planted hedges
â in maidment âs view , while planting hedges might reduce the impact , the site âs exposed and windy location meant the hedges were â unlikely to survive â
â the council planning committee never discussed or voted on the solar farm because the local ward member , lib dem alan connett , decided not to refer it â as he was entitled to do
by r.h.d. barham , whose poem features haldon hill - where the solar farm now sits â i was content for the officers to deal with it , â he said
â in october , environment secretary liz truss told this newspaper that large solar farms were â ugly , a blight on the countryside â
â an earlier version of this article has been amended to make clear that solstice renewables and harry lopes has sold its interest in the scheme to an associated company belltown power which will receive the green subsidies and has been responsible for construction
