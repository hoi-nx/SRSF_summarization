supermassive black holes at the centre of large galaxies could be powering blasts from deep inside the galaxy 's core , astronomers have claimed
the huge outpourings of material are responsible for ejecting enough dust and gas to build more than a thousand stars the size of our sun every year
and these outflows could also remove huge quantities of star - making gas , dictating the size , shape and overall fate of galaxies

the galaxy in the study , known as iras f11119 +3257 , has an actively growing supermassive black hole at its centre
black holes that fit this description are called active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and their intense radiation output also generates powerful winds that force material away from the centre of a galaxy
in february it was revealed that a supermassive black hole 12 million times larger than the sun and powering â the brightest lighthouse in the distant universe â has been discovered
but scientists theorise that they are generated by matter heating up as it is dragged into supermassive black holes at the centre of distant galaxies
astronomers can not explain how such an enormous black hole could have formed so soon after the first stars and galaxies emerged
' this is the first galaxy in which we can see both the wind from the active galactic nucleus and the large - scale outflow of molecular gas at the same time , ' said lead author dr francesco tombesi , an assistant research scientist in the university of maryland 's astronomy department
the outflows could also remove huge quantities of star - making gas , dictating the size and shape of galaxies

the background is a wider view of the region from the sloan digital sky survey ' the temptation is to ignore the supermassive black hole when studying galactic dynamics and evolution , but our study shows that you ca n't because it influences galaxies on the larger scale , ' added co-author dr marcio melã©ndez
this train wreck provided all the material to feed the supermassive black hole that is now driving the huge galactic - scale outflow
