what more does wayne have to do when louis van gaal said he needed a 20 - goal - a - season striker , i almost laughed
manchester united have spent huge money and now he is saying wayne rooney , robin van persie or radamel falcao ca nât score 20 goals ? do me a favour
wayne rooney issued the perfect response on saturday
in his career wayne rooney averages 18.8 goals a season
still not good enough , louis ? even if he only meant league goals , wayne rooney still ranks highly
thierry henry , one of the deadliest strikers in premier league history and my sky colleague at wembley on sunday , only scored 20 league goals in a season five times
wayne rooney has done it twice
using van gaal âs maths , even alan shearer could nât get into this manchester united team â¦ louis van gaal 's suggestion that he needs a 20 - goal - a - season striker is laughable - he has wayne rooney wayne rooney scores for manchester united against sunderland in their 2 - 0 win at old trafford on saturday the back four love to score it was not a vintage final , but chelsea âs back four held the key to victory at wembley
the chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and typify jose mourinho âs style : win at all costs
the chelsea defence has contributed 17 goals and 13 assists this season and were excellent at wembley hammers must avoid flat finish it was a surprise to see a sam allardyce team concede three set - piece goals
sam allardyce needs to turn west ham 's form around to avoid a depressing end to the season peter crouch has now scored 46 premier league headers , equalling alan shearer âs record in the competition
he âs got a great touch , scored some fantastic goals â scissor kicks against galatasaray , hat - tricks against arsenal , volleys against manchester city â and has enjoyed some memorable moments
peter crouch celebrates after scoring against hull city during their premier league clash brendan 's new year 's resolution after that brilliant win over manchester city , liverpool are bang in the race for the top four
liverpool obviously tailor their training to perfection in the new year and make sure they are in form at just the right time
it helped their title challenge last season and it could be key to champions league qualification this time round
with no europa league football to distract them now , there âs no doubt liverpool have what it takes to hunt down and catch manchester united and arsenal
liverpool 's players celebrate during their 2 - 1 win against manchester city at anfield on sunday murray 's moment glenn murray was key in crystal palace âs promotion to the premier league but will have been gutted to miss most of 2013 - 14 with injury
glenn murray rises above the west ham defence to score during crystal palace 's win at upton park swans flying under monk when swansea city sold wilfried bony i feared for them , but garry monk âs team have continued as if nothing has happened
