five men have been poisoned in japan after allegedly asking a restaurant to serve them banned parts of the world 's most toxic fish
the men were having dinner on friday night in the western city of wakayama when they ate puffer fish liver , which prompted vomiting and breathing difficulties early the next morning
puffer fish - also called blowfish or fugu in japan - are the world 's most toxic group of fish and their livers , ovaries and skin contain tetrodotoxin , 100 times more lethal than cyanide
dicing with death : five japan men were poisoned after eating banned parts of the puffer fish ( file photo ) yet eating the fish 's flesh is a tradition in japan , where wealthy diners play the russian roulette of the restaurant world by dining on sashimi slivers so thin they are almost transparent
according to a city health official , the men asked to eat a banned , toxic part of the fish - which the most foolhardy fugu aficionados are said to enjoy for the tingling it produces on the lips
the health official said the men were in their 40s and 50s and the restaurant was shut down for five days from yesterday amid an investigation
