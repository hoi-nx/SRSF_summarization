brook is willing to break with convention and give khan the lion 's share of any payday in an effort to finally lure him into a blockbuster world title fight
brook has the bargaining chip of a world championship belt but so far that has proved ineffective in drawing the bolton welterweight into a fight that would attract huge british interest
sportsmail understands khan would pocket in the region of Â£ 4 million if he met the 28 - year - old at wembley on june 13 â a date brook 's promoter , eddie hearn , has penciled in with the national stadium
ibf world welterweight champion brook poses at a press conference at montgomery theatre , sheffield khan hits devon alexander during their welterweight bout at the mgm grand garden arena last year khan chats to liverpool midfielder and fellow maxi nutrition ambassador jordan henderson in a promo brook has gone to claim he would be prepared to accept a smaller payday as ibf champion to make the fight
but despite sporadic positive feedback from the khan camp , who told eddie hearn at a recent meeting in blackpool that the bout ' will happen one day ' , the trail has since gone cold
he said that i 'm an easy fight but how long have we been banging on about wanting the fight with him ? ' after i 'm done with khan he will just be a mere memory
' eddie hearn added : ' we want the fight so badly
' khan 's fight in sheffield on march 28 will be his first since the horrific stabbing incident in tenerife last september that could have cost his life
he intends on three more fights this year , though he believes he has a greater chance of attracting the winner of mayweather 's showdown with pacquiao than he does of landing a khan bout that would draw enormous domestic interest
brook hits the bag during a media workout session at bary 's gym in las vegas in august 2014 brook lands a punch on shawn porter on his way to becoming world champion in august 2014 khan 's apparent interest in fighting american 's adrien broner would indicate that brook is low on his agenda , with brook saying : ' i think it is more likely i will end up fighting one of mayweather or pacquiao than khan , the way he is dragging his feet
' eddie hearn told sportsmail earlier this week that discussions have started over a possible summer fight for brook against juan manuel marquez or brandon rios , who are both former world champions
