it takes practice to perfect shuffling a deck of cards in a fast and flashy way
peri diaconis compared different shuffling techniques and it seems that the ' riffle shuffle ' , which involves cutting a deck in half and shuffling the halves into each other , is the most time effective - if done well
but if they use a flashier overhand shuffle , which involves quickly inserting random chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other , they will need to do it 10,000 times to achieve similar results
â there 's a third way of mixing cards - used in poker tournaments and monte carlo - i call that smooshing , â dr peri diaconis said
in a video for numberphile , dr peri diaconis compared shuffling styles to explain their efficiency ( illustrated ) if a dealer uses an overhand shuffle ( pictured ) , which involves quickly inserting random chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other , they will need to do it 10,000 times to achieve similar results to the riffle shuffle riffle method technique : cutting a pack of cards in half and quickly shuffling them into each other
efficiency : a dealer needs to repeat the process seven times to ransomise the pack and this can be done in less than 30 seconds
efficiency : a dealer needs to do this 10,000 times to achieve similar results
smooshing method technique : randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again
efficiency : one minute of smooshing guarantees a random pack of cards
a technique called smooshing ( pictured ) also known as wash , corgi and chemmy , involves randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again
it needs to be done for around one minute for the cards to be truly random and difficult to guess dr peri diaconis explained in the video how mathematicians check that shuffling is random
