apple has unveiled its watch today in what is the company 's first completely new product since the death of founder steve jobs
a press event held in san francisco revealed the collection that will range in price from $ 349 to $ 17,000 ( Â£ 299 to Â£ 13,500 in the uk )
it comes in three models : the apple watch , sport and lg , and all are sold in either 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions
the devices are due to go on sale on april 24 , but how do they compare to rivals ' smartwatches ? and can apple crack the market that has only seen limited sales to date ? here mailonline looks at its main competitors in the increasingly crowded market
apple 's watch is available in three models : the watch , sport and lg ( shown ) and all models will be sold in 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions
apple watch is made of stainless steel , sport is made of aluminum and the premium edition comes in 18 - karat rose gold and yellow gold moto 360 the moto 360 watch launched in september 2014 and won praise for its stylish , circular design that was seen as being a move away from the bulky and computerised - looking pebble steel , samsung and lg
the moto 360 360 - which is available now in the us - is also $ 100 cheaper than the apple watch
despite its impressive design and promises that the watch lasts for 24 hours , tests have shown this averages at around 12 - six hours less than the apple watch and almost two days shorter than the samsung gear s. like with apple 's watch , batter life depends on usage
' the moto 360 launched last year and is available for $ 250 in the us and Â£ 199 in the uk gear s samsung - the world 's biggest smartphone manufacturer - was early to launch a range of smartphones to counter slow earnings in its mobile sector
the gear s was unveiled in august 2014 its new watch is called the gear s and has a larger curved amoled screen than its predecessors at two inches ( 5cm )
engineer and tech expert sami mughal from oxgadgets told mailonline : ' apple are marmite at the moment ; you either love them or hate them
' the watch is the cheapest on the market at $ 199 and has an impressive battery life of two to three days , meaning users do not have to charge their watch every night
at $ 332 it is more expensive than the moto 360 and the samsung gear s , but is still cheaper than the apple watch
the watch will be available later this year across europe , asia and the us although the exact date and price information has not been announced
by comparison , the moto 360 which also has a circular screen has a ppi of 205
the firm has not yet revealed battery life details but said it would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with the device
' there will be a range of straps available when the watch launches and i can see it being popular with both sexes
' huawei would not be drawn on battery life or pricing and these will be key to its success , but it is certainly the most stylish and luxurious smart watch i âve seen
