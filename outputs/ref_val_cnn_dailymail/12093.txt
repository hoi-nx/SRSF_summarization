12,000 babies were born using ivf in australia last year but ms cassa says doctors can give no guarantees the treatment will work ms cassa âs passion for children prompted her to start running a day care but she says this only makes her desire to be a mother stronger out of pocket expenses for ivf treatment have increased from around $ 1,500 per cycle to $ 3,500 , with new changes meaning couples must spend at least $ 2,000 to qualify for the medicare safety net
