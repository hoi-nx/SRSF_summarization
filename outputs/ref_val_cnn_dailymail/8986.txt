customers of internet service provider iinet say unlimited access to netflix has slowed their internet connection since its launched in australia last week
iinet says on - demand streaming service netflix now accounts for 15 per cent of its consumer traffic , thanks to a partnership that allows customers to watch as much netflix content as they like without it counting towards their monthly data quota
but iinet said any problems with internet connections were not being caused by the rise in netflix users , instead blaming slow speeds on disruptions to the telstra network , the herald reported
