jailed for a year : burton agreed to say he was behind the wheel when 14 other motorists were caught flouting road regulations more than a dozen drivers paid one man to accept their points for offences - before police realised what had happened when they saw his licence had 49 points , a court has heard
burton , 45 , of newcastle , agreed to say he was behind the wheel when 14 other motorists were caught speeding , flouting a red light , driving without a seatbelt or using a mobile in the car over a six - year period
police only became suspicious when it was realised that burton had 49 penalty points on his licence - the majority of which were not his
officers noticed that they had received many notices of intended prosecution - sent when a vehicle is seen or photographed committing a driving offence - naming burton
a huge amount of documentation relating to him between 2006 and 2012 was then reviewed , and the scam was uncovered
drivers are generally banned from the road when they accrue 12 penalty points
judge deborah sherwin said the seriousness of their actions was evident from the case against politician chris huhne , who tried to cover up swapping speeding points with his ex-wife in 2003
â dunnen , prosecuting , said after the 14 drivers were caught breaking road regulations , they got in touch with burton and he agreed to take their points for them
