the racing driver who was the first the stig on top gear has said that the bbc show would lose its ' fire ' without the embattled clarkson
mccarthy , who was the show 's resident racing driver between 2002 to 2003 , said that top gear without clarkson simply ' wo n't work '
' ' and god help any soul who takes his place , because that 's like signing up for your own firing squad
he also said that the bbc 's decision to suspend clarkson and drop the rest of the current series of top gear amid allegations clarkson punched a producer was ' a complete overreaction ' the presenter told waiting reporters that he was off to have ' lunch with a friend ' as he left his home yesterday ' the only person who could take it on would be somebody who has nothing to lose
' clarkson 's future at the bbc is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in north
he now faces an interrogation over his row with top gear producer oisin tymon by bbc chiefs , who are said to be ' desperate ' to get rid of him
mr mccarthy went on to add that top gear with a ' neutered ' clarkson would not work either in the radio times interview
he said : ' the charm and brilliance of clarkson are that he is a slightly loose cannon , you 're not quite sure what he 's going to do next
' i think he is god 's gift to british broadcasting , and a brilliant journalist

the word - used as a derogatory term for gipsies or travellers - was part of a ' running gag ' between clarkson and fellow presenter james may about their colleague richard hammond 's perceived cheap style
