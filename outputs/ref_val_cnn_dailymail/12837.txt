nigeria 's military says its forces have retaken the northeastern town of gwoza , which boko haram militants last year declared the headquarters of their " caliphate
" the announcement comes on the eve of the west african country 's general elections
" just this morning , the gallant troops of the nigeria military in a concerted and well - coordinated land and air operations have liberated gwoza , the headquarters of their so - called caliphate , " major general olukolade said in a defense ministry statement friday
olukolade said the troops had routed boko haram fighters in towns and villages leading to gwoza
boko haram declared its own " caliphate " after seizing the area around gwoza , in borno state , in august 2014 , according to the chatham house think tank
nigeria 's general elections take place saturday
the polls had been scheduled for february 14 , but on february 7 , nigeria 's election commission announced they would be postponed for six weeks due to security concerns , with the military needing more time to secure areas controlled by boko haram
nigeria president jonathan , who is running for reelection , has been criticized for not doing enough to combat boko haram
on friday , jonathan referenced the gwoza victory in a broadcast to the nation , praising nigeria 's armed forces for their " immense sacrifices " in defending the nation
" we are also glad that our gallant armed forces have successfully stemmed the seizure of nigeria territories in the northeast by the terrorist group , boko haram , " jonathan said
citing interviews with witnesses , it said the militants rounded up 300 gwoza residents when it overran the town , then took them to a camp in the sambisa forest
" each week that passes we learn of more brutal boko haram abuses against civilians , " said hrw researcher mausi segun , adding that nigeria " needs to make protecting civilians a priority in military operations against boko haram
" the rights group said nigeria security forces had " failed to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population " when fighting boko haram but noted that , according to the government , military police were investigating those claims
amnesty said in september that reports of alleged abuses by nigeria security forces had increased since the government stepped up its fight against boko haram
it followed the posting online of an unauthenticated audio message purportedly from boko haram 's leader , abubakar shekau , on march 9 in which the speaker announced that the terror group wanted to join isis
since 2009 , boko haram , whose name translates as " western education is sin , " has waged a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of sharia law in nigeria
boko haram 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling nigeria government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques
