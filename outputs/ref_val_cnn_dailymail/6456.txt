if you 've waited until the last minute to book a holiday over easter weekend , eurozone sunspots are offering plenty of great getaway bargains this spring , a new study suggests
those who are n't sold on portugal can find similar bargains in the spanish costas , tenerife and cyprus
perhaps most important for holidaymakers , the canary islands and cyprus offer more guaranteed spring sunshine than their bargain counterparts
towns like albufeira , portugal ( pictured ) offer savings of 20 per cent from last year , the study said in the spanish costas , like costa blanca ( pictured ) , prices are almost as low as portugal 's algarve region andrew brown of post office said in a statement : ' although holidaymakers will get far more travel cash for their pounds in the eurozone , prices vary significantly between resorts , so the best advice is for canny travellers to cherry pick and book a resort where prices are cheapest
' cyprus , while more expensive than portugal or spain , does still offer substantial savings - and lots of sunshine both cyprus and tenerife ( pictured ) boast the most guaranteed spring sunshine among the eurozone but britons looking to save would be wise to stay away from the us , especially in light of a poor exchange rate
