but as the wi celebrates its 100th anniversary , a new book has been published which offers an insight into the history and politics behind the famous uk organisation
curtis ' book , the wi : a centenary history , has studied the suffragists who made the wi one of the most important movements for women in the 20th century
the first wi meeting in the uk was held in anglesey , north wales , on september 16 , 1915 as a way to encourage women to become more involved in producing food during the first world war
trish stewart ( left ) of rylstone and wi came up with the idea of posing naked for a calendar to raise money for charity
right , judith connolly , of the same wi , also strikes a pose even the queen mother was a member of the wi
mrs curtis started researching her book after moving to rural oxfordshire in 2004 and joining the local wi
after writing an article about wi banners , she became interested in the movement and interviewed people from wi groups around the country , collecting stories and nostalgic photographs
the black and white pictures capture classic images associated with the wi , including a young queen mother watching a chair caning demonstration , a group preparing fruit for jam making and women waving off a horse and cart after a course on caravanning
queen elizabeth , the queen mother , a member of the wi , watches a chair caning demonstration in 1938 lady denham , chair of the first wi , and , right , the new book marking 100 years of the organisation the book covers the very beginnings of the movement right through to modern women like the calendar girls making their mark
' in the 19th and into the 20th century , women 's influence was often exercised through the men in their lives and women 's groups have had a similarly low profile
women collect fruit and vegetables ready to make chutney during the war eleanor roosevelt , wife of the american president franklyn d roosevelt , talks to a member of barham wi in 1942 she said : ' when i started looking into it i was surprised that a lot of the people who started the wi were suffragists
' they gave the wi a political twist , using it to educate women in citizenship , give them a new role in society , and that really grabbed me
' her book explores key figures in the movement , like lady denman , the wi 's first formidable chairman and her vice-chairman grace hadow , as well as pivotal changing points , like when the welfare state was introduced
' the wi had been trying to influence politics all through the 1920s and 30s
' the wi reached its peak in the 1980s when it had more than 9,000 groups around the country , although it was viewed by the general public as being old - fashioned and insignificant
members of malton wi set up their market stall in the 1940s a wi working party making fur coats from rabbit skins for the people of russia in 1944 in 1999 a group of women from rylstone and wi in north yorkshire changed that when they turned a personal tragedy into a collective triumph
their success was completely unprecedented and their ' alternative wi calendar ' went on to raise Â£ 3 million for leukaemia and lymphoma research
they overturned the idea of the wi as an old fashioned collection of elderly ladies who made jam and sang jerusalem
' however , the wi also still tackles bigger issues too - violence against women , the environment , health and justice
