sisters iola roberts ( left ) and dwynwen williams ( right ) gave birth three minutes apart in the same hospital in adjacent rooms
the sisters are pictured here with mirain ( left ) and celt ( right ) the sisters , who were both overdue , had booked to be induced on separate dates but astonishingly both went into labour on february 19 this year dwynwen williams , 38 , and iola roberts , 39 , who both already had two children each , were thrilled to fall pregnant at the same time last year
iola roberts , who lives in nebo , north wales , with husband paul and their older children brenig , six , and brillaen , three , was given february 9 as a due date
while dwynwen williams , who lives in llangernyw , north wales , with husband dewi , a farmer , and their older children mabon , seven and llywarch , five , was due on february 13
older sister iola roberts , who works as a nurse , said that despite their due dates being so close they had never expected to go into labour at the same time
the consultant - led unit where the sisters gave birth is currently under threat so both iona and dwynwen williams are both backing a national campaign supporting the unit
dwynwen williams , 38 , said : ' when i was on my way to hospital , i texted iola roberts to say what was happening , and i could n't believe it when she sent one back to say she was also on her way
' iola roberts , who arrived at the hospital shortly after dwynwen williams , added : ' when i arrived at the hospital , i was told i 'd have to wait because there was someone in the treatment room being examined , and i replied : " tell her to get a move on ! " ' the midwife was shocked until she realised it was my sister
they then gave birth in adjacent rooms , within three minutes of each other
dwynwen williams said that having her sister there made the experience even more special
it turned out she gave birth to mirain at 1.11am , and i gave birth to celt at 1.14am
' iola roberts agreed : ' it was like a family reunion on the ward
dwynwen williams said : ' i needed a consultant with me all through the birth because of complications
