a florida teacher is facing suspension for calling a 14 - year - old muslim student ' rag - head taliban '
deyab - houssein wardani , from weston , said valdes first called him names in his french class at cypress bay high last month when he walked in wearing a hooded sweater
' over the next several days , the 64 - year - old teacher , who often nicknames her students , continued referring to deyab-houssein as ' taliban ' - even calling him ' rag - head taliban '
they have called for the teacher to be fired or suspended the teenager , who is an honor role student and a boy scout , asked his parents what the word meant , and they were shocked when they learned where he had heard it
' the parents contacted the assistant principal of the school , and when asked about the name - calling , mrs valdes admitted that she had called their son ' rag - head taliban ' , wsvn reported
the school then told the wardanis that their son could move into another french class
' accomplished : the houssein wardani family , right , said their 14 - year - old son ' dh ' is a hard - working boy scout and honor roll student who should not have to worry about such name - calling - especially from a teacher and when mr houssein wardani asked the teacher about what she had said , her response was less than reassuring , he wrote on facebook
' the district launched an immediate investigation into the matter and will be bringing forward to the school board in march a recommendation for disciplinary action regarding this situation
mr houssein wardani said he was told she would be suspended for five days - but he said that is not enough
