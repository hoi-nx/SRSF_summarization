even fernando torres was nât relegated to the reserves
but for Â£ 250,000 - per - week falcao â perhaps the most handsomely - rewarded second - string striker in history â this was the ultimate indignity
radamal falcao has scored just four goals since arriving at manchester united his latest run out was for the under 21s as they faced spurs on tuesday night at least with fellow Â£ 50million flop torres his decline was something of a slow burn , occasionally illuminated by a flicker of glories past
sadly , for falcao , there is no sign of him emerging from the darkness at old trafford
an unused substitute as manchester united struggled for a goal ( falcao has scored more than 200 in his career ) during their 2 - 1 defeat by arsenal in monday âs fa cup quarter - final , the colombian was back at the theatre of nightmares 24 hours later for an under 21 fixture against spurs
falcao fluffed his lines and missed several chances during a win over qpr back in january the striker has spent plenty of time warming the bench at old trafford louis van gaal must decide whether to take up the option to buy falcao at the end of his loan spell he failed to score against spurs , fluffed one chance and was then withdrawn â a synopsis which could well be applied to the majority of his outings since his Â£ 6m loan move from monaco
the beauty of that arrangement â and it âs something of an ugly truth â is that manchester united are not committed to making his stay permanent and there is zero chance of them doing so after his failure to impact , four goals from 19 appearances his sorry return
falcao drew a blank against league one preston in the fa cup last month he also struggled against cambridge from league two in the previous round celebrations have been few and far between for falcao , pictured here after scoring against leicester river plate 2005 - 06 - games 11 goals 7 2006 - 07 - games 20 goals 3 2007 - 08 games 39 goals 19 2008 - 09 games 35 goals 16 porto 2009 - 10 games 43 goals 34 2010 - 11 games 42 goals 38 2011 - 12 games 2 goals 0 atletico 2011 - 12 games 50 goals 36 2012 - 13 games 41 goals 34 monaco 2013 - 14 games 19 goals 11 2014 - 15 games 3 goals 2 manchester united 2014 - 15 games 19 goals 4 it was , of course , in the colours of atletico that falcao smashed a devastating hat - trick past chelsea in the european super cup of 2012
falcao was on holiday during the world cup as he missed out following a long injury lay - off falcao scored goals for fun during his days as an atletico player he won the europa league with porto in 2011 and again with atletico the following year falcao is still a monaco player having signed for manchester united on a season - long loan gone are the razor - sharp reactions of body and mind
falcao will be lucky if he leaves manchester united with 20 league appearances , let alone goals
