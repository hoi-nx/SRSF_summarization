seaworld is mounting a public defense of its animal handling in a new advertising campaign following the release of a highly critical documentary , blackfish - which left the park with declining revenue and attendance
the company has faced backlash since the release of the 2013 documentary that examined what led killer whale tilikum to drown trainer dawn brancheau in 2010 at seaworld 's orlando park
the print and youtube campaign that began on monday also comes only a day before former seaworld trainer john hargove is set to release a book detailing his experiences at the park , which could bring more negative attention to the company
however , seaworld senior corporate affairs officer kermes claims the timing of the campaign has nothing to do with hargrove 's book release , according to the orlando sentinel
' the campaign focuses on the marine - life theme park 's efforts of caring for animals in captivity and in the wild , while ' setting the record straight on false accusations by activists who oppose whales and other animals in zoological settings '
' jim atchison ( above ) , who had served as ceo and president since 2009 , stepped down in january amid accusations that the company 's treatment of killer whales may have led to the deaths of trainers
last monday , seaworld launched its ' meet the animals ' campaign which introduces individual animals as it gives a look into sea life
the youtube campaign also shows videos of behind - the - scenes caring for seaworld 's marine mammals by the company 's veterinarians
' it was reported in february that seaworld had a wider loss in its fourth quarter of $ 25.4 million as attendance to its theme parks continued to fall - due in part to blackfish
