special bond : gunner amy stevens and highfield , who is retiring the poignant message on a tombstone outside the hq of king 's troop at army barracks says it all : â here lies an old horse called wonder , his extraordinary age being forty years old when he died
â of course , that was back in the days when horses really went to war
but the fact that wonder lived to such a ripe old age â in human years , well over 100 â is testament to the fact that even when horses were used on battlefields , the british army valued and looked after them
today , the four - legged members of king âs troop royal horse artillery housed at woolwich do nât have to charge at the enemy , thank goodness
they perform only ceremonial duties , such as trooping the colour , state funerals and military tattoos
what âs more , they live in a luxurious state - of - the - art equestrian training facility , with an army of grooms tending to their every need
they enjoy 24 - hour care , with a dedicated vet and farrier on site
they are exercised daily in the arena or hacked out in nearby charlton park
once a year they go on a four - week summer holiday to melton mowbray in leicestershire , where they spend time out at grass
and yet , despite this , animal rights activists launched a withering attack on the mod last month , accusing the army of being cruel to horses
campaigners from people for the ethical treatment of animals ( people for the ethical treatment of animals ) claimed the military should not be allowed to keep any animals at all
they seized on figures showing the mod had put down 109 of their horses in the past six years as evidence of neglect
anyone with experience of horses â like me â will tell you that figure is actually quite modest considering the mod has 500 horses in its care at any one time at woolwich , where king 's troop is stationed , and at knightsbridge , where the household cavalry is based
activists singled out figures showing that horses were put down because they fell lame or suffered from colic
they suggested the mod did not try hard enough to re-home horses who could no longer work
however , this did nât stop the activists
mimi bekhechi , director of people for the ethical treatment of animals , complained : â the mod has no business using horses , dogs or any other animals
they are not soldiers , nor are they pieces of military kit to be used and then decommissioned at the end of their involuntary service
â while painless euthanasia is the only humane option for sick or wounded animals , a combat zone is no place for them
â but no horses are used in combat now
what the animal rights lobby appear to be campaigning for , therefore , is an end to the role of horses at official events
the artillery fire a 41 gun royal salute in green park in honour of queen 's 87th birthday they perform only ceremonial duties , such as trooping the colour , state funerals and military tattoos for anyone who feels proud to watch the magnificent spectacle of our gleaming military horses on parade at buckingham palace or on the mall , it seems unthinkable
what âs more , anyone who visits the woolwich base can see that they are incredibly well cared for
by any standards , king 's troop headquarters is an amazing facility
the horses are in peak condition
if they actually bothered to visit , the naysayers would see that the horses look as happy as can be
as he shows me round the stable blocks , captain watson explains that the soldiers become incredibly attached to the animals in their care
they put years of painstaking work into training them
almost all are bought as four - year - olds , mostly from ireland , and stay in service until 18
but military chiefs readily admit it can be tricky finding the right home
these are working animals who are used to an interesting and varied life
they perform in front of massive crowds and so it is imperative that they stay calm and perform their duties unflustered
she featured in last year âs trooping the colour and will take part in the trooping the colour again in june this year â one last time , perhaps
like doughnut , he featured in last year âs trooping the colour and will again this year
any suggestion that the military should be prevented from having horses seems ludicrous when you think how much care and attention is paid to their needs at every stage of their life , right into their old age
â if they got rid of the ceremonial side of the army a lot of tourism would go
