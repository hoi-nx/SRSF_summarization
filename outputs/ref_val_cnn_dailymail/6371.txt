today 's long awaited report into british 's surveilance powers was sparked by the snowden revelations gchq was last night cleared of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic
the intelligence and security committee said the central claims made by the guardian newspaper on the back of documents stolen by us whistle - blower snowden were wrong and it cleared the government âs listening station of wrongdoing
after an 18 - month inquiry , the committee dismissed the claims that gchq had â blanket coverage â of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages
in reality , it said , gchq can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a â tiny fraction â of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process
tory mp mark field , a member of the committee , said : â the big mistake that snowden and the guardian made in its coverage was to equate bulk data with bulk surveillance
labour mp hazel blears chaired the press conference on the intelligence and security committee 's long - awaited report into british 's spy agencies gchq headquarters , based in cheltenham , is the government 's main listening post and is allowed to monitor people 's ' communications ' to uncover terror threats â but what we âve also found is there is a degree of confusion and lack of transparency about the way in which this is authorised in our legal system
' the allegation arising from the [ snowden ] leaks is that gchq â hoover up â and collect all internet communications
it is clear that both for legal reasons and due to resource constraints , it is not : gchq can not conduct indiscriminate blanket interception of all communications
moreover , gchq do not have the capacity to do so and can only cover a fraction of internet communications ' british 's spy agencies have to get a warrant to monitor an individual 's emails , phone calls and other communications
the warrants are signed off by the foreign secretary philip hammond ( left ) or home secretary theresa may ( right ) shami chakrabarti , director of rights campaign group liberty , said the parliamentary committee was ' clueless and ineffective ' councils were given more authorisations to access private communications data last year than gchq and mi6 , it emerged last night
that compares to 1,291 approvals for gchq and 652 for mi6
mi5 , which makes the vast bulk of such applications , was given 48,639 authorisations last year
shami chakrabarti , director of human rights group liberty , condemned the report , adding : â no doubt it would be simpler if we went along with the spies â motto of â no scrutiny for us , no privacy for you â â but what an appalling deal for the british public
