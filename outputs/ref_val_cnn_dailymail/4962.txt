the number of homes in which no one has a job has fallen by more than 600,000 since 2010
official figures out yesterday also show a decline in families living wholly off state handouts
along with a report last week showing record numbers in work , the figures provide fresh evidence that iain duncan smith 's reforms are nudging more welfare claimants into jobs
the work and pensions secretary 's apparent success was obscured however by the fall - out of david cameron 's decision to quit by 2020 â and the continuing focus on politicians ' kitchens
official figures show 15.9 households have no - one in work , down from almost 19 per cent in 2010 mr iain duncan smith 's introduction of universal credit and a Â£ 500 a week benefit cap have been heavily criticised by the left and the poverty lobby which claim families have been impoverished
but yesterday 's figures from the office for national statistics indicate the reforms are helping to switch large numbers of people from a life on welfare handouts to jobs and earnings
the number of homes where no one has ever worked , the hard core of benefit - dependent individuals and families , fell from 275,000 in the final months of 2010 to 245,000 in the same period last year
there were 372,000 fewer children in jobless homes than in 2010 , and the number of children in families where no one has ever worked , over 302,000 at the end of 2011 , was down to 221,000 at the end of last year
work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith said the figures showed that almost 2million people are now enjoying the ' self - esteem and financial security that a job brings ' ' in total , 1.9million more people with the self - esteem and financial security that a job brings
' these figures reveal that the number of workless households has fallen by over 600,000 under this government
' the worklessness count came on top of last week 's record employment figures and a zero inflation rate likely to be good news for families at a time when incomes are beginning to rise again in the wake of the recession
