in the one and a half years they have been married andrew and erica have never argued , have no secrets and are more in love today than the moment they met
yet incredibly this melbourne - based couple , both aged 30 , have never consummated their marriage - and erica admits that she has no intention of ever doing so
for while andrew would love to rip his wife 's clothes off , erica is in fact still a virgin and reveals to the daily mail online that the very idea of making love to her husband is a complete turn off rather than a turn on
unique arrangement : erica and andrew holloway have been married since october 2012 but have never had sex because erica is ' repulsed ' by the idea ' i wish i wanted to have sex with my husband , ' erica , a graphic designer , explains
' erica has known since the tender age of 15 that she was asexual - after realizing that she had never felt sexually attracted to anyone
and despite trying to force herself to feel some kind of sexual desire towards a few men in her late teens , she admits that she failed to ever feel the kind of connection that so many of her peers seemed to experience at this point , erica had almost given up on ever finding love , as , perhaps unsurprisingly , most men she met ran a mile when she told them about her total aversion to sex
' but in 2002 , erica 's world changed when she met andrew , while the pair were both living in melbourne
happy couple : erica , pictured with andrew on their wedding day in 2012 , allows her husband to sleep with other women , including professional escorts true love : erica and andrew became a couple in 2009 , after seven years of friendship blossomed into something more ' i was very honest with andrew and did n't think for a moment we would ever be anything more than friends , ' erica says
' but over time while our love has grown , erica 's aversion to sex has not once waivered and it has not been easy for me to deal with
' but over time we have made this situation work as i would rather share my life with erica with no sex than not at all
' the couple reveal that , in order to make their relationship work , they now have an open marriage , whereby erica not only turns a blind eye to andrew having sex with other women , she has also been the driving force behind his flings
and to date he has slept with ten other women
making it work : erica insists that she and andrew have the ' perfect relationship ' , despite not being sexually intimate with one another wedded bliss : the couple , pictured on their wedding day , were determined to make their marriage work , despite andrew admitting that he found erica 's issues with sex difficult to deal with ' just because i do n't want sex , i understand andrew does , so we sought help from a sex counselor who came up with the suggestion he takes lovers and it seemed the perfect solution for us , ' erica says
' jealousy is never a factor as i 'm just relieved andrew is having sex ; i feel guilty it ca n't be with me
' it is an unconventional marital set up that andrew admits has been harder for him to get used to than erica
' indeed , so comfortable is erica with andrew having sex with other women , the she admits she is even trying to find her husband a permanent live - in lover
she explained : ' i think that would be the dream situation , as that way andrew does n't even need to leave our home to have sex
' andrew added : ' we know we do n't have a conventional marriage , but erica and i are 100 per cent happy and it works for us
