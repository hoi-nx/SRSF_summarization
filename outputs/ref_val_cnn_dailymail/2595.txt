millionaire durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in california , as well as drug and weapons charges filed in new orleans , attorneys said in court papers friday
in the papers filed at the state criminal district court in new orleans , william gibbens and dick deguerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep durst jailed
... they 're gon na find nothing , " dick deguerin , the lead attorney on durst 's team , told ktrk-tv
' i think louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie
the attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where durst was arrested
durst , a member of a wealthy new york real estate family , was charged with murder in california for the december 2000 shooting death of berman
durst 's arrest came shortly before the hbo finale about his links to three killings â that of his first wife , who disappeared in new york in 1982 ; berman , the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared ; and a 71 - year - old neighbor in texas whose dismembered body was found floating in galveston bay in 2001
frail : durst is on suicide watch at a louisiana detention center
he is expected to appear in court monday durst has only ever been tried for the texas killing , and he was acquitted of murder
durst waived extradition in new orleans but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance
however , durst 's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge
while legal experts said durst 's remarks off - camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible , prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing
' prosecutors are not commenting on the berman case while durst is still held in louisiana , where he also faces firearms charges .
