but there the comparison ends , for 19 - year - old heather mack faces a lifetime behind bars - or even death by firing squad - if convicted of the premeditated murder of her socialite mother , mack
a little more than 24 hours before this exclusive glance through a bali hospital window , miss mack had given birth in a caesarian operation to her 6lb 1oz daughter , stella schaefer , the last name being that of the baby 's father and her co-accused 21 - year - old tommy schaefer
although miss mack is not considered a flight risk , as a woman facing a serious charge she has to remain under guard at all time , no matter what the circumstances
joining her in the hospital room - and standing for a short time at the window - were the child 's grandmother , tommy schaefer 's mother , and other relatives and friends who had flown from their homes in chicago
and it is from his mother and relatives that tommy schaefer will have to rely for a first hand description of his baby , for he has been refused the right to travel under guard from kerobokan prison to the hospital
mack , 19 , was taken to hospital from kerobokan prison after she started to have contractions earlier this week mack had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital , pictured , wanted up front unless the prison grants him a special privilege to see the baby , he is unlikely to see her until - and if - miss mack takes the child with her to their next scheduled court appearance on march 24
there is every likelihood of the couple âs next court appearance - their cases are being held separately - being adjourned while she regains the strength to face the judges in the denpasar district court
earlier miss mack had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital wanted up front
but her united states attorney , anthony scifo , has told the chicago tribune - the city where the accused couple come from - that he was able to send money to indonesian earlier in the week after working out a deal with miss mack âs uncle , who controls $ 1.56 million in a trust fund set up for her by her murdered mother
miss mack does not have access to the money under her 30th birthday
they have told police that she objected to her daughter âs pregnancy by tommy schaefer and during a fierce argument he struck heather mack âs mother with the metal handle of a fruit bowl
if miss mack keeps to her stated intentions , she plans to keep the baby with her in the cell for the maximum allowed period of two years - unless there are dramatic developments in the case against her and she is able to leave the notorious prison
the pair ( pictured together ) , from chicago , illinois , are being tried separately by the denpasar district court sheila von wiese-mack 's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel but if convicted of the charge of premeditated murder , she - and tommy schaefer - could be sentenced to death by firing squad
last week tommy schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by mack and called a racially offensive name
after meeting with mack at the hotel , they discussed how to inform von mack that mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where mack and her mother were staying
' she ( von mack ) was angry at me when she knew that heather mack was pregnant , ' tommy schaefer said , while trying to hold back tears
heavily pregnant mack ( right ) , 19 , and tommy schaefer ( second from left ) , 21 , sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of von wiese - mack mack , who was sitting beside her lawyer , sobbed at the testimony
in her first questioning in court on wednesday , mack , who is eight months ' pregnant , said tommy schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von mack made the threat in an argument
heather mack , 19 , told an indonesian court on wednesday that her boyfriend tommy schaefer , 21 , killed shelia von wiese-mack ( together - left ) in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby in february a health scare saw mack rushed to hospital after she collapsed with stomach pain and started bleeding
hospital officials later said miss mack 's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check - up because she was in pain and had lost blood
