the white house , the state department and senate democrats on capitol hill are side - stepping questions about hillary clinton as the controversy over her cyber hygiene escalates

maryland rep. elijah cummings , the ranking member on the white house 's select committee on benghazi , said it 's not his job to protect clinton , his party 's possible nominee for president
' if clinton ca n't make the email story go away quick enough , she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata
