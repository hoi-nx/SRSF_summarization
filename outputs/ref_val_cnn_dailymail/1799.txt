human rights lawyers smeared british soldiers with false accusations of the torture and murder or innocent iraq , a government dossier claims
a report drawn up on the prime minister 's orders claims public interest lawyers ( public interest lawyers ) pursued claims against soldiers despite realising the allegations of abuse might have been ' untrue '
it comes after a public inquiry spent Â£ 31million exonerating british soldiers of claims they went they went on a killing and torture spree following a fierce battle in southern iraq in 2004
right is a picture of the aftermath of the battle of danny boy shown to the five - year al-sweady inquiry after five years of investigations , the al-sweady inquiry in december concluded there were some breaches of the geneva convention following the battle
now the government is gearing up to sue law firms for millions of pounds in legal costs and calling for the pil 's chief lawyer , shiner , to be struck off
the mod 's dossier , seen by at least two sunday newspapers , accuses pil and another law firm , leigh day , of continuing to pursue the case even after evidence emerged that the allegations may be untrue
that led investigators to take evidence from around 100 further witnesses , costing taxpayers an extra Â£ 780,000 , the paper reported the government 's dossier as saying
it is also alleged that public interest lawyers used a local ' agent ' to trawl basra for potential victims , a breach of a ban on solicitors touting for business that brought hundreds of extra claims against the mahdi army
the birmingham - based law firm even continued to represent one claimant in a separate judicial review after he admitted to al-sweady investigators he had lied about his sister dying on the battlefield , the dossier alleges
claims which subsequently emerged that enraged british soldiers had tortured and executed innocent local people in the aftermath of the battle were dismissed by the al-sweady inquiry , which was named for an alleged teenage victim

' public interest lawyers said last night in a statement seen by the sunday telegraph : ' the al-sweady inquiry thoroughly investigated the subject of these matters during which no criticisms were made of public interest lawyers or shiner by the chair
