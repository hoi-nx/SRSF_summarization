i am atheist -- and i am black
in a cnn special that aired on tuesday , for example , people of color were not as well - represented as american atheism 's more familiar face : you know , white males
in fact , african - american atheists represent a still small -- though growing -- segment of american atheists at large
does this mean that blacks and other minorities generally just do n't gravitate towards nonbelief , or are there other factors which keep us hidden ? there is a harsh truth to face here
most blacks identify as religious
belief in god is touted with pride , and the church is intricately tied to tradition , history and culture
the question often is n't if i go to church -- it 's where
and even if one does n't go to church , surely they still have faith -- because our people have endured and overcome so much hardship that it had to be the work of a god
to openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible , and good luck finding other blacks who also do n't believe
it is very important to note however , that the internet has made it easier for black atheists to find each other , and there is a large community of us online
in founding my organization , black nonbelievers , in 2011 , i have been fortunate to connect with others who were either raised secular like myself , or who were brought up extremely religious and left it behind
and they have done so bravely , defying the perception and expectation that all blacks blindly accept religion
there are support systems for people who have lost loved ones , yet they have no religious affiliation
while the number of visible minority atheists is still small , we are here and we 're here to stay
