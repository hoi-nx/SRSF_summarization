a watchdog has cleared west yorkshire police over the case of four - year - old hamzah ( pictured ) , who was starved to death by his alcoholic mother despite years of police contact with the family mother - of - eight amanda hutton was jailed for 15 years in 2013 after she was found guilty of hamzah 's manslaughter and neglecting five of her other children
at her trial it emerged that a range of agencies , including police officers , had contact with her family because she was a victim of repeated domestic violence , but no one spotted the danger the children were in
in a statement , the watchdog said : ' the ipcc investigation concluded that hamzah 's death was not something west yorkshire police could have reasonably been expected to predict or prevent , and that it was the actions of a pcso who made repeated and concerted attempts to speak to ms amanda hutton that led to the discovery of hamzah 's body
' mother - of - eight amanda hutton ( pictured ) was jailed for 15 years in 2013 after she was found guilty of hamzah 's manslaughter and neglecting five of her other children the commission said there had been no misconduct by officers but did criticise the force for not referring itself to the ipcc at the time the body was discovered
ipcc commissioner butts said : ' there was a clear public interest in enabling the ipcc to scrutinise the actions of west yorkshire police officers after the discovery of hamzah 's body in 2011
' amanda hutton 's trial heard how hamzah 's father , aftab khan , raised concerns with officers after he was arrested for attacking amanda hutton but detectives told the court these were investigated and no problems were found
the child 's body was found in what police said were ' breathtakingly awful ' conditions in a bedroom at amanda hutton 's house in bradford , while the kitchen was also filled with rubbish the living room of amanda hutton 's home was covered in old takeaway boxes , bottles and plastic bags ' in particular , i am concerned that it fails to explain sufficiently clearly the actions taken or not taken by children 's social care when problems in the hamzah family were brought to their attention on a number of occasions
