friends from the sydney private school scene have described their shock at how a ' nice nerd ' could end up convicted of rape
at the elite cranbrook school , in bellevue hill , in sydney 's eastern suburbs , far from being in the ' cool ' group , he spent his time with the theatre crowd , and he played one of the von trapp children in the school 's production of sound of music
so rather than hitting the exclusive parties around his home in vaucluse , in sydney 's eastern suburbs , he spent his weekends in his last year of school practicing his singing , dancing and acting
' he was particularly shy around girls and completely harmless , ' one female who knew him at school said
' i was told he had a crush on me by one of his friends which struck me as being very primary school - i mean , he was 17 but was far too shy to ever come up and say so himself
it 's pretty impossible to reconcile the guy i remember with the guy implicated in this crime
