life on a civil war ship in the south was no pleasure cruise
so it may be no surprise that among the first artifacts to be brought up from the wreck of the css georgia in savannah are two sets of leg irons
" we all know about discipline in the u.s. navy , " said jobling , a project manager with texas a&m 's conservation research laboratory
it was scuttled in december 1864 , having never fired a shot in anger while it defended the city
about 400 artifacts have been brought up by divers in the initial stage of the recovery of the css georgia , which must be moved for a deepening of the shipping channel
texas a&m is working with the u.s. army corps of engineers in savannah to conserve many of the artifacts for eventual display
among the items cataloged since the dives formally began at the end of january are two pieces that helped with the business end of the css georgia : its cannons
one iron piece had eyes , or holes , that connected a gun carriage to ropes that the ironclad 's crew manipulated to move the gun forward and backward
contract divers are out on the site every day , weather permitting , not more than a couple miles east of the city 's famous river street and waterfront
the $ 15 million removal of the css georgia is necessary for the state and federal harbor deepening project , which will see the channel go from 42 to a uniform 47 feet so massive cargo container ships can use the port without relying on the tide
the css georgia did n't have enough power to maneuver and effectively trade artillery rounds with any enemy vessels that might approach from the atlantic ocean
the yankees refused to take on the css georgia or other nearby defense obstructions
archaeologists have the challenge of preserving portions of the css georgia through chemical and other means , making her iron stable so the remains one day can be displayed
much of the css georgia is corroded , and archaeologists are gauging the integrity of each piece for conservation
" hopefully , there is a section of the wreck that will tell the human side of the css georgia , " said jobling
while salvage operations soon after the civil war removed a lot of iron from the site , there 's a chance personal items survive , especially if they are below the sediment line and protected from the ravages of oxygen
why ? that 's because the css georgia 's green wood made it susceptible to leaks
so on december 21 , 1864 , just as union maj. gen. william t. sherman 's hordes of soldiers reached savannah , the ironclad 's crew likely opened its water valves
the css georgia silently slipped below the surface
the sailors used small boats to get to shore and began a 20 - mile walk from savannah
