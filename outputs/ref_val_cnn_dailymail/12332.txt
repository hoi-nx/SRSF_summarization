i met gissendaner in january 2010 in a nondescript classroom at metro state prison for women in atlanta
since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement , gissendaner was particularly eager to share community with others , if only one morning a week
that image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who gissendaner is â who she has become : someone full of contagious joy and gratitude , open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry
gissendaner 's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband , doug gissendaner
this same pastor has been visiting gissendaner for almost 16 years
her commitment to gissendaner , along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns , provided steady , ongoing love that fostered change
so by the time i met gissendaner in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation
in the theology program , gissendaner found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on christian faith could be a gift to the wider church " on the outside , " as well as in prison
by studying historical and contemporary christian thinkers , gissendaner became part of the conversations that make the christian tradition dynamic
my relationship with gissendaner had this quality from the start
in her graduation speech , gissendaner described this moment : " there came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- i was pulled from the courses
" i sat with gissendaner as she went back over some of her own painful memories , took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done
indeed , the power of these moments -- when gissendaner looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins , when we spoke of god 's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever
gissendaner embraced what bonhoeffer , a german pastor - theologian and nazi resister , calls " costly grace
the fruits of gissendaner 's redemption are now well - documented : reconciliation with her children , ministry to inmates full of despair , counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others
on the night gissendaner thought would be her last , she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates , urging them not to worry about her , but to be encouraged
most poignant for gissendaner are the writings of german theologian moltmann , who is widely known as the " theologian of hope " and with whom gissendaner began corresponding in 2010
in the words of gissendaner 's favorite scripture , it is a hope that proclaims : " i shall not die but live , and declare the works of the lord " ( ps 118:17 )
in gissendaner 's own words : " the theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that , despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head , i still possess the ability to prove that i am human
" many people have asked me in recent days how i have been transformed by my friendship with gissendaner and by gissendaner 's journey of hope
while i struggle to find adequate words , what i do know is that gissendaner 's story pushes the logic of christian faith to its outermost limits
today , gissendaner 's life hangs in the balance
the state of georgia on monday issued a last - minute postponement of her execution , citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her
while gov. nathan deal does not have the formal power to commute gissendaner 's sentence to life in prison , i join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation , including more than 500 from georgia , who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save gissendaner 's life and to speak out publicly against her execution
