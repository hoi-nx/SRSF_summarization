the way we walk is unique when compared to our closest living relatives , the ape
but scientists are not sure when our skeleton evolved to create this distinction , which is one of the questions driving the study of human evolution today
scientists have developed a new method of analysing long bones , such as the hallucal metatarsal - the shaft of the foot bone that links to the big toe - in order to study differences between the feet of humans and apes
the method shows structural differences in different colours , as shown above an interdisciplinary team led by scientists at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg , south africa , has combined visualisation techniques , engineering principles and statistical analysis into a new way of analysing the structure of long bones
they used it to document foot differences between humans and apes , so that variations were highlighted in a rainbow of colours
scientists are not sure when our skeleton evolved to create our unique walk , but they believe the answer could lie in our big toes , which we use in the propulsive phase of walking , unlike apes which use it to climb and grasp
their method , which is described in the journal plos one , allowed them to detect differences in the shape and size of the bone in the modern species , by creating images from ct scans to make a â colour map â where different qualities and properties of the bone are shown in different colours
â in our first study , we have documented exciting structural differences between humans , chimpanzees , and gorillas , some of which were predictable based on their gait differences
