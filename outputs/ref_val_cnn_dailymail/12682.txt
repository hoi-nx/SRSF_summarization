it turns out that jupiter may be more than just an enormous ball of gas spinning a few hundred million miles farther out in the solar system
two scientists are suggesting that the inner solar system once played host to a bunch of " super-earths " -- planets that were larger than our own but smaller than neptune
jupiter 's epic , planet - shattering journey toward the sun and back out again laid the foundations for the creation of earth and the other smaller planets nearby -- mercury , venus and mars
" our work suggests that jupiter 's inward - outward migration could have destroyed a first generation of planets and set the stage for the formation of the mass - depleted terrestrial planets that our solar system has today , " said batygin of caltech , one of the authors of the paper
they generally have at least one planet significantly larger than earth that 's in a closer orbit than mercury 's
" he and his co-author -- laughlin of santa cruz , santa cruz -- are building on a scenario of jupiter 's migration that was previously put forward by other scientists
batygin and laughlin suggest that during its inward journey , jupiter dragged a load of planetary building blocks , known as planetesimals , along with it
" you only need a few earth masses worth of material to drive tens of earth masses worth of planets into the sun. " on its way back out , jupiter left some remaining planetesimals in its wake -- the building blocks that over millions of years would come to form earth , mercury , venus and mars .
