a niece of one of the victims of the germanwings crash is haunted by the ' atrocious ' thought that her uncle spent the last eight minutes of his life knowing he was going to die
sandrine driessens , niece of 59 - year - old belgian father and grandfather driessens , said that the thought was ' very hard '
' my uncle certainly knew that he was living his last moments and it 's very hard to hear that the descent of the aircraft lasted eight minute , ' she told la provence newspaper
he was killed when the a320 crashed in the alps on tuesday happy : although driessens ' niece said she was haunted by the idea that he knew he was going to die for eight minutes while the plane was descending , an aviation expert has said that it is more likely that the passengers and crew were calm and did not realise that they were in mortal danger ' for eight long minutes , he was dying
' but a veteran a320 pilot has said that the passengers would have been unlikely to know that they were going to die
if anything , he said , the plane would have been filled with ' eerie silence '
' it is likely that there was a problem with the pilots , as they put the plane into descent but failed to control it , ' said tony newton , who is also an examiner for british 's civil aviation authority
' it 's not a hollywood panic , it 's an eerie silence
' mr driessens , born in kinshasha , had returned to belgian in 1960 and lived in couvin and mons
' he was a wonderful man who loved his family above all , ' said ms sandrine driessens
