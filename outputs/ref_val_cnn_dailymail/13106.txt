the sun cuts across lake nicaragua , casting shadows across lush flora and brightly colored boats
life on lake nicaragua is peaceful , rustic and isolated , but this could change with the pending completion of a canal that builders are likening to panama 's famed waterway
headed by hong kong - based consortium hk nicaragua canal development investment company ( hknd ) , the $ 50 billion nicaragua canal ( also called the nicaragua grand canal and interoceanic canal ) would create a gargantuan new shipping route through lake nicaragua by connecting the atlantic and pacific
hknd was granted a 50 - year concession by the nicaraguan government in 2013 to build and operate the 278 - kilometer ( 172 miles ) canal , reportedly with the option for an extension
the canal will run through lake nicaragua ( among other areas ) , central america 's largest lake and freshwater reservoir , which not only preserves an integral part of lake nicaragua 's ecosystem , but directly supports numerous communities
the prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area , and those who cherish its untouched splendor
with the pending completion of the canal in 2019 , lake nicaragua may be impacted in ways only time will reveal
environmental experts worry that the shallow waters of the lake wo n't be able to withstand the dredging that will come with construction
" in terms of the canal impact on lake nicaragua , one big concern is the damage to the quality of the water ; the ship traffic will pollute the water with toxic sediments and industrial chemicals and introduce destructive invasive species , plants and animals , " dr. huete-perez , vice president of the nicaraguan academies of science and director of the molecular biology center at the university of central america told cnn
" dredging of the lake for the construction of the canal will render the lake a ' dead zone ' because of hypoxia , eutrophication and turbidity
" in january , london - based scidev.net reported that an independent commission of experts -- including scientists from the interamerican network of academies of science , nicaraguan academy of sciences and international council for science -- had reached similar conclusions , warning of " unintended adverse consequences that could do economic , environmental and social harm
on january 9 , 2015 , hknd responded to concerns about the lake 's impact on communities in a statement on its website
largely unmarred by development , lake nicaragua is a sight to behold
the feeling of being everywhere and nowhere at once is part of lake nicaragua 's charm
while granada pulses with old world charm , lake nicaragua stands still with nature as its compass , mostly untouched by modernity
