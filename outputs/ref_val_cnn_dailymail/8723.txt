a chicken which nearly died after it was savaged by a fox has recovered thanks to an innovative form of bird physiotherapy
seven - year - old rosie was attacked in the back garden of her owner jean hull , and vets said she was ' almost split in two ' following her ordeal
mrs jean hull resolved to do all she could to save the bird 's life , because she was the favourite pet of her late husband maurice , and spent five months nursing her back to health
mrs jean hull , from high salvington in sussex , said : ' she clearly wanted to live and was n't going to let that fox beat her
' she was my late husband 's favourite , so that is where the extra feeling comes from
treatment : rosie has since undergone a new form of avian physiotherapy to help her recover stretches : the treatment involves manipulating her limbs to enable her to walk normally again mrs jean hull said : ' this fox came whizzing down the garden and grabbed her and dashed down the bottom of the garden
' rosie was rushed to a nearby vet 's office , where parsons carried out emergency surgery to save her
