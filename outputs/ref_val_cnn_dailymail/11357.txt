now scientists say they can accurately estimate biological age by creating a 3d scan of wrinkles and other facial features
scientists say they have discovered a way of finding out that age by creating a 3d scan of facial features
the left image shows the average of the 17 - 29 year - old man , and the right 60 - 77 year - old man mouth width , nose width and the distance between the mouth and nose increase with age , while the corners of the eyes start to droop
jing-dong han and colleagues at the chinese academy of sciences collected 3d images of 332 chinese people between the ages of 17 and 77 using a camera called the 3dmdface system
using the data , the authors created a map of the ageing human face and were able to develop a method to find patterns of ageing based on certain facial features
according to the study , mouth width , nose width and the distance between the mouth and nose increase with age , while the corners of the eyes start to droop

young faces are smoother and thinner , while people with older faces had more fat build up and fuller cheeks , as well as sagging skin they found that up until the age of 40 , people of the same chronological age could differ by up to six years in facial age
the technique was used to identify participants who were physiologically ageing faster or more slowly than their chronological age would suggest
the researchers say their model could help identify people who age physiologically faster and tailor treatment to their needs
