the swarms of insects that plague light bulbs at night could be about to become a thing of the past
scientists have invented a bulb that emits less blue and green wavelengths , which they claim is 20 per cent less appealing to moths and other bugs
the technology could also save lives in the tropical regions of the world , where insects carry a multitude of potentially fatal diseases
a bright idea : scientists claim they have invented a bulb that emits less blue and green wavelengths , which does nât appeal to insects as much as conventional led light bulbs ( shown ) light emitted by conventional bulbs - particularly the blue wavelengths of led bulbs â is attractive to a range of insects , drawing them out from the night and straight to people âs homes
the problem with this is that insects such as mosquitoes , sand flies and â kissing bugs â that fly towards the light , increase the risk of catching vector - borne diseases
light emitted by conventional bulbs - particularly the blue wavelengths of led bulbs â is attractive to a range of insects , drawing them out from the night and straight to people âs homes
here , a vast number of bugs flock towards a floodlight in australia graphene is set to make its commercial debut in the form of a light bulb in a â matter of months â
while you may imagine that the brightness of a light bulb may dictate how many insects are drawn towards it , scientists from the university of southern california say it âs the colour of the light that matters most
all insects are attracted to â white â light , which is a combination of all colours , but different insects are sensitive to particular combinations of these wavelengths
for example , blue , violet , and ultraviolet wavelengths are especially attractive to moths and some other insect groups , so these wavelengths were turned down in experimental light bulb
professor longcore led a team , with help from philips research in the netherlands , with the aim of reducing the number of insects an led bulb can attract while still maintaining white light for indoor use
dr andrã© barroso , a senior scientist at phillips , said : â for the purpose of this study , we created unique and one - off led lamp designs that can be customised to emit different colour wavelengths to reduce the attraction of insects
