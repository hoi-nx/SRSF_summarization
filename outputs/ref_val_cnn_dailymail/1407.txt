an mi5 agent was allegedly recruited by a terrorist mastermind in syria and sent back to britain in a plot to launch a devastating attack against his handlers
the agent was recruited by mi5 as an undercover informant within the radical islamic community and he then travelled to syria where he became part of a jihadist group
but he apparently double - crossed his britain handlers and returned to central london with plans to launch an ' insider attack ' in the capital
a long undercover operation was run by mi5 to try to identify linked individuals who might be travelling back from syria to launch similar attacks but this investigation has now concluded , meaning we can now report the fact that he was a potential ' double agent '
mi5 faces difficult questions about its tactic of recruiting agents who are known terrorists , while supporters of mohammed emwazi ( pictured ) have claimed that mi5 harassed him investigators believe he met a terrorist mastermind with designs on attacking the west who encouraged him to plan an attack
back in britain , information suggested he began plotting to attack the mi5 handlers who had recruited him and set about trying to buy automatic weapons in this country or abroad
he remained in contact with his jihadi controller , a terrorist mastermind who is thought to have established links to britain
mi5 were sufficiently concerned by an intercepted communication they received that they launched an emergency operation to apprehend the man
there has been growing concern from within the security services that there could be ' blow - back ' from the conflict in syria , where hundreds of young britain have joined the fighting
eleven months after the agent was allegedly planning his attack , police and mi5 rounded up another cell linked to is also allegedly planning a gun attack in central london
