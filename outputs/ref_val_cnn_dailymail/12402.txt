photographs quietly introduced as evidence in the latest major terrorism trial in manhattan federal court offer a rare look inside bin laden 's lair -- years before al qaeda flew hijacked planes into buildings or bombed u.s. embassies in africa and even before the fbi placed bin laden on its most wanted list
still , bin laden was preparing , hiding out in a remote , mountainous area of afghanistan known as tora bora
a remarkable set of photos -- the first showing bin laden in the hideout where he would seek refuge after 9/11 -- came to light only last month in the terrorism conspiracy trial of bin laden lieutenant al-fawwaz , a communications conduit for al qaeda in london in the mid- 1990s
al-fawwaz would arrange bin laden 's first television interview for cnn 's arnett and peter bergen in 1997 and a sit - down for abc news ' john miller a year later
but before then , al-fawwaz called on a palestinian print journalist , whose 1996 journey to afghanistan yielded these photos
atwan had broken the story about bin laden 's first fatwa , or religious decree , stating his grievances against the u.s. , such as the presence of u.s. troops in saudi arabia
the next month , al-fawwaz went to atwan 's office to offer him the first print interview with the emerging jihadist leader in afghanistan
" i was told that osama bin laden was fond of my writing , he liked my style , and he wanted to meet me personally , " atwan recalled in an interview for peter bergen 's 2006 book , " the osama bin laden
" danger aside , in november 1996 , atwan was airborne to afghanistan
the date - stamped photographs from his trip -- which scotland yard detectives discovered two years later in a search of al-fawwaz 's london home -- show a healthy , relaxed , sometimes smiling bin laden , not yet 40 , conversing , hiking , videotaping pronouncements , surrounded by children
the photos also show rare images of another man who has become an influential ideologue in the global jihadist movement -- abu musab al-suri , better known as abu musab al-suri , a syria now in his mid- 50s who has not been seen in public or heard from in a decade
still , abu musab al-suri is arguably the most influential strategic thinker in islamist militant circles today
" a generation of jihadis were influenced by his teachings , " said paul cruickshank , a cnn terrorism analyst who has written about abu musab al-suri
" he wanted a global jihadist intifada , where people rose up and fought as individuals
bin laden , from saudi arabia , first went to afghanistan in the 1980s to participate in the armed resistance to soviet invaders , one of thousands of arab fighters defending a muslim nation
but after four years headquartered there , in 1996 , under pressure from the u.s. , sudan made bin laden go
by then , the ideologically in sync taliban had taken control of afghanistan , and bin laden decided to move there
in may 1996 , bin laden settled in the eastern afghanistan city of jalalabad
as one photo shows , atwan and bin laden took a two - hour walk around tora bora
" it 's like an oasis in afghanistan
" bin laden 's three wives and more than a dozen children did not share bin laden 's joy in living the life of medieval peasants in the tora bora mountains , where the only light at night was from the moon and gas lanterns , and the only heat in a place where tremendous blizzards were common was a wood - burning metal stove
in december 2001 , with u.s. troops retaliating for 9/11 closing in , bin laden fled tora bora , eventually making his way to pakistan , where u.s. navy seals ended a decade - long manhunt by killing him in his abbottabad hideout , an hour north of islamabad
even in tora bora , atwan felt bin laden was vulnerable to intelligence agencies
" in 1996 , bin laden knew but certainly did not disclose the lethal plots he had set in motion -- the embassy bombings , the planes plot that would become 9/11
al-suri was close to bin laden , which explains his comfortable presence in the 1996 photos of tora bora , seated next to al qaeda 's leader in his cave or hiking with him , carrying his own cameras
) the u.s. has since accused abu musab al-suri of training recruits at al qaeda 's pre- 9/11 al-ghuraba and derunta camps in afghanistan , where operatives such as ahmed ressam , who planned to bomb los angeles international airport in december 1999 , learned how to kill with poisons and chemicals
eventually , abu musab al-suri publicly criticized bin laden for making al qaeda so hierarchical , for courting publicity and being so controlling , even calling him a " pharoah " for his imperial leadership style
strategically , abu musab al-suri argued , a less centralized jihadist network would make operatives who were arrested less likely to expose fellow militants to intelligence or law enforcement agencies , because the fighters would not know who else was part of the movement
after 9/11 , abu musab al-suri appeared on the u.s. most wanted terrorists list with a $ 5 million reward for information leading to his capture
