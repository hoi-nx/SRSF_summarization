most little girls will exchange bracelets and gifts with their closest friends , but one eight - year - old has been receiving trinkets from a more unusual source - the birds in her garden
gabi mann , from seattle , washington , feeds the crows that visit her home with peanuts and they bring her gifts in exchange
the youngster has built up collection of more than 70 shiny beads , buttons , pieces of metal , brightly coloured plastic and foam - all left for her by her corvid companions
among her most prized presents from the neighbourhood crows is a pearl - coloured heart
' it 's showing me how much they love me , ' gabi mann told the podcast the bittersweet life and the bbc two
' the image above shows just some of gabi mann 's favourite items left for her by birds in exchange for peanuts gabi mann and her mother leave nuts for the crows on a bird feeder ( above ) along with fresh water in a water bath listen to the full podcast by the bittersweet life when they visited gabi and her mother lisa in seattle her strange relationship with the birds began in 2011 when as a four - year - old she would accidentally drop food
groups of crows began loitering around the family house hoping to pick up the scraps gabi mann left behind
when she started going to school , gabi mann began feeding them her lunch
two years later gabi mann and her mother lisa began leaving food outside in their garden on a daily basis - filling the bird bath with water and leaving peanuts on feeders
other experiments involving the same family of birds found that caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food
the individual processes are detailed in this diagram as gabi mann throws the food for the birds , crowds of crows - known as a murder - gather on telephone lines and the nearby fence
in return the crows now leave trinkets on the empty bird feeder - including a broken light bulb , earrings , pieces of lego , rusted screws , polished rocks and glass beads
' crows are known to be highly intelligent creatures - capable of solving complex puzzles and problems to obtain food
in perhaps the most astonishing story , however , gabi mann 's mother lisa describes how the crows in their neighbourhood appear to keep watch over the family
lisa mann and her daughter gabi mann ( above ) have formed a unique bond with the crows in their neighbourhood she said that on one occassion she had been out taking photographs of an eagle when she dropped her lens cap on the floor and forgot to pick it up before walking home
' gabi mann keeps her collection of gifts from the birds carefully arranged in bags and pots shown above gabi mann herself believes her relationship with the crows has given her a special bond with the natural world and calls herself nature girl
' professor john marzluff , an expert on avian social ecology at the university of washington , said he believes the crows may be offering up the gifts as they would to a potential mate
speaking to the bittersweet life podcast , he said : ' i have seen an awful lot of things crows bring people
they do bring gifts whether it is always going to happen , i do n't think so
the crows regularly carry gifts , like above , to the water bath and bird feeder in the family 's garden after eating ' certain individual crows the bond they form with that person might be more of a courtship bond where they are bringing presents like they would for their mates
