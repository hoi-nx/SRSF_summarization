microsoft co-founder paul allen says he has found the wreck of a long - lost world war ii. japanese battleship near the philippines
the philanthropist posted images on twitter that appeared to show the musashi , once one of the two largest warships in the world
the discovery was made aboard his superyacht , the my octopus , as part of an expedition that paul allen launched
the search has taken paul allen and his team of researchers more than eight years
" since my youth , i have been fascinated with world war ii. history , inspired by my father 's service in the u.s. army , " paul allen said in a statement
in one tweet , he said one image showed the bow of the ship , which features a distinctive chrysanthemum -- the flower is the emblem of japan 's royal family -- and a huge anchor
the other underwater photograph shows one of the musashi 's valves on which the japanese characters for " main valve handle " and " open " are legible
the director of japan 's kure maritime museum told cnn after viewing the information posted by paul allen that it appeared that the vessel was the musashi , although further pictures were needed to know for sure
navy dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times , but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the musashi
" more than 1,000 of the musashi 's crew were killed during the battle and sinking
a statement released by vulcan , paul allen 's company , said that the team combined historical data with advanced technology to narrow the search area , and that paul allen had " commissioned a hypsometric bathymetric survey of the ocean floor to determine the terrain " before searching the area with a bluefin autonomous underwater vehicle
todaka , the maritime museum director , said that , given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found , he was " 90 % sure " that the ship was the musashi
" todaka said paul allen 's team had been in contact with the museum about the ship 's potential location and its expedition
" he added that images of the entire body of the ship will be needed to be 100 % sure that the discovery is indeed the musashi
the vulcan statement added that the team is " mindful of the responsibility related to the wreckage of the musashi as a war grave and intend to work with the japanese government to ensure the site is treated respectfully and in accordance with japanese traditions
" since leaving microsoft , the company he co-founded in 1975 , billionaire paul allen has immersed himself in a variety of commercial and charitable pursuits
