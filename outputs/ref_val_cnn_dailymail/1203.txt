a group of 47 republicans senators warned iran 's mullahs on monday that any agreement the obama administration strikes with the islam republic to limit tehran 's nuclear program may be short - lived unless congress formally approves it
in a rare open letter to iran leaders , arkansas freshman sen. tom cotton and 46 others from the republicans wrote that without congressional approval , ' we will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear - weapons program that is not approved by the congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between president obama and ayatollah ali khamenei
' ' the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen , ' the republicans wrote , ' and future congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time
' the white house in turn tried to brand republicans as warmongers and accused them of pursuing a ' partisan strategy to undermine the president ' while demanding power that goes against the role the founding fathers envisioned the legislative branch playing in foreign affairs
scroll down to read the letter freshman sen. tom cotton of arkansas , shown in january at the us capitol , organized 47 republicans senators to warn iran that a nuclear agreement could be short - lived unless congress approves it the white house in turn tried to brand republicans as warmongers and accused them of pursuing a ' partisan strategy to undermine the president ' while demanding authority that goes against the role the founding fathers envisioned the legislative branch playing in foreign affairs secretary of state john kerry ( third from left ) met with iran foreign minister mohammad javad zarif ( third from right ) for a new round of nuclear negotiations last wek while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu was in washington telling congress that tehran ca n't be trusted ' the rush to war , or at least the to the military option that many republicans are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the us , ' white house spokesman josh earnest said monday afternoon
josh earnest speculated that letter emanated from senate republicans ' concern that as soon as a deal is signed , the white house would begin pressuring congress to begin lifting sanctions
the white house would first want to see ' demonstrated compliance ' on the part of iran before that would ever happen , the president 's spokesman said
republicans and democrats alike have said they would like to see a stricter sanctions regime enforced if iran does not agree to the us ' terms by the end of the month , and a resolution to that effect is set to come to the floor of the senate
that legislation would not authorize the president to go to war with iran , though still , josh earnest contended that letter signers have no alternative to president obama 's diplomatic strategy other than ' a military option
' speaking to reporters after a meeting in the oval office with european council president donald tusk , obama commented that it 's ' somewhat ironic ' that republicans want to align themselves with ' hardliners ' in iran
on notice : the letter to iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei ( pictured ) warns that senators who signed it will be in office long after president obama leaves the white house later in the briefing he brought up an authorization for the use of military force agreement the white house sent to congress last month asking for the power to fight isis with ground troops in special circumstances
the president would rather use us 's influence to try to build coalitions around the world , not only because he thinks it is ' more effective , ' josh earnest said , but because it ' has yielded important results for the us people
' there is a starkly different approach between the one that is advocated by republicans that puts the military option and war - fighting at the top of the list , ' he continued
although the letter , first reported by bloomberg , is addressed to ' leaders of the islamic republic of iran , ' it 's equally aimed at delivering a message to obama
' the president may serve only two 4 - year terms , whereas senators may serve an unlimited number of 6 - year terms , ' tom cotton 's group wrote
' tom cotton told bloomberg that ' iran 's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that â¦ any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril
' california sen. dianne feinstein said monday after that she was ' appalled ' at the republicans effort to ' blow up a major effort by our country and the world powers to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the iran nuclear program
' the white house said monday that the republicans senators 's move ' certainly interferes ' with ongoing negotiations
in remarks on the senate floor monday afternoon top - ranking democrat reid said the judgment of the chamber 's republicans ' seems to be clouded by their abhorrence of president obama
' reid , who was the senate 's majority leader until january , when republicans rose to power , said the letter signers were ' undermining ' obama ' while empowering the ayatollahs
the uranium enrichment facility in natanz , iran is a major sticking point with the us , which wants inspectors to have unfettered access to the iran regime 's nuclear program ' the greatest threat against the world is the marriage of militant islam with nuclear weapons , ' israeli priime minister benjamin netanyahu warned congress last tuesday israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu addressed a joint meeting of congress last week in washington
the pact the bargainers are working on does not actually require congressional approval , however , because it is not a treaty , which would require a two - thirds majority senate vote to be ratified
obama said in a separate cbs interview that the us would ' walk away ' from the talks unless they produce a procedure for verifying that restrictions on iran 's nuclear effort are working
the letter released monday was signed by 47 of the senate 's 54 republicans
