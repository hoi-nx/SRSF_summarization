like many professional athletes , woods has decided to move into the hospitality industry with a huge new restaurant set to be opened this year
but it appears to have already hit a speed bump , with project developer nicholas mastroianni revealing it can not be named ' woods ' because nike owns the rights to the golfer 's full name
he made the claims when asked in an interview about the florida project 's clunky name - the woods jupiter : sports and dining club
woods is unable to name his restaurant after himself because nike owns the rights to his name , the project developer has claimed in an interview with golf.com , he said he was told that ' nike has the rights to the name woods ' , adding that even gaining permission to use woods ' name in a press release was ' over the top '
however , woods ' manager mark steinberg has contradicted the claims , saying nike does not own the rights to his client 's name
' a nike spokesperson supported this , denying the corporation owned the rights to the name woods
