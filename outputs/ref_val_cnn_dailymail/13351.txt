racist emails -- like one that depicted president obama as a chimpanzee -- resulted in three ferguson , missouri , city employees resigning or being fired , the city spokesman said friday
police officers capt. rick henke and sgt. william mudd resigned thursday over the emails discovered during the american justice department investigation of racial prejudice in the city 's police and judicial system , city spokesman small said on friday , citing the city attorney
the city 's top court clerk , mary ann twitty , was fired earlier this week in connection with the emails , small said
examples of the racist emails include one sent in october 2011 that showed a photo of bare - chested dancing women , apparently in africa , with the caption " obama 's high school reunion
" some critics have called for the department to be disbanded and for police chief jackson to resign
in a friday interview with cnn 's sara sidner , ferguson mayor knowles said jackson was not copied on any of the emails
in a separate report , the justice department described what it said was a " pattern and practice " of discrimination against african - americans by the ferguson police and municipal courts
that discrimination included racist emails
