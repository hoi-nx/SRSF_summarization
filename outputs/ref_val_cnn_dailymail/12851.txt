researchers say dr. ben carson may be a brain surgeon , but science shows he 's dead wrong about how sexual orientation works
wednesday on cnn , ben carson , a retired neurosurgeon and potential republican presidential candidate , said he " absolutely " believes being gay is a choice
but scientists say decades of research overwhelmingly shows sexual preference is inborn , not a choice
" in a statement wednesday , ben carson apologized for what he said on cnn , and softened his words , saying the verdict is still out on whether people are born with their sexual preference
while science is seldom definitive about anything , especially something as complicated as why we love who we love , researchers say the preponderance of the evidence shows sexual orientation is not chosen
" so what was ben carson 's scientific support for his argument that being gay is a choice ? he pointed to prisons
so , did something happen while they were in there ? ask yourself that question , " ben carson told cnn 's chris cuomo
experts on sexual activity in prisons challenged the very premise of ben carson 's statement , calling it " preposterous " and " appalling
prisoners do engage in homosexual practices , but that does n't mean they 've gone from straight to gay , the experts said
" opinion : prison does n't make people ' come out ' gay the prisoners who are perpetrating the rape are often either gay to begin with , or are heterosexual and rape to subjugate other prisoners
" these men do n't see what they 're doing as homosexual , and they will leave their incarceration heterosexual
" other prisoners do willingly engage in homosexual activity , but the experts say it 's more of a way to release sexual tension and have some degree of intimacy
critics of these studies point out other research they say indicates that orientation is a choice , namely studies that show sexual orientation can change over the course of a lifetime , and that " socialization " can alter orientation
