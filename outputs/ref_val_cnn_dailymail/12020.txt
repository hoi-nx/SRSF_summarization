pietersen has agreed a release from his indian premier league contract as he seeks a new deal with surrey to try to reignite his hopes of an england recall
pietersen was axed by england in february 2014 after their whitewash in australia , but is hoping for a still unlikely international return in time for this summer 's ashes rematch
pietersen 's plans to return to county cricket with surrey have moved a significant step closer pietersen said : ' i 'm hugely grateful for all the support and understanding i 've received from everyone at the sunrisers and the indian premier league
pietersen plays a shot on the second day of the ashes series between england and australia last year england and wales cricket board chairman graves this month revived the record - breaking 34 - year - old batsman 's hopes of a return to the fold , contrary to the public remarks by anyone else associated with the governing body
but a pre-requisite from graves was that pietersen must first of all find a way back into county cricket - and then , of course , start scoring runs again
' a statement on his website spelled out pietersen 's next move - without specifying surrey as his immediate destination - and that he has his heart set on an england return in time for the start of the ashes in july
pietersen was involved in a high - profile dispute with england coach peter moores back in 2009 it read : ' the four - time ashes winner , who is also england 's highest ever runscorer in all formats , will ... join a domestic county with the aim of earning a place in the england squad for the upcoming ashes series
former england star pietersen previously rubbished claims suggesting his best days are behind him ecb managing director downton pinpointed pietersen 's ' disengagement ' with his team - mates during his last test match to date - the defeat in sydney which consigned england to their 5 - 0 2013/14 ashes whitewash
