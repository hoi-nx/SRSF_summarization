scientists have discovered a frog in ecuador that can rapidly change its skin patterns to mimic the texture it sits on
spotted in the western andean cloud forest , the creature is believed to be the first known amphibian to have this shape - shifting capability
researchers claim the ability to change skin texture to reflect its surroundings may enable the frog to camouflage itself from birds and other predators â but say this has yet to be proven
krynak spotted the spiny frog , which nearly the width of a marble , sitting on a moss - covered leaf
' the spines came back ... we simply could n't believe our eyes , our frog changed skin texture
' but whether the texture really helps them elude predators still needs to be tested
' in this image , one of the frogs can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs , where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside this is the astonishing ' glass ' frog which manages to elude its predators with its see through skin - rendering it almost invisible
they found the animals shift skin texture in a little more than three minutes
a separate research them at universidad tecnolã³gica indoamã©rica , ecuador , discovered that primates sobetes , a relative with similar markings but about twice the size of p. mutabilis , has the same trait
