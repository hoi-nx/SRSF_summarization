manchester united and skipper wayne rooney significantly boosted its own chances and delivered a probable knockout blow to tottenham hotspur 's hopes of champions league qualification with 3 - 0 home win sunday

tottenham hotspur is seventh , six points adrift of the top four
a national newspaper had posted a video on on social media sunday which appeared to show wayne rooney being felled by fellow epl footballer and former manchester united teammate phil bardsley as both donned boxing gloves for a " friendly " fight in his kitchen

earlier , chelsea extended its lead at the top of the epl to six points but was held 1 - 1 at home to saints in another less than convincing performance from jose mourinho 's team
however , it has a commanding lead plus a game in hand over chasing manchester city , which lost 1 - 0 to burnley saturday , in a severe blow to hopes of retaining the title
in sunday 's other epl clash , everton eased its relegation fears with a 3 - 0 win over newcastle , who had fabricio coloccini sent off for a foul on aaron lennon , who is on loan at goodison from tottenham hotspur
