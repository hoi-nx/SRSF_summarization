the first treatment specifically designed to treat migraines has been developed - a breakthrough experts say is of ' ground - breaking ' importance
the new injection gives hope to the hundreds of thousands of people who suffer chronic migraines - the most debilitating type of headaches
the jab is made from monoclonal blood protein compounds
these are are antibodies - proteins produced by the body to fight injection - specifically engineered to fight the chemical that causes migraines
the protein compounds are able to ' mop up ' another protein called calcitonin gene - related peptide ( cgrp ) , which triggers the pain , nausea and vomiting associated with a migraine
a new injection to prevent migraines has been developed for the first time , in a breakthrough experts are calling ' ground - breaking ' in trials of 172 sufferers , scientists found the jab brought ' significant reduction ' in the numbers of hours and days chronic migraine patients suffered headaches
a migraine is severe recurring headache , usually affecting only one side of the head , characterised by sharp pain and often accompanied by nausea , vomiting , and visual disturbances
a combination of reactions occur that results in a chemical called the calcitonin gene - related peptide ( cgrp ) being produced and released
cgrp causes the swelling of blood vessels that are intertwined with nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve , which is located on both sides of the head
researchers found monoclonal blood proteins â antibodies specifically engineered to bind to cgrp â were able to ' mop up ' the chemical , meaning it did not trigger a migraine
he said : ' this announcement is of ground - breaking importance , as it represents the first potential , specific treatment for chronic migraine ever developed
the injection , which is made from proteins called monoclonal blood proteins , is able to ' mop up ' another chemical which triggers migraines when it is released in the brain ' all interested physicians will watch this development with excitement , as it offers a chance to do more for our most disabled migraine patients , as we invest in further research for an eventual cure
' he said past medications used to treat migraines â beta - blockers , anti-depressants , and epilepsy medicines â are ' borrowed ' from other specialities , whereas this injection works specifically for migraines
a combination of chemical reactions occurs that results in a chemical called the calcitonin gene - related peptide ( cgrp ) being produced and released
cgrp causes the swelling of blood vessels that are intertwined with nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve , which is located on both sides of the head
researchers found monoclonal blood proteins â antibodies specifically engineered to bind to cgrp â were able to ' mop up ' the chemical , meaning a migraine was not triggered
