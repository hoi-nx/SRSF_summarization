swirling through the air in mesmerising saucer - like shapes , these exceptionally rare lenticular clouds are the most common explanation for ufo sightings
the remarkable - looking disc shapes were spotted by amateur photographer glenn spencer , 42 , in the sky above chester in cheshire
the formations , also known as wave clouds , were scattered over miles , producing a stunning spectacle
rarely seen in the uk , lenticular clouds are formed when a tall geographic feature , such as the the top of a mountain , obstructs a strong wind
