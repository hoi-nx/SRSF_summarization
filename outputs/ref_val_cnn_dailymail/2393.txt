now a principal scientist from gillette has revealed the science behind shaving including how hairs behave , why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never , ever tap your razor on the sink
washing the face before a shave increases the surface area the blades can cut through said gillette principal scientist kristina vanoosthuyze dr kristina vanoosthuyze has worked in the gillette shaving technology area at the innovation centre in reading for the past nine years
every morning 80 volunteers visit the centre and shave in front of a filming rig that combines magnifying lenses , high - speed cameras and special high - intensity lighting
this has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair , and in the case of multiple - blade models , the first blade pulls the hair up , the second cuts it , the third blade acts in a similar way to the first , and so on
in some of their products , gillette also offers a vibrate function that further lifts the hair and reduces the friction caused by the blades
this footage has also revealed the differences between dry and hydrated skin and beard hair
every day 80 volunteers shave in front of a rig that combines magnifying lenses and high - speed cameras
in the case of multiple - blade models , the first blade pulls the hair up , the second cuts it , the third blade pulls and so on when hydrated , skin is also tighter ( an image of the skin is shown before washing left and after washing right )
as a result dr kristina vanoosthuyze recommends showering before shaving - and not the other way round this image is a microscopic image of cut hairs on dehydrated skin
dry hair can have the strength of copper wire and when hair and skin hydrates it swells and makes the hair easier to cut
shave with a multi-blade razor using light strokes : gillette said the razor should do the work , not the person shaving
' allowing water to penetrate the hair is key for a comfortable and close shave because dry hair is difficult to cut , ' explained dr kristina vanoosthuyze
' scanning electron microscopy also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek , neck and chin , for example
however , dr kristina vanoosthuyze revealed that shaving in the direction of the hair is often the best place to start
' it is difficult to give a simple , straightforward answer , because the comfort of the shave - or lack of irritation - is dependent on so many more factors than simply the direction of the shaving stroke , ' she told mailonline at the launch of gillette 's proglide with flexball technology razor
' our data has shown that men who shave with proglide against the grain rated the product as high for ' gives a comfortable shave ' as those men who shaved with the grain and / or in both directions
' scanning electron microscopy also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek , neck and chin ( pictured )
dr kristina vanoosthuyze said : ' as a general rule , most men find shaving first in the direction of the hair growth and then following up with upstrokes provides the closest , smoothest shave with good skin comfort ' but she continued that a man 's facial hair tends to grow in different directions , so even if he thinks he shaves with the grain , some hairs will still unknowingly be cut against the grain
' as a general rule , i would say that most men find using light strokes and shaving first in the direction of the hair growth and then following up with upstrokes provides the closest , smoothest shave with good skin comfort
' and when it comes on what not to do , dr kristina vanoosthuyze said that some men place as much as 3.3lbs ( 1.5kg ) of force on the blade
' dr kristina vanoosthuyze also explained that under no circumstances should a person tap their razor on the side of the sink
this image shows the angle a blade takes on a typical cheek hair she also explained that under no circumstances should you tap the razor on the side of the sink
' at the end of the shave , just rinse the razor thoroughly with water and shake off excess water before storing , ' dr kristina vanoosthuyze
and after the shave , dr kristina vanoosthuyze recommends using a moisturising lotion
