nhs chief executive simon stevens today revealed a Â£ 200 million scheme aimed at providing better care for the most vulnerable patients elderly and vulnerable patients will be offered longer gp appointments â including at weekends â in an attempt to reduce the chances of them ending up in hospital
as part of a Â£ 200million scheme aimed at providing better care for the most vulnerable , some patients will also undergo consultations with a&e nurses via webcams to establish whether it is really necessary for them to go to casualty
simon stevens , the nhs âs chief executive , yesterday announced the pilot scheme , which will be rolled out in 29 areas covering a total of five million patients
it is hoped the scheme will gradually expand across england with the aim of treating more patients at home , or at their gp surgery , rather than in hospital
mr simon stevens said the set - up of the nhs is too â fragmented â , meaning patients are passed â from pillar to post â
â eventually , mr simon stevens wants many of the complex procedures provided by hospitals to be routinely available at gp surgeries a few miles from patients â homes
in airedale , west yorkshire , patients in care homes will be offered consultations via webcams with nurses in a&e units at any time of the day and night
if they suffer a fall , rather than calling an ambulance , staff at the care home will set up the internet consultation with a nurse at the hospital
in west yorkshire , patients in care homes will be offered consultations via webcams with medics working in a&e units at any time of the day or night , as part of the trial scheme announced today these patients may have several long - term conditions such as dementia , diabetes and heart disease and doctors will use the time to make more thorough assessments
