the deep bass tones of singer barry white have become synonymous with seduction among humans , but it appears horses find deep voices sexy too
a new study has found that female horses are more attracted stallions with deeper , lower pitched whinnies
the lower frequency ' voices ' of stallions tended to be associated with larger males , who had a calmer temperament and their offspring tended to survive for longer
and just like humans putting on an album featuring barry white 's bass - baritone voice , the deeper whinnies from male horses also appear to get the mares more in the mood
the researchers say the findings could also be used to help horse breeders select the best stallions for mating in the future
professor lemasson , a biologist at the university of rennes in france , said : ' the lower pitched the stallion 's voice , the slower its heart beat and the higher its reproductive success
in a study published in the journal public library of science one , professor lemasson and his colleagues recorded the calls of 15 breeding stallions from stud farms around france
the singer barry white was known as the walrus of love due to his deep voice and reputation for singing romantic songs , but it seems he may have been copying a style of seduction already employed by male horses they took blood and sperm samples from each of the horses and measured their heart beat
the researchers then played the recordings to 40 adult mares aged between seven and 27 years old at the haras national du pin in france
the females were placed in a corridor with a speaker at either end , through which a pair of whinnies from different stallions were played
they also found that the males with deeper whinnies tended to be larger - suggesting they were stronger and so better able to protect the harem
male stallions will often show off in an attempt to win a mate but it seems their whinnie is also important they also had slower heart beats , meaning they were calmer and fewer of their offspring tended to die before or shortly after birth
