clark county coroner murphy said wednesday that he ruled perez 's death a homicide from multiple gunshot wounds to the head , neck , chest and arms
nevada prisons chief cox said in a statement issued after the coroner 's ruling became public that andrew jay arevalo and perez were fighting when a guard at high desert state prison opened fire
but he said the shooter was one of three correctional officers who remain on administrative leave pending completion of a nevada department of investigations report and a review by the state attorney general 's office
laxalt 's office also could be called on to defend the state in wrongful - death and excessive - force lawsuits
perez and andrew jay arevalo were being housed separately in a disciplinary wing , known as ' the hole ' , where inmates are handcuffed behind their backs when they are outside their cells , and no more than one inmate is usually allowed out of a cell at the same time , plunkett said
' procedure was followed because perez and my client were both handcuffed , ' the attorney said
scene : perez and andrew jay arevalo were in the ' hole ' , or administrative segregation , at high desert state prison in indian springs , nevada , in november , when they started fighting
perez died and andrew jay arevalo survived plunkett added : ' obviously , in light of the shooting , the procedural violation is the least of the issues
' plunkett said she has talked with an attorney for perez 's family
' perez 's younger brother , victor perez , 30 , said the family were not properly told what happened to his sibling
' we had to undress him ourselves to take pictures of his wounds , ' mr perez told the review-journal
prisons officials issued a 78 - word statement the day after perez died saying he had been in prison since march 2013 , that an autopsy and investigation would be conducted , and that no further details about his death were available at that time
the statement did n't say perez had been shot or that andrew jay arevalo had been wounded
