border officials refused a canada woman the right to stay in the britain claiming she does n't have a ' genuine relationship ' with her britain husband - despite them having been married for 45 years
david , 70 , and his wife maria , 66 , have been happily married since 1970 , and have a 42 - year - old son , derick , who holds a britain passport
the couple lived in ontario , canada , until september 2013 , when they moved back to the britain to care for mr david 's sick mother
but border officials have now refused retired optician mrs summers 's application for a permanent britain visa because they do n't believe the pensioners have a real ' affectionate relationship '
border officials have questioned david and summers ' relationship and denied her a visa - despite them having been happily married for 45 years
pictured , right : the couple on their wedding day in 1970 the decision was appealed and it is currently being considered by the uk border agency , who have told the couple that no final ruling will be made until the end of may
the couple , who own a house in hereford , are meanwhile desperately trying to prove that their marriage is genuine for fear mrs summers could be permanently excluded from the britain when her temporary tourist visa expires
' the couple say they have five decades ' worth of pictures to prove their long - running marriage is genuine - but were not asked to provide any evidence when applying for the visa mr david said : ' we love each other very much , it 's hurtful for them to suggest our marriage is not real ' mr david added : ' they have n't even given us a chance to prove that our marriage is real
mr and mrs summers lived in canada after they married in 1970
they want to move to the house they own in hereford so they can look after mr david 's mother they say the decision has been made all the more extraordinary by the fact that they have grown - up son they married in 1970 and lived in kingston until 1981 , when they moved to ottawa
the couple made frequent visits back to the britain and bought their house in hereford in 1995 for mr david 's elderly mother doris to live in
' i find it utterly extraordinary , i ca n't really contemplate life without my wife
