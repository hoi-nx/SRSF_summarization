new delhi thankfully , no one was wounded after crude bombs were hurled at a tamil news station in india on thursday
last week , when india 's government and a british documentarian faced off over a film featuring a man imprisoned for a 2012 gang rape in south delhi , a little - known channel hundreds of miles away in southern india was waging its own battle
hardline hinduism groups were angry with broadcaster puthiya thalaimurai for filming a show about the relevance of a traditional necklace -- called mangalsutra in hindi and thaali in tamil -- worn by married india women
six people involved in the bombing have been arrested , said s. george , the commissioner of the southern india city of chennai
" the show wanted to give women a platform
but you can not strangle freedom of free expression by violent means and threats , " said kumar , the ceo of new generation media , which runs puthiya thalaimurai
' india 's daughter , ' the film banned by india : what did it show ? but india is no stranger to censorship imposed legally or forced by rowdy protesters
communities or people claiming their religious sentiments were hurt by anyone else 's opinion can file a lawsuit
authorities can seek restraining orders from local courts -- as they did to ban the recent bbc documentary " india 's daughter " -- by citing potential disorder
in december , a bollywood movie , " pk , " came under attack over similar accusations when mobs tore apart its posters in parts of india
but india , home to one of the world 's largest film industries , has blocked several movies from screening
just last week , india blocked the bbc from airing " india 's daughter " because it included comments from one of the men convicted of raping a young student in a moving bus in new delhi in 2012
" there 's a growing intolerance towards different shades of opinion
what india needs is a concerted effort to move beyond it and embrace free expression in totality , " said kumar , the new generation media chief executive .
