there are two main ways visitors to ho chi minh city cross the streets
it 's a tour company that provides two - wheel thrills on the italian vintage scooters , vespa , around ho chi minh city , out into the mekong delta and beyond
being on a scooter in ho chi minh city is the best way to feel a part of the city , says mueller
one popular early morning pit stop is tao dan park where ho chi minh city 's bird fanciers puff themselves up like their caged pets in a display of tweeting one - upmanship
all the mopeds are driven by local , experienced drivers who have no problem with the swarm of vehicles on the roads
a local tour guide rides along , too , to add context to the sights , smells and sounds experienced from the back of a two - stroke motor
it became so successful he was in danger of putting himself out of a job , so in 2006 he decided to start a tour company offering multi-day tours outside of ho chi minh city
according to mueller , his business was kick - started by vietnam 's appearance on the tv program " top gear , " which showed the country 's beautiful countryside and underused roads
most of the scooters in mueller 's garage hark back to the golden age of vespas , the late ' 60s and 1970s , refurbished with replacement parts from piaggio - licensed machinists in india
true to their reputation , the 100 or so classic scooters owned by vespa adventures break down frequently -- mechanics are on hand for running repairs -- but mueller believes its all part of the charm in a city where two wheels beats two legs
