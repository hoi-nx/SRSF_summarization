aldi is up to 30 per cent cheaper than the â big five â supermarkets despite the fact they have been cutting prices on shopping basket essentials
the budget chain continues to undercut the giants on everything from fruit and vegetables to eggs and pasta , an independent study found
aldi came out cheapest on a basket of 33 commonly bought items at a total of Â£ 42.15 , a saving of almost Â£ 8 compared to the Â£ 50.11 charged by asda
an new study has found that aldi , pictured , continues to undercut the big five supermarkets on everything from produce to eggs and pasta the german retailer was a remarkable Â£ 18 â 29.9 per cent â cheaper than sainsbury âs , which came in at Â£ 60.15 in the survey by the grocer magazine
the figures suggest that families could comfortably save more than Â£ 1,000 a year by switching to a budget supermarket
aldi âs sales are up 19.3 per cent on a year ago , giving it a market share of 5 per cent , which is almost on a par with waitrose
the growth of aldi and its rival lidl has triggered the greatest change in shopping habits since the 1950s when the large supermarkets first arrived to push aside independent traders
the mainstream stores , which have lost millions of customers , have responded by slashing prices on high profile items such as milk and bread , which is hurting their finances
such has been the impact of price cuts that it is now cheaper to feed a family than a year ago , and cpi inflation is expected to show britain is about to enter its first period of deflation since the 1960s
sainsbury âs said the figures in the study were skewed by the fact it covers only a small number of the many thousands of items it stocks
