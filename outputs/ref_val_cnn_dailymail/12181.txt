as expected , israeli prime minister netanyahu gave a rousing speech to u.s. congress , rich in historic imagery and replete with literary references
yet a speech filled with powerful words is no substitute for a strategy for actually preventing iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon
" the obama administration , on the other hand , is making a strong and credible case that the deal it is pursuing would block iran 's pathways to developing the fissile material necessary for a bomb and extend the time for iran to produce enough weapons - grade uranium to build a bomb from today 's estimated three months to at least a year
without a deal , iran would revert to building up its stockpile of nuclear uranium , while the international community would lose the ability to monitor and track iran 's activities
" if no deal that the u.s. and five other powers actually might strike with the iran would be acceptable to netanyahu , how does he propose to deal with the iran nuclear threat ? he spoke about ratcheting up international sanctions against iran and keeping them in place until iran ceased regional aggression , sponsorship of terrorism and threatens to annihilate israeli
it is doubtful that netanyahu really believes sanctions would end the iran nuclear program
of course , israeli could order a military strike on iran any time it chooses , but israeli 's ability to inflict significant damage on iran 's widely dispersed and heavily defended nuclear facilities is limited
when the discussion turns to military action , what is really meant is u.s. military action
it is understandable that a foreign leader speaking in the u.s. congress would shy away from openly asking washington to attack another country , especially after the experience of the 2003 invasion of iraq , which netanyahu also lobbied for
we should recall netanyahu 's september 2002 testimony to the house foreign affairs committee , six months before the u.s. assault on baghdad began , when he said : " it 's not a question of whether iraq 's regime should be taken out but when should it be taken out ; it 's not a question of whether you 'd like to see a regime change in iran but how to achieve it
that 's why he advocates policies that would put the u.s. on a path to military action without mentioning the words " military action
but words are no substitute for a strategy -- and that 's where netanyahu once again failed himself , his country and his audience .
