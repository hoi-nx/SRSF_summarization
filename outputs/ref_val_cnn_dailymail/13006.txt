cleveland 's mayor apologized monday for the city 's " poor use of words and our insensitivity " in the rice case
mayor jackson told reporters the city was apologizing to the rice family and the people of cleveland for the wording of a legal filing last week , which said the death of rice , a 12 - year - old who was shot by police in november , was the sixth - grader 's own fault
crump , an attorney for the rice family , said the mayor 's apology did n't go far enough
" i want him to apologize for the death of this 12 - year - old child , one of his citizens , at the hands of what we believe were police officers who were improperly trained
" cleveland police officer loehmann fired the fatal shots at rice in november within two seconds of arriving outside a recreation center where the 12 - year - old was playing with a pellet gun
" they never even gave him a chance , " rice 's mother , samaria rice , told cnn 's " erin burnett outfront
" cleveland authorities have repeatedly said that loehmann mistook rice 's fake gun for a real one
in its 41 - page response to the family 's lawsuit filed friday , the city says that rice 's injuries " were directly and proximately caused by the failure of plaintiffs ' decedent to exercise due care to avoid injury
