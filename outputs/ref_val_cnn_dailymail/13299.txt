witnessing alzheimer 's progress on the big screen is as terrifying as it is in real life
i know , because i 'm a child of alzheimer 's
but my family and i watched alzheimer 's erase that brain -- slowly , inexorably , completely
alzheimer 's still carries a stigma of the unknown -- even though today more than 5 million u.s. have it
every 67 seconds , another one of us develops alzheimer 's
women in their 60s are about twice as likely to develop alzheimer 's as breast cancer
with 10,000 baby boomers turning 65 every day , there will be 13.5 million of us with alzheimer 's by 2050
and many people do n't understand that alzheimer 's is n't a natural part of aging
alzheimer 's is a disease that kills
an oscar for " still alice " is shining the brightest light yet on alzheimer 's , but light is n't enough anymore
alzheimer 's is exerting a powerful impact on u.s. families -- on our health , our finances , and our futures
why women ? back in 2010 , when we published " the shriver report : a woman 's nation takes on alzheimer , " we reported that women were more than half the individuals diagnosed with alzheimer 's and nearly two - thirds of the unpaid caregivers of those who had it
today nearly two - thirds of those with alzheimer 's are women -- that 's more than 3.2 million women
and more than 60 % of caregivers for people with alzheimer 's and dementia are women , with many having to reduce their own workload or even drop out of the workforce altogether to care for loved ones
why is the incidence of alzheimer 's higher for women ? nobody knows
and why is it that women in their 60s are so much more likely to get alzheimer 's than breast cancer ? nobody knows
so wipe out alzheimer 's is stepping in
they 'll reach out to help and encourage women whose loved ones have alzheimer 's
they will be politically engaged and encourage political candidates who support increased funding for alzheimer 's research
wipe out alzheimer 's is creating a global community of women activists , agitators and agents of change to do just that
the race for the oscar may be over , but the race to wipe out alzheimer 's is on .
