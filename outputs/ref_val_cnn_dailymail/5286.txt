patients at a hospital a&e department are being forced to parade details of their conditions on laminated signs
they are assessed by staff when they arrive , then given a red card if their illness is serious or a green one for less urgent issues , with a two or three - word summary of their ailment
these are designed to speed up staff assessments as patients wait for treatment , but the trial scheme has been described as â insensitive â and like â a police line - up â
