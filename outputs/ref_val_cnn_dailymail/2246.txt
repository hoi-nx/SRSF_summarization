the battle for live streaming smartphone video heated up thursday as twitter launched its periscope application , taking on fast - rising online rival meerkat
the periscope app , like meerkat , allows anyone to stream live video to a wide audience with their smartphone
it comes as meerkat , a cult hit , unveiled a fresh round of capital investment
when meerkat first launched last month it imported a user 's twitter followers as well as showed who they were following
however , this was said to have annoyed twitter and the social network cut off meerkat 's access to this service
the new app ' lets you share and experience live video from your mobile phone ' and is ' a perfect complement to twitter , which is why we acquired the company in january , ' twitter 's kevin weil said in a blog post
' while there are many ways to discover events and places , we realized there is no better way to experience a place right now than through live video
earlier this month , as meerkat was becoming a craze at the south by southwest festival , twitter cut meerkat 's access to some features , which could limit its ability to grow
the same day , meerkat announced it had raised $ 14 million in venture funding , and founder rubin sounded unfazed by the twitter announcement
in a meerkat stream announcing the new funding , rubin called periscope ' a very slick product , a very beautiful product ' but that there was room for multiple players in live video
elman added that while other live video services had been available before , they did not take off because of a lack of network capacity and enough people using smartphones for video
it has a simple premise : press the stream button , point the phone 's camera at a scene and a link to stream is automatically tweeted from a connected account meerkat said in a blog post that the funding round participants also included comcast ventures , entree capital , raine ventures , sherpa , slow ventures , universal music group , ' and many awesome friends like ( actor ) jared leto , ( investor ) david tisch and ( youtube co-founder ) chad hurley
' we aspire to become the most comprehensive and most impactful participatory live streaming community , ' meerkat 's blog said
