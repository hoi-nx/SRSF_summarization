as relatives and friends mourn the loss of their loved ones aboard germanwings , the world community is stunned by the sequence of events that led to co-pilot andreas lubitz purposely crashing the plane into the french alps , killing all 150 people on board
i happen to have several personal connections to this tragedy : a recent graduate of drexel university -- where i teach -- and her mother were on the ill - fated flight , i lived in german for 18 years and i am a psychologist who has researched the psychology of terrorism and developed psychiatric tests that are used to determine pilot flight fitness
while the engineering of the airbus aircraft is fascinating and the world of air traffic control absorbing , what is even more complex and challenging to understand is the human mind of the co-pilot investigators say is responsible for the crash -- the machine that flies the machine
the u.s. navy has strict testing programs related to fitness for duty protocols for their pilots during the length of their careers
but we have learned that the german company lufthansa and its budget airline affiliate germanwings do not use psychological testing once the pilots have made it through the selection process
psychological assessment and screening is not held in as high esteem in german as it is in the united states
a fitness - for - duty evaluation asks this important question : can the pilot safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health and cognitive standpoint ? the deliberate destruction of germanwings by a single person , most likely related to some grievance or other unknown intrinsic motivation that he took to the grave , can also be considered an act of terrorism
when examining germanwings flight 9525 from the " cockpit of the human mind , " one must ask this question : how can we ever predict or prevent tragedies like these when we can never truly know what lurks in the mind of another human being ? as a psychologist , i would , of course , advocate for more rigorous psychological screening and regular testing for pilots , as well as instituting additional security measures to prevent future incidents like this
one thing is for sure : the tragic events of germanwings will surely renew conversation about what happened to flight mh370 -- the biggest aviation mystery since amelia earhart vanished in 1937 -- and the role that human factors may have played in its disappearance .
