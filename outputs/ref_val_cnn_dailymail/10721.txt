man city 's prospects of success in the champions league next season could be damaged after crashing out of the competition at the last - 16 stage in barcelona
city are borderline whether they are placed in either the second or third group of seeds for the 2015 - 16 group stages and risk a potential draw with barcelona and paris st germain , or bayern munich and atletico madrid , if they do n't improve their europe coefficient and drop into pot three
pellegrini 's men - who lost 1 - 0 in the nou camp on wednesday and 3 - 1 overall on aggregate - are currently ranked the 16th best team in europe but that could fall after they failed to make this season 's quarter - finals
a lionel messi - inspired barcelona edged out man city with a 1 - 0 win in the nou camp to end their euro dream man city could drop down into pot three after crashing out of the champions league vincent kompany and his man city team - mates could not overturn a 2 - 1 first - leg deficit real madrid , barcelona , bayern munich , chelsea , atletico madrid , benfica , schalke , arsenal , porto , manchester united , paris st germain , borussia dortmund , valencia , zenit st petersburg , bayer leverkusen and man city * liverpool are only ranked 40th so are guaranteed a tough draw if they finish in the top four
manchester united will be placed in pot two if they finish inside the top four despite last season 's poor campaign chelsea are ranked the fourth best side in europe - behind real madrid , barcelona and bayern munich the second pot will be made up of the next eight highest - ranked clubs â and man city ca n't be certain of that
this is how next season 's champions league group seedings would look if the season ended during the current stage of the campaign : top seeds : real madrid , barcelona , bayern munich , chelsea , lyon , benfica , zenit st petersburg and juventus second pot : atletico madrid ( ranked 5th ) , arsenal ( 8th ) , porto ( 9th ) , manchester united ( 10th ) , paris st germain ( 11th ) , valencia ( 13th ) , bayer leverkusen ( 15th ) and man city ( 16th ) city are particularly vulnerable because they could be replaced by schalke in the second pot if the german side , currently fifth in the bundesliga , finished in the top four
