hannah green 's 30th birthday is a day she will never forget but not for the reasons you might expect
at 20 weeks pregnant , it was also the day hannah green , now 31 , discovered her unborn daughter lola had a congenital heart disease and would need open heart surgery as soon as she was born
with no history of the condition in the family the unexpected news left hannah green and her partner gerard , 30 , from gosport , hampshire , devastated , and hannah green vowed to do everything she could to ensure her daughter had the best start in life
' hannah green and gerard 's baby had transposition of the great arteries , a rare heart defect in which the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed
the diagnosis meant that lola would need open heart surgery to switch the arteries back to their correct position as soon as she was born
lola had open heart surgery when she was just ten days old in an eight - hour operation to swap arteries lola with proud parents hannah green and dad gerard , a tattoo artist ' it 's so easy to take it for granted when you have a healthy baby
' so when hannah green attended london 's baby show in february 2014 and came across stem cell banking company precious cells , she realised the procedure could prove priceless
stem cells are found in the cord blood that remains in the placenta and umbilical cord , which are usually thrown away , after a baby is born
the stem cells are an exact dna match to the baby and can help cure many life threatening diseases , such as leukaemia and sickle cell disease
hannah green said : ' we were going to look for a crib and a pram and came away with information about stem cell banking
' hannah green feels comforted by knowing her daughter 's precious stem cells will be there for her until she 's 30 the family poses for a snap , with lola , who wears a pacemaker to regulate her heart , grinning at the camera ' there are so many different things that can be done with stem cells
' but with a price tag of more than Â£ 2,000 the procedure was way out of hannah green and tattoo artist gerard 's price range
the couple were given a box containing a special bag in which the cord blood could be stored , and the number of a phlebotomist who would come to the hospital and harvest the blood as soon as lola was delivered
but because lola 's heart rate kept dropping she was born by emergency caesarean at princess anne hospital in southampton after a 36 - hour labour , weighing a healthy 7lb 2oz
' hannah green says of lola : ' we do n't know what the future holds for us and the stem cells could help her heart condition in the future ' hannah green had her daughter 's stem cells harvested through precious cells the courier arrived within hours of lola 's birth to collect the stem cells , which have now been cryogenically frozen by precious cells at their bio bank in london for 30 years
' we do n't know what the future holds for us and the stem cells could help her heart condition in the future
' ' sometimes i forget we have the stem cells banked , and then i remember and feel relief
