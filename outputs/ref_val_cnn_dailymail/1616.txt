fans of chelsea , blackburn and wigan may be shocked to learn that unheralded striker franco di santo is currently one of the hottest properties in germany 's bundesliga with werder bremen where he has scored 12 goals in his last 18 matches
even more surprising is the argentine 's views on the respective merits of the two leagues
contrary to popular belief , the 25 - year - old insists players in germany are made to train harder than their premier league counterparts and that games are more intense and competitive in the bundesliga
a few months ago , di santo 's opinions might have been ridiculed but given the dismal performances of english clubs in europe this season , it appears he may have a point
franco di santo is loving life in the bundesliga with werder bremen after stints with three english clubs the argentine striker moved to english with chelsea but also played for blackburn and wigan following chelsea 's exit against paris saint-germain , it is unlikely any premier league will be in the quarter - finals of the champions league , with manchester city and arsenal both losing their first leg matches at home
in contrast , bayern munich are safely through to the last eight with borussia dortmund and bayer leverkusen having a great chance of joining them from the bundesliga next week
' when i came to germany , i thought it would be a little bit less intense than the premier league , ' admitted franco di santo , who signed for werder bremen on a bosman free following wigan 's relegation in 2013
in the english league , you have time to turn around and go against the defender face - to - face , but here it is always pressure , pressure , pressure
di santo says he thought it would be a little bit less intense than the premier league but he was surprised di santo says that after a career as a young player in the premier league he finds the bundesliga as intense ' the other thing that is different is the kind of training
here i feel good , so maybe for my body it is better to train ! ' the reputation of the premier league has taken a nose - dive recently but di santo is not surprised our top clubs are n't able to dominate in the champions league and suggests there may be a snob value towards the bundesliga because of the dominance of bayern munich
the 6ft 4in centre forward has 12 goals in his last 18 games as werder bremen rise up the bundesliga table ' i think germany and english have the strongest two leagues but the big difference is the marketing
' of course , bayern munich is by far the best team in germany but it 's not because the other teams are s * * * , it is just because they very strong
' if bayern munich came into the premier league , they would finish top - three for sure and they could win it , why not ? they have world cup winners and players like ( arjen ) arjen robben , ( robert ) lewandowski and ( franck ) ribery
di santo , modestly for his league , believes bayern munich would be in the premier league 's top three the big striker took on chelsea and their midfield giant nemanja matic in pre-season
werder bremen won 3 - 1 ' just because some of the other teams in germany are n't big names , it does n't mean they 're not good
ok , it was pre-season but chelsea put out a good team and it was n't like they were able to score 10 against us
' the presence of didier drogba ( left ) , who is still di santo 's friend , made it difficult for him to get game time di santo ( right ) says his loan to blackburn went well at first but then he was dropped by sam allardyce franco di santo has hailed his argentine international team - mate angel di maria as one of the top 10 players in the world
di maria has struggled in english , as di santo did , following a record Â£ 59.7million summer move to manchester united
but i did get a goal and assist in our local derby against burnley and they made a dvd of the match with my face on the cover ! ' ironically , it was roberto martinez â now in charge of english 's sole europa league survivors everton â who helped start to turn his career around by signing him for wigan on a permanent basis in 2010
' wigan won the fa cup â di santo was an unused substitute - and were relegated in the same season , and roberto martinez left for everton
' there is no problem with that , it would have been difficult to sign so many players from wigan , ' says the player
blackburn fans mob di santo after he scored against burnley and it even earned him a space on a dvd cover wigan lifted the fa cup at wembley before being relegated , although di santo did n't play a single minute instead , the forward â who won three caps for argentina during his time at the dw stadium â went to werder bremen in northern germany and is finally fulfilling the promise everyone predicted in his teens
unfortunately a booking also means he is suspended for saturday 's big match against bayern munich
he still keeps in touch with old chelsea pals like didier drogba and branislav ivanovic and friends from wigan like alcaraz and maynor figueroa
wigan owner dave whelan gets a champagne shower from di santo , but they would soon part company while di santo is enjoying the bundesliga , he says he fancies a shot at ' revenge ' in the premier league ' i am happy here really , i know i am in a league that is very competitive , one of the best in the world , ' he said
' di santo still has friends in english from his time there and keeps contact with a few chelsea players di santo faced top players in english but says germany 's lack of big names does n't make teams 's * * * '
