a group of avant-garde light designers in melbourne are about to take an apartment tower and transform it into a beautiful canvas that can tell you more about the weather than looking up at the sky
bruce ramus , creative director of the project , said every half hour the building will communicate the next day 's weather forecast , while during the remaining time it will be like a ' light house ' communicating the ' feel ' of the weather through light
after spending eight years living in melbourne mr bruce ramus said he noticed melburnians had a peculiar obsession with the weather and thought it could be possible to ' bring light to a community ' in a way that articulates what it actually feels like to be there
' there 's a lot of movement available to this lighting system so if it ever gets windy down in the docklands , the lights will move directionally with the wind
every half hour , tomorrows weather forecast will wrap around the building ' the movement isnt physical but the way we can program the lights means there will be a sense of gentle but apparent movement , ' he said
do n't expect the building to look like the weather forecast app on your phone though as mr bruce ramus wants the building to echo more than the temperature
' it 's not necessarily about what the light does but how it makes you feel
visionary : mr bruce ramus wants architecture to reflect nature and humanity instead of the static concrete jungle we see today mr bruce ramus said light is a language everyone can understand because we do n't understand it through our brains , but instead feel and understand it through our bodies
