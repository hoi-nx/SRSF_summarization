the paint - like swirls depict global water - surface temperatures around the world , with the surface texture driven by the rotation of the earth
using data from various climate models , trapped regions of warmer water , shown in red , are seen adjacent to the gulf stream off the eastern coast of the us the paint - like swirls of this visualisation depict global water - surface temperatures
trapped regions of warmer water adjacent to the gulf stream off the eastern coast of the us indicate the model âs capability to simulate eddy transport of heat within the ocean , a key component necessary to accurately simulate global climate change the model , by the lanl , is used to simulate eddy transportation of heat within the ocean , a key component necessary to accurately simulate climate change
global ocean surface kinetic - or movement - energy is pictured here
observe the prominent jet stream off the eastern coast of the us with adjacent eddy rings the world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change , scientists have warned
the analysis was based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world scientists recently announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central pacific and have started to alter wind patterns
the illustration shows the prominent jet stream off the eastern coast of the us with adjacent eddy rings
when winds blow across the ocean , kinetic energy is transferred from the wind to water as a result of the friction between the wind and the sea surface
