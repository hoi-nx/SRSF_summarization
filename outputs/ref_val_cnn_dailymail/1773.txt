president obama is alleged to have stopped an israeli military attack against iran 's nuclear facilities in 2014 by threatening to shoot down israeli jets before they could reach their targets , according to reports to emerge from the middle east at the weekend the threat from the u.s. forced prime minister netanyahu to abort a planned attack on iraq , reported kuwaiti newspaper al-jarida
netanyahu will be in washington for an address to congress on tuesday aimed squarely at derailing obama 's cherished bid for a diplomatic deal with tehran
the netanyahu government took the decision to strike iran last year after discovering that the u.s. and iran were involved in secret talks over iran 's nuclear program and were about to sign an agreement in that regard behind israeli 's back
the report claimed that an unnamed israeli minister who has good ties with the u.s. administration revealed the attack plan to secretary of state kerry , and that obama then threatened to shoot down the israeli jets before they could reach their targets in iran
according to the report , ' netanyahu and his commanders agreed after four nights of deliberations to task the israeli army 's chief of staff , gantz , to prepare a qualitative operation against iran 's nuclear program
' in addition , netanyahu and his ministers decided to do whatever they could do to thwart a possible agreement between iran and the white house because such an agreement is , allegedly , a threat to israeli 's security
' for six years , president obama and netanyahu have been on a collision course over how to halt iran 's nuclear ambitions , a high - stakes endeavor both men see as a centerpiece of their legacies the sources added that gantz and his commanders prepared the requested plan and that israeli fighter jets trained for several weeks in order to make sure the plans would work successfully
israeli fighter jets reportedly even carried out experimental flights in iran 's airspace after they managed to break through radars
stopping iran from building a nuclear bomb has become a defining challenge for both obama and netanyahu , yet one they have approached far differently
prime minister netanyahu was forced to abort a planned attack on iraq after the u.s. threatened to shoot down israeli jets ' through scaremongering , falsification , propaganda and creating a false atmosphere even inside other countries , ( israeli ) is attempting to prevent peace , ' iran 's top nuclear negotiator said on saturday in tehran
u.s. and iran officials reported progress in the latest talks on a deal that would freeze tehran 's nuclear program for 10 years , but allow it to slowly ramp up in the final years of the accord
the obama administration will be represented at the event by united nations ambassador samantha power and national security adviser susan rice , who criticized netanyahu 's plans to address congress as ' destructive ' to the u.s. - israeli relationship
activists rally and protest outside fox news building on 6th ave and 48th st to protest the visit of israeli prime minister netanyahu , who is scheduled to address congress on tuesday within months of taking office , obama irritated israeli when , in an address to the arab world , he challenged the legitimacy of jewish settlements on palestinian - claimed land and cited the holocaust as the justification for israeli 's existence , not any historical jewish tie to the land
the white house was furious when netanyahu 's government defied obama and announced plans to construct new housing units in east jerusalem while biden was visiting israeli in 2010
the settlement issue has been a persistent thorn in relations , compounded by profound unhappiness in washington over israeli military operations in the sinai , iraq and lebanon during the ford , reagan and george h.w. bush administrations that led those presidents to take or consider direct punitive measures
