food poisoning affects one in six us every year caused by rotting meat and vegetables , dirty water and unhygienic kitchens
researchers claim that tiny nano - sized droplets of electrically charged water filled with free radicals could be sprayed onto food to kill pathogens lurking on the surface
researchers claim that tiny nano - sized droplets of electrically charged water filled with free radicals , could be sprayed onto fruit and vegetables , to kill pathogens lurking on the surface ( illustrated ) scientists at harvard university in cambridge , massachusetts believe that with more research , droplets called engineered water nanostructures ( ewns ) could replace current methods used to disinfect food , such as applying mild solutions of bleaches and chlorine
â depending on how long fruit and vegetables were exposed to the spray of nanoparticles , lab tests showed that between 80 and 98 per cent of bacteria were destroyed
but in the electrospray , a thin layer of charged water captures the radicals and stabilises them
to test the efficiency of process , three strains of bacteria known to cause illness - e. coli , salmonella and listeria - were applied to tomatoes and stainless steel surfaces
