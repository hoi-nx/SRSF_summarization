but a top researcher says we 've been giving ourselves too much credit - because we were helped by our oldest friends
humans paired up with dogs as early as 40,000 bc , it is claimed , giving us such an advantage in hunting that it prompted the wipeout of our neanderthal rivals
a new theory claims humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than was first thought left behind : while early humans hunted with wolves , their neanderthal rivals in europe continued using primitive tools without any help , according to anthropologist dr pat shipman ( artist 's impression ) the controversial theory has been put forward in a new book by leading anthropologist pat shipman of pennsylvania state university
no match : the theory claims neanderthal ( model pictured ) were no match for the hunting technique instead , she said , humans began taming and breeding wolves - leading to the pets we know today - soon after they arrived on the continent from africa up to 70,000 years ago
dr pat shipman , however , told the observer : ' we formed an alliance with the wolf and that would have been the end for the neanderthal
' this meant the dogs did not need to approach these large cornered animals to finish them off â often the most dangerous part of a hunt â while humans did nât have to expend energy in tracking and wearing down prey
' dr pat shipman 's theory , shared in her book the invaders : how humans and their dogs drove neanderthals to extinction , was partly inspired by early dog remains
neanderthals look similar to modern humans but were a distinct species with genetic differences she examined 33,000 - year - old fossils of dogs found in siberia and belgium , and looked at how the shapes of their jaws and skulls were different from wild wolves
last year a study at the university of tã¼bingen in germany claimed early humans emigrated from africa far earlier than we first thought - and as many as 130,000 years ago
