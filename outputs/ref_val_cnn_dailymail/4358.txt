when arsene wenger sent coquelin on loan to charlton in november it looked to be the final nail in the frenchman 's arsenal career
arsenal midfielder coquelin ( right ) controls the ball during his side 's win against queens park rangers the frenchman wore a protective mask at loftus road after fracturing his nose against everton coquelin , pictured challenging sandro , has become the gunners ' midfield enforcer in recent months but a spate of injuries in midfield saw arsene wenger recall coquelin in december
he 's grasped his chance to become a key member of arsenal 's midfield with both hands , despite his reluctance to return to arsenal from charlton fearing he 'd simply be warming the bench
just weeks after his arsenal career looked to be drawing to a close , coquelin is on the verge of agreeing a new long - term contract to stay at the emirates stadium
arsene wenger would like to say coquelin 's emergence has been pre-planned ; a managerial masterstroke that has helped arsenal turn their stuttering league form around
coquelin played five games on loan at charlton this season but has returned to be a first team regular coquelin 's stint in the first team has earned him a new long - term contract with the gunners the frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot mathieu flamini in the pecking order following three substitute appearances after his return from the valley , coquelin was handed a rare start against west ham on december 28 in place of the injured mathieu flamini
he 's waited so long to prove himself in an arsenal shirt , coquelin 's wo n't let a broken nose keep him on the sidelines now
gunners boss arsene wenger admitted that he was willing to let coquelin leave the club before his return arsene wenger is still interested in saints 's defensive midfielder schneiderlin ( left ) coquelin , pictured in training , still needs to convince arsene wenger that he can play for arsenal long - term the big question is whether coquelin is the long - term answer to arsene wenger 's holding midfielder conundrum
schneiderlin , for the time being , is favourite to land the role provided arsenal can strike a deal with saints , who will want at least Â£ 25milliom
that would leave coquelin 's regular place in arsene wenger 's team selections under threat
