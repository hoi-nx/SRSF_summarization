white - water rafting had been on my bucket list for years but to do it with ben in the middle of the amazon is a moment i will never forget
â you can just imagine a teraductile flying overhead , â ben quipped
trip of a lifetime : i was lucky to join adventurer ben on a tour of ecuador satey briefing : ben watches on as our white - water rafting guide gabriel gives us the lowdown setting sail on our amazon adventure : ben and i , on the right of the boat , receive instructions from our guide i was invited to accompany 40 - year - old ben on a trip to the country where his life of adventure and travel all started
ecuador has long - been associated as a gateway to the much more popular galapagos islands or simply a pit stop on a tour of south american
ben âs first trip as an 19 - year - old , unable to speak a word of spanish , saw him spend a sobering night in a quito prison cell and endure 15 rabies injections in his stomach after getting bitten by a dog
however the incidents did little to phase ben as he says it was that trip that he decided he wanted to make a career out of travel
â i never believed i would do it , â says ben , husband to marina and father to ludo and iona
i was also bitten by a dog and had to have loads of painful rabies injections in my stomach ! ' the changes : ' ecuador has changed unimaginably since i first came here
â it was a place on bbc reality show castaway in 2000 that propelled ben into the spotlight
for the last 18 months he 's also become a worldwide touring ambassador for virgin holidays and using his vast experience he helped curate the itinerary for this trip
he 's packed a lot into his 40 - years but tearing down cotopaxi volcano on a mountain bike was a first for us both
the current owner , glamorous mignon plaza , inherited the property from her grandfather , leonidas plaza , two - time president of ecuador
food for thought : cow hooves and roasted guinea pig are popular local dishes in ecuador llama selfie : i grabbed one of the friendly animals for a quick photograph llamas roamed around the hotel âs beautiful cobbled courtyard so i grabbed one for a selfie
160 years in the making : the stunning la compania de jesus church was painted in gold leaf by hand bizarre medical practice : ben gets his torso whipped by seã±ora rosa in san francisco market i also witnessed bizarre scenes at the nearby san francisco market where local healers whip willing punters with stinging nettles to raise energy levels
ben took the plunge , stripping down to his underpants in between displays of meats from cow hooves to llama and paying $ 10 for the privilege
â flying the flag : ecuador 's national colours are seen above the government palace in quito 's plaza grande perfectly maintained : the beautiful plaza grande in quito is a place for locals and tourists to relax we also dropped in more unique local businesses including the famous sweet shop las colaciones de la cruz where we tried our hand at sugar - coating peanuts in a wooden bowl over a hot fire
carrion âs restorations is a bizarre business which restores baby jesus dolls while also doubling up as a facility to treat people with skin conditions
jesus dolls are traditionally kept in the lounge of all of the catholic households in ecuador
after spending time in quito we visited guamote âs local market where thousands of indigenous people , dressed in traditional ponchos and hats and accompanied by pigs and llamas on leads , descend every thursday
previously faced with tarantula and rattle - snake , animal lover ben admits this typical andes cuisine still mystifies him
â locro ( potato soup ) , ceviche and a meat selection dinner , served on a hot volcanic rock which you then use to bbq the food yourself , are other popular dishes we experienced on our journey , mixed down with a canelazo , a traditional ecuador drink of warm spiced cinnamon mixed with tequila
cow foetus is also a delicacy in ecuador but we steered clear of that
each mealtime we quizzed ben on his adventures and can report he is much more fun that i had imagined , even trying to help one young man in our party score a date on tinder
local life : locals in traditional ponchos and hats descend every thursday to guamote market devil 's nose train : the route , which costs Â£ 15 per person , offers beautiful views of the andes our tour also included an 800 - metre descent on the devil 's nose train , which zig zags down the spectacular mountainside on the route between quito and guayaquil and a trip to the lush hot springs in termas papallacta heated from nearby coxopaxi
due to a mix up with collection points after our rafting experience , myself , the virgin holidays and two fellow journalists found ourselves stranded along the edge of the jatunyacu river
impressive : huge bridge which crosses the jatunyacu river had a jurassic park vibe out of this world : ben and i check out the jatunyacu river before we go white - water rafting amazon life : carly reed , our lovely virgin holiday pr , and i meet the locals quito casa gangotena hotel riobamba la andaluza hotel banos samari spa resort papallacta termas papallacta activities arranged by metropolitan touring the 11 - day andes to the amazon tour with virgin holidays is available from Â£ 3645pp
for more details visit virgin holidays with no shoes , phone , water or sun cream , we used our broken spanish to mingle with locals and have a beer
ben , who had earlier dashed off to eat whittchety grubs at a local amazon community during the incident ( as you do ) , told us such moments are what adventuring is all about
