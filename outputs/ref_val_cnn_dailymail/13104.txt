tikrit , iraqi two men in blue smocks were mopping up blood spilled in the main entrance to the dijla hospital south of tikrit when we arrived there mid-morning friday
the air shook with outgoing rockets and artillery roaring toward the center of the city
we were escorted by men from the badr organisation , the biggest and best - organized iranian - backed force fighting isis
as we got out of our car , a man wearing a vest with the emblem of the iraqi red crescent beckoned urgently to video journalist mary to come inside
he led her to a gurney surrounded by four or five men , some wearing blue disposable surgical gowns , others in dark green military fatigues
they were huddled over a man naked to the waist , a thick plastic tube inserted in his side , red with blood , leading to a bottle filling up with more blood
the wounded man -- no one knew his name -- had been shot in the head , the chest and the leg
the head doctor , in dark green combat fatigues , told me the man was in critical condition
all the while , the windows of the building shook from the concussion of the bombardment of central tikrit
from the sound , it was clear that artillery and rocket launchers were nearby
several other wounded fighters were in the entrance , but their condition was much less grave
one , who identified himself as sadiq , had been shot in the upper thigh , but was fully conscious
he told producer kareem he had been shot in central tikrit that morning , recalling at the time he was uncertain whether it was shrapnel or a bullet because the fighting was so intense
while mary and kareem were doing that interview , i walked around the hospital to see if there was anything else that might help us put together a report
it was a ramshackle place , it looked like much of the facility had been in a state of neglect for a while , perhaps because until recently it was in no - man 's land
the same critically wounded man was wheeled into a side room
" this was a last , desperate attempt to stop this unknown man from dying
i heard a commotion behind me , and the doctor i had spoken to before passed me , shouting , " grab all the cameras ! get the cameras ! " " what 's the problem ? " i asked him
right next to me a tall man with a military shirt over running pants raised his rifle , about to shoot in the air
it 's a separate group , and clearly al-kadhimi , who was treated with deference by his own men , did n't enjoy the same esteem here
mary discreetly pulled out the data card with the footage she had just shot and replaced it with an empty one
it 's an old trick that sometimes works in situations like these
the armed men wanted the sequence of the dying fighter deleted , and were n't going to take " no " for an answer
eventually , kareem said we should delete the sequence of the dying man , after our iraqi security guard had said we needed to do just that -- otherwise , we were in trouble
a media - savvy member of the soldiers of the imam brigade insisted we were hiding the card with the footage
" they do n't know how to delete the pictures of the dying man , " he said
so mary went with him inside the hospital to delete the footage of the dying man
to cut a long , tense story short , mary did n't delete the footage
someone else did , all the footage from the hospital
he , and we , were reminded that with all the different armed groups fighting on the tikrit front , there might be unity against isis , but that 's about where it ends .
