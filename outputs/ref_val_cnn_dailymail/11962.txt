the banks of the dead sea are under threat from soaring numbers of sinkholes that are appearing as the salt lake dries up , an environmental group has warned
ecopeace middle east estimates that there are more than 3,000 sinkholes now along the banks of the salt lake , which is bordered by israel and jordan
water evaporation from the lake - which is occurring at nearly four feet per year - drawing freshwater into the pockets of salt left behind by the lake
environmental groups report that there are now more than 3,000 sinkholes , shown above filled with water , along the banks of the main body of the dead sea , caused by the loss of water from the giant salt lake as the salt dissolves in the fresh water , it causes the earth above it to collapse
but the salt lake 's water elves have fallen from 394 metres below sea level in the 1960s to about 423 meters below sea level at the end of 2012
the water level continues to drop at an alarming pace of 0.8 to 1.2 meters per year
speaking to abc news , mr bromberg said : ' these sink holes are a direct result of the inappropriate mismanagement of water resources in the region
sink holes like this one at mineral beach beside the dead sea on the west bank are becoming more common these sinkholes appeared in the fields in south east corner of the dead sea near to the lisan peninsula it has historically been maintained by a flow of fresh water from rivers and streams that have equaled the water is loses to evaporation in the scorching heat - about 160 billion gallons a year
the dead sea is an inland lake that sits on the border between israel and jordan , as shown in the map above the salt formations , seen in the aerial view above , are left behind as the mineral rich water evaporates away this sink hole beside the dead sea , caused by collapsing alt deposits left by the lake , has filled with water
