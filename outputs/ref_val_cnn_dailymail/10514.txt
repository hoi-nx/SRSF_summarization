a brief guide to the sound of music by paul simpson for years i âd thought it was vera lynn âs we âll meet again they planned to broadcast when the atomic bombs fell , but according to paul simpson , in this essential guide to the iconic film , when a nuclear strike is imminent , the bbc intends filling the airwaves with songs from the sound of music
nevertheless the remaining powers - that - be sincerely hope to â maintain some semblance of normality â by exposing us to the ever - optimistic von trapps
the sound of music could have been very different if the osmonds had claimed a place in the film i always hid under the seat when the nazis prowled around the convent , and to this day i have nât seen the bit where the nuns sabotage the cars
it was a film that appealed to women who had domineering husbands â all those glowering captain von trapp sorts who expected their dinner to be on the table
the first surprise in simpson âs book is that the story begins in england
the von trapps were descended from whitehead , an engineer born in bolton in 1823
whitehead âs granddaughter , agatha , met captain georg when he was visiting the factory looking at torpedoes
julie andrews ( centre ) is pictured in 1965 on the set of the sound of music with her on - screen step - children they were married in 1911 and had seven children
agatha died of scarlet fever in 1922 , and georg moved as a widower to salzburg
exactly as in the film , she was a tomboyish postulant , always having to be rebuked for sliding down banisters , climbing on the roof , jumping over chimneys , and grabbing the other nuns to tickle their ribs
georg was entranced , and he married his new nanny in 1927
like christopher plummer , georg peeped on a bosun âs whistle to call the children to order , and he accompanied them on a guitar when they had a singing session
after they âd sung a selection of medieval church music at the salzburg festival in 1936 , the von trapps were invited abroad on tours
the five eldest osmonds ( pictured in 1972 ) are said to have begged to be able to play the von trapp children in the famous film according to hollywood , however , the von trapps crept from the concert hall , hid behind the nonnberg tombs , and climbed every mountain to freedom carrying heavy instrument cases
in fact , had julie andrews , christopher plummer and the children kept going on the route they âd chosen , they âd have soon arrived on the terrace in hitler âs berchtesgaden.that part of austrian borders bavaria , not switzerland
the original maria was diddled by agents and managers , who persuaded her to sell them the global rights to her story in perpetuity for a paltry flat fee of $ 10,000 , so neither she nor the family made a further penny cent from any of the adaptations
rex harrison , bing crosby and yul brynner turned down the role of captain von trapp , believing the man to be â very much a cardboard figure , humourless and one - dimensional â
audrey hepburn ( left ) is said to have turned down the role of maria , while bing crosby ( right ) rejected the part of captain von trapp , believing it to be ' a cardboard figure ' noel coward rejected the part of max , the impresario â a shame
by contrast , the five eldest osmonds begged to play the von trapp children
regarding the authentic von trapps , incidentally , they stopped singing professionally in 1956 and settled in vermont , where they ran a hotel that burned down in 1980
maria died in 1987 , georg having long predeceased her , in 1947
life was never as rosy as in the film : one of the children had electroconvulsive shock treatment for depression , another married a canadian , and others became dairy farmers
julie andrews ( left ) and christopher plummer ( right ) won the two top roles in the famous film , playing maria and captain von trapp respectively the julie andrews film is the third highest grossing movie in history , behind gone with the wind and star wars
the only place where it has never caught on , ironically , is austrian , where captain von trapp is considered a deserter , which he was if you think about it
the von trapp villa became himmler âs headquarters during the war
