the a&e four - hour waiting target will be missed for the whole of 2014/15 , the department of health today said
repeated failure to achieve the target of 95 per cent of patients waiting four hours or less at a&e departments in england means it is no longer possible for the nhs to meet the standard for the year
the latest figures , for the week ending march 8 , show the gold standard was missed for the 23rd week running
it comes as a report warns even top performing hospitals are showing signs of buckling under the immense pressures faced by the nhs
' warning signs are flashing ' across hospitals with experts advising the government there is ' no quick fix ' to the troubles plaguing the health service
the department of health today said the four - hour a&e waiting time will be missed for the whole of 2014/15 after the latest weekly figures showed the target was not achieved for the 23rd consecutive week today england revealed 92 per cent of patients spent four hours or less from arrival to being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital
it came in spite of higher numbers of patients attending emergency departments , with 434,800 patients visiting a&e - up by more than 8,000 from the previous week and a four - week high
a department of health spokeswoman said : ' we know the nhs is busier than ever before and despite missing the a&e standard for the year , over nine out of ten patients are being seen , treated and discharged within four hours
' meanwhile a new report by the nuffield trust suggests the problems facing the nhs go far deeper into hospitals than just the front door at a&e
patients arriving at a&e have often had to wait longer than the four - hour target , according to the nuffield trust 's analysis of how all 156 hospitals trusts in england have performed against six national targets over the course of the coalition government
it comes as a report warns even top performing hospitals are showing signs of buckling under the immense pressures faced by the nhs
it found the majority of hospitals breached a target on at least one of the six measures - most notably the a&e waiting time , the 18 - week target for a hospital bed , and the six - week target for scans and other diagnostic tests
co-author holly dorning , said : ' the vast majority of patients are still receiving care within the target times , but our analysis shows that deteriorating access to services is starting to affect patients attending even the best - performing hospitals
' we 've known that hospitals have been struggling to meet the four - hour a&e target for a while
95 per cent â the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in a&e before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital
92 per cent â average performance against the four - hour target by major a&e departments in 2014
the report adds : ' failure to meet , for example , the four - hour a&e target appears to have very little bearing on performance against other measures
' a department of health spokeswoman said : ' we know the nhs is busier than ever and despite missing the a&e target for the year , over nine out of 10 patients are being seen , treated and discharged within four hours
' responding to the latest a&e figures , sarah pinto-duschinsky , director of operations and delivery for england , said : ' this winter nhs staff in england pulled out all the stops and , compared with last year , provided care for an incredible 190,000 more people coming to a&e and 51,000 more being admitted to hospital as an emergency
' these record numbers - up by between six and nine per cent some weeks - mean that although the nhs wo n't have met the a&e average 95 per cent target for the full year , staff continued even during this busiest winter ever to treat more than nine in ten people within four hours
