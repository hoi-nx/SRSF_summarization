eating nuts and peanuts reduces the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke , a new study claims
and they believe their findings suggest peanuts may be a cost - effective measure to improve cardiovascular health because they are so cheap
however experts cautioned today that salt - covered nuts would not have the same health benefits
catherine collins , principal dietitian at st george 's hospital nhs trust , said : ' research over the past few years has shown heart - health benefits of including nuts and legumes ( like peanuts ) as part of a varied diet
studies where nuts have been added to the diet ( such as the european predimed study ) , and long - term population studies have consistently shown a reduction in death from heart disease when nuts and legumes are included in the diet
this was regardless of gender , race , bmi , smoking , alcohol consumption and conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity
nuts reduced the risk of death regardless of gender , race , bmi , smoking , alcohol consumption and conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity ' but who cares if they help us to live longer at an affordable price ? ' however experts have cautioned that people should not start eating ' large quantities ' of nuts and peanuts in light of the research
commenting on the findings , professor peter weissberg , medical director at the british heart foundation , said : ' this large study found that death rates from heart attacks were lower in people who eat nuts , particularly peanuts , than in those who do n't
' however , the data do not show that the more peanuts you eat the lower the risk of a fatal heart attack , so people should not start eating large quantities of nuts , particularly salted nuts , in the hope that it will protect them from heart disease
