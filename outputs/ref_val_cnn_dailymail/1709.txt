she 's a great - grandmother and 102 years old but that does n't stop margaret working out five days a week
margaret , 102 , could very well be australia 's fittest great grandmother after she completed 102 squats on her birthday this year she 's a great - grandmother but that does n't stop margaret working out five days a week incredibly margaret was never keen on exercise in her youth - the only thing she did to keep fit was walking - but that all changed when she reached her 90s and broke her pelvis and while some may like to take it easy on their birthday , margaret decided to complete her most impressive feat yet in celebration of her special day earlier this year
â last year my physio john said i 'm going to get you to do 102 squats for your birthday , i said ' you have to be joking ' , â margaret told the daily mail australia
â physio john abd-mariam has been working with margaret , a mother of four daughters , for a number of years , and when they first met the 102 - year - old was not nearly as fit as she is now
one of her four daughters suzanne said her mother was never really into exercise when she was younger but she did enjoy riding horses in her leisure time - pictured here on horseback with her husband colin margaret initially took a bit of persuading to start exercising but once she started she did n't look back â initially we worked on basic standing balance exercises
a few years earlier margaret had broken her pelvis in three places , at the age of 93 , and needed to be rehabilitated after that
her daughter , suzane , said the improvement in her mother in recent years has been phenomenal her transformation is incredible as margaret had broken her pelvis in three places when she was 93 and needed rehabilitation from there john continued to encourage margaret to keep getting better
and in january 31 this year she completed over 102 squats â and all in the name of charity
â it was in late december last year that i initially suggested to margaret that she should do one squat for every year of her life ' , â john said
the 102 - year - old has always loved being outdoors - especially with horses margaret 's fitness involves some singing , balance activities , weights , and a little bit of cardio ' she 's still very well mentally , she is very interested in politics and current affairs
' a few months on margaret now has some tough competition as her friend pauline sciberras , who is nearly 92 , has also joined in exercising with her , and is getting very good at her squats
' the exercise is making a big difference for margaret not only physically but also mentally who turned 102 on january 31 margaret was given a silver medal from the president of ireland , her home country , on her birthday the gym and exercise classes at the thomas holt sans souci gardens aged care facility where margaret lives have proved very popular â i love it ! ' pauline sciberras told the daily mail australia with great enthusiasm
â the women also revealed that since john has been running classes for the residents , which involve some singing , balance activities , weights , and a little bit of cardio , more and more people have been joining in
in margaret 's honour one of the sea turtles recently rescued in the area - believed to be over 80 years old - was named after her
