the new advert for taco bell 's ' biscuit taco ' shows a man waking up to be told by his tv that ' happiness is the same breakfast ' the two and a half minute tv ad then shows people lining up behind each other while waiting to be given breakfast when they get to the front of the queue , they are then given egg mcmuffin - type sandwiches , while looking bored and miserable the two and a half minute tv ad shows a man waking up and being told repeatedly that ' happiness is the same breakfast '
the ad also features a dictator - type character , whose make - up and clothes seem to resemble ronald mcdoanld the new ad is similar to a campaign last year that featured real - life people named ronald mcdonald professing their love for taco bell offerings after running through the streets , they climb through a hole in the wall and reach a castle , where they are given a biscuit taco
in addition taco bell is running a poster campaign in new york and los angeles , with one featuring a demonic looking clown holding what looks like an egg mcmuffin with the words ' routine rules ' a man and a woman in the queue then decide to break free and run to the edge of the city where they climb through a hole in the wall the ad then finishes with the couple being handed a biscuit taco with the website breakfastdefectors.com flashing up on the screen one of the new posters , which are being put up across new york and los angeles promoting taco bell it is a continuation of an ad campaign last year that featured real - life people named ronald mcdonald professing their love for taco bell offerings
