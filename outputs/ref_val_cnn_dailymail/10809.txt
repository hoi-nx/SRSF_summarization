the lib dem were accused last night of using public money to garner votes after it emerged that more than 80 per cent of places to benefit from a new fuel subsidy will be in their own seats
treasury chief secretary alexander said 17 rural areas would benefit from a 5p a litre cut in fuel duty after a scheme â funded by the british taxpayer â was signed off by the european commission
but 14 are in lib dem seats , including two in mr alexander âs own constituency in the scottish highlands
labour suggested there should be an inquiry into so - called â pork barrel politics â by the lib dem , who also boast of channelling cash for roads and schools to their own seats
mr alexander , mp for inverness , nairn , badenoch and strathspey , has faced repeated claims that he is shoring up votes in his seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere
at the pumps : treasury chief secretary alexander said 17 rural areas would benefit from a 5p a litre cut in fuel duty after a scheme â funded by the british taxpayer â was signed off by the european commission mr leslie said : â while i âm sure there are many living in rural areas who would love a fuel duty cut , it seems more than a coincidence that this is largely restricted to alexander âs backyard and those of his small band of lib dem colleagues
â nine areas benefiting from the new â rural fuel rebate â are in the ross , skye and lochaber constituency of former lib dem leader charles kennedy who is facing a desperate fight with the snp to hang on to his seat
two are in mr alexander âs seat , and another two are in the constituency of his lib dem neighbour john thurso
another beneficiary is lynton , north devon , in the constituency of former lib dem defence minister sir nick harvey , and one of only four seats in england to benefit
mr alexander said the move will help up to 125,000 people in areas faced with some of the highest fuel prices in the country
a source close to mr alexander denied the scheme was designed to favour lib dem seats
â alexander represents a rural community with many remote areas and so he knows first - hand the extra financial burden this puts on families and businesses facing high fuel costs while relying on cars to travel long distances
