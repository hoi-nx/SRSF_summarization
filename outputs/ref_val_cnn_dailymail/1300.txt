decades ago i found myself working with a young woman with autism
i had done my reading of the autism texts of the time , and was singularly surprised when nothing i had read matched up to the person i was sat next to
we know so much more about autism now but the idea that all people with autism are disordered , impaired , or somehow ' lesser ' is one that still needs to be challenged
some of the strongest marriages i have encountered are between people with autism , and i have also met multi-millionaire entrepreneurs who have been identified as autistic
why is there such a stigma surrounding autism ? so , the question remains , why is it that autism continues to be seen as a disorder , with terms such as ' impaired functioning ' still so rife within the literature and current diagnostic manuals ? why is it that one needs to present as a ' problem ' before being in a position to be identified as autistic ? even the term ' diagnosis ' brings along its own associations with ' illness ' or ' disease '
for years , i have been suggesting ' identification ' as a more appropriate term , which counters the pejorative language so often heard in reference to autism
without doubt being autistic in a world populated in the main by people who are not can cause huge issues for the individual and their family
the curse of bad prognoses some research has shown poor outcomes for people with autism but there have been fewer evaluations using real - world measures such as employability , self - sufficiency and social support
the actress daryl hannah ( right ) has autism the sad fact is that there are still schools of thought that deny the fact that people with autism can lead very successful lives
the national autistic society , for example , promotes employment for people with autism
' some of the strongest marriages i have encountered are between people with autism , and i have also met multi-millionaire entrepreneurs who have been identified as autistic , ' says dr luke beardon at the autism centre at sheffield hallam university we 've been working to further these initial advances ; to continue to promote a more accepting view of autism and to encourage society to recognise the potential of autistic individuals
in terms of general perception â well , society is certainly moving slowly in the right direction , with more and more autistic people self - advocating and promoting their strengths , but there is an awful long way to go
