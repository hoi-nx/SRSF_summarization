an alleged fraudster who claimed to own half of facebook has vanished from his home just weeks before his new york - based trial after ditching his ankle monitoring bracelet , his lawyer has said
ceglia , 41 , of wellsville , sued the social network 's billionaire founder , mark zuckerberg , in 2010 , claiming he had been promised a 50 per cent share in the business in exchange for start - up money
in 2012 , he was charged with fraud after federal authorities said he had fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his case against mark zuckerberg , 30
however , it has now emerged that ceglia is missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet
last april , buffalo federal judge richard arcara officially closed the book on ceglia 's multibillion - dollar lawsuit claiming half - ownership of facebook , granting mark zuckerberg 's motion to dismiss it the ruling affirmed a magistrate judge 's recommendation from a year earlier , saying the suit should be thrown out because the 2003 software development contract ceglia had based it on was faked
ceglia had claimed that he and mark zuckerberg had signed a contract , ' the face book ' , that included a provision entitling him to half - ownership of facebook in exchange for start - up money for the firm
although facebook 's lawyers agreed the pair had a contract , they said references to the social network were slipped in for the lawsuit

november 22 , 2003 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ' i have recently met with a couple of upperclassmen here at harvard that are planning to launch a site very similar to ours
' january 1 , 2004 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ' i think it is unnecessary at this point , with all of the extra work i have done for you , to be held to the original completion date
' january 5 - mr ceglia to mr mark zuckerberg ' it is well past january 1 and to my knowledge you do n't have a single thing done for the site ... you know perfectly well that you ca n't just take a person 's investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in harvard
' february 2 , 2004 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ' ceglia , i have a rather serious issue to discuss with you , according to our contract i owe you over 30 % more of the business in late penalties which would give you over 80 % of the company
' february 6 , 2004 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ' sorry it âs taken me a few days to respond , ( sic ) now that the sites ( sic ) live i feel i must take creative control and i just can not risk injuring my sites ( sic ) reputation by cheapening it with your idea of selling college junk , nor do i wish to spend my time shipping out coffee mugs to rich alumni
' february 7 , 2004 - mr ceglia to mr mark zuckerberg ' mark zuckerberg , all i can think is your parents have handed you everything your entire life and after all this time and energy and money that you think in your head that an ok way to act is to just say - oh i âve changed my mind i do nât think it âs cool to make money and that that should be that
' july 22 , 2004 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ( a week before facebook was incorporated ) ' ceglia , i am guessing that you do nât want to talk to me but i wanted to say happy birthday and that i hope to resolve our differences
