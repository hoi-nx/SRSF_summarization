an iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new u.s. hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant , according to dallas police
authorities have stepped up patrols in the neighborhood where al-jumaili lived -- and died -- in their effort to find out who killed the 36 - year - old early thursday , as he and his brother stood in the parking lot of his apartment complex watching the snow
dallas police spokesman cotner said al-jumaili , who recently immigrated to the u.s. , had never seen snow and " just like all of us , a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us
" there is " extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago , " said alia salem , executive director of the cair in the dallas and fort worth area
cair became involved in the case immediately after the shooting , according to salem , because of " a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against muslims
police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime
police did not say where al-jumaili was struck or how many times he was shot
in black - and - white soundless surveillance video , one person who appears to be carrying a rifle is seen running just ahead of a second person , dallas police officer monica cordova said
cotner said police are conducting tests to find out whether more than one rifle was used in the shooting , but he said he could not reveal the make or model of the weapon
" we ca n't solve this crime alone , " he said
