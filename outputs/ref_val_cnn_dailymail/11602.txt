and civil partners neil berry and wesley shepherd have become embroiled in a bizarre spat that seems almost worthy of tv âs little britain
the couple have accused their neighbour , a parish council veteran , of triggering a vendetta against them over a parking space next to their Â£ 850,000 thatched cottage in the picturesque village of upper clatford
but he told the mail he has nothing against gay people , saying he is on chatting terms with a lesbian blacksmith and once went to parties at mr neil berry âs house featuring â butlers in the buff wearing nothing except little aprons and bow ties â
the colourful row has shattered the genteel tranquillity of the hampshire village , with its medieval church and riverside green
gale ( pictured ) denies being homophobic - but admits he built a bench directly behind their house neighbours at war : mr gale 's house ( pictured left ) and mr wesley shepherd and mr neil berry 's house ( right ) mr neil berry , 53 , moved in to his 18th - century cottage more than a decade ago , and later received planning permission to double its size
the 66 - year - old retired mechanical engineer , whose family has been in the village for generations , is said to have started a one - man campaign to convince mr neil berry and his partner their parking area was really part of the village green
the couple claim he prompted his â drinking buddies â on the parish council to launch a â homophobic vendetta â against them
they say the council has spent nearly Â£ 7,000 â 20 per cent of its annual budget â on a legal bid to take away part of their parking space
the row came to a head last week when police were called after a councillor turned up at their house with a contractor to erect a fence that would have reduced the size of the parking area
mr neil berry said : â when i told them they had no right to put the fence there the contractor shouted homophobic abuse at me and pushed me against a car , which wesley shepherd managed to film

â mr neil berry said the problem began when the parish council suddenly registered a new plan of its village green land , and began clearing an overgrown patch next to his garden â while claiming that he had unlawfully extended his boundary
â it was around that time that mr gale decided to go back on the parish council , â he said
â but mr gale insisted that the council was right to take action over an attempt to â steal â land from the green
threatening to sue over claims he is homophobic , mr gale said that he and his wife margaret had welcomed mr neil berry to the village , adding : â he and his partner were guests at our daughter âs wedding
â mr gale said he had resigned as a councillor after mr neil berry alleged that he was behind the boundary dispute with the parish , which he denies
â the contractor denies a homophobic assault on mr neil berry
mr neil berry ( pictured right with his partner wesley shepherd ) said mr gale âs behaviour has left them feeling intimidated
