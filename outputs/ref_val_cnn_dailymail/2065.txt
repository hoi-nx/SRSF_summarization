the chancellor used this week 's budget to announce the first above - inflation increase in the threshold for the higher rate of tax osborne is expected to pledge to accelerate increases in the 40p income tax threshold if the conservative win the general election
the chancellor used this week 's budget to announce the first above - inflation increase in the threshold for the higher rate of tax , which has sucked in ever - more middle - class families , in seven years
but yesterday economists said that even after the latest rise , the decision to limit increases had left millions out of pocket
mr osborne persuaded reluctant lib colleagues to agree that the higher - rate tax threshold should rise gradually from Â£ 41,865 this year to Â£ 43,300 in april 2017 as he sought to woo voters ahead of may 's election
the chancellor says he wants to deliver a threshold of Â£ 50,000 for higher - rate tax and Â£ 12,500 for the basic rate
the ifs said yesterday that higher - rate taxpayers were feeling the pain from the coalition 's earlier decisions to cut the threshold for paying 40p and then increasing it by less than inflation
mr osborne says he wants to deliver a threshold of Â£ 50,000 for higher - rate tax and Â£ 12,500 for the basic rate the coalition has already raised the personal allowance from about Â£ 6,500 to Â£ 10,000 and it is due to hit Â£ 11,000 in 2017
mr osborne said the planned increases in the 40p threshold in the coming years â which could be reversed by an incoming labour government â were a modest ' downpayment ' on tory plans to raise the threshold to Â£ 50,000 by 2020
