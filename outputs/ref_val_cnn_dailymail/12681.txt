boston richard knew his son was n't going to make it
but the father of three told his wife he could n't stay by 8 - year - old martin 's side
the boy 's body was torn apart by an explosion near the finish line of the boston marathon
his skin had changed color
a crowd hovered over him , frantically trying to help , but he was dying
speaking from the witness stand at tsarnaev 's trial on thursday , richard told jurors he was faced with a heartbreaking choice
" i knew in my head that i needed to act quickly , or we might not only lose martin , " he said
" we might lose jane , too
" moments after the blast , richard had stumbled toward jane , his 7 - year - old daughter
his legs felt like they were on fire
but he soon realized the situation was much worse for his daughter
" she did n't have it
" richard 's description of the explosion 's horrifying aftermath capped a day of dramatic testimony as survivors shared their stories in the second day of the high - profile trial
a fourth person , an mit police officer , was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , allegedly ran from police
and now , his younger brother sits in court facing 30 federal charges related to the bombings
they argued thursday that now is n't the right time for jurors to hear the string of harrowing stories from survivors of the explosions , arguing that testimony should be part of a later phase of the trial , when jurors will decide what penalty tsarnaev should face
on thursday , jurors relived the moments after the marathon bombings through the eyes of some of the people most affected by the blasts
defense attorneys did n't ask them any questions
jeff bauman was suspicious as soon as he noticed a black backpack on the ground near the finish line
" but this was boston , he thought , where stuff like that does n't happen
" i saw a flash , heard like three pops and i was on the ground , " jeff bauman said from the witness stand thursday
" jeff bauman 's ears were ringing , and everything was muffled , but he heard the screams
" i looked down and saw my legs , and it was pure carnage , " he told jurors
" jeff bauman testified about becoming aware of his injuries -- burns , wounds on his back , and his legs
" i knew my legs were gone
" we are under attack , " he thought to himself
hern , a high school football coach , then went searching for his 11 - year - old son , aaron
before she hit the ground from the blast , she said , it registered in her mind that she had lost her leg
she started thinking -- did i wear socks today ? she decided she had n't worn socks that day
richard soon learned that , as he 'd feared , martin did n't survive the bombing
his wife , denise , was also hospitalized after the attack
she lost sight in one eye
the father said his own injuries were much less severe than the wounds many other victims suffered
the ringing in his ears never stops , and he lost some of his hearing
but richard said he could still hear the lawyer questioning him at thursday 's trial
