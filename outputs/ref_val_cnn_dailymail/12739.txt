iraqi forces appear to be slowly closing in on an important tactical victory against isis
but as they press forward in their attempt to retake the city of tikrit from isis insurgents , there is an important question that the united states and its allies should be asking : could this victory actually undermine the only sustainable strategy for ensuring iraqi 's stability ? the reality is that short - term tactical victories wo n't be enough to defeat isis , especially as the reliance on iran - backed shiite militias is only likely to exacerbate tensions with the largely local sunnis population
indeed , the crucial ground war component of the campaign has so far been heavily reliant on the shiite militias , whose track record of sectarian violence is well - documented , and their involvement threatens to drive more iraqi sunnis into the arms of isis
historically , iraqi has n't always needed shiite militias under iran 's command to fight sunnis extremists
the growing fear among many sunnis has been compounded by prime minister al-abadi 's statement to parliament that any iraqi choosing to stay neutral was effectively aligning themselves with isis -- remarks that create an atmosphere that enables violence against ordinary sunnis , many of whom feel caught between the extremists and a shiite - led government from which they have been systematically oppressed and alienated
all this suggests that the " awakening " experience , which showed that iraqi sunnis will reject violent extremists if they believe they will get a fair shake from the system for doing so , is as vital as ever to the prospects of defeating isis
sunnis willing to fight isis should be given control over their own affairs in northern iraqi in the way that kurdish aspirations have been accommodated
short - term tactical victories wo n't defeat isis , and militia involvement will more likely strengthen its appeal
the reality is that ultimately , only a political deal that guarantees iraqi sunnis ' inclusion , equality and protection -- one that is implemented by iran and its allied iraqi militia -- can resolve the isis problem
