alicia was standing in the wrong queue to leave the packed assembly hall at springfield primary school in chelmsford , essex , when jona davies made the comment
her older sister olivia , 11 , spotted her sister in the wrong place before hearing their deputy head teacher call her ' pirate girl ' as he tried to attract her attention in front of the school last wednesday
she said the ordeal was the talk of the school and that students from different classes were talking about what mr jona davies , 44 , had said to her little sister
he allegedly sought out olivia , a year 6 pupil , in the playground to explain his actions - but he did n't apologise to alicia directly
she said : ' my sister was queuing in the wrong place and that âs when mr jona davies called her " pirate girl "
' that evening , olivia explained to her mother aimee , 30 , a midwife at queen 's hospital in romford , what had happened
alicia is normally smiling from ear to ear when i pick her up from school but on wednesday she was really solemn and i could tell she was upset
' it was only when my other daughter olivia told me what had happened that i went marching into the school to confront him
' i could n't believe that someone with such authority could be so ignorant and insensitive
' alicia has suffered from an impairment in her left eye since she was two and is also extremely short sighted and is only able to see about a metre in front of her due to the condition termed ' lazy eye '
the patch , which she wears for six hours a day , helps to maintain the 20/20 vision in her right eye
jona davies allegedly called the six - year - old ' pirate girl ' after forgetting her name and trying to get her attention as she was in the wrong queue after assembly specialists at broomfield hospital , chelmsford , have warned the family that if the eye has not improved by the time alicia is eight - years - old , she will be ' stuck ' with that level of vision for the rest of her life
mrs blanco-clements , who also has an 18 - month - old son named teddy , added : ' alicia is so , so , vulnerable because of her eye patch
' mrs blanco-clements , a mother - of - three , and her hgv driver husband liam , 29 , confronted mr jona davies , who is also a triathlete , at the school later that day and were disappointed by his ' flippant ' attitude
' she was not available so i actually spoke with mr jona davies - he came into the room and said " i think i know what this is about "
' i said " what on earth do you think you are doing talking like that to a child with a visual impairment , who is scared already , in front of the whole assembly ? " ' he said he did not know her name and did not know whether to call her " patch " so instead called her pirate girl
' we 're so protective of alicia because of everything she 's been through
' the couple attended the school for a second time , where they were able to speak to headmistress , sharon tyler
' she said the school would be reminding mr jona davies of its policies
' sharon tyler , the school 's head teacher , said : ' we accept that what was said was inappropriate and have apologised unreservedly to the pupil and her parents
