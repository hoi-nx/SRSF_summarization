the germanwings aircraft that crashed earlier this week was deliberately brought down by a co-pilot who had managed to lock himself in the cockpit as he set the plane on a course for destruction , according to officials
we all wish it were n't so , and the investigation , instead of looking at possible deficiencies of the plane , will now look to the co-pilot , who -- by all accounts -- showed no signs that this would be his horrific legacy
the locked door , the very mechanism put into place to protect the cockpit from unruly or dangerous passengers -- made more secure in response to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- was used against a pilot who , for reasons still unknown , left the cockpit
it may be too early to draw conclusive lessons from what has happened , but as this unfolds and before we begin constructing a narrative about the pilot that may be filled with rumors , innuendo and half - truths , there are structural issues to address immediately
first , we have seen that there is a real risk of pilots bringing down planes
we have built no back - up plans into the secure cockpit programs
it might be necessary to devise secure and classified entry access passwords or electronic keys that are available only to both pilots or a pilot and the lead flight attendant
no system of security should rely on a single point of entry and while the post- 9/11 security planning made sense then , it may have outlived the threat now
second , regardless of pilots ' backgrounds and ideologies , airlines as sophisticated as lufthansa may need to implement more than voluntary stress - relief assessments
" perhaps airlines will need to guarantee that pilots who seek counseling will not be unjustly punished
