a filter - feeding ' lobster ' as big as a human took the place of whales 480 million years ago , a new fossil find has shown
the 6.5ft ( two - metre ) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders
a giant filter - feeding ' lobster ' ( illustrated left ) took the place of whales 480 million years ago , a new fossil find has shown
the 6.5ft ( two - metre ) prehistoric creature was an early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders and at this length would have been comparable in size to athlete usain bolt ( pictured right ) the remains were unearthed in morocco and it is thought to be the oldest giant filter - feeder ever discovered
the 6.5ft ( two - metre ) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders
like modern - day whales , it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food , using spine - covered ' limbs ' on its head
like modern - day whales , it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food , using spine - covered ' limbs ' on its head
modern - day lobsters grow to around 19 inches ( 50cm ) and modern - day whales average at around 79ft ( 25 metres )
' while filter - feeding is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food , previous filter - feeders were smaller , and usually attached to the sea - floor
' we have found the oldest example of gigantism in a freely swimming filter - feeder
other anomalocaridid fossils have been flat , like pressed leaves the fossils ( pictured left and right ) also show that aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body , which were likely to be precursors to the unique double - branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans
