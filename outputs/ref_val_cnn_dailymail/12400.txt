maduro also announced saturday a series of measures , including visa requirements for americans citizens and the downsizing of the embassy in caracas , to counteract what he called americans " interference " in his country
venezuela has in recent weeks accused the americans of being behind an alleged coup plot
speaking at an " anti-imperialist " rally in the capital , maduro said visas would now be required for all americans visitors and that the americans embassy in caracas would now need foreign ministry approval for any meetings
moreover , a group of prominent americans officials , current and retired , will be banned from entering venezuela because of what maduro said was their involvement in " bombing iraq , syria and vietnam " and other " terrorist " actions
the officials include george w. bush , former americans vice president dick cheney , former cia director george tenet and several current members of congress , including ileana ros-lehtinen , bob menendez and diaz-balart
