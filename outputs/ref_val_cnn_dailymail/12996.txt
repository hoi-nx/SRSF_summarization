" we 'll draw the blood and have a way to do this very rapidly and start to tease apart who is a little more at risk and who is a little more resilient for ptsd , " says principal investigator dr. baker of the university of california-san diego
according to the ptsd alliance , more than 13 million americans have ptsd and the societal cost is in the billions
the department of veterans affairs estimates 30 % of all vietnam vets have experienced ptsd
among troops recently deployed to iraq and afghanistan , ptsd can run as high as 20 % in any given year
but why does severe emotional trauma trigger ptsd in some people and not others ? the idea that your genes play a role in whether you develop ptsd is a popular focus of recent research
studies of twins show heredity accounts for about 30 % of the differences in response to trauma , with identical twins much more likely to both develop ptsd than fraternal twins
an unusual avenue of research is how our immune systems may contribute to the development of ptsd symptoms
prior studies of people diagnosed with ptsd compared to control groups without the disorder suggest differences in genes related to inflammation may play a role
" the body is built to keep us alive and it functions as one big system , " says baker , discussing the interface between stress and immune chemicals
" under this experimental design , not only can we identify differences between americans marines with ptsd and without , but we can go back in time , so to speak , to see if any of the marines who eventually developed ptsd " showed evidence that it would emerge , says the study 's co-senior author , christopher woelk
" in the blood of marines ultimately diagnosed with ptsd , the study found biomarkers associated with gene networks that regulate innate immune function -- the body 's first line of defense -- and interferon , a protein responsible for kicking the immune system into action
" we 're early in the process of having some clues as to what might predict risk and resilience , and with more research we 'll begin to have effective preventions and treatments , " says baker .
