' press secretary earnest said the president and his advisers ' certainly value the kind of contribution that he has made to the effective management of that department , and he has played an important role in implementing needed reforms in that department

the email would have been covered under ap 's information request since mayorkas sent it during the relevant time period and contained tony 's name
