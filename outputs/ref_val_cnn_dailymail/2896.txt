police will be barred from leaving suspects to languish on bail for months or even years , theresa may pledged yesterday
detectives would face a 28 - day time limit which could only be extended under strict rules in the home secretary âs shake - up
home secretary theresa may pledged to stop police from leaving suspects on bail for months and said the tories would introduce rules blocking the extension of bail beyond three months unless magistrates approved mrs may âs promise comes amid mounting anger that forces are abusing their powers by keeping people in a lengthy legal limbo â only to decide eventually not to press charges in many cases
the tories propose to introduce an initial limit of 28 days
any application to extend pre-charge bail beyond this would have to be approved by a magistrate , said mrs may
last year , dj paul gambaccini , 65 , told of his â 12 months of horror and trauma â at having his name dragged through the mud before being told he would not face historic sex assault charges
â i have been clear it is simply not acceptable for individuals to spend months , and in some cases years , on pre-charge bail with no system of review only for charges never to be brought , â she added
mrs may said it was unacceptable that people like dj paul gambaccini ( pictured ) had been kept on bail for ' months and in some cases years '
he was told after 12 months that he would not face sex assault charges mrs may said : â these measures ensure that decisions to release suspects with pre-charge bail conditions are taken only where it is necessary or proportionate
