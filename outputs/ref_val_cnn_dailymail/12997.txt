the ground was used by " a varied cross-section of society throughout the years since the burial ground was open , " elsden , project manager from mola ( museum of london archaeology ) told cnn
bedlam , now a synonym for chaos , took its name from the hospital of st mary of bedlam in london which nursed the mentally ill. among the deceased are victims of the english civil war , the great plague of 1665 and the great fire of london in the following year
the site was found at an entrance of the city 's new crossrail station -- part of a Â£ 14.8 billion ( $ 22 billion ) project that will expand london 's railway network
" a large sample of the population from that period will enable us to look at the lifestyle , looking at london and what the romans were doing in the suburb area , outside the city walls
roman skulls unearthed deep beneath london the findings are timely as well -- this year marks the 350th anniversary of the great plague in london
" londoners also assisted in the research by helping to search parish records to identify people who were buried in bedlam
