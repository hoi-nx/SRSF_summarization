how refreshing it was to see welbeck properly celebrate scoring for arsenal against former club man united on monday night
the striker 's passion was clear to see as he bounded backwards across the old trafford turf , letting out a roar of celebration as alexis sanchez and santi cazorla rushed over to celebrate the moment
welbeck had every reason to celebrate and let all that pent - up frustration out
a pumped - up welbeck celebrates his winner for arsenal at former club man united the arsenal striker celebrates with team - mates alexis sanchez and santi cazorla after scoring at man united since the age of eight , he was booted out the door in the summer by louis van gaal , who claimed he was n't good enough to be a first team player at man united
so , on his first return to old trafford , welbeck had a major point to prove and when antonio valencia under - hit a back pass to goalkeeper david de gea , he seized his chance
skilfully taking the ball around the spaniard , he passed it into an empty net before celebrating whole - heartedly but still with plenty of respect for the man united fans
welbeck could certainly teach these players , who took the whole not celebrating against a former club thing a little too seriously
shaun wright-phillips ( third right ) looked downright miserable after scoring for qpr at old club chelsea adam johnson ( sunderland vs city , december 2012 ) likewise with adam johnson , who had great expectations when he joined city from middlesbrough in 2010 but was barely given a chance by roberto mancini
so when adam johnson gained his revenge by scoring the winner against city a few months after leaving , you 'd expect something a bit more animated than just a raised hand of apology
