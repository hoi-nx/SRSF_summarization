as cameron prepares to go to buckingham palace to mark the formal start of the general election campaign , ending the long phoney war between the political parties , an exclusive comres poll for the daily mail and itv shows the tories have opened up a four - point lead over labour
it is their best vote share since george osborne 's so - called ' omnishambles ' budget , which included taxes on hot pasties and caravans , which prompted a conservatives slump
the party has to reach even further back - to september 2010 - for the last time it enjoyed a four - point lead with comres
ukip is on 12 per cent , well down on last year 's peak of 19 per cent , with the liberal democrats showing signs of a modest recovery , on nine per cent
the poll is the mirror image of a yougov survey over the weekend , which put labour on 36 per cent and the tories on 32 per cent
tbe comres poll finds mr cameron has extended his lead over mr miliband over which of them is best suited to lead the country an exclusive comres poll for the daily mail and itv news puts cameron and the conservatives up one point on last week with 36 per cent , while miliband 's labour is on 32 per cent , down three points the survey comes after last week 's bruising tv encounter between the two main party leaders and interviewer paxman ( pictured ) following thursday âs television grilling by mr paxman , half of all adults in britain think mr cameron would make a better prime minister -- 50 per cent -- compared to three in ten -- 29 per cent -- who back mr miliband
this represents a fall of four points for the labour leader on the last comres poll , conducted last week before the tv clash
with a seven - way television debate , featuring mr cameron , mr miliband and the leaders of the liberal democrats , ukip , the snp , plaid cymru and the greens looming this thursday , voters are around twice as likely to associate mr cameron than mr miliband with being ' good on television ' , by 64 per cent to 31 per cent
just 29 per cent back mr miliband as prime minister , which represents a fall of four points for the labour leader on the last comres poll , which was conducted last week before the tv clash mr cameron also has a big lead on which of the two is considered a strong leader , with 60 per cent of voters choosing him versus 33 per cent for mr miliband
