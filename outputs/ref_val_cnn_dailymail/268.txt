even if all it amounts to is a handful of visits to england 's training camp to spend a few hours observing the players and offering some pointers , the prospect of wilkinson being involved with the national team is an enticing one
nothing is certain at this stage , but it is not out of the question that the iconic fly - half will agree to give his input as lancaster 's squad prepare for the world cup
if the 35 - year - old hero of the 2003 triumph does take on a role of sorts â and that would appear to be a big if â it would n't be as a coach and it might not even amount to a consultancy , certainly not on a regular basis
wilkinson could lend his expertise to england 's 2015 world cup preperations wilkinson , who was a fly - half , kicked the winning drop goal to lead england to world cup glory in 2003 wilkinson has been getting involved with rugby coaching and could aid england 's world cup preparations england coach lancaster would not ignore the opportunity to use wilkinson 's know - how but most england supporters would settle for wilkinson popping into the hq in surrey on his way to the supermarket , if there was any chance of some of that stardust and winner 's mentality rubbing off on the class of 2015
ford has private sessions with wilkinson 's kicking mentor , the renowned dave alred , who has not had a role in the national set - up since the last world cup
but any chance to tap into the know - how of one of the country 's all - time greats , with his legendary work ethic and meticulous approach , would not be casually ignored by lancaster
wilkinson has spoken of his interest in the option of working as a specialist coach or tutor , and has done so part - time with toulon this season
wilkinson ( centre ) is revered in toulon , where he spent the final years of his career as a player lancaster already has one 2003 world cup winner in his coaching ranks in mike catt ( centre ) wilkinson 's input could help england 's current fly - halfs such as george ford danny cipriani ( left ) and owen farrell are england 's other alternatives at fly - half for all his personal accomplishments , he is wise enough to accept that playing pedigree does not necessarily translate into coaching credentials
talking last autumn , after being invited into england 's camp , he said : ' if there is anything i can add , then we can have a little chat , but more importantly i need to learn my trade
' i 'm coaching one week every month in toulon , learning my way around it
in fact , it would not be a leap of the mind to imagine him matching england 's current kickers shot for shot in extended practice sessions
while there is scope to improve the kicking game , both at goal and tactical , wilkinson is a big admirer of the men currently country 's vying for his old shirt
wilkinson ( left ) acknowledges that success as a player offers no guarantees to becoming a skilled coach lancaster ( left ) and his england side narrowly missed out on rbs 6 nations glory on saturday wilkinson speaks highly of the abilities of england 's current fly - halfs , especially ford and owen farrell ' george ford is a fabulous player who produces some amazing touches and is an absolute natural in the way he reads the game , ' he said
england have the biggest representation on a 12 - strong list for the rbs 6 nations player of the tournament
