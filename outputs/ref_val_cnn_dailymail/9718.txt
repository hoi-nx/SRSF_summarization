discarded stone tools made by early humans have formed a vast ' carpet ' in part of the sahara desert in what scientists say could be the first man - made landscape
archaeologists working in southern libya have found that large sections of a 350km ( 217 miles ) long escarpment has been built up from dropped stone tools
they discovered as many as 75 tools in just a single square metre of ground along the slopes of massak settafet , near fezzan , libya
the oldest - known instruments are the oldowan stone tools from ethiopia , which date back about 2.6 million years
the acheulean tool technology period - up to 1.76 million years ago - featured large stone hand axes made from flint and quartzite
about 50,000 years ago more refined and specialised flint tools were made and used by neanderthals and it is believed it was at this stage tools were constructed out of bone
cut marks have found on animal bones that have been dated to be 3.4 million years old - around the time that a squat ape - like ancestor called australopithecus afarensis - known as lucy - roamed africa
' some talk of an ' early anthropocene ' about 10,000 years ago when forests began being cleared for agriculture
' making stone tools , however , dates back more than two million years , and little research has been done on the impact of this activity
the researchers estimate there are millions of stone tools like the one above littering the landscape in libya the stone tools were discovered along a 217 mile long escarpment in messak settafet in southern libya the researchers found an average of 75 man - made tools in each square metre they looked in - ranging from large flakes knocked off boulders that were used for cutting to sophisticated stone shapes
the messak settafet runs for 350km ( 217 miles ) and much of it appears to have been shaped by human hands ' the landscape is in effect a carpet of stone tools , most probably made in the middle and pleistocene
' it is clear from the scale of activity how important stone tools were , and shows that africa hominins were strongly technologically dependent
by combining their data with previous extensive surveys carried out across africa , the researchers also attempted to estimate roughly how much stone had been used as tools and discarded during human evolution
they estimated that there could be an average of between 0.5 and 5 million stone artefacts per square kilometre across africa
