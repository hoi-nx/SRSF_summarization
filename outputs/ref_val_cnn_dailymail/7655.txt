a drug addict who mugged frail pensioner barnes wept today as he heard lawyers will argue his attack was a ' hate crime '
prosecutors say gatiss deliberately targeted his 4ft 6in , visually - impaired 67 - year - old victim out of hostility towards the disabled
the cowardly attack on mr barnes , from gateshead , tyne and wear , shocked britain in january and a fundraising campaign to buy him a new home made Â£ 330,000 in just a few days
barnes - who suffers growth problems and is partially sighted - was attacked by drug addict gatiss ( right ) in january
prosecutors today called for the offence to be categorised as a disability hate crime gatiss , 25 , also of gateshead , appeared briefly at newcastle crown court via a videolink from durham prison today , where he is being kept in segregation for his own safety
that could mean gatiss was guilty of a disability hate crime , which would aggravate the assault with intent to rob charge that he admitted last month
' the attack on mr barnes sparked outrage around britain and led to his neighbour , beautician katie cutler , organising a fund to help the 67 - year - old donations flooded in from around the world and saw mr barnes given Â£ 330,000 to buy him a new home but judge paul sloan qc suggested the claim of a general hostility towards disabled people was ' hollow ' and told the court the aggravating circumstances would be factored into the sentencing anyway
