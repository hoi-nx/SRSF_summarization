for years , native americans have called on redskins owner snyder to change the team 's name
it 's a dictionary - defined racial slur that 's dehumanizing to native americans
but what about the thousands of high schools across the america that have the name as its mascot ? where do they fit in the debate ? once you factor in freedom of speech , how should one approach this issue ? recently , in upstate new york , the lancaster central district school board unanimously voted to retire its high school 's mascot and moniker -- the " redskins
" the board called the mascot " a symbol of ethnic stereotyping " and said the school " can not continue practices which are offensive and hurtful to others " -- namely native americans
some students opposed the board 's decision citing school legacy and tradition
" coincidentally , around the same time in delaware , the conrad schools of science announced it will begin to take steps to drop its " redskins " mascot before the beginning of the 2015 - 16 school year
local school districts are responding to the growing chorus of voices who oppose antiquated native american mascots
furthermore , there 's research that shows native americans mascots and monikers harm the mental health of native american youths
other research shows how all ethnic groups are hurt by poor representations of native americans
what the conrad schools of science and the lancaster school board decisions represent for native americans are hope -- for us and our kids -- that broader awareness is changing perspectives and that hurtful stereotypical nicknames should not have to be tolerated by any ethnic group
many have made the argument that native americans like me are trampling on the first amendment when we call for the washington football team to change its name
on march 6 , the organization said in a blog it does not support the uspto 's decision to cancel federal trademark protection of the washington football team 's use of the word " redskins
" in june of last year , the uspto had repealed six of the team 's seven trademarks , finding the r - word is " disparaging to native americans
" although the aclu agrees the team name is " offensive and perpetuates racism against native americans , " it can not support what it refers to as language policing
he told me he 's " disappointed " that the aclu would defend the washington team , which he refers to as " a multi-billion dollar company profiting off a racial slur
" america needs to do better as a whole with regard to native americans
this is n't just about native americans mascots
this is about the dehumanization of native americans
