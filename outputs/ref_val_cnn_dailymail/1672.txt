cockroaches might not be the most beloved of all critters - but is it ethical to control their movement with mind - control technology ? that âs a debate engineers at texas a&m university are stirring with their latest â robo - roach â device , which can control the path a cockroach takes with wireless technology
they have created little backpacks for the bugs and implanted electrodes into their nervous system to control their movement
their backpack stimulates the nervous system in the bugs ' brains ( image provided by dr hong liang )
doing so allows the direction of their movement to be altered
it is different to previous technologies that stimulated antennae this is not the first technology to turn cockroaches into controllable insects - others have even released products you can buy to create your own remote - controlled roach
but previous attempts to manipulate the movements of cockroaches relied on stimulating their antennae , tricking them into avoiding objects
next , they inserted electrodes into the body of a cockroach to stimulate its nervous system
while they can only control their direction for now , the researchers hope to advance the technology to have greater control , such as making it walk , run and stop on command speaking to the guardian , lead researcher dr hong liang said the benefits of such technology could include attaching cameras or sensors to cockroaches , and having them explore areas humans can not - such as disaster zones
