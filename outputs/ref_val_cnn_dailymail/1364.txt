now , one london - based photographer has captured these structures in a series of captivating - and at times gruesome - images of the animal kingdom
london - based photographer , frank , has captured stunning images of the anatomy of various creatures
' on one hand , especially from the royal veterinary college 's point of view , these images are designed to understand anatomy and with the help of digital imaging they will be now available to a vast audience of students and practitioners , ' said mr frank
conjoined twin piglets ( left ) and the cast of a cow 's lung ( right ) can be seen here ' when you remove the entanglement of surrounding tissue and fat , you are left with something so pure and delicately artistic that is completely different from anything else i have ever seen , ' photographer frank told dailymail.com
' from my perspective , i wanted to create something that is so detached from academia and anchored in art that it will puzzle the viewer , ' said mr frank each of the specimens is stored in a formalin pot , preserving its intricate structure in incredible detail
in one day , mr frank would normally photograph between 15 - 20 pots , with on average one day in post-production for each
the collections features images of a cow 's heart , a goat 's testis and a dog foetus , among others
' one of mr frank 's favourite images is of the injected testis of a goat
to create the images , the photographer used carefully constructed lighting on the pots to achieve a sense of the fragility of the membrane or tissue within the pregnant uterus of a red deer ( left ) and a cast of a goat âs lung ( right )
pictured is a cow âs uterus ' the pot itself obviously posed some limitations and some problems , ' said mr frank
he hopes that ' like in a renaissance painting , [ this art ] will ask broader questions on life and its meaning

it is when science becomes pure art , ' he said ' i do n't see an injected testis ; i can see a satellite image of a river , ' said mr frank this astonishing image of a pregnant pony uterus was selected as the winner for the 2015 wellcome image awards
' it shows us a large and magnificent creature reduced to this sad , fragile and half - formed creation , which i find very humbling , ' said one of the judges a cow 's heart is seen here
