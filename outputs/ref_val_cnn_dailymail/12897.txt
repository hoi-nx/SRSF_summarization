when u.s. writer avijit roy was hacked to death on a dhaka , bangladesh , street in full view of horrified onlookers , blogger rahman doubled down
fundamentalists were choking free thought in his secular nation , he wrote
but they could n't silence it
his friends warned him to be careful , to watch what he posted online
but rahman dismissed those concerns , saying his facebook profile page did n't even bear his picture
they do n't even know what i look like , he told them
on monday , the 27 - year - old rahman fell victim to the same brazen act that killed avijit roy , hacked to death by two men with knives and meat cleavers just outside his house as he headed to work at a travel agency
he was so maimed -- with wounds to his head , face and neck -- that police identified him through the voter identification card he was carrying
his death was the second time in five weeks that someone was killed in dhaka for online posts critical of islamic -- but they are hardly the only two who 've paid a steep price
" the despicable murder of avijit roy last month should have led authorities to step up protection measures for bloggers and others at risk
the killing of rahman today is another clear example of the bangladesh government 's utter failure to ensure the safety of those at risk , " said abbas faiz of amnesty international
" how many more bloggers will have to be attacked before action is taken ? " as shocking as rahman 's death was , the reaction from some quarters was equally disturbing
on his facebook page ( for which he picked a custom url that translates to " unbeliever " ) , rahman had posted a picture with the hashtag # iamavijit
" on his page , rahman reposted a cartoon depicting mohammed from the french satire magazine charlie hebdo
on facebook , he is credited for a series , " jaw - crushing answers to insulting comments of atheists
" mohiuddin , a blogger who himself was wounded by machete - wielding attackers in 2013 but survived , remembered rahman as a great satirist
" the irony is that the people who killed rahman were n't even familiar with his writings ; they were simply following orders , police said
in confessions to police , the pair -- both students at islamic schools -- said they did n't know what a blog was , nor had they seen rahman 's writing
they said they were acting on orders from another person who told them killing rahman was a religious duty , police commissioner biplob kumar sarkar told reporters
the only person arrested in the killing of avijit roy , the u.s. blogger , is farabi shafiur rahman , who had called for his death in facebook posts
" the bangladesh government must urgently establish accountability in this murder case and others , " the committee to project journalists said after rahman 's death
" but the deaths -- of rahman , of avijit roy , of haider -- have emboldened the movement , rather than chill them into silence
