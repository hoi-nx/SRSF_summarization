those who would love to see the lesser spotted laura robson back competing on a tennis court are learning that it is a question of hope trumping expectation
having withdrawn from the qualifying event of this week âs miami open , she has now removed herself from the entry list to next month âs wta tour event in bogota , and the new target for her return appears to be the french open in may
that suggests she is going to be left with at least 16 months of catching up to do when her troublesome wrist is deemed fit for full tournament play again , having not played since the australian open in january last year

â it 's only two months after my second surgery and my left wrist
robson has sought the advice of 2009 us open champion del potro del potro made only his second tournament appearance in 14 months at the miami open since returning at the start of last year the talented russian has not got past the third round at any event and her ranking still languishes at 153
so it could be hard for robson whenever she returns , although on her side is that she does have bags of natural ability and is a superb ball striker
