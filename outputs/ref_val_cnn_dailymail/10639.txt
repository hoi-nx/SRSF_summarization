the ' crackers ' tv licence can not survive for another decade , johnson warned today as he insisted the bbc uses it to ' demolish ' its competition
the senior conservative said changing viewing habits mean it is harder to justify the ' full whack ' of the levy on every family with a television
but mr johnson today insisted the idea of funding the full slate of bbc output was now in doubt , and the bbc ' needs to think about its future '
speaking on lbc radio , the johnson said : ' many people now no longer get their news , many young people in particular , no longer get their news from tv
' bbc director general lord lord hall has said he believes the licence fee ' has got at least another ten years in it ' he said there would be a case for some money raised from taxpayers to be used to ensure a very high standard of public broadcasting
but he said he doubted whether this meant the ' full whack of the licence fee ' was necessary
they take huge sums of money from the taxpayer , from the licence payer , and use it to cross-subsidise businesses that demolish local newspapers , local websites
' a bbc spokesman said : ' we agree with johnson on supporting high quality public broadcasting in this country , and that it would be a shame to lose that , which is why it is important that the bbc is able to continue offering the high quality news , drama , and entertainment the british public loves
' the corporation insisted that 96 per cent of people use bbc services every week
changing viewing habits , including watching online and subscription services , mean the tv licence has become harder to justify bbc boss lord hall yesterday defended the licence fee and said the corporation 's opponents have to be ' honest about the consequences ' of their plans for the organisation
in a speech at new broadcasting house in central london , he said the corporation was at ' a crossroads ' and the licence fee - which is not currently required to watch catch - up tv on iplayer - must be amended to cover ' catch - up television as soon as possible '
i welcome the committee 's endorsement of our proposal to require people to pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch - up television
the committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee - a universal household levy
' in fact , i 'm going to go further and argue that if we did n't have a bbc funded by a licence fee , such is the world we face , we 'd have to invent it
