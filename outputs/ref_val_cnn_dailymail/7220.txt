a father who believed he had the right to smack his two young children has had them taken into care by social workers following a ruling at the high court in london ( pictured ) the man has now had his third child , a six - month - old girl , taken into care by rotherham council officials
it comes after his middle child , now aged three , was also taken into care
it is not clear whether the man 's eldest child is in care , although there have also been care proceedings issued in relation to that child
she said : ' it was clear to me that she can not separate herself from the father and from his entrenched views
the parent revealed that he smacked his children on the bottom , legs and arms , using his hand ( picture posed by models ) ' she singularly fails to appreciate the risk that he poses to any child in his care '
since then , he has been cared for by his ' quiet , considered and thoughtful ' maternal uncle
the judgement also revealed that care proceedings had taken place for another child , during which a family judge criticised the man 's ' rigid and inflexible thinking '
despite the parents ' objections , judge wright ruled that e 's welfare demanded that she also be looked after by her uncle and his partner , alongside her older brother
