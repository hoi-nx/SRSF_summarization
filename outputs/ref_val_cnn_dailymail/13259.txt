thirty years ago , a journey across european meant a passport full of stamps , a wallet full of different currencies and plenty of time spent waiting in line to be glared at by border officials
that all began to change in june 1985 , when the continent 's countries began signing up to the schengen agreement -- a deal that lifted frontier controls between cooperating neighbors
today , 20 years after it came into force , with more than 26 states now participating , schengen has completely altered the experience of traversing european
spanish photographer ignacio evangelista spent several years criss - crossing the continent to capture these abandoned checkpoints on camera for a project he calls " after schengen
" the result is a fascinating gallery of images that charts the unusual architecture of places whose fate has been intertwined with european 's ever - evolving political and economic allegiances
" i do n't know why but from many years ago , i feel very attracted to situations or places where the natural and the artificial come together , sometimes a little bit in conflict , " ignacio evangelista tells cnn , explaining his interest in frontiers
as a young adult in the early 1990s , ignacio evangelista experienced many of these borders firsthand when he embarked on an interailing trip -- a country - hopping rite of passage that sees many young european take advantage of cheap pan-continental train tickets
" the frontier buildings range in size and style , from giant soviet declarations of authority that loom over major highways to tiny huts in deep , dark forests
european 's richer countries tend to maintain old posts , while less wealthier states seem content to let them deteriorate , ignacio evangelista says
a strong supporter for an open european at a time when some of the continent 's nations are talking about severing the close economic and political bonds they share with their neighbors , ignacio evangelista recalls one encounter that underscored the human side to his project
after 10 minutes they went back their separate ways , and i thought , before the schengen agreement , this couple had no future
