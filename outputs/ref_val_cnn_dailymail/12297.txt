south african safaris conjure up images of four - wheel drive cars trundling through games parks carrying tourists with binoculars clamped to their eyes
venturing into the continent 's game reserves on horseback may seem a little daunting but is one of the best ways to experience the environment , says philip kusseler , co-owner of wait a little horse safaris
philip kusseler has been leading outings into south african 's karongwe and greater makalali game reserves near the famous kruger national park for more than a decade
his stable of around 40 horses at a farm in ofcolaco in the northwest of the country includes warmbloods , native boerperds and former thoroughbreds
the ex-racehorses may be more used to chasing on the turf than exploring the bush , but philip kusseler says that once trained they make for great tour guides
" we train all our horses in basic dressage , " she explains
" all horses spend a minimum of two years being schooled at a purpose - built riding arena at the farm and also in the bush where they learn to deal with some of nature 's most intimidating creatures
" when an ex-racehorse sees a lion , " explains philip kusseler , " you can feel it 's heartbeat through the saddle but he soon learns to cope with it and they are just as cool as any other horse breed
" " trekking with horses is extremely dangerous because the horse fits the lions prey preference perfectly
but they are so well - trained and so well disciplined that they do n't react like a prey animal would , so the lions get quite confused
" along with the " big five " game ( lions , elephants , rhinos leopards and buffalo ) wait a little 's intrepid guests can expect to come across zebras , wildebeests , hippos and giraffe amid 35,000 hectares of game park
i always say the animals are the least dangerous -- the most dangerous thing is riding horses
