lasting love : the star with husband grant roffey having forged a career starring in hollywood blockbusters and packed theatres , people might assume walters to be brimming with confidence
but the veteran star has revealed that when it came to romance in her younger years , she relied on a helping hand from alcohol to bring her out of her shell
the mother - of - one , 65 , has admitted that before meeting her husband grant roffey , 57 , thirty years ago , she had never had sex while sober
however , now she has been diagnosed with a yeast allergy she almost never drinks and , on the rare occasions she does , hates the effect it has on her health
in a candid interview , she also reveals she is finding it increasingly difficult to learn her lines , a problem she has increasingly found as she stars in new series indian summers
the mamma mia ! star met mr grant roffey while she was starring in a production of macbeth and began a whirlwind romance almost immediately but they only married in 1997 , 11 years into their relationship
talking to saga magazine , she has said how their first encounter ended with a drunken tryst and that , at that time in her life , she always needed to drink before being able to have sex
she described how she and a friend had drunk three bottles of champagne before bumping into her future husband at a bar in leicester
â i remember saying , â do you want my children ? â that first night â terrible things ! â it was driven by alcohol
who âd have sex without alcohol ? especially the first time
before we were together , i do nât think i âd ever done it sober
â while she might owe her happy marriage to alcohol , she now hardly touches a drop due to a yeast allergy
the actress met her husband in 1986 and began a whirlwind romance almost immediately
â and before , when i âd had a few drinks , the next day i âd always have these flu - like symptoms
â this is not the only problem alcohol has caused for her health
she has spoken before of her struggles with menopause and again said how she continues to suffer with hot flushes after 15 years
i was doing this tv called murder , and every take there âd be , â stop , she âs having a flush ! â the actress also revealed she is finding it difficult to learn the lines for current channel 4 series indian summers , in which she plays cynthia ( pictured ) â at the national i âd come off stage for a quick change and have to shout , â garth , the tray ! â and this guy would come with this big tin tray and fan me
â a more pressing issue caused by her advancing years is a difficulty with learning her lines
otherwise i âd never remember the lines
â i have to learn things ahead of time now , which i âve never had to do in my life
the next day i would hardly look at my lines , and they âd be there
