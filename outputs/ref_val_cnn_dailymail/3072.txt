traditional british cooker manufacturer aga , favoured by tv chefs mary berry and nigella lawson , has today launched in china with a brand new feature : a wok burner
taking the leap into the new market is arguably the biggest gamble the firm , which has been selling ovens in british since 1929 , has ever made
most chinese kitchens have just two gas hobs and , if they have an oven at all , it is usually cheap and the size of a microwave
gamble : aga has been selling cookers in british since 1929 and launching in china is seen as a big gamble
wong ( front ) , aga âs director of business development in china , said shifting eating habits among the country âs rich influenced the company âs decision to launch there british staple : aga is a favourite of merry berry and nigella lawson
even the pm has one of the firm 's cookers in his kitchen but aga is targeting the country 's new middle class and chief executive mcgrath told mailonline he was confident he could convince people to spend between Â£ 5,400 and Â£ 27,000 on the british favourite
mr mcgrath , speaking in beijing ahead of the official launch event , conceded that the cookers could just become popular with a â small niche market connecting with expats in china â
â aga products are synonymous with cosy comfort food such as sunday roasts and victoria sponges
despite the company 's rich british history , it has teamed up with china - based firm beijing hi seasons for the rollout and mr mcgrath said he âs hoping that families in china will use the cookers to make traditional chinese food
aga chief executive mcgrath ( pictured ) denied that succeeding in china was essential for the company but added : â we want to win some away games ' cooker model : british fashion model daisy lowe was enlisted to advertise the popular cooker , which has not launched in asia as such , the aga models being launched in china resemble those available in british but with a crucial difference : a wok burner on top
wong , aga âs director of business development in china , told mailonline that shifting eating habits among the country âs rich also influenced the company âs decision to launch there
according to the aga website , dr dalã©n created a cast - iron cooker capable of every kind of cooking simultaneously , with two large hotplates and two ovens
this picture , taken in 1968 , shows two children at the ideal home exhibition can you really do every kind of cooking that there is ? this advert was published in a 1955 edition of punch magazine a cascade of recent high - profile food safety scandals in china has also contributed to a rise in home cooking , as confidence in restaurant standards has dropped
although aga sales were up in 2014 in the british , the company is reaching near saturation point in the country â after all , you âre only likely to buy an aga once
last year the company , which produced its millionth rangemaster cooker this month , released a slimline city60 model aimed at british city dwellers in an attempt to find new buyers
â consumer analyst paul french recently told the financial times : â in china , if you have the kind of money to spend on an aga , you generally have someone who cooks for you
the aga models being launched in china resemble those available in british but with a crucial difference : a wok burner on top british : aga has been selling these popular ovens in british since 1929 but hopes to break into the asia market â now , in china , the generation that earns money does nât just leave behind their parents , â mr wong said
trademark , copyright and patent abuse in china is often flagrant , and it seems inevitable that if aga takes off , knock - off products with similar names will start popping up
