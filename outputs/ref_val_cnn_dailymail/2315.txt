scientists at european 's cern research centre have had to postpone the imminent relaunch of their refitted ' big bang ' machine , the big bang machine , because of a short - circuit in the wiring of one of the vital magnets
engineers had been expected to start on wednesday pumping proton beams in opposite directions all the way round the two 27 - km ( 17 - mile ) underground tubes in the big bang machine , closed down for the past two years for a refit
after a two - year shutdown and upgrade , it is about to ramp up for its second three - year run
if they only take visible matter into account , their equations simply do n't add up ; the elements that can be observed are not sufficient to explain the rotation of objects and the existing gravitational forces
called ' dark matter ' , this substance appears to make up at least 80 per cent of the matter in the known universe
that would have been the prelude to the start of particle collisions in late may at twice the power of those in the big bang machine 's first run from 2010 - 2013
the smashing - together of particles inside the big bang machine is designed to mimic conditions just after the big bang at the dawn of the universe
' that includes searching for the dark matter that makes up about 96 percent of the stuff of the universe but can only be detected by its influence on visible matter around it
' scientists and engineers at cern , mindful of a serious leakage in 2008 which caused a delay of two years in the start - up for the first big bang machine run , have long insisted that there can be no rushing into full operations
previously a higgs particle has been created in an big bang machine detector and has then disintegrated into four muons ( the four red lines )
according to dr christoffer petersson 's model the higgs particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter scientists at the cern , or cern , say if nature cooperates , the more powerful beam crashes will give them a peek into the unseen dark universe
scientists hope to see all sorts of new physics , including a first ever glimpse of dark matter , one of the chief focuses of the experiment
' dark matter â and its cousin , dark energy â make up most of the universe , yet scientists have n't been able to see them yet , so researchers are looking for them in high - energy crashes , in orbit on a special experiment on the international space station , and in a deep underground mine
' what we know about dark matter is that it exists and then very little after that , ' mit professor michael williams said at a science conference in february
' dr victoria martin , from edinburgh university , a member of the atlas team , said : ' using data from lhc run one we discovered the higgs boson particle
' higher energy may also allow the mysterious ' dark matter ' observed in galaxies to be made and studied in the lab for the first time
' on december 9 the magnets on one section of the big bang machine ring were successfully powered to the level needed for a single particle beam to reach 6.5 tev
the goal this year will be to run two beams of proton particles in opposite directions to produce 13 tev collisions .
