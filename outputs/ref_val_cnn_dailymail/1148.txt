tony irish , the boss of the international players â union , has criticised the icc over their decision to cut the cup in england to 10 teams , saying : â the global game needs a global view
â with the likes of ireland and afghan â two of the more engaging sides in this year âs tournament â in danger of missing out on qualification in four years â time , the icc have faced tough questions over their commitment to spreading the game beyond its 10 test - playing full members
but irish âs comments , part of a wide - ranging interview with sportsmail about some of the major issues faced by international cricket , carry particular significance : fica , the federation of international cricketers â associations of which he is chief executive , represents the players unions in england , australian , bangladesh , new zealand , sri lanka , south african and west indies
tony irish , the south african boss of the international players â union , says cricket needs a global view and not a 10 - game cup that the icc has planned for 2019 that will exclude the likes of ireland ( above ) fans of afghan , who have n't been disgraced in their first cup in australian and new zealand in other words , he is speaking on behalf of the majority of the world âs top cricketers
â fica takes a global view on the game , â said irish
â one of the objectives must be to try to grow the global game
â irish , whose push for fica to play a greater role in determining the game âs future has not been helped by india âs refusal to form their own players â union , said the format of future world cups should not be influenced by the tv - driven desire to guarantee as many group matches as possible for the indian
afghan and new zealand playes come together after their cup pool a match in napier â one can understand that from a commercial point of view , and from the point of view of satisfying the biggest cricket market , â he said
the important thing is that the body that administers the global game needs to have a global view
india have n't got a players ' union which hinders the international union 's powers to push for an inclusive game he said : â there âs very little framework any more to the ftp
â and irish is concerned that the takeover of the icc by the indian , england and australian boards last year will result in an increasingly unlevel playing field at international level
