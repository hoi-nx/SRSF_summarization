he now at the centre of a new controversy after saying that foreign taxi drivers in london have cars ' smelling of sick ' â you have a chap who has just arrived from a country you âve never heard of , whose car smells faintly of lavender oil and sick , who does nât know where he âs going and ca nât get there anyway because he never puts more than Â£ 2 worth of fuel in the tank of his car
â he also turned on drivers in the north , saying northern roads are overrun with immigrants â who have never experienced tarmac before â
