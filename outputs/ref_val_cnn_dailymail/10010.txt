anger : watson , 32 , claims his nose was bitten off , left and right , during his work christmas but is furious after police shelved their investigation because he was too drunk to remember what happened after checking cctv at possible locations and hunting for witnesses , officers found nothing so were unable to record the incident as a crime and suggested he may have fallen over
mr watson fears the person who attacked him may now never be caught and denies he fell because he had no grazes on his hands , elbows or knees

' i just ca n't get my head around the fact that this has happened to me and i do n't know why
the hotel maintenance worker has since undergone painful skin grafts , and in december surgeons took skin from another part of his face to rebuild his nose
watson still believes part of his nose was bitten off
' the police have now written it off because i ca n't remember what happened
i thought it happened outside fenwick but i ca n't be sure
' mystery : mr watson has had surgery twice already after the incident on december 23 - but his memory of the night is hazy , making it hard for police to discover what happened northumbria police has confirmed the incident was investigated but no evidence of an attack could be found
