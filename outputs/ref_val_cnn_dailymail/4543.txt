labour today hinted at hefty tax rises for people earning more than Â£ 80,000 a year
miliband has been deliberately vague about labour âs plans to raise taxes to deal with the deficit , identifying only his proposal to reinstate the 50p tax rates , which experts warn may raise nothing
he suggested that those earning more than Â£ 80,000 were rich and could bear to pay more
mr ed balls said labour would not hit those on â middle and lower incomes â , with taxes mainly rising for those on higher salaries
he added : â if you look at people on middle and lower incomes â this is nât only people on Â£ 10,000 or Â£ 20,000 a year , it âs Â£ 50 , Â£ 60 , Â£ 70 , Â£ 80,000 a year â they are paying more tax
david cameron , at a rally in wiltshire today , has claimed labour will cost families Â£ 3,000 in tax rises over the next parliament mr miliband said labour would ensure britain âs corporation tax rate remains the â lowest in the g7 â
david cameron claimed yesterday that a labour victory would lead to Â£ 15 billion of tax rises , costing families an average Â£ 3,000 each over the lifetime of the next parliament
the ifs also criticised the tory figures , saying they were based on too many assumptions about labour âs opaque tax and spending plans
