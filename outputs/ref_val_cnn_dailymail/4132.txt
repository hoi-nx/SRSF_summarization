this is the excruciating moment a woman appears to snap a bone in her leg while using gym equipment
the unidentified woman cries in pain as her bone apparently snaps , moments after she lifts a heavy weight using a leg press
a leg press is a machine used in strength or resistance training
it requires a person to push weight away therefore engaging their leg muscles
but when the woman she is halfway through her second repetition , having already lifted the weight , she relaxes her leg while it is extended , rather than keeping her knee bent to support the weight
the unidentified woman screams in agony as her leg bone snaps
she was using a leg press machine at the gym , in which she was pushing away weights with her leg muscles but the weight is too heavy and bears down on her leg , forcing it to bend the wrong way
while the woman writhes in agony , a man standing nearby in a suit watching her workout rushes to help
while it is unclear what exactly injury she sustained , an expert told mailonline she could have fractured the tibia ( the bone between the knee and ankle ) or the femur ( bone that extends from the pelvis to the knee )
â fitness experts today warned of the dangers of carrying out exercises such as a leg press without the proper training or supervision
some said that resistance machines such as the leg press are dangerous because they isolate muscles in a way that does not mimic ' real life ' movement , while others warned a person should always concentrate when carrying out such exercise
' helle hammonds , founder of gymclass , london , said machines such as a leg press can be dangerous as they isolate muscles in a way that does not mimic how a person would normally move
after lifting the weight for the second time , the woman relaxed her legs instead of keeping them bent
this meant the weight bore down on her legs , forcing them to bend the wrong way and snapping her bone she said : â the problem with leg press machines and many other weight machines is that they create a way of moving weights whilst isolating certain muscles and joints
â these weight machines create an unreal environment , using inappropriately heavy weights and incorrect form can , as the video shows , cause problems
â i have seen many injuries to people 's lower backs from leg press machines in particular , as they lift weights that are too heavy
â through research the fitness industry has now moved away from sending clients on this kind of machine and i would recommend people use free weights to do exercise such as a squat , spilt lunge or a waking lunge
â tom eastham , a trainer for push mind and body retreat , added that concentrating while lifting weights is key
' golden rules for the leg press or any other strength based exercises would be : focus , brace then contract
