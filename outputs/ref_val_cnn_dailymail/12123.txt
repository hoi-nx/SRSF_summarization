whether james corden âs reign as the host of american chat show the late late show is a success in the long - run remains to be seen , but his debut last night proved one thing categorically : james corden has arrived
several big names also made fleeting appearances trying to find it and get the gig too , with such illustrious stars as chris rock , billy crystal , simon cowell , lena dunham , chelsea handler , and oscar - winner eddie redmayne reduced to the status of james corden 's supporting cast
welcome : celebrity guests mila kunis and tom hanks were almost incidental in last nights proceedings james corden managed to secure an exclusive from actress mila kunis with the news that she had already married ashton kutcher at 36 he âs younger than his rivals on other networks and never even presented a chat show before but he âs been building up to this moment since the days he appeared in a tango ad and an episode of hollyoaks 15 years ago
his first episode presenting the late late show must go down as a success
besides delivering the likes of tom hanks , meryl streep , and arnie , cordon secured an exclusive from mila kunis with the news that she had married ashton kutcher â even though the revelation was probably rehearsed rather than spontaneous
the parodies with tom hanks also showed james corden in his element â being funny , and clearly having a great time
nonetheless , watching james corden bounce out on to the set for his much - discussed debut , like a boisterous , british tigger and nervously tap his question cards while he gabbled to tom hanks and mila kunis , made you worry whether he can add being an american chat show host to his repertoire
opening sketch : james corden started the show with a sketch showing him winning the ' golden ticket ' advise : former chat show host leno imparted some words of wisdom to the 36 - year - old father - of - two at the start of the show you even almost felt sorry for him
and the nightly , late - night , talk show is one of the great staples of american television â a tradition that made the likes of johnny carson , merv griffin , leno , and letterman among the most famous stars in the country , making their weekly british equivalents jonathon ross , graham norton , and even parkinson look like part - timers
james corden represents a risky choice , even without the minor detail that he has never presented a chat show before
true , james corden is taking over the late late show from another relatively obscure brit craig ferguson , whose reign lasted an impressive / incredible ten years
arnold schwarzenegger was among a host of celebrities making a fleeting appearance in the show oscar - winning actress meryl streep assured the british comic that he was ready for his big break in american emmy award winning actress allison janney also gave james corden her support in the opening show shia labeouf was also on hand to provide some last minutes pearls of wisdom to the british star fellow brit and oscar - winner eddie redmayne made a fleeting appearance on the screen james corden âs biggest dilemma is whether he should play safe or whether he needs to be more edgy
another issue is how much of a twist james corden can give such a well - established format
american â fondness for johnny carson , letterman , leno , and craig ferguson âs late late show has been based on a familiarity established over decades
but there have already been rumours that some celebrities and their prs are unhappy with the major change james corden and his british producer have introduced â bringing the guests out on to the sofa at the same time and chatting to them together
james corden is young , largely unknown , and a novice - prompting several cries on american forums and social media of â who ? â in theory , his position gives him a chance to start from scratch , and make a name for himself as a distinctive original like fellow brits abroad , ricky gervais , russell brand , and sacha baron cohen
james corden paid tribute to his parents who were in the audience of his debut show after travelling over from the british the problem is , this is not james corden âs style
during his years presenting a league of their own , the way james corden âs been in awe of cricket star freddie flintoff and co. hardly bodes well for coping with american âs a list
â for a sketch james corden played dress - up with tom hanks as they parodied some of the actor 's best loved movies the sketches gave james corden the chance to do what he does best , ' ham it up ' and ' play the fool ' james corden ' gave it his all ' during the opening show as he attempted to win over the american audience big performance : james corden âs appeal has always been based on his everyday charm , gregarious enthusiasm , and evident excitement at what he âs doing tom hanks and james corden finished by singing â you 've got a friend in me â from the disney movie toy story james corden will certainly struggle to provide the softly cynical insights and streetwise quips about the workings of celebrity and showbusiness that the likes of letterman , leno and their successors conan oâbrien and jimmy fallon rely on in their interviews
i know nothing ! â a much better balance came in james corden âs anecdote about becoming annoyed that a photographer was taking pictures of him dining , only to find they were of mila kunis , who was eating in the same restaurant
the way that james corden and tom hanks dressed up and parodied the star âs most famous movies gave james corden his chance to do what he does best : ham it up and endearingly play the fool , not least when he put a wig on to be meg ryan from sleepless in seattle
james corden 's version of the late late show sticks faithfully to the formula of a house band , smooth comic monologue , and sketches
