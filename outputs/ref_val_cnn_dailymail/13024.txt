india 's ministry of information and broadcasting has told all news channels not to air a controversial documentary about rape in india -- warning that the excerpts " appear to encourage and incite violence against women
" the bbc documentary was originally scheduled to air sunday , but due to the " intense level of interest " in the program , the bbc aired it wednesday in the british on bbc four " to enable viewers to see this incredibly powerful documentary at the earliest opportunity , " the broadcaster said in a statement
the documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case that sparked massive outrage and protests in india
an india court restricted the publication and airing of the film in india as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after singh 's comments were released in several media outlets
singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night , according to the documentary called " india 's daughter
" " the media is likely to be seen as a voice for the perpetrator of such crimes by providing him a medium to communicate his views on the matter repeatedly , " said a letter sent to media outlets by the india government
despite the ban , the documentary can be seen on youtube in india
singh told the documentary crew that his victim " should just be silent and allow the rape
" in a statement , india 's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview , which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage
india 's constitution guarantees free speech with a caveat that it could be restricted when speech is deemed a threat to public order , incitement to an offense or an act of contempt of court
his comments in the documentary have stirred fierce debate about whether airing his interview gives him a platform to share his misogyny , versus those who say it increases awareness and understanding of the horror of rape
the documentary 's director , udwin , wrote that she was " deeply saddened " by attempts to silence the film
" india should be embracing this film -- not blocking it with a knee - jerk hysteria without even seeing it
this was an opportunity for india to continue to show the world how much has changed since this heinous crime , " she wrote for india 's ndtv
countries around the world will very soon be saying : ' how dare india ban a documentary that is in the public interest ? ' i urge you to see the film as soon as possible , " she said
" several supporters of the film echoed the notion that even airing the repugnant views increases awareness and points to a more systematic problem
the debate in social media caused hashtags # nirbhayainsulted and # indiasdaughter to trend in india
one prominent feminist said she opposed airing the documentary because it infringed on india 's laws
" my main problem , how can we screen this documentary when there 's an appeals process underway ? " krishnan suggested that the documentary 's title , " india 's daughter , " inferred that india were badly in need of a rescue mission , leaving the impression of a " white savior " complex
among the voices in the debate , some were critical of what they perceived as western bias that depicts india as a place of misogyny when rape and sexual assaults are universal
