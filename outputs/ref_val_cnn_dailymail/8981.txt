nico rosberg 3 massa vettel 5 raikkonen 6 bottas ricciardo sainz 9 grosjean maldonado nico rosberg crosses the line , but it is only good enough for p2 , a mighty half - a - second down on hamilton
he had an awful first sector , but was quicker than lewis hamilton in the final sector
bottas wobbles out of the final corner , but he still does enough to qualify fourth and lewis hamilton is going even quicker ... lewis hamilton complaining about his tyres on his out - lap from the pit - lane ... will it make a difference ? ricciardo is the first driver on a timed lap. he crosses the line to clock a 1:28.329 to move him up to third , but here comes kimi and he goes third above ricciardo
can anyone beat lewis hamilton to australian grand prix pole ? all of the drivers are back in their respective garages and it is lewis hamilton from vettel , felipe massa , raikkonen , maldonado , ricciardo , grosjean and sainz
neither nico rosberg nor bottas have posted a time
lewis hamilton crosses the line and the briton posts a 1.26:419 which is 1.3 seconds quicker than the next driver in vettel , but nico rosberg runs wide at the penultimate corner and takes a trip across the grass
nico rosberg , in his mercedes , is the last driver to leave the pit - lane
the final 12 - minute session is underway in melbourne ... lewis hamilton or nico rosberg ? nico rosberg or lewis hamilton ? place your bets now
lewis hamilton and nico rosberg are happy they 've done enough , and they are back in the mercedes garage
back on track , and lewis hamilton leads the way from nico rosberg
and here is a gloomy , but ever - positive , jenson button : â i think the positives are , looking at winter testing it was difficult , having issues and running short , and suddenly you put a team at a race weekend and you have to stick to the schedule
we must mention that his team - mate marcus ericsson was the other non-mclaren driver to be eliminated from q1
both mclaren drivers are eliminated from the opening qualifying session of 2015
jenson button improves his time to leapfrog kevin magnussen , but they will start 17th and 18th respectively
they will start on the final row of the grid
that leaves kevin magnussen and jenson button in the drop - zone
with manor not running , only three drivers will be eliminated from q1 ; pastor maldonado and carlos sainz are the two drivers set to miss out ... lewis hamilton quickly usurps nico rosberg however , and he tops the timesheets in melbourne
so , with eight minutes to go in q1 , vettel leads from bottas , raikkonen , lewis hamilton , felipe massa , nico rosberg , hulkenberg , verstappen , grosjean and perez
nico rosberg , on the medium compound - remember ferrari are on the softer , quicker compound - goes fourth , a second slower than vettel
lewis hamilton , on the medium compound takes a wee trip across the grass on his out - lap. not the ideal start to qualifying from the briton there
meanwhile , it has been confirmed that manor , who pulled everything out of the bag to make it to melbourne , will not take part in qualifying so they will not race this weekend
the british driver and his team - mate kevin magnussen , who is deputising for the injured fernando alonso , endured a miserable day during practice for the season opener at the albert park
the mclaren pair , hampered by reliability problems to their new honda engine , managed only 13 laps between them in friday âs opening session and were five seconds down on nico rosberg âs best time for mercedes
so , with 10 minutes to go until the start of qualifying , why not catch up on the very latest news from melbourne , starting with lewis hamilton and his hope that he will be remembered as a legend when he retires from formula one
jenson button and kevin magnussen , standing in for the absent fernando alonso , propped up the timesheets yesterday
but jenson button remains , retained by mclaren for a sixth season , remains typically optimistic : â this is the package i think will challenge mercedes
â lewis hamilton ended both practice sessions behind nico rosberg yesterday , but the briton was back on top this morning
good morning and welcome to mailonline âs coverage for the season - opening australian grand prix
