an alabama woman charged in her granddaughter 's running death testified wednesday that she would ' rather die ' than hurt the little girl , and denied making her run as punishment
joyce hardin garrard took the witness stand to say she never intended any harm to 9 - year - old savannah hardin
when defense attorney richard rhea asked if she would have done anything to hurt savannah or any other grandchildren , garrard replied , ' i 'd rather die first
' the 49 - year - old garrard said she and savannah had been in the yard picking up sticks and talking , taking frequent breaks to get a drink of water and to play
took the stand : joyce garrard , 49 , took the stand in her own defense wednesday in her trial for allegedly killing her 10 - year - old granddaughter savannah hardin by forcing her to run as punishment for lying about eating candy ' i was picking up sticks with her because i felt just as responsible for her lying as she was , ' garrard testified
prosecutors say garrard killed the girl three years ago by making her run as punishment for a lie about candy
' it was ' more like a jog and not a run , ' garrard maintained
garrard said that 's when she told savannah 's stepmother , jessica mae hardin , to call 911
victim : garrad allegedly forced her granddaughter , savannah hardin ( pictured left and right ) , 9 , to run to her death at her home in etowah county in 2012 after discovering she had lied about eating forbidden chocolates arrests : garrard ( pictured , left , in her police mugshot ) was charged in the fatal february 2012 incident alongside savannah 's stepmother , 27 - year - old jessica mae hardin ( right ) one word on a 911 recording could help decide garrard 's fate
with 9 - year - old savannah lying unconscious following an afternoon of running and a 911 operator listening over the phone , joyce hardin garrard asked for something â either a cigarette or a blanket
on the feb. 17 , 2012 , recording , played in court tuesday , garrard is heard in the background as the girl 's stepmother , jessica mae hardin , talked for more than 11 minutes with beggs , a 911 operator in etowah county
speaking in a loud voice as savannah hardin talks to beggs , garrard is heard repeatedly saying the child 's name and asking her to wake up
if garrard asked for a cigarette while the girl lay before her dying , jurors could agree with prosecutors that the woman was angry and meant to kill the child by running her for hours
if they believe the woman said ' throw , ' jurors could see that as sign garrard was worried and trying to help the girl
but defense lawyers are expected to argue that the third - grader 's death was n't gerrard 's fault prosecutors were preparing to cross-examine garrard later wednesday after she was questioned by her attorney
authorities said she sat by without intervening while the older woman forced the girl to run until she dropped
a defense expert said in dramatic testimony tuesday that he would n't classify the death of a young girl as a homicide even though her grandmother is accused of running her to death , yet he agreed the child would n't have died without exhausting physical exertion
questioned by an attorney for garrard at her capital murder trial , forensic pathologist dr. lauridson indicated he could n't say someone else caused the death of savannah hardin , 9
garrard began crying after he said her granddaughter 's death was n't a homicide
but under cross-examination by prosecutor reid , lauridson admitted he did n't have all the witness statements and police files that were available to dr. emily ward , the state pathologist who ruled that the girl 's death was a homicide
neighbors have testified they saw the 49 - year - old boaz woman forcing the girl to keep running even after she was vomiting and begging to stop , and reid drove home the point to jurors
crow testified that a report indicated ward did n't have the girl 's medical records before conducting the autopsy
prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against garrard , who is accused of making the girl run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy on feb. 17 , 2012
