designer hayat rachi raised money on a fundraising website to start her own feminist lingerie line ( modelled here by two real women ) in her images , hayat rachi was determined to use real women , posing naturally and not catering to the male gaze the lingerie - which comes in chartreuse , orange and black - is made from sustainable bamboo fabric rather than lace and satin because it moulds to the wearer âs body , and has antibacterial properties
' explaining why she felt driven to design the line , she said : â i found it difficult to find a lingerie brand that shared the same ethos as myself : empowerment , body confidence and the non-objectification of women
â â so instead of succumbing to the body - shaming , sexualised and objectifying lingerie on the market , i used my frustration to start my own brand , neon moon , with the support of the prince âs trust
i genuinely could nât fathom reaching the Â£ 5,000 goal with 18 days left ! â hayat rachi wanted to design lingerie that was n't about objectifying women â i have been so blessed by the support received from women , men , transgender and non-binary people âs generosity ! â â the amount of press created , and also zooey deschanel sharing an article on neon moon on her facebook ( to close to six million followers ) added to such a viral buzz about neon moon âs kickstarter
â all extra money funded beyond Â£ 5,000 will go into producing more lingerie for the â mon dieu â collection in order to sell directly online
' neon moon is ' revolutionising ' the underwear world by being ' a body - positive , feminist lingerie brand , â she added
