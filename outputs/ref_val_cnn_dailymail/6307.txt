bale rammed some of the ridiculous criticism he has received in recent weeks from real madrid supporters back down their throats with a first - half double and the perfect goal celebration
when he put real madrid ahead on 18 minutes in the 2 - 0 win over levante on sunday night he made sure he left off some steam , covering his ears as he ran to the corner to give the flag a celebratory kick
bale celebrates , with obvious relief , after breaking a long scoring drought to put real madrid ahead at the bernabeu the welsh winger covers both his ears to demonstrate that he has not been listening to the boos from the real madrid fans bale ran to the corner flag and kicked it as he let out some pent - up frustration having found the net for the first time since january real madrid 's two expensive superstars both celebrate after bale had diverted cristiano ronaldo 's shot into the corner of the net to make it 2 - 0 real madrid ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : keylor navas ; dani carvajal , pepe , sergio ramos , marcelo ; luka modric ( illarramendi 78mins ) , silva , isco ( jese 69 ) ; bale , benzema ( hernandez 82 ) , cristiano ronaldo
goals : bale 18 , 40 booked : luka modric levante ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : marino ; ivan lopez , david navarro , ramis , tono ; camarasa , simao ; xumetra ( garcia 59 ) , barral , morales ( el zhar 59 ) ; kalu uche ( casadesus 75 )
it was his first goal in nine games but with 16 in 38 this season he remains on course to match last year 's haul and the singling out from those jeering supporters and some real madrid - based media had clearly got to him
the welshman scored again five minutes before the break , diverting a cristiano ronaldo shot past marino
cristiano ronaldo 's effort looked as if it was going wide and although bale 's touch was slight it was necessary and he was awarded the goal
bale 's first half performance will have silenced those calls for him to be left out of the real madrid team
bale has come in for plenty of criticism from the la liga crowd in recent weeks , but looked to have found his form at the right time benzema tracks levante 's david navarro as real madrid sought to respond after a poor performance against schalke cristiano ronaldo can not mask his frustration after striking the post with an early chance to put real madrid ahead against levante the world player of the year endured a difficult first half , with his temper bubbling below the surface despite real madrid taking control it was a luka modric shot that marino pushed out to the edge of the six - yard box that benzema turned in moments later but all three real madrid forwards - bale , benzema and cristiano ronaldo - were offside
luka modric then took a corner won by bale and planted it on the welshman 's head only for the effort to go just wide
cristiano ronaldo also shot straight at marino five minutes from time and skied an effort from the edge of the six - yard box in injury time
video bale was more motivated - ancelotti cristiano ronaldo nicks the ball past levante 's ivan lopez as real madrid prepared for next weekend 's clasico with a win this acrobatic cristiano ronaldo volley was headed off the line , before bale volleyed in the rebound to give real madrid the lead cristiano ronaldo and bale embrace after the second goal , but the portuguese forward 's immediate reaction has been criticised isco takes on simao down the left hand side while benzema waits for the spaniard to deliver a cross at the bernabeu on sunday night levante goalkeeper marino gets up ahead of bale to claim a cross , but the keeper could do nothing about the welshman 's goals dani carvajal holds off the challenge of kalu uche on what proved to be a comfortable night for the home side in la liga cristiano ronaldo sees a shot saved by marino on a night where he looked desperate to score , but found his way constantly blocked
