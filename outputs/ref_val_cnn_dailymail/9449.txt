she was once the largest ocean liner in the world and her sinking caused shockwaves across the globe when 1,198 passengers and crew lost their lives after a u-boat attack
now a newly discovered image suggests previous claims that the name of rms lusitania was painted out to protect her on her fateful final voyage in 1915 were untrue , making her a legitimate target for germany submarines

this picture , which has only just emerged , is believed to be the last one ever taken of the rms lusitania in new york - and it clearly shows her name had not been painted over as authorities had said the rms lusitania ( pictured ) was sunk by a germany u-boat in 1915 killing 1,198 passengers and crew layton , 35 , from new york , said : ' it was said they had done everything to make her less ' findable ' to the enemy , camouflaging her for protection , helping protect her from attack

after submarines sank a further seven us merchant ships wilson finally went to congress on april 6 , 1917 , calling for a declaration of war on germany the rms lusitania and the mauretania were launched at a time of fierce competition for the north atlantic trade
the germany shipping lines were aggressive competitors in the transatlantic trade , and the rms lusitania and the mauretania were built to outperform their germany counterparts
the cruiser rules required that the crew and passengers of civilian ships be safeguarded in the event that the ship is to be confiscated or sunk
popular myth says that to protect the rms lusitania , her name was painted over - so that she could not be identified as a military vessel
