wenger has urged arsenal to rid themselves of europe âs gallant loser tag by grasping their champions league second chance on tuesday night
the gunners head into their second leg in monaco trailing 3 - 1 following an abject display at the emirates
in each of the past four seasons , arsenal have narrowly crashed out at the last 16 stage
arsenal were in fine form to beat west ham on saturday and will need to carry that momentum forward the gunners will need to overturn a two - goal deficit against a team who rarely concede last season they secured a credible 1 - 1 draw in bayern munich after losing the first leg ; in 2013 arsenal won 2 - 0 in the allianz arena only to crash out 3 - 2 on aggregate after a crushing first leg loss
three years ago , having lost 4 - 0 to ac milan in the first leg , wenger âs side staged a brilliant comeback only to fall short in a 3 - 0 second leg win
and in 2011 , arsenal again missed out by a solitary goal , crashing out 4 - 3 on aggregate to barcelona despite winning the first leg 2 - 1 at the emirates
and now arsenal must perform yet another european comeback in monaco with wenger desperate for his side to finish the job this time
wenger says his team have an opportunity to right the wrongs of last month 's defeat to monaco mesut ozil and olivier giroud cut a dejected figure while arsenal were being beaten at home by monaco â that âs not what you want ( to be called gallant losers ) , you want to qualify , â said wenger
â honestly , i âd prefer to be 3 - 0 up ( but ) we have no choice
is all the pressure on monaco ? they can lose it
â should the gunners need a further motivation then they only have to glance at monaco striker dimitar berbatov âs suggestions that his side wanted it more than the english club during the first leg
olivier giroud has bounced back from a poor performance to score three times in four games since monaco the arsenal striker hit a stunning goal to put the gunners ahead at home to west ham on saturday â we have enough experience to know that what happens on tuesday night does not depend on statement of people , but just depends on our performance on the night , â said the arsenal boss
â i do nât believe that ( monaco wanted it more than arsenal )
but the striker has responded well , scoring three in as many starts since the defeat to monaco â including a brilliant strike in the win over west ham that fired arsenal to within a point of second - placed manchester city
â i try to bounce back as quickly as i can and it âs true the boss gave me a chance to do it against everton ( after the monaco defeat ) , â said the france international
arsenal crashed out of the champions league last season despite a good display against bayern munich in 2012 the gunners came close to overturning a 4 - 0 deficit against ac milan , but fell just short â i try to do it straight away
