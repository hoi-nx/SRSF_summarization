for gordon , the old wisdom â fail to prepare , then prepare to fail â is more a way of life than a fleeting thought
to the uninitiated , tomorrow âs final will be settled over 90 , maybe 120 minutes , with the lingering possibility of penalty kicks
celtic keeper gordon is fully focused ahead of the scottish league cup final with dundee united
but , long before the first ball is kicked in earnest , the celtic goalkeeper fully expects to be ahead in the battle of wits
while much of what will transpire between celtic and dundee united will be random and instinctive , gordon believes his slavish devotion to studying what âs liable to be thrown at him can significantly shorten the odds on his side coming out on top
gordon fails to hold the ball allowing rodrigo palacio of inter milan to score in the europa league â it âs about taking that research out on the training pitch , too , and practicing for who you âre going to be playing against - a team that likes to put a lot of low , early crosses into the box , for example
â for the rangers game , it was deep early crosses hung up to the back post so we focused our training around that
â and when that plan comes together in the form of a victory and a clean sheet ? gordon will be hoping to celebrates his first showcase occasion since hearts earned cup glory in 2006 â absolutely , it âs satisfying , â gordon added
nine years ago , gordon played in the scottish cup for hearts against gretna â his last major final as it would transpire
gordon âs intervention in the final chapter was key , however
as hearts hit four perfect kicks , he saved from derek townsley before watching gavin skelton sky the eighth and final kick over the top
celtic goalkeeper gordon celebrates their goal during the scottish premiership match against aberdeen â i had a fair idea of most of the gretna penalty takers , â he recalled
â that stop from 12 yards not only allowed gordon to lift the only major honour of his career to date - it cemented his reputation as one of the finest goalkeepers scotland has produced
when a Â£ 9million move to sunderland was completed a year later , it seemed he âd spend half his life on the winner âs podium
a year ago , with the road back from injury seemingly never ending , the chance of another fix of the winning feeling seemed fanciful
â i probably did nât appreciate at the time like i should have done - playing in a cup final , winning a cup , â he reflected
celtic keeper gordon speaks with referee craig thomson after the scottish cup quarter final â albeit it âs a different competition this sunday but it âs still to win a cup , i probably did think it would come around again , that i âd get another chance
â it âs not something i âll look back on fondly if we do nât

romanov âs liking for self - harm culminated in gordon , pressley and hartley taking the unusual step of holding a press conference to air their frustrations

gordon throws his gloves in to the crowd following the premier league match with kilmarnock â there are players from that team and some really good characters
â while hartley , pressley and robbie nielson have done just that , gordon still has many races to run as a player

â scottish goalkeeper gordon in goal for sunderland after his Â£ 9million exit from hearts back in 2007 so far , he âs dealt with just about everything that been cast his way
from the cynics that felt signing a long - term crock to replace fraser forster would only end one way , to the strikers in scotland and across europe who have found him back to his imperious best
but surely gordon , who effectively still has a two - year tie to parkhead , has spent enough time watching football these past three years to not voluntarily do so again ? â who says i could nât be no1 , like ? â he laughed
