andrew is pictured avidly staring at a colourful display he is trialling new glasses which correct the condition , allowing him to experience normal vision for the first time in his life
valspar , a us - based paints company , have released a video showing colour blind people using the glasses for the first time
he laughs with joy , exclaiming â is this what you guys see every day ? â enchroma , who manufacture the glasses featured in the film , claim the spectacles allow wearers to â gain faster and more accurate discrimination of colours such as in traffic signals and signs â
but best of all , enchroma says the glasses give people who view the world in varying shades of grey the â profound experience of a bright and vivid world of colour â
andrew is pictured looking at his son 's drawings and being able to see the colours for the first time

atlee is pictured staring at a sunset robert sprujit , a perceptual psychologist featured in the video , said : â colour blindness is a situation where , because your eyes are different from someone else âs eyes you do nât see the world in the same way
â we developed these glasses to enable colour blind people to see colour for the first time in their lives â colour blindness , also known as colour vision deficiency , is where a person finds it difficult to distinguish between different colours
in most cases , colour blindness is inherited , but it can also develop as the result of a pre-existing health condition , or as a side effect of certain medicines
it occurs due to an abnormality of the retina , the layer of cells at the back of the eye that are sensitive to light
the cone cells in the retina are sensitive to different wavelengths of light
for people with normal vision , the brain compares the signals from all three cones , enabling a person to see the colour of an object
but for people who are colour blind , one or more cones will be missing or wo n't function normally , which means they will be unable to see the full spectrum of colours

the two streams of information conflict , and the more the signals overlap , the greater the extent of the colour blindness
however , enchroma adds that the glasses are not a cure for color blindness â it is a product that can assist with it
