moscow russia president putin appeared in public monday for the first time in about 10 days as he met with kyrgyzstan president atambayev in the russia city of st. petersburg
although the kremlin and the russia state media released photos and video footage of putin last week , they did not quell the rumors about his whereabouts , because it was unclear when they were taken
so all eyes were turned to st. petersburg on monday for putin 's scheduled meeting with atambayev of kyrgyzstan
and he made light of his absence , saying : " it would be boring without gossip
" in another sign putin has a firm hand on the tiller , defense minister sergey shoigu said the president had ordered russia 's northern fleet to be placed on full combat alert from monday morning for snap checks , russia 's state - run tass news agency reported
the checks are intended to test the fleet 's capacity to ensure russia 's military security in the arctic , tass said
also on alert are russia 's western military district and certain airborne units , with some 38,000 military personnel involved in total
here 's what gave some doubters grist for the rumor mill : on friday -- three days before the scheduled meeting -- a russia state media broadcaster prematurely aired a report that putin had a meeting with atambayev -- although the event had not yet occurred
the kremlin vigorously denied that anything was amiss , with putin 's spokesman saying the president was healthy and that his handshake " can break a hand
" does putin ever catch a cold ? does he ever get sick ? the kremlin does n't want to allow putin 's image of virility and strength to become tarnished by the weaknesses of mere humans , " cnn analyst frida ghitis wrote
" last week , presidential spokesman peskov sought to allay questions , telling russia radio station echo of moscow that people should not worry and that putin was " absolutely " healthy
rumblings about putin began last week after a meeting in the kazakh capital , astana , between the russia leader and the presidents of kazakh and belarus was postponed at short notice
a kazakh official told reuters that putin had fallen ill. on thursday , he missed his meeting with the federal security service , russia 's counterintelligence agency
putin 's last public appearance was supposedly on march 8 , international women 's day
