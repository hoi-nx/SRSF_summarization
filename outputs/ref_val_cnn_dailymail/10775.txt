shadow chancellor ed balls said the party could delay hs2 going any further than birmingham in favour of a new east-west line labour has been accused of delivering a ' slap in the face to the north ' after suggesting it could abandon a new high speed rail line to manchester and leeds
shadow chancellor ed balls said the party could delay hs2 going any further than birmingham in favour of a new east-west line
david cameron said labour was ' letting down people in vital regions of our country '
but mr ed balls said prioritising the second phase of hs2 â which would connect birmingham to manchester and leeds â made ' no business or economic sense at all '
' labour had previously backed hs2 , which could cost more than Â£ 50 billion , even though mr ed balls was known to have doubts about it
' labour had previously backed hs2 , which could cost more than Â£ 50 billion , connecting london to manchester and leeds via birmingham chancellor george osborne also supports hs3 but construction is unlikely to begin until after hs2 is completed in 2033
' the idea that improving links between birmingham , nottingham , leeds and newcastle , that that should wait until after we have done hs2 , i do n't think makes sense
' david cameron , at a production line for london taxis in coventry , said labour was ' letting down people in vital regions of our country ' responding to mr ed balls 's comment , the prime minister said : ' the economic argument is very simple which is we need another railway line between london and birmingham and up to the north of the country
' and i would say to anyone who says there is n't a case for hs2 , try getting on the train from birmingham to london or london to birmingham and see how many people are standing , see how much extra capacity we need
' but the very worrying news today is that labour are calling into question the links between birmingham and manchester and birmingham and leeds , and this would be an immense slap in the face from labour to the west midlands , the east midlands and the north of the country and i can not believe they are contemplating letting down british people in vital regions of our country in this way
