barring a revelation from his parents or girlfriend , we may never know what was going through the mind of lubitz in the moments leading up to the crash of germanwings flight 9525
what we now know is that all indications point to lubitz as the perpetrator of the crash , locking the pilot out of the cockpit and setting the aircraft on a fatal trajectory into a remote mountain range in the french
every day , more details come to light , as the world struggles to make sense of why a 27 - year - old german man would apparently choose to deliberately crash a plane with 150 people on board , including himself -- and remain so calm while doing it
when investigators searched lubitz 's home in dusseldorf , they found medical leave notes " slashed , " suggesting lubitz was hiding an illness or illnesses from his employers
the dates for which lubitz was excused from work included the day of the crash , though investigators have not yet revealed the reason he was excused , if any reason was written on the notes by his doctor
we do know , from a german aviation source , that lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification examination last summer
" spohr added that lubitz had " interrupted " his training , which he began in 2008
lubitz suffered from " generalized anxiety disorder , " with severe depression symptoms dating back to 2009 , according to french newspaper le parisien
while the main medical clinic in dusseldorf denies it was treating lubitz for depression , german investigators found antidepressant medications in lubitz 's apartment , according to published reports that cnn has not yet been able to independently confirm
die welt , a german newspaper , over the weekend cited an unidentified senior investigator , who said lubitz suffered from " severe subjective burnout syndrome " and severe depression
" " people who relapse or develop more of what is called a psychotic depression in addition may have symptoms of psychosis
" one of the medications lubitz was prescribed is said to be agomelatine ( an antidepressant medication ) , according to le perisien
" in 2010 , lubitz received olanzpine injections ( an antipsychotic medication ) " to treat ocd , " according to le perisien
doctors advised lubitz to be more active , practice a new sport and regain self - confidence
citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation , the new york times saturday reported that lubitz sought treatment for vision problems that might have put his career at risk
authorities have not ruled out that lubitz 's vision problem could have been psychosomatic
many people have been asking how likely it is that depression could result in this sort of horrific action
" most people would just kill themselves , " he says
" it 's very , very rare for depression to cause people to kill other people
" it has to be a very severe depression to the point that there 's a psychosis that 's a result of that depression , " he says
with this kind of depression , it 's so deep that you actually break with reality
" remember , lubitz was in his late 20s -- and the odds of mental illness presenting at this age are much higher for someone in their 20s or 30s
did anyone see any changes with his behavior ? did he stop sleeping ? there 's a pretty good chance something would come up in speaking with the people in his life
" more details are needed on lubitz 's story
perhaps the most chilling revelation so far is that lubitz not only decided to do what he did , but that he ignored the pilot 's pleas to think about the lives on board and change his mind
that 's such an extraordinary possibility that -- that 's not depression -- but because they 're impaired in concentration , memory and attention , which is n't good for a pilot , " said sir wessely , president of the royal college of psychiatrists and an adviser to the united kingdom army
