u.s. president obama said on monday that iran should commit to a verifiable freeze of at least 10 years on its nuclear activity for a landmark atomic deal to be reached , but said the odds were still against sealing a final agreement
in an interview with reuters at the white house , obama said that a rift over israeli prime minister netanyahu 's planned speech to congress opposing the iran deal on tuesday was a distraction that would not be ' permanently destructive ' to u.s. israeli ties
but he said there was a ' substantial disagreement ' between his administration and the israeli government over how to achieve their shared goal of preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
he said iran must halt their nuclear work earlier on monday in a speech on monday to the aipac ( aipac ) netanyahu warned that a nuclear deal could threaten israeli 's survival ' if , in fact , iran is willing to agree to double - digit years of keeping their program where it is right now and , in fact , rolling back elements of it that currently exist ... if we 've got that , and we 've got a way of verifying that , there 's no other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that they do n't have a nuclear weapon , ' he said
israeli fears that obama 's iran diplomacy , with an end - of - march deadline for a framework nuclear agreement , will still allow its arch - foe to develop an atom bomb
netanyahu has spoken scathingly about a possible deal , saying negotiators appear to have given up on a pledge to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
obama sought to downplay the long - term damage from the row over netanyahu 's speech to congress , saying the rift was not personal and that he would meet the israeli leader again if he wins israeli 's march 17 election
but obama said netanyahu had been wrong before with his opposition to a 2013 interim deal with iran
israeli fears that obama 's iran diplomacy , with an end - of - march deadline for a framework nuclear agreement , will still allow its arch - foe to develop an atom bomb ' netanyahu made all sorts of claims
in a speech on monday to the american israel public affairs committee ( aipac ) , the largest u.s. pro-israel lobby , netanyahu again warned that a nuclear deal could threaten israeli 's survival while insisting the u.s. - israeli relationship was ' stronger than ever
