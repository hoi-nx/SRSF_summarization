while the world is divided over whether ' that dress ' is blue and black , or white and gold , nasa has been involved in a colour controversy of its own
this time the debate involves mars â the so - called ' red planet ' â which conspiracy theorists believe is in fact more blue and green
on the left is a processed image of what nasa believes mars to look like the sky on earth is blue because of a phenomenon known as ' rayleigh scattering ' , in which blue particles of light are scattered around by the atmosphere
nasa claims the sky appeared blue because viking 1 's filtered images still had to be calibrated with the right colour balance
the debate has raged since the 1970s when nasa 's viking 1 lander became the first spacecraft to touch down on the red planet , according to a report by alan boyle in nbc news
nasa claims the sky appeared blue in the first mars images because viking 1 's filtered photographs still had to be calibrated with the right colour balance
nasa sometimes uses different filters to depict mars
ron levin , a researcher at lockheed martin stated in areport : ' an excess of red is found on all of the mars blue and green panels
is this what mars really looks like ? a mosaic from nasa 's curiosity rover shows mount sharp in raw colour
but even nasa admits this is n't an exact science
colour balance is a highly subjective and no two spacecraft use the same exact filters
to clear up the debate , nasa usually releases a number of different types of mars imagery , which include the raw file , unprocessed colour pictures and true - colour versions
to add to the confusion , the curiosity rover recently found that the interior of mars ' rock ' telegraph peak ' is in fact blue / grey colour balance is a highly subjective and no two spacecraft use the same exact filters.as well as this , people often perceive colours differently â as shown by the famous black and blue dress
