when nurse gregson decided to share an intimate moment with her boyfriend , privacy was nât exactly utmost in her mind
not only did her romantic liaison take place in the front seat of her audi , but she was also parked in the middle of a zebra crossing
gregson , 26 , from preston , was arrested by police after they found her car parked at an angle on a zebra crossing on christmas eve while she was straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat the 26 - year - old , who was nearly twice the drink - drive limit , was arrested after police caught her straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat
gregson , whose favourite books include fifty shades of grey , had parked her black audi at an angle on the crossing but put her hazard lights on to warn other drivers
gregson initially denied being drunk , saying she had just finished a 15 - hour shift at preston hospital
she refused a breath test , saying she had a cold , but a urine test showed she was twice the drink - drive limit â she was straddling a male in the passenger seat , â said mrs quanbrough
she then got into the driver âs seat and put on the seatbelt
â officers asked gregson to step out of the car and found she was unsteady on her feet
gregson was taken to a police station where she refused to be breathalysed and was given a urine test instead
gregson , who had no previous convictions , later admitted being in charge of the car while over the limit
they can be charged even if they are in the passenger seat if police think they were recently driving , as in gregson âs case .
