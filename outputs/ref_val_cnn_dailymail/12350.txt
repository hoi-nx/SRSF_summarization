washington hillary clinton is pressing the reset button -- yet again
she 's quietly fighting back a week after her awkward and occasionally combative news conference on the furor over the private email server she used while running the state department
clinton 's twitter account is buzzing this week with posts that test political messages on health care , college affordability , civil rights and jobs -- issues she hopes will help mobilize president barack obama 's democratic coalition and pave her way to the presidency
despite fretting among some democrats who worried that the party 's best -- and perhaps only -- viable democratic candidate appeared to be in trouble , early signs suggest clinton is doing what the clintons do best : mounting a comeback
i do n't see an organic clamoring for more information , " said a longtime clinton ally who did n't want to speak for a campaign that has n't yet been announced
" if and when hillary clinton decides to run , she will have to address this issue , but i believe the american people are more interested in her addressing the kitchen table issues that matter most to them , " he said
of course , clinton still faces plenty of challenges and the email saga raised questions about whether she can run a more sophisticated , no drama campaign than the one she managed in 2008
but the cnn poll revealed that those critical of clinton 's role in the email affair appear to break close to party lines and her favorable rating remains at 53 %
a slow recent decline in that rating appears to coincide with clinton 's slow re-entry into partisan politics and does not necessarily reflect her recent stumbles
perhaps the most intriguing figure in the poll is that only 1 % of respondents had never heard of clinton
that supports the idea expressed by some democratic that clinton may be the most vetted figure in public life
a less well - known candidate might have made a terrible first impression if faced with the kind of hyper - covered flap clinton was
but gop believe the email scandal could be a political gift that keeps on giving , as it touches on a narrative that the clintons are secretive , resistant to transparency and often blur the rules
there are also other problems -- including the question of foreign funds sent to the clinton foundation and hillary clinton 's whopper speaking fees -- that gop believe could reach a political mass and fan doubts about the likely democratic nominee 's character
then there are the foreign policy questions , including a now damaging photo op in which clinton offered a " reset " button to russia only for the country to revert to a cold war-esque posture
" spicer argued that even with younger voters , who do not remember the clinton years , the question of impropriety over her emails could provide an entry point into past scandals
though clinton is the prohibitive democratic front - runner , her support in the party is not universal
another well - connected democrat who did n't want to go on the record criticizing clinton admitted that the email issue did play into gop caricatures about the allegedly " conspiratorial " politicians and that it could challenge the former secretary of state 's early efforts to get her message out about her ideas and rationale for running for president
in many ways , the email furor was a story the media could n't wait to write , so it may be that journalists have inflated the importance of the episode , at least in the absence of any evidence that clinton broke the law or made classified information vulnerable
