slain russia opposition figure nemtsov knew criticizing the kremlin was dangerous , but thought his fame would protect him
the 55 - year - old was walking home from dinner with his girlfriend anna duritskaya when he was gunned down in moscow on friday
nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against putin 's government
in an interview with cnn 's anthony bourdain last year , nemtsov spoke of the deaths of other kremlin critics , but said his fame offered some protection
" i 'm a well - known guy , and this is a safety because if something happens with me , it will be scandal not only in moscow city but throughout the world , " he said then
after nemtsov was shot , putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting , the kremlin said in a statement
last year , a moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of russia journalist and fierce kremlin critic anna politkovskaya
in their 2014 interview , nemtsov told anthony bourdain he believed russia 's existing power structure was like 19th century russia , with one person in control and no real freedom of press , real competition or elections or an independent judiciary or rule of law
" this is a country of corruption , " nemtsov said
" for putin 's russia , this is a system
" " if you are corrupted , but you are loyal , and you serve the kremlin , you are first of all rich and secondly you are in a very safe position
