a stag party in las vegas is usually the cue to go a little crazy
but the groom , my mate justin jacob , was adamant he did n't want ' crazy '
after all , we are all older and wiser now â¦ las vegas was n't the first choice among our party - we had originally planned to go to thailand
' as justin jacob 's best man , it was my job to organise the stag party - and i discovered what a nightmare that can be
we planned a three - night trip
las vegas is home to many stag and hen parties - but the groom on jeff 's trip said he did n't want ' crazy ' we stayed at the cosmopolitan , one of the newer hotels in las vegas
it 's vast - just walking from one end to the other takes about half an hour
it has great shops and 14 different restaurants , including stk , a steakhouse which also has branches in new york and la
like most of the hotels in las vegas , the the cosmopolitan is very skilfully laid out so that it does n't matter where you are going to or coming from , at some point on your journey through the hotel you will find yourself passing the slot machines and the gaming tables
you plan to go to bed , for example , and then you get sucked into going to a pool party when you get to your room at the end of the day , you 're unlikely to have any change in your pockets - it will all have been eaten by the ' slots '
as the best man , jeff ( left ) was ' mr sensible ' on the trip , and looked after the groom - to - be justin jacob ( right ) we did n't start off with a carefully drafted plan about how we spend our days in las vegas - instead , we decided that we would all meet up at certain points
' we looked at going on a grand canyon tour , but in the end we never really escaped the hotel scene â las vegas really sucked us in , chewed us up and spat us out ! half the time you 're not sure whether it 's breakfast or whether you should be getting ready for a night out while we had planned to take it easy , in the end we partied like we did when we were in our 20s
