orlando , florida kaka grins as he recalls being mobbed by a boisterous crowd chanting his name at a florida airport arrivals hall in the early summer of 2014
the graceful brazilians midfielder once of sao paulo , ac milan and real madrid has become used to such fevered adulation over the years
but it was n't the loyal apostles of real madrid 's ultras sur , the curva sud milano or even his compatriots in the unmistakeable yellow of a selecao with whom he won a world cup in 2002 that provided the heroes welcome in question
instead it was a passionate crowd festooned in the less heralded purple and white of orlando city , one of the newest franchises in mls
local news stations carried live pictures of kaka 's plane touching down
also ( at ) my presentation downtown , i was very , very happy , " kaka said
the mls is now approaching its 20th season but has long been pejoratively regarded outside north america as a retirement home for once top - level players -- a plastic , commercially driven product devoid of any real identity offering one last payday before the limbs give out
aged 32 and no doubt the recipient of a handsome remuneration package , there will be many who question whether kaka is merely jetting in to boost his bank balance before calling it a day
relaxed and polite as ever , kaka himself is having none of this
there was once a time when every kaka goal resulted in a lifting of his jersey to reveal a t - shirt which stated " jesus christ loves you " or " i belong to jesus christ
" talking of moments , kaka describes how moving to the u.s. was always a long - term ambition
upon meeting orlando city majority owner flavio augusto da silva in brazil a number of years ago , the pair discussed the potential of working together
kaka points to other high - profile players like steven gerrard , frank lampard , david villa and giovinco being attracted to the league as proof of its appeal and progress
in a few years , we will listen a lot about the mls , " he said
the forthcoming mls season marks the first of a new eight - year tv deal and media rights partnership with espn , fox sports and univision
on top of this , average attendance across the league for the 2014 season was the highest in recent mls history , according to data on the mls attendance blog
a report from forbes magazine in late 2013 found only 10 out of 19 mls franchises were making any money
critics might also argue that the players mentioned by kaka are past their very best with the possible exception of the 28 - year - old giovinco
he reveals he still harbors ambitions of continuing his international career and even making the world cup in russia 2018
in four years , we have another world cup , " said kaka , who will be 36 in 2018
so i hope i can play another world cup
" just mentioning the world cup in the presence of a brazilians can be tense after the trauma of last year 's incredible semifinal in belo horizonte
" " that was very hard for us , " said kaka even though he was n't selected for the tournament
" that defeat in our country , in the semifinal world cup it 's very , very difficult
" kaka hopes that many of his compatriots will keep up with the mls and his career in orlando now that he 's exhibiting his much admired talents there
a lot of people will see the orlando city playing in mls
" and despite earlier talk of an extended international career and making world cup 2018 , there really is only one goal at the forefront of his mind
i hope one day i can win the league with orlando city , " he said
