a crocodile - like amphibian that was the size of a small car dominated prehistoric lakes more than 200 million years ago , a new study has found
palaeontologists discovered the fossilised remains of the ' super salamander ' while excavating on the site of an ancient lake in southern portugal
the predator , which grew to be around two metres ( 6.5 ft ) in length and lived in lakes and rivers during the late triassic period , has been named metoposaurus algarvensis
the researchers behind the discovery , which was made in mudstone flats close to loulã© , in the algarve of southern portugal , say that the new species was similar to other primitive amphibian that were widespread at the time
' it was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head , which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut
' scientists said the giant creature ( illustrated ) would have terrorised lakes during the rise of the dinosaurs the researchers , whose work is published in the journal of vertebrate paleontology , discovered the remains of metoposaurs algarvensis on the bed of an ancient lake
it was found within a large bed of bones where several hundred of the creatures may have died when the lake dried up
the image above shows the fossilised skulls of metoposaurus algarvensis excavated in portugal 's algarve so far the researchers have excavated just four square meters of the lake and say they could find hundreds of creatures preserved in the mudstone
