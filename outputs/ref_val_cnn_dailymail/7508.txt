ronny deila will use international week to scout for celtic signings but he and his spies are more likely to be spotted at under - 21 or national youth team games than a euro 2016 qualifier over the next 10 days
ronny deila wants his club to gain a standing in world football on a par with ajax for their development and production of young talent
however , it is unlikely that ronny deila will be throwing a few million pounds to secure any eye - catching signing that would raise supporter expectations ahead of that late summer campaign
ronny deila ( centre ) wants to implement the same youth production standards as ajax in the future he explained : â we will bring in players but i think we will bring in younger players to build the next generation behind the current one
the celtic boss will use the international break as an opportunity to scout potential younger talent celtic have a great chance of completing a domestic treble and thrashed dundee united once again â we have to think younger and give them the chance to get in the squad and train with the best ones
â ronny deila helped real madrid wonder kid martin odegaard on to early stardom by handing him his first - team debut at 15 in norway
while celtic would not stand a chance of tempting him to scotland when spanish , german or english giants are scrapping for his signature , ronny deila believes less precocious talent than martin odegaard can be mined then nurtured into better long - term prospects under him
