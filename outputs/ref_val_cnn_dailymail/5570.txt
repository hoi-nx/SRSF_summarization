former vice president cheney , defending the republican against charges of bigotry , says its president obama and attorney general holder who are ' playing the race card ' and not the other way around
' to say that we criticize , or that i criticize , obama or holder because of race , i just think it âs obviously not true , ' cheney said
' my view of it is the criticism is merited because of performance â or lack of performance , because of incompetence
' cheney addressed the subject during a 10 - hour long interview with journalist james rosen , a portion of which appeared on playboy 's website late tuesday night
former vice president cheney , seen here on the set of meet the press in december , says it 's ' obviously not true ' that republican criticisms of president obama and attorney general holder are race - related ' certainly we have nât given up â nor should we give up â the right to criticize an administration and public officials , ' the former george w. bush administration and bush senior administration official said after james rosen asked him if there is any ' truth ' to past suggestions by obama and holder that republican opposition to the president is race - related
holder has conjectured numerous times that republican hostility to the president and his policies are based , at least partly , on obama 's race
he again claimed in an interview several weeks ago with politico that racism was sometimes an underlying factor in the administration 's struggles with congressional republican
' there have been times when i thought that âs at least a piece of it , ' holder acknowledged
' cheney also chastised the obama administration in his sit - down with james rosen for habitually viewing large - scale controversies through the frame of race
' it 's president obama and attorney general holder , seated here in the roosevelt room of the white house in february with senior adviser to the president valerie jarrett , who are ' playing the race card ' and not the other way around , cheney charged he further took obama to task over decisions he 's made in the last six years as commander in chief , since taking the baton from george w. bush in 2009 , that cheney , the former no. 2 government official , believes are to the detriment of america and have led to the unraveling of the stability abroad that he and bush senior helped put in place
where do you start ? ' cheney replied when james rosen nudged him to say that obama had ' intentionally ' or ' inadvertently ' undone his predecessor 's work
passing judgement on the democratic president 's handling of iraq , cheney said it was a ' huge mistake ' for obama to withdraw troops and ' we are paying a price for it now
obama 's so - called ' apology tour ' in cairo , egypt in 2009 was also ' a huge mistake , ' cheney proclaimed
' i think he âs done enormous damage to the military , ' cheney , a former defense secretary under bush senior said , repeating old lines of attack on obama , who had no military experience when he took office
' cheney said he is ' absolutely convinced ' that a future president ' will be faced with a major crisis and will not have the military capability he needs to deal with it ' because of obama 's actions

they are pictured here talking to the press in the oval office in 2002 ahead of cheney 's 10 - day trip across the middle east and europe to discuss with allies the iraq situation while obama has advocated for a leaner military , it is , ironically , conservatives in congress who are currently standing in the way of a massive increase in defense spending to replace the armed services divisions depleted coffers
