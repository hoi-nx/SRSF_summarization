united nations tour groups and diplomats breeze past a nondescript display of 35 blown - up photos printed on poster board
sharma , visiting the united nations from india , gasps when she realizes what she is looking at
it 's a no - frills exhibition of photos taken by a man who is being called " caesar , " a syria government defector whose job it was to take photos of dead detainees for the military police
captions on the photos show that many of them were taken inside military hospitals , and accuse syria president bashar al-assad 's regime in the torture and killings
the photos show emaciated bodies
it 's a sight that gave pause to frantzen , who works at the united nations and was running late to a meeting
that 's partly why moustafa , senior political adviser to the coalition for a democratic syria , said he placed the photos in this location
he wanted to bring awareness to the public and put pressure on u.n. security council member states to vote for the international criminal court to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity in syria
" if you compare it to the horrendous crimes of the bashar al-assad regime , it does n't get , i feel , it does n't get the same coverage
" the syria mission to the united nations did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the exhibit
