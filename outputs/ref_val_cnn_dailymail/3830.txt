louis van gaal has been here before with the press questioning him , his players seemingly confused by his philosophy and the public bemused as the season tailspins into mediocrity
the only difference on the previous occasion was that van gaal tired of the challenge and gave up
it was 2008 and he was at az alkmaar , an admittedly different proposition to united
he resigned from az alkmaar in march 2008
louis van gaal , pictured in training on friday , takes united to face liverpool at anfield wayne rooney celebrates scoring united 's final goal in their 3 - 0 win against tottenham last weekend van gaal , pictured in 2007 , resigned as manager of az alkmaar only to return to the club and win the title but then something remarkable occurred in the form of a players ' mutiny
the team rebelled against van gaal 's own decision to walk out leave them and demanded him back
' we felt insulted when the club told us van gaal was leaving , ' said kew jaliens
' the entire squad , felt that van gaal is the right man and the only man who could take this club and our squad to a higher level
' as united travel to liverpool on sunday with champions league qualification hanging in the balance , the question is whether united 's players and directors would do the same for van gaal today
of course , thing are n't quite as bad as they were at az alkmaar
and last week 's 3 - 0 win against tottenham was a possibly the first sign that a new successful united team could emerge in the post-ferguson era
stijn schaars , pictured during his days as an az alkmaar player , did not want van gaal to leave the club antonio valencia , ander herrera and radamel falcao ( left to right ) train ahead of their trip to anfield indeed before sunday 's game at anfield , van gaal was confident enough to talking about extending his time at old trafford beyond his current three - year deal
i do n't know how i would react in the circumstances when united ask me to extend , and if i should do that
' perhaps their 3 - 0 win over tottenham last weekend could be viewed as the united players own vote of confidence in their manager
wayne rooney later revealed that he had spoken to the team the night before and certainly it seemed as though they might have finally ' got ' the elusive van gaal philosophy
and not before time : sunday 's clash with liverpool could be defining for judging van gaal 's first season a success or failure
van gaal has revealed the united job will be his last but he could extend his contract at old trafford but van gaal needs to demonstrate that united are making progress and qualification for the champions league is the only tangible way to do so
at times united 's players seem to be inhibited by van gaal
some at united believe he has been in danger of losing credibility among the players at times when he spoke about his ' philosophy ' , given the amount of times he has changed his formation
in addition , the players have seemed ' strangled ' by van gaal at times , said one united source
they remember him there as coach brought back discipline to the squad and who introduced fresh intensity and a crisper , sharper passing game , a tactical prerequisite for a modern elite champions league club
that famous meeting , when the players begged him to stay at the dutch club was a heated and emotional affair in which van gaal demanded the fill support and commitment of the players if he were to stay
