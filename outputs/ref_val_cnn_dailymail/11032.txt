hitch , is being touted as the tinder for matchmakers , as it lets people set up two facebook friends
named after the will smith film about a romantic guru who helps singles find love , the idea for the app was inspired after founder anton gu met a mutual friend one night but felt too bashful to ask his chums for her number
although singles are set up with each other anonymously initially , matchmakers can see how many messages the pair have exchanged once they 've chosen to reveal their identities
the idea for the app all stemmed from a thwarted encounter
founder anton gu , from london , said : ' in february last year i went to a gig with a group of friends
hitch founder anton gu says the idea behind the app was simple : ' i was single
i made an app. ' and it 's not only been a professional success for anton gu , but a romantic one too to create a hitch , you log in through facebook and select two friends you want to introduce
he said : ' by the time the app was out , that girl from the gig was dating someone
' hitch is available in 50 countries and around 2,000 hitches are made in the uk each month
having a mutual friend makes communication very easy , meaning that 85 per cent of hitches result in conversation friends know better : hitch is available to download in 50 countries , and users have increased particularly quickly in india , where matchmaking is a popular culture he added that women are better matchmakers than men
he said : ' i liked the idea of both setting up my friends and being set up anonymously
' joel holford , 22 , says he likes the idea of hitch , but points to the fact that it relies on many of your friends having the app too
