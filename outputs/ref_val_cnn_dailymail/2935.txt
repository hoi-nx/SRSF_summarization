warning : glyphosate is most commonly used in the popular weedkiller roundup a weedkiller used in millions of gardens has been identified as a potential cancer risk
the world health organisation âs cancer agency asked a group of 17 international scientists to decide whether glyphosate posed a risk to humans
the iarc ( iarc ) declared that the chemical , which is the world âs most widely used weedkiller , is a â probable human carcinogen â
glyphosate is most commonly used in the popular weedkiller roundup , which is made by the american agro-chemical giant monsanto
the firm â which strongly disputes the iarc âs findings â sells the herbicide to farmers in the american , where crops can be genetically modified to give them immunity to glyphosate
use of the chemical has soared in the past decade , and it has been found in water and food on the shelves in the uk , including bread and cereal bars
it concluded that there was evidence that glyphosate can cause tumours in mice and rats in laboratory experiments â and could cause dna damage to human cells
the firm âs head of global regulatory affairs philip miller pointed to a four - year evaluation of glyphosate which was carried out for the eu by the german government , and concluded that the chemical was â unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk in humans â
â some academic experts were also critical of the findings
