it comes to something when even guardiola looks surprised
after all , the former barcelona coach has seen the messi show many times before
on the training fields of barcelona âs ciutat esportiva joan gamper training centre , on the slick , wet grass of the nou camp and at the best europe stadia , guardiola has watched messi make fools of many

messi âs free - kicks were nât up to much on wednesday
after all , if we accept that we have the first flawless footballer in our midst then where do we go from there ? pretty much everything else , however , was exemplary and it was a nutmeg on james milner by the near touchline in the first half that provoked one of the most memorable reactions of the season from guardiola
as james milner disappeared in to a place no footballer ever wishes to go , messi was away up the field , scampering towards the retreating figures of kompany and martin demichelis with savage intent
on nights like this , messi will terrify the best defenders and , here , manchester city âs pair resembled pedestrians stranded on the central reservation of a motorway
messi is nât the only one with the moves
if this is to be manuel pellegrini âs final act in europe as manager of manchester city then he will leave with messi âs scampering image burned on to the back of his eyes

in case messi is ever interested
they âve certainly got plenty of tunel vision at the nou camp thanks to messi
when manchester city look back on the goal that effectively ended this tie , they will ask questions
here in catalonia , however , the locals will have taken home only memories of the way that messi drifted infield from the right , dragging manchester city defenders towards him like moths before lifting the perfect pass in to rakitic âs path
not long after barcelona âs goal , messi did pretty much the same thing again
manchester city did nât help themselves
martin demichelis looked paralysed â perhaps he was just too aware of what his international team - mate can do â while manchester city âs central midfield players failed palpably once again to locate the barcelona midfield players queuing up to adorn messi âs creative work

the manchester city goalkeeper got the better of messi at the end of the first leg , of course
