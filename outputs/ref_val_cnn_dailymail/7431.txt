england verdict in one sense disappointment because that was the fourth straight year england have finished runners - up
on the other hand , england are growing and improving and i am very positive and excited about this team
if they work massively on their defence , ensure the full might and power of england âs front five can be brought into every game and become far more clinical in their decision - making at key moments they can achieve great things
england are going to be incredibly tough to beat at twickenham this autumn and that âs a good place to be in a world cup
england 's players form a huddle after narrowly missing out on the six nations title to ireland on saturday head coach stuart lancaster walks down the tunnel after watching his country 's 55 - 35 victory against france what did stuart lancaster get right and wrong ? 15
chris robshaw bench : marler , t youngs , wilson , parling , wood , care , farrell , tuilagi right : he has nailed down the first - choice half - back combination â george ford and ben youngs â and that is huge
ford has been impressive from the start and ben youngs has finished the tournament like a train
the coach has also given jonathan joseph his head at 13 and england have a real cutting edge at outside centre , supported by two fast - developing wings
the first - choice england backs , with the exception of 12 , pick themselves now and have a tournament together under their belt
george ford ( pictured ) , alongside ben youngs , have formed a first - choice half - back combination wrong : stuart lancaster missed a golden opportunity to check on danny cipriani âs form by starting him against scotland , when i would also have tried slade at 12
england have also missed out by not getting steffon armitage involved because there are occasions when the back row has looked unbalanced and one - paced
no danny cipriani against ireland , then he was brought on at full back on saturday when it cried out for him to play at inside centre
also , why bring on richard wigglesworth , who is just not an impact player , for ben youngs with 10 minutes left against france ? ben youngs was enjoying the game of his life and when the adrenaline is pumping you can achieve remarkable things
stuart lancaster missed an opportunity to start danny cipriani ( centre ) against scotland during the six nations how can england improve their defence ? england conceded 11 tries in the tournament and though i would discount the france game as an extraordinary one - off , they still coughed up sloppy scores in other games
ben youngs goes over the line to give england an early lead in their must - win six nations clash against france leicester tigers star ben youngs jumps for joy after scoring the first try of the match on saturday evening player of the tournament my england player of the tournament is george ford , who has quickly proved himself a real gem
he is the man who has started bringing out the full potential of a talented and dangerous england back division
my player of the tournament , though , is ireland flanker sean oâbrien , who is a force of nature when fully fit
he set the tone for ireland in their important win over england and his display against the scots on saturday was the most impactful individual performance of the tournament
ford ( centre ) is my england player of the tournament - he has proved himself as a real talent are irish worthy champions ? yes , totally
they outplayed and out - thought england in dublin and their more expansive â but ruthless â game plan at murrayfield was delivered perfectly
warren gatland never gets the full credit he deserves and he will have wales fine - tuned by september champagne moment in fact it was a eureka moment ! it was when george ford took that quick line - out throw on england âs own line in the first half on saturday and started a brilliant counter-attack that ended with ben youngs going in under the posts
george ford slides in to score england 's fourth try of the afternoon and first of the second half against france and finally the french ! i do nât buy for one minute this idea that the t14 is diluting their talent
