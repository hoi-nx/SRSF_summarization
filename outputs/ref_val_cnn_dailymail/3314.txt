knox is pictured above in seattle last month a juror who helped to convict amanda has revealed she has ' grave doubts ' over the american 's involvement in the murder of rudy guede
job centre worker ballerini , who served on a panel of citizen judges that reinstated knox 's murder conviction last year , has slammed the prosecution 's case citing ' questionable proof , flimsy evidence and bizarre testimony '
the motive put forward by prosecutors that knox killed miss kercher after she complained about the american leaving the bathroom dirty seemed like ' nonsense ' , she said
miss ballerini , 48 , suggested that the pair did not get a fair trial because there was ' an atmosphere of guilt ' in the deliberation room before it even began
knox and former boyfriend sollecito served four years for the brutal killing but were freed on appeal in 2011
but last year an appeal court reinstated the original convictions ordering the pair to serve 28 and 25 years respectively
italy 's highest court will hear knox and sollecito 's final appeal next week
if convicted italy can request knox 's extradition
but while the supreme court could rubber stamp the conviction later this month , miss ballerini 's claims could derail the case

miss ballerini said : ' i said immediately that i did not agree and they took note
knox ( above with police ) reacts after hearing the verdict during her appeal trial in perugia on october 3 , 2011 miss ballerini added that ' there was not enough [ evidence ] , in my opinion , to justify such a heavy sentence '
the couple are pictured above kissing after miss kercher 's body was discovered sollecito was described in the initial trial as ' depraved ' , because he read violent manga comics , but miss ballerini said reading comics or watching cartoons did not amount to being a killer
he has given three different accounts of the murder and never said that knox and sollecito were with him , she pointed out
continuing to pick apart the case she said it was strange that knox and sollecito had barely left a trace of dna in the room where rudy guede 's body was found whereas rudy guede left ' a good number ' of marks
