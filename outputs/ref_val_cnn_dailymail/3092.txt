the holiday of a lifetime turned into a nightmare for an australia man when the formerly fit university lecturer was left stranded in a foreign hospital for five weeks after a severe stroke john ( right ) and christine rose were on a holiday in slovenia in june last year , visiting their daughter smon and their grandson ( left ) , when the sprightly 70 - year - old suffered an unexpected and significant stroke ' the whole experience was terribly traumatic
seeing your father have a stroke and nearly die is awful enough , and then to have the company not provide coverage just made everything worse , ' mr rose 's daughter , smon told daily mail australia
mr rose had no pre-existing medical conditions , and was extremely fit for his age , riding 35 kilometres to his work on the gold coast each day
the stroke left the mr rose with severe memory loss - to the extent that he could not remember which country he was in - and without the ability to walk
mrs christine rose was initially assigned a case worker , but over the course of five weeks allegedly spoke with at least 18 different staff members with allianz global assistance , who she claims had not read the case notes before they rang her
he lost 18 kilograms while he was in hospital , and every time my mum asked why allianz global assistance was unable to fly my dad home they came up with an excuse , ' she said
the christine rose 's claim that the delay in funding by allianz global assistance prevented mr rose from receiving the rehab he needed the 70 - year - old ( before the stroke ) was rushed to hospital where he waited five weeks to be sent home ' in emails they blamed ' world events ' and ' time zone differences ' , which made no sense because we were checking them all the time
a statement from allianz global assistance said that it was important to highlight that ' what may be interpreted as â taking time â to make decisions and get someone home is actually a highly rigorous process that has the safety and well - being of the patient at the forefront of every decision
mrs christine rose was informed that allianz global assistance was waiting on a report from her husband 's neurologist to confirm that he had not had a pre-existing medical condition and that their claim was valid , despite providing medical history to the company when they took out the insurance
a customer service representative allegedly told mrs christine rose that the company was trying to prove that her husband did have a condition , in order to avoid paying the claim
mr rose spent five weeks in the ljubljana hospital in slovenia ( above ) , and lost 18 kilograms mr rose was also not able to start rehabilitation while he was in the slovenia hospital , as the doctors understood him to be leaving any day to go back to australia ' when we are informed that one our customers requires medical treatment we ensure that we are obtaining medical information from the treating medical team overseas
mr rose was also not able to start rehabilitation while he was in the slovenia hospital , as the doctors understood him to be leaving any day to go back to australia
ms smon said that despite doctors at the slovenia hospital recommending that mr rose be flown back to australia lying down with trained medical nurses to accompany him , allianz global assistance asked for a family member to fly with him
mr rose 's daughter said that allianz global assistance did not provide an ambulance to transport mr rose to the airport mr rose with his grandson before the stroke , which left him unable to walk and significant memory problems she said that the chief medical officer of allianz global assistance directly denied the recommendations of the hospital , which her family believes was due to the high cost of contacting the nurses
' within two hours i had been contacted by allianz global assistance and the funding to send my father back to australia was all approved
' mr rose 's daughter said that allianz global assistance did not provide an ambulance to transport mr rose to the airport , and had never been contacted by the company 's local agent , who was meant to be organising all the paperwork on the ground
mr rose ( above left , with his wife ) had no pre-existing medical conditions , and was extremely fit for his age , riding 35 kilometres to his work on the gold coast each day ms smon said that her mother ( left ) has never received any follow up on the incident , despite sending multiple emails , and has been left quite traumatised by the whole experience ' airlines can take up to 7 days to clear a patient for travel as it requires their medical team being happy with the information as well as clearance from the engineering team
