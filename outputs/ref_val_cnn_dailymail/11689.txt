overly ambitious , feasible or simply just a scam - whatever your view on the mars one mission , it has at least inspired people to think of colonising other worlds
and now a sketch for the project has revealed the habitat the first astronauts on mars could reside in - if they ever get there
it includes living quarters , a laboratory , a greenhouse and even a holodeck to give the crew the best conditions possible on the red planet
hover cursor over the image below to zoom in danish space architect kristian von bengtson revealed his sketch for mars one 's habitat on the red planet ( shown )
the concept includes living quarters , a laboratory and even a holodeck
there are two habitats in total , one for ' living ' ( left ) and one for ' work ' ( right )

in february 100 people - including five britons - were shortlisted for the questionable mars one mission , which claims it will send people to live on the red planet
' the large cut in candidates [ from 200,000 to 100 ] is an important step towards finding out who has the right stuff to go to mars , ' said bas lansdorp , co-founder of the dutch mars one mission
mars one made headlines around the world in february when it revealed the final longlist of 100 applicants who will train on earth for a one - way mission to the red planet in 2025
but the proposed mission has been widely criticised ever since it was first announced in 2011 - and experts have said this latest announcement does nothing to silence the sceptics
lack of funding , no signs of development and an overly ambitious â reality tv â approach have all been cited as reasons that mars one will never be more than a pipe dream
â they say they can put a first crew on mars for $ 6 billion [ Â£ 3.9 billion ] , which is a shoestring budget compared to the apollo programme which cost $ 25 billion [ Â£ 16.2 billion ] - and that was in 1960s money ! â it could be you : pictured are some of the mars one hopefuls , who will be spending eight years in training ahead of what they think will be a mission to mars , although the mission has been widely criticised for the lack of a feasible plan to actually get to the red planet in the sketch the habitat has a social area with a â holodeck â to keep the crew entertained
â but even the first step of securing enough large rockets to launch the mission to mars has not been demonstrated by mars one
this would have documented the training and lives of the astronauts on the red planet
