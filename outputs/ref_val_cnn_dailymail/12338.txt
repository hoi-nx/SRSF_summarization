there is plenty of noise surrounding the nuclear deal that is being negotiated with iran
but for all the heat generated by israel prime minister netanyahu 's speech to congress and an ill - conceived , panicky letter to iran 's leadership organized by cotton -- the latest debate is creating little light
indeed , it may actually be obscuring the fundamental issue of iran 's own foreign policies -- and whether tehran 's destabilizing activities abroad should preclude a deal at all
yet the question that netanyahu did not answer , and which sen. cotton and his 46 colleagues have not even asked , is what exactly should be done about iran 's activities abroad ? many in congress fail to grasp that foreign minister javad zarif and his colleagues in iran 's cabinet , with their united states - phds and understanding of plural democracies , are not cut from the same cloth as the hardliners in charge of iran 's quds force ( its commander , qasem suleimani turns up in lebanon and iraq despite a travel and asset ban )
to answer the question of what to do about iran 's activities , it is important to understand that the nuclear agreement , while it has little to do with iran 's arms transfers or extracurricular activities in the region , can lay the groundwork for a far more serious engagement about iran 's role in the region -- and in a manner that addresses head - on the concerns of its sunni neighbors , many of whom are eager to resume longstanding trading relationships with iran
the reality is that iran 's reemergence into the international community in a postnuclear deal environment would allow the gcc ( gcc ) to assert its interests in the region , and to lay out expectations of iran as a constructive partner
and there is no need to rely on iran 's word that it will refrain from such activities
ultimately , as important as the nuclear issue is , the real promise of a deal is only partially about limiting the country 's nuclear ambitions -- it is also about returning stability to a shattered region , exhausted and impoverished by war
