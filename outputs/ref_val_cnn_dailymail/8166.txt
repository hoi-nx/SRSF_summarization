banks have experimented with card readers and even fingerprint scanners but in the near future you could access your accounts using your heartbeat
halifax has recently completed a successful trial of ' cardiac authentication ' for its online accounts using the nymi band

halifax ( branch pictured ) recently completed a successful trial of ' cardiac authentication ' for its online accounts using the nymi band
nymi reads the wearer 's heart rhythms , which is said to be as unique as a person 's fingerprint , to authenticate who they are a built - in proximity sensor can then detect where they are , and when the wearer is close to a paired device , will automatically confirm their identity and unlock the account
in particular , the bracelet contains a heartid sensor that measures the amount of electrical power generated by a human heart , called a cardiac rhythm tracked on an electrocardiogram , or ecg
this ecg differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart
nymi only works with a registered person 's cardiac rhythm , meaning if the bracelet is stolen it ca n't be hacked
the bracelet contains a heartid sensor that measures electrical power generated by a human heart tracked on an electrocardiogram , or ecg when the wearer clasps the nymi around their wrist , the bracelet powers on
when the wearer clasps the nymi around their wrist , the bracelet powers on
the nymi functions on a three - factor security system - the bracelet , a unique heartbeat and an aad ( aad ) , which is a device registered with the app. nymi vibrates and built - in leds light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them
the nymi functions on a three - factor security system - the bracelet , a unique heartbeat and an aad ( aad ) , which is a smartphone or device registered with the app. when the nymi authenticates a user it looks at the shape of their ecg wave , not their heart rate
when connected to an account , the band could , in theory , be used to pay for goods using contactless readers too ( example shown ) an ecg differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart
nymi only works with a registered person 's cardiac rhythm , meaning if the bracelet is stolen it ca n't be hacked
