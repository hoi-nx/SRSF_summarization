worst affected will be the west coast main line , where virgin has told passengers not to bother trying to travel
on easter sunday a 55 - minute direct trip from rugby to london will turn into a marathon lasting four hours and 20 minutes , with two trains and two buses
â failures : poor planning , equipment failures and communication breakdowns contributed to the christmas train chaos , including a crush at finsbury park ( pictured ) , a report has found other services blighted by engineering works include london midland , which uses the same west coast line and has issued a similar warning , and swathes of the great western and greater anglia lines
however , the warnings have brought fears of a repeat of the last fiasco endured by 115,000 passengers at christmas when the key east coast main line was crippled by overrunning engineering works , prompting a major inquiry , damning rebukes from ministers and watchdogs , and a grovelling apology from rail bosses
cancellations : the report found that when work near king 's cross overran the trains were switched to start and finish at finsbury park station but ' not enough was done ' to manage passenger flow at the new station under a large headline on its website , virgin warns passengers of the impending easter chaos with the words : â there âs a spanner in the works
â engineering works on the line between crewe and warrington and from carlisle to glasgow will â severely reduce services to the north and scotland â , it said
services are also likely to be â extra busy the day before and after affected days â and passengers should book early
west coast passengers also face major works at watford junction from an Â£ 81million programme from network rail â to improve the ageing infrastructure â
