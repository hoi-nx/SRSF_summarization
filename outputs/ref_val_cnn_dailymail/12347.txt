but increasingly , marriage is becoming a marker of class privilege in america , something increasingly reserved for the affluent
if progressives want to tackle the scourge of inequality , then the retreat from marriage is an issue they ca n't ignore
the reality is that the retreat from marriage is pervading the working middle class -- the two - thirds of america without a college degree
this is occurring even as in upscale america , marital bonds remain comparatively strong
" this is the marriage gap , and it 's something new in america , " declares a manifesto on " marriage opportunity " unveiled in a recent washington monthly cover story
) " over the past several decades , the norm of marriage has eroded across all economic and educational classes , but much less among the elite , " they write
" but for millions of middle - and lower - class america , marriage is increasingly beyond reach , creating more fractured and difficult family lives , more economic insecurity for single parents , less social mobility for those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder , more childhood stress , and a fraying of our common culture
" true , overall america marriage rates have fallen from 72 % of america adults in 1960 to just 51 % in 2012 , according to the economist
marriage in america , it seems , is becoming another luxury item for economic elites to enjoy
so why should we worry ? " declining marriage rates may not be concerning on their own , but while america are forgoing marriage , they are not forgoing childbearing , " say isabel sawhill and joanna venator of the brookings institution
it 's true that more children are being raised by cohabiting couples , but in the america ( unlike some european countries ) these relationships tend to be unstable and short - lived
high marriage rates in upper middle - class america make the link between family structure and economic success abundantly clear
for example , economists robert lerman and w. bradford wilcox estimate that the median income of families with children would be 44 % higher today if america had the same marriage rates we had in 1980
rather than actively promoting marriage -- something government has shown it does n't really know how to do -- the opportunity agenda aims at removing impediments to marriage , especially for non-elite america
they envision a possible political bargain in which conservatives accept gays as allies in fortifying marriage , and liberals recognize that family breakdown is magnifying america 's disparities of wealth and income
could expanding marriage opportunity really become common ground in america 's intensely polarized culture wars ? it seems like an extravagant hope
