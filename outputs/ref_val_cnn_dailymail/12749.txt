with tensions running high after the shooting of two officers in ferguson , missouri , state and county police took over protest security in the st. louis suburb thursday
st. louis county police and the state highway patrol are assuming " command of the security detail regarding protests , " st. louis county police said , while ferguson police will remain responsible for " routine policing services " in the city
the takeover came less than a day after two police officers standing guard outside ferguson police headquarters were shot in what st. louis police chief belmar called an " ambush , " spurring a manhunt for those responsible for targeting the line of officers
" we could have buried two police officers , " belmar told reporters
" belmar said several people " have been very forthright " with investigators , but authorities have n't released the names of any possible suspects
investigators believe they have identified two people they want to question in the shooting , and one of them might be the shooter , a law enforcement official said
police are also trying to find anyone who may have helped the shooter get away
this is n't the first time that county police and state troopers have stepped in to handle protest security
when clashes between police and protesters boiled over last year , missouri 's governor declared a state of emergency and tapped the state highway patrol to take over
after that emergency declaration expired in december , ferguson police resumed command of protest security
officers from other agencies have continued to provide backup at larger protests
at a candlelight vigil thursday night near the scene of the shooting , religious leaders led prayers for the wounded police officers and protesters
dozens of demonstrators gathered again outside the police headquarters thursday night
this time , jeff roorda of the st. louis police officers association said , the security situation on the streets is different
while the demonstrators ' focus was ferguson , neither of the wounded officers works in that st. louis suburb 's police department
one is from webster groves , a city about 13 miles south of ferguson
" so did the white house , with a tweet signed with president barack obama 's initials offering prayers for the wounded officers and calling " violence against police ... unacceptable
" and u.s. attorney general holder , who visited ferguson in the aftermath of brown 's shooting and unrest that spurred , decried what happened as a " heinous and cowardly ( and ) repugnant attack
" this was not someone trying to bring healing to ferguson
it 's not known what connection , if any , the shooter or shooters had to wednesday night 's protest
that 's why they congregated in ferguson , to demand changes like disbanding the city 's entire police department and ousting mayor james knowles
at its peak , some 150 protesters congregated wednesday night in front of the ferguson police station , belmar said
and then there 's the likelihood of more protests and the possibility of more violence as well
even though jackson , city manager john shaw , ferguson 's top court clerk and two police officers are gone or on their way out , some activists are vowing to keep pressing for change
" we are n't satisfied with this , " reed said of the police chief 's exit
" it 's a step in the right direction , but it 's not what total justice looks like in ferguson
" jackson expressed optimism that , in his view , the justice department report concluded that ferguson " can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be
" and belmar said it underscores the fact that , eight months after brown 's death , the streets of ferguson are still simmering and law enforcement officers there are on edge
