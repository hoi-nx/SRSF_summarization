getting through senior school has never been easy , but with the invention of smart phones and social media , running the teenage gauntlet has become twice as hard
a new documentary series called teens , which airs its first episode tonight on channel 4 , follows a group of teenagers from davenant foundation school in loughton , essex for a year and charts how modern technology has changed the way young people interact
the cameras started to follow the group in january 2014 and continued to record their antics until the end of december
what becomes clear early on in the programme is how much each teen uses their phone â whether it is to engage on social media or simply text their parents
this first episode meets jess and harry , who have both have just joined school for sixth form
â that âs when you [ use the number to ] go on whatsapp
this episode shows how social media can be a force for good among teens , by engaging them in current issues and broadening their horizons
the comment has an inflammatory effect on the pupils present , who quickly take to social media sites like twitter to attack the lecture , with many blaming jess because she organised it
later that evening , the pupils continue to whip up a storm on social media and jess reads multiple comments about herself being an attention seeker and that someone has called her fat which is retweeted several times
the producers then talk to a group of girls from the school who have also been attacked on social media
harry says : â when you say something to someone on social media , you are nât aware of the consequences
â i stick to the thing where i âd say to someone on social media what i would say to them in real life
social media and unlimited internet on smart phones has given these teens the freedom to interact with their friends all night , but they 've paid a hefty price - real expression
teens airs tonight , tuesday 24 march , on channel 4
