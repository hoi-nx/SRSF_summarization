do you have any idea how much sugar you 're eating ? it 's probably a lot more than you think
as this shocking graphic reveals , millions of us are unwittingly eating everyday foods packed with sugar - and getting fatter in the process
while some culprits , such as coca-cola and ice cream are well known ( and used here for comparison purposes ) , there are many other less obvious foods - such as pasta sauce , soup and so - called healthy granola - that are loaded with the white stuff
for example , a 500g jar of dolmio bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a mars bar
and heinz tomato soup is on par with bulmer 's cider in the sweetness stakes , with five cubes
so if you âre getting most of your sugar from these sources , you can eat up to 18 cubes daily
more and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic
â the who ( who ) recommends no more than 10 per cent of a person 's daily energy should come from free sugars - those that are added to processed foods and drinks , but also those found naturally in honey , syrups and fruit juices
that equates to around 50g or 10 cubes a day - easily reached with a bottle of fizzy drink
hidden health threat : a 500g jar of dolmio bolognaise sauce contains more than six cubes of sugar - the same as a mars bar
with the global obesity crisis spiralling out of control , health experts are becoming increasingly vocal about the dangers of ' hidden sugar ' in food
he said : ' added sugar in our diet is a very recent phenomenon and only occurred when sugar , obtained from sugar cane , beet and corn , became very cheap to produce
' the two most common forms of unhealthy added sugars are table sugar ( sucrose ) and high - fructose corn syrup , a liquid sweetener made from maize
â he added : ' while it may not be surprising that a can of coca-cola has a staggering seven cubes of sugar ( 35g ) , similar amounts can be found in the most unlikely of foods
though we all need some sugar - it is the essential fuel that powers all cells in our body - excess levels have been linked with raised levels of the hormone insulin , which increases the risk of diabetes
the theory is that glucose , one of the main ingredients in added sugar , creates repeated spikes of insulin
a large population study in the us showed that people who consumed more than 25 per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had almost three times the risk of dying from heart disease
that was compared with those people who consumed less than 10 per cent of their calories each day through sugar , independent of other risk factors including weight
