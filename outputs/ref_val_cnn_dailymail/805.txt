penalty : top lawyer romie tager qc faces a fine of Â£ 1.2million for failing to pay inheritance tax on his father 's estate a leading barrister has been ordered to pay a Â£ 1.2million penalty after he failed to pay his father 's inheritance tax bill for 10 years after his death
romie tager qc , one of the country 's top experts in commercial and property law , repeatedly refused to reveal how much his father 's estate was worth and did not respond to requests to pay inheritance tax
the barrister resigned as head of his chambers for ' personal reasons ' shortly before the tax tribunal judgment was made earlier this month
he recently defeated gordon ramsay in a high court dispute over one of the celebrity chef 's pubs , and has represented high - profile figures including david mellor
hmrc took him to a tribunal last year after it emerged that he had run up enormous bills for unpaid income and inheritance tax
mr tager 's father osias died in march 2005 without making a will , the tribunal heard , but an assessment of the size of his estate was not given to hmrc until four years later
tax officials disputed mr tager 's estimate of his father 's wealth , which was largely contained in shares , and sent mr tager a string of letters demanding further information
at a second tribunal hearing held in london in october , the judge was told that mr tager had still not sent the necessary information to hmrc
he also said it was difficult to work out the size of his father 's estate , as tager was ' secretive ' about money and had much of his wealth tied up in a variety of shareholdings
mr tager claimed that the amount of inheritance tax he owed was no more than Â£ 75,000 , but judge bishopp agreed with hmrc that the true figure was at least Â£ 1,171,020
the judge ruled that mr tager should pay a penalty totalling the entire amount of unpaid inheritance tax , along with a separate penalty for unpaid income tax , meaning that the final figure the lawyer owes is Â£ 1,246,020
cases : mr tager recently defeated gordon ramsay , left , at the high court , and he has also represented david mellor , right , in a legal dispute in a scathing judgment delivered earlier this month , he said that mr tager had done ' too little too late ' to resolve the case , and had ' repeatedly and persistently fobbed hmrc off '
if hmrc succeeds in obtaining a full record of his late father 's estate , mr tager could face a further hefty tax bill , as the penalty imposed by the tribunal does not cancel out tax liabilities
the total size of his father 's estate is not known , but if the inheritance tax assessment of Â£ 1.17million is correct then it is likely to be worth at least Â£ 3.4million
' in february selborne chambers announced that mr tager was to stand down as head of chambers ' for personal reasons '
mr tager recently won a high court case against gordon ramsay on behalf of film director love , after the celebrity chef claimed his signature had been forged on the lease for the york & albany pub in north london , which is owned by mr love
