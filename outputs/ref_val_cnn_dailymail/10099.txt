when astronomers first started taking ultraviolet images of venus , they were somewhat baffled by a mysterious â y â shape that covered the entire planet
scroll down for a video animation showing the effect spanish astronomers have revealed a new theory for a ' y ' shape on venus ( annotated image from the pioneer venus orbiter in 1979 shown )
they say it is formed by winds pushing a ' wave ' of clouds on the planet
these winds move faster at higher altitudes , creating the odd shape the latest theory was proposed by astronomers from the institute of astrophysics of andalusia ( csic ) in granada , spanish , in collaboration with the university of the basque country and the institute of astrophysics and space sciences of portugal
venus is slightly smaller than earth but has a similar mass. it is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles ( 108 million kilometres ) , and takes about 225 days to orbit the sun. one day on venus lasts as long as 243 earth days
on venus strong winds move the upper atmosphere 225 mph ( 360km/h ) , circling the planet every four to five earth days
but the planet itself takes almost 243 earth days to complete an orbit - meaning the winds are much faster than the rotation speed of the planet
' this [ atmospheric ] wave is dragged by the winds of venus , so if they are constant the wave should round the planet without getting deformed , right ? ' dr peralta , the csic - csic researcher in charge of this study , told mailonline
' winds on venus can circle the planet in four to five earth days
but the planet takes 243 earth days to rotate , amplifying the y shape
an illustration of the surface of venus is shown on the right he added that the idea was not entirely new - but his theory was the first that explained a new type of atmospheric wave , different to anything seen on earth
the wave seems to be ' pushing up ' this ultraviolet absorber from below on venus - although what this substance is , which gives the feature its dark appearance , remains a mystery
understanding the shape will allow astronomers to study the â super-rotating â nature of the venus atmosphere
â a wave with the size of the y must play a key role in explaining why the atmosphere rotates sixty times faster than the surface , so it was crucial to understand it , â said dr peralta in a release .
