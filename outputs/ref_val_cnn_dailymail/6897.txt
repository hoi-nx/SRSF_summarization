a bird that was long thought to have gone extinct has been rediscovered in myanmar after a team of scientists used a recording of the species ' distinctive call to track it down
the jerdon 's babbler ( chrysomma altirostre altirostre ) - a small brown bird similar in size to a house sparrow - was last spotted in myanmar in 1941 and was thought to have died out altogether
but a team of scientists managed to uncover multiple birds nesting in a small area of grassland in myanmar 's central bago division in may last year , according to their report published in the latest edition of birding asia
re-discovered : the jerdon 's babbler which was thought extinct for 73 years until scientists found evidence of it living in myanmar the scientists targeted some of the few remaining patches of wild grassland left along myanmar 's mighty irrawaddy river , now one of the most heavily cultivated and densely populated regions of the impoverished but emerging southeast asian nation
rheindt , from the national university of singapore , told afp he was the first person to spot the bird during the survey , which was also carried out with members of the wildlife conservation society and myanmar 's nature and wildlife conservation division
but researchers warned that the bird 's survival is still far from guaranteed given pressure on myanmar 's few remaining grasslands
' this discovery not only proves that the species still exists in myanmar but that the habitat can still be found as well , ' colin poole , director of wildlife conservation society 's regional hub in singapore , said in a statement
myanmar has more species of bird than any other country in mainland southeast asia , with ornithologists saying this number is could increase if more scientific research is conducted .
