he is the protege of total football mastermind rinus michels , but ' little general ' advocaat has been pitched straight into battle at sunderland
instead , the 67 - year - old is tasked with saving a failing side from relegation
but who is the man who , at 67 , is making his premier league debut as sunderland âs oldest - ever manager ? advocaat ( left ) in action during his playing days for roda against psv advocaat on a cycle ride when assistant coach with holland in 1987 - seen here with adri van tiggelen , ronald koeman , rene van der gijp and marco van basten advocaat has held many managerial positions both in his native holland and abroad - see here at psv in 1996 advocaat is best remembered in great britain for his two league titles with rangers in the late 1990s advocaat certainly does nât want for experience
this is the 18th job of a 28 - year managerial career which has taken in nearly 900 matches and yielded 10 major trophies
he is best known on these shores for three - and - a - half years at rangers , a stay which produced two spl titles â including a record 21 - point winning margin â two scottish cups and a league cup
he has worked with and against ronald koeman in holland manchester united manager louis van gaal is another manager that advocaat knows well former england , manchester city and leicester boss sven goran eriksson is someone else that advovaat knows from his time in the game successful , however , is not a word used to reflect on his time at the stadium of light and , after four league goals in 29 appearances , he left on a free transfer
working with premier league players will not be new to advocaat as he has come across many in his time in international football - including manchester united 's marouane fellaini while he was coach of belgium between 2009 - 10 former arsenal star andrey arshavin is another player advocaat has worked with during his time as russia manager between 2010 - 12 advocaat signed brazilian international giovane elber for german side borussia monchengladbach in 2005 during his first spell in eindhoven in the mid-nineties he lifted the dutch cup and eredivisie title , working with the likes of brazilian striker ronaldo
advocaat has nine games left in the premier league season and his aim is to ensure sunderland do n't go down despite his years of managerial experience , advocaat has never been in a relegation battle before he was hounded from his second spell as holland national - team boss after both the media and supporters were critical of his handling of the team , despite them reaching the semi-finals of euro 2004
subsequent posts at south korea and russia saw his teams fail to emerge from the group stages of world cup 2006 and euro 2012 respectively , while his latest job was an unhappy five - month period in charge of serbia , where he was sacked in november
