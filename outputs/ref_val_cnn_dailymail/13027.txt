that 's what police officers from watertown , massachusetts , described in heart - stopping detail monday , revealing details of a chaotic shootout with the boston marathon bombing suspects
one of the suspects , tsarnaev , died from injuries he sustained that day -- wounded in a gun battle , then run over by his brother , dzhokhar
dzhokhar tsarnaev managed to escape , but was later caught by police
the shootout with police in the early morning hours of april 19 , 2013 , marked one of the most dramatic chapters in the manhunt for the suspects who paralyzed the boston metropolitan area for days
it was n't long before tsarnaev and dzhokhar tsarnaev were firing guns , throwing bombs and trying to run officers over with a stolen suv , reynolds said
then the two brothers began throwing improvised explosives , including pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb , the officers testified
" maclellan said the pressure cooker bomb " was incredibly loud
" pugliese said he opened fire when he saw one of the men , tsarnaev , charging toward him
pugliese fired and the man threw his pistol at the officer , hitting him in the bicep
and with tsarnaev , who was wounded from gunfire , on the ground , the three officers tried to put him in handcuffs
they thought they 'd be able to arrest him
" we were wrestling with tsarnaev , and all of a sudden i could hear an engine revving , " reynolds said the suv , reynolds said , was heading straight toward the officers
" dzhokhar tsarnaev did not have to go back and run his brother over
he could have sped off and run away , " cullen told cnn 's " the lead with jake tapper
" the sight of the stolen suv speeding toward them caught the officers by surprise
the prosecutor asked pugliese if there was something in the road that forced the suv driver to go directly at the officers
dzhokhar tsarnaev was arrested about 8:45 p.m. that same day , hiding in a boat called the " slip away " that was stowed in a backyard in watertown
jurors saw photos of the boat last week
before the trial started , prosecutors and defense attorneys had sparred over how much of the boat jurors would get to see
in boston , about a mile from the courthouse , jurors intently looked at the entire boat monday
dzhokhar tsarnaev , wearing a dark jacket and no handcuffs or shackles , watched the jurors but showed little emotion or expression
jurors appeared to strain to make out the words tsarnaev scrawled inside the boat
