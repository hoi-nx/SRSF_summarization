according to the fashion world , the seventies are back â and there âs no one happier about it than me , as someone who lived and breathed every second of it
designers such as prada , tom ford and gucci showered catwalks last year in flares , jumpsuits , wide - brimmed hats and wild prints
but the retro revival does nât stop at the ankles ; summer stilettos have been ditched in favour of towering platforms on almost every high street in the country
as a top model during the seventies , i lived in platforms
bigger was always better , especially because â at 5 ft 8 in â i was a little on the short side for the fashion world
but now , aged 61 and with 11 grandchildren , i âm not sure i can carry them off with such aplomb
surely thin , slimming lines and elegant shapes are what i âm after rather than weighty clodhoppers ? to find out if they can ever be flattering , i put eight pairs through their paces
i had a pair of red snakeprint platforms by terry de havilland like these more than 40 years ago
