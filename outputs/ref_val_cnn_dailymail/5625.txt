researchers have mapped dark matter in several colliding galaxy clusters more than a billion light - years away
and one outcome of the research is that dark matter might not actually be composed of particles , as previously thought
' researchers in switzerland and the uk mapped dark matter in clusters ( shown in blue ) , and discovered that dark matter might be ' weirder than we thought '
surprisingly , the study discovered that dark matter â particles â may simply pass through each other when galaxy clusters collide
â this work looks at the way dark matter interacts with itself when massive clouds of it are smashed together with other massive clouds , â lead author dr harvey from efpl told mailonline
â this implies that dark matter particles do not interact with themselves , which would have caused dark matter to slow down
more importantly , the study challenges the view that dark matter consists of proton - like particles - or perhaps any particles whatsoever
â the implications for dark matter are that it rules out some models of particle dark matter , for example it challenges the idea that dark matter is made of an equivalent ' dark proton ' that is exchanging ' dark photons â , â said dr harvey
â to say we can conclude that dark matter is not a particle is too far , but we are challenging many models of dark matter , and it remains to be seen whether dark matter is a particle as many lines of research are yet to prove this
they were able to work out the pattern of distortion caused by dark matter , and make maps of where it should be harvey 's data came from the chandra x-ray space observatory and the hubble telescope , and included the famous bullet cluster collision ( shown ) , a collision of two galaxy clusters whose gas has been molded into the shape of a bullet
this particular collision is the best current evidence for the existence of dark matter dr massey , one of the authors on the study , told mailonline that it was most likely a different type of particle to what scientists had been looking for so far
all of our evidence for dark matter so far comes from its supposed gravitational effect on galaxies - but if our models of gravity are wrong , then this could be false evidence
â alternatively , dark matter could be some kind of fluid , rather than a particle with a property in space , â dr massey said
another theory is that dark matter is made out of â glue balls â , which are a conglomeration of smaller particles â glued â together in an ensemble
the researchers created the maps by studying the effects dark matter had on extremely distant galaxies
â if you hit your head against a wall of dark matter , your head would go straight through , â explained dr massey
and from their study , the researchers conclude that dark matter is even â weirder than we first thought
â if you hit your head against a wall of dark matter , your head would go straight through , â explained co-author dr massey the fascinating conclusion was that dark matter does not interact with itself - or , perhaps , even other matter - in ways we would think possible
' one major idea among astronomers is that dark matter consists of a new subatomic particle that we have n't discovered yet
in addition , dark matter speeds up the motion of galaxies inside galaxy clusters , which are collections of hundreds of galaxies , containing literally astronomical amounts of stars , planets , and gases
galaxy clusters are also 90 per cent dark matter , which makes them ideal for studying it , especially when they collide into each other and force their respective dark matters to interact
based on this knowledge , dr harvey and his colleagues studied data from 72 galaxy cluster collisions
and so far , this particular collision is the best evidence for the existence of dark matter , based on its interaction with the clusters
in the coming years , scientists will be hoping to directly observe dark matter particles in a number of detectors - including the lhc at cern
