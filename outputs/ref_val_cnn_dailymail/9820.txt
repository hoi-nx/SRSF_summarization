from witnessing the breathtakingly beauty of the guerrero mountain range to getting food poisoning in morocco , david experienced more than just feats of brilliance while filming most talented
the 31 - year - old co-host of the interactive talent show , which will be broadcast for the first time tonight , travelled to indian , mexico , italy , argentina and morocco and caught up with four people from each country
discussing the stunt , david told mailonline travel : â the local village came down to watch the event and all of them were really calm â i was this flappy english bloke who was nât sure about it
mr budati demonstrated his ability to rest a coconut on his wife âs throat and slice it in two with a machete mr budati says that he approaches the stunt by removing the audience and consequences from his thoughts and remaining calm serenity was also a theme in argentina , where david got to witness what would retrospectively become one of his favourite performances of the series â gaucho cowboy martin performing horse yoga
â his relationship with the horse was just so good , so calming
â the london - based presenter even admitted that had he been able to adopt an ability for himself , he would have chosen mr martin âs , as the skill would impress his partner â a horse enthusiast
argentine gaucho cowboy martin exerted complete control over a horse while performing yoga with it david admitted that had he been able to adopt an ability for himself he would have chosen mr martin 's so that he could impress his partner â it would have to be the horse yoga , even though there are things that were definitely cooler
â also , i like the idea of serenity and chilling out , especially as i live in london , and martin âs performance was the purest moment of utter serenity
â despite the moments of tranquillity experienced on the trip , david also endured his fair share of turmoil and a bout of food poisoning in morocco certainly took its toll
david said : â we filmed indian and morocco together and i was careful that everything was piping hot and that i was nât going to eat meat in indian â i was militant
david described aziz salhi as a real showman and was impressed by his strength and ability the presenter noted that the road had been closed and 500 people had turned out to witness aziz salhi 's show of strength â so when i got to morocco i felt like i had survived indian and paid a hefty price for playing with the rules
â morocco however did bring about some of david âs favourite moments and he recalls going to visit strongman aziz salhi , who holds off accelerating cars and keeps hold off accelerating motorbikes
not sure what to make of it ! david admits that he was slightly confused by the pizza freestylers ' act â and in the middle of all these young and hip people is a man and his son , who eat a lot of pizza , throwing pizza dough
â david âs visit to mexico also brought about its fair share of interesting characters , and the country itself had a profound effect on the presenter
mexico performer eduardo flores gets into position before head - butting a real nail threw a piece of wood shock horror ! david recoils after watching mr eduardo flores use his head to hammer a nail through a piece of wood he said : â at first i was annoyed that i was going to mexico instead of swedish
â â but mexico was so much fun
not so much mexico city , but when we travelled to acapulco we drove through a mountain range and it was just stunning , absolutely gorgeous
â david âs meeting with eduardo flores while in mexico , however â a man who head - butted a nail into a piece of wood â was less easy on the eye
cool under pressure ! in scorching temperature gurjar performs some controlled bmx yoga on a mountain â he was there banging his forehead on this nail
â other performances that caught david 's eye during the series included a man named gurjar , who performed bike yoga while perched precariously from the side of a mountain in indian
david enjoying himself by having a few midday drinks with breakdancing group impacto crew in mexico a breakdancing group called impacto crew , who the presenter admits getting slightly drunk with in the midday mexico sun , also evoked fond memories for the presenter
