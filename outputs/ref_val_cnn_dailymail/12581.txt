three - year - old irish setter thendara satisfaction -- known to his owners as jagger -- took second prize in his class at the event in birmingham , central england , on thursday
but just a day later , after returning home to belgian , he became ill. owner - breeder milligan-bott told jagger was " finding it hard to breathe " so a veterinarian was called , but the dog died before he could get there
" they found cubes of beef in his stomach that had at least two types of poison inside
pieces of beef had been stitched together so that the poison did n't come out
" he had enough in his system to kill a horse , according to the vet , " said milligan-bott , who is at a loss to explain why jagger was targeted : " we ca n't fathom why anyone would do this
a spokesperson for the kennel club , organizers of the crufts dog show , said there had never been such an incident in the history of the competition , which dates back to 1891
