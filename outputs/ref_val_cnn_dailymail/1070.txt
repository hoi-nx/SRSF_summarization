hometown boy walker held his nerve to close out victory at the valero texas open at san antonio
the ryder cup player added to his sony open title this season and three pga tour victories in 2014 as a closing 70 maintained his four - shot overnight lead
spieth was second on seven under , having perhaps left his run too late before finishing with four birdies in the last five holes
walker poses with the valero texas open trophy after recording a four - shot win walker took the trophy at his hometown tournament and now has six wins since the start of 2014 walker went into his final round with four - shot lead and managed to preserve his advantage walker birdied the par - five second when he laid up short of the green , pitched on and holed a straight eight - foot putt - though he gave the shot back at the fourth
playing partner spieth made a late bid to exert some pressure with birdies at the 14th - via a 45 - foot putt - and 15th and when his tee shot at the showpiece 16th spun back out of the fringe , there was scope for walker to crack
his birdie was matched by spieth but the four - shot margin remained and despite a poor tee shot , walker also birdied the penultimate hole with a good putt from 18 feet
spieth did likewise and both parred the last to leave walker as the tour 's first repeat winner this season
walker adds the valero texas open to the sony open title which he has already won this season spieth finished as runner - up , despite carding four birdies on the last five holes spieth said he found it hard to make par at times on the course but was walker 's closest challenger ' all this keeps adding momentum and confidence and i 'm excited to go
