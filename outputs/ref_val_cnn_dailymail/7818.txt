scientists are having extraordinary success treating cancer with new vaccines they believe could be a â game - changer â in the battle against the disease
they have worked out how to teach the body âs immune system to identify cancer cells , allowing patients to be primed to destroy cancer
in one case an us woman given just weeks to live was cleared of advanced blood cancer
she is still alive three years later , and her doctor says she is not a one - off
both methods involve taking t - cells , which fight infection , and giving them the ability to recognise a special tag on the surface of cancer cells , called the wt1 protein
the treatments aim to help the immune system seek out and destroy cancer cells they do this by giving t - cells the ability to detect a key marker called wt1 search and destroy : t - cells can be taught to identify and then kill cancer cells wt1 is a protein found on the surface of the cells of many types of cancer t - cells are a type of white blood cell , which fight infections or threats an infusion of donor stem cells â which can transform into t - cells â may also be used to boost the immune system over the past three years , specialist koehne , of the memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york , has treated 15 plasma cell leukaemia patients with t - cells taught to recognise cancer
the patient receives the stem cells straight away but the t - cells are sensitised to wt1 in the lab by exposing them to fragments of the protein
the t - cells are then given to the patient in a series of injections over several months
but after receiving the stem cells and four t - cell doses , her cancer was reduced to undetectable levels
in the british study , led by dr emma morris â a haematologist at university college london and the royal free hospital , t - cells from up to 20 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or chronic myeloid leukaemia are to be extracted , inserted with dna so they recognise wt1 , and then put back again
â most people have immune cells which ca nât recognise cancer cells , which is one of the major problems with tackling the disease , â dr morris explained
â we have genetically engineered patients â immune cells so they develop receptors for the wt1 protein , making them much better at recognising leukaemia cells
â one patient has already received an infusion containing genetically engineered â t - cells and there are others whose cells are being prepared
three years ago , lacey , was on death âs door having relapsed with an aggressive version of myeloma , a form of blood cancer
lacey was on death 's door with a form of blood cancer when a doctor suggested the vaccine book designer mrs lacey , 64 , from newburyport , massachusetts , said the treatment meant she was well enough to garden , walk her dog , and go canoeing
â in the short term , doctors are looking to see if these super-immune cells will be powerful enough to stop leukaemia patients from relapsing after chemotherapy
dr morris , whose research with professor hans stauss has been funded by the charity leukaemia and lymphoma research and government body cell therapy catapult , said : â we could potentially use it in ovarian cancer , breast cancer , and patients with prostate or colon cancer too
â she said the approach should produce less side effects than chemotherapy and provide longer - term protection than drugs , which are flushed out of the body in days or weeks , because immune cells have a â memory â , persisting at low levels in case a threat re-emerges
