the labour party has upset its own mps after selling mugs promising a control on immigration
the Â£ 5 souvenirs were supposed to drum up cash for the party 's election fighting fund
but they have sparked a storm of criticism , with prominent backbencher diane abbott branding them ' shameful '
ed miliband 's promise to control immigration has been used as an unlikely slogan for a Â£ 5 red mug on sale on the labour party website labour party released five mugs to coincide with the launch of ed miliband 's five election pledges
each red mug , sold through the party 's website , has one of the pledges written in white
ms diane abbott wrote on twitter : ' this shameful mug is an embarrassment
' but real problem is that immigration controls are one of our 5 pledges at all
at 5pm on sunday there were 267 of the mugs still available , according to the labour party website labour party mp diane abbott , a former frontbencher in mr ed miliband 's health team , condemned the mugs - and policy - as ' shameful ' a labour party spokesman said : ' labour party has five election pledges
' mr ed miliband was tackled on immigration last week as he appeared on the first tv contest of the election campaign
' the ' hell yes ' slogan has also been seized on by the labour party , which has had it printed on t - shirts for sale to raise money for campaign coffers
' the slogan has been put on t - shirts now being sold by the labour party cameron has come under fire after promising ' no ifs , no buts ' to cut net migration to below 100,000
some senior tories urged mr cameron to ditch the pledge , but he has vowed to repeat it for the general election this year too
