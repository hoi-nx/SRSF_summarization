i never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about powell , writes simon heffer four years before he died in 1998 , powell did me the honour of asking me to write his biography
if there is anyone alive other than powell âs widow and daughters who knows more about him than i do , i âd like to meet him
i never detected the slightest whiff of scandal about powell
when on saturday evening a fellow journalist told me of the allegations made by the church of england , my first instinct was to laugh : but that soon changed into utter outrage when i realised he was serious
the church of england has publicly accused powell of being involved in ritual satanic abuse on hearsay , without the slightest evidence
the establishment turned against powell in 1968 after the so - called rivers of blood speech ; it would never have protected him for a second had it detected the slightest whiff of scandal
it is disgraceful and destabilising for clergy to behave in this way , and the church of england needs to investigate those responsible for this smear and take action accordingly
these post-savile accusations bring to mind the hysteria surrounding allegations of satanic abuse in the late 1980s and early 1990s , including notorious cases in rochdale and the orkneys that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids
powell , pictured making a speech in 1977 , has been named in a church of england review into historic sex abuse when the london school of economics investigated 84 alleged cases , it found no convincing corroborative evidence of any abuse â yet families had been torn apart on the say - so of those who insisted action be taken
for decades , powell has long been a bug - bear of the liberal establishment
what better way for some mischievous leftist priest to damage powell further than by linking him with the current rash of stories about child abuse ? in 1998 , just after powell died , the bbc broadcast a programme in which they railed at enoch for his hypocrisy
i have long dreamt of the day when ignorant politicians and establishment figures would stop manipulating powell âs memory for their own advantage
