mecklenburg-vorpommern is quite a mouthful
which is why locals refer to this region of lakes , castles , and beaches in the north - east of germany as mecklenburg-vorpommern , or meck-pom
it has a long coastline on the baltic and is the third largest of germany 's 16 laender - but the least populated
back in focus : ' meck-pom ' offers blissful beaches along germany 's baltic coastline after world war ii , meck-pom was part of communist germany , which might account for its low profile
the regime concentrated on the cities and neglected the countryside , so castles and seaside resorts deteriorated
since reunification 25 years ago , all that has changed
the result is a clutch of wonderful hotels and beautifully - run resorts
the sea accounts for the region 's ancient wealth and the cities along the coast - wismar , rostock , stralsund and greifswald - were part of the 13th - century trading confederation , the hanseatic league , which did business with scandinavians and slavs around the baltic
towering medieval cathedrals and customs houses on market squares as big as football pitches are built of ancient revolutionary red - brick , moulded and baked from the sodden clay
at the beach resorts of boltenhagen and warnemunde , holidaymakers on hire bikes ( Â£ 6.50 a day ) pedal through pine - filled parks to the sea - front
