when bush spoke last week at the conservative political action conference in national harbor , maryland , the likely gop presidential hopeful did better than expected
now that bush might run for president in 2016 , the condition vexes conservatives who believe that when it comes to choosing the gop nominee , the former florida governor is all wrong
during bush 's speech , a few dozen supporters of sen. rand paul of kentucky -- wearing red t - shirts with the words " stand with rand " -- walked out and later blasted bush as insufficiently conservative
but what should really count for a lot is that bush is sufficiently competent
he 's the grownup in a roomful of extremists who -- as they compare union members to isis ( scott walker ) or vow to abolish the irs ( ted cruz ) or bash the media ( chris christie ) -- seem most interested in applause lines
bush is a serious person with a serious shot at the presidency , something that you just ca n't say about all republicans who appear to be running
as someone who is bilingual and whose wife hails from mexico , bush can hit hillary clinton , the likely democratic nominee , where it hurts by carving into her latino support
in his 1998 gubernatorial election , and 2002 re-election , bush received over 60 percent of the latino vote
and it 's no secret that , for many latinos who might vote for bush , the make - or - break issue is immigration
that 's because many latinos see immigration as a way of determining a candidate 's character
latinos will be watching to see if bush stands up to the pressure from extremists to join the gop 's closed border chorus
they 're used to being thrown under the bus by politicians who sacrifice latinos to gin up support from non-latinos
so it was actually refreshing to see bush use his appearance at conservative political action conference -- which took the form of an onstage interview by conservative talk show host sean hannity -- to once again speak plainly
in response to questions , bush emphasized the need to secure the united states border , insisted that immigration policy should be driven by economic concerns and the need for high - skilled immigrants , and reaffirmed support for giving undocumented immigrants driver 's licenses and in - state tuition at public colleges and universities
bush criticized president obama 's executive actions to prioritize deportations , but also bashed gop in congress for protesting that policy by holding up funds for the department of homeland security
in the washington times / conservative political action conference presidential preference straw poll of 3,007 participants , bush came in fifth out of 17 candidates with just 8 percent of the vote
clearly , bush has a long way to go in convincing conservatives that he 's their best choice
