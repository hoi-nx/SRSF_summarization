neanderthals may have created and worn the world 's first jewellery 130,000 years ago , according to scientists
researchers examining eight talons taken from a white - tailed eagle found at krapina in croatia say they were used to create necklace or bracelet
the claws bear multiple cut marks , notches and signs that they had been polishing by the neanderthals that once inhabited the site where they were found
the eagle talons shown above were found at a site inhabited by neanderthals and are the earliest example of jewellery yet discovered , according to researchers who have re-examined them 100 years after they were found the findings will add to mounting evidence that neanderthals were not the slow - witted and primative creatures they are often portrayed as
instead they are emerging as having had a sophisticated culture , were highly intelligent and may have even created art. it has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient neanderthals
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning europe now have roughly 2 per cent neanderthals dna
scientists have found that part of our hla system , which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body , could have come from neanderthals
the new findings suggest that the talons may have had a symbolic purpose - something that some anthropologists have argued neanderthals did not possess or copied off modern humans
however , dr frayer , an anthropologist at the university kansas who led the study along with colleagues in croatia , said the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in europe
' the eight talons were discovered more than 100 years ago at a site where neanderthals remains have been found just outside the town of krapina in northern croatia
the researchers examined the talons and found that four of them bear multiple smooth edged cut marks around the top
the researchers , whose findings are published in the journal public library of science one , say the cut marks are evidence that they talons and connecting bones were cut from the foot of the eagle and attached to a string or sinew
along with colleagues at the croatia natural history museum , dr frayer said : ' these talons provide multiple new lines of evidence for neanderthals â abilities and cultural sophistication
' they are the earliest evidence for jewellery in the europe fossil record and demonstrate that neanderthals possessed a symbolic culture long before more modern human forms arrived in europe
our traditional view of neanderthals , shown above in the reconstruction at the natural history museum in london , is of a primative and stupid species but new evidence suggests they were intelligent and cultured cuts and notches on the talons ( shown above ) suggest they were strung on sinew as a bracelet or necklace ' some have argued that krapina neandertals lacked symbolic ability or copied this behavior from modern humans
' these remains clearly show that the krapina neandertals made jewelry well before the appearance of modern humans in europe , extending ornament production and symbolic activity early into the european mousterian
' previously the oldest jewellery to be discovered in the world were some seashells that had showed signs of being used as beads around 100,000 years ago in israel and africa but were thought to have been made by modern humans
the talons were discovered at a site inhabited by neanderthals close to the town of krapina in northern croatia the shells above were found in israel and were thought to be the earliest example of beads that were worn as jewellery - dating to around 100,000 years ago - but the eagle talons predate these by up to 30,000 years previously scientists have found evidence that neanderthals may have created engravings on rocks in gibraltar while modified feathers and shells have also been found alongside their remains
the ancient skulls , dating back 400,000 years , show neanderthals - like features in the face and teeth , while other parts of the skulls , including the brain case , resembled those of more primitive human ancestors
scientists have long believed that they died out as modern humans , homo sapiens , moved into the parts of asia and europe where homo neanderthalensis had lived
a 60,000 - year - old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in france also suggests neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices a recent discovery by researchers at the musã©um national d'histories naturelle in paris suggests that neanderthals may have built homes using the materials they found around them
cross-hatched engravings found inside gorham 's cave in gibraltar are also thought to be the first known examples of neanderthals rock art. dna analysis has also shown that neanderthals carried the same genes that are thought to have enabled modern humans to speak
