as baxandall arrived at glan clwyd hospital , north wales , 11 ambulances were waiting to hand over patients
baxandall , 95 , was taken to glan clwyd hospital , north wales ( pictured ) at around 5pm on september 1 last year after a fall
she was not admitted to a&e until 9.50pm , and died the next day it is the latest shocking death threatening to undermine patient faith in the welsh ambulance service , which has met its response targets just once in the past two - and - a - half years
at a pre-inquest hearing yesterday , miss baxandall 's great - niece kate thomas , a locum doctor who helped care for her great - aunt in the ambulance , said : ' by the time she was admitted it was far too late
' the court , sitting in ruthin , north wales , was told miss baxandall âs cleaner dialled 999 on september 1 last year when she found her on the floor after a fall
a paramedic arrived soon after but it was two more hours before an ambulance arrived , making it to the casualty department of glan clwyd hospital by 5pm
coroner gittins said miss baxandall 's case is particularly concerning as it is the third such case he has had to deal with at that time , coroner gittins said , there was evidence to suggest 11 ambulances were queuing outside waiting to discharge patients
she was finally admitted at 9.50pm â almost seven hours after the paramedic first arrived
the coroner said he was concerned as miss baxandall âs death was the third he had dealt with recently where ambulance delays were a factor
