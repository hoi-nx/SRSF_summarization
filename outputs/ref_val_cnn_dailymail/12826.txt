as the seventh full week of testimony in the first - degree murder trial against former patriots star aaron hernandez came to a close this week , witnesses described him as acting strangely and glaring at the victim two nights before the killing
aaron hernandez is on trial in fall river , massachusetts , in connection with the shooting death of odin lloyd , a semi-pro football player who was found dead june 17 , 2013
the former tight end had signed a five - year contract extension worth $ 40 million but , less than a year later , aaron hernandez was charged with the murder of the man who was dating the sister of his fiancÃ©e
two of aaron hernandez 's closest associates are co-defendants in the case
evidence collected in odin lloyd 's death led to two more murder charges against aaron hernandez in a separate case in boston
two witnesses who saw aaron hernandez at the boston nightclub rumor just 48 hours before odin lloyd 's killing said he looked angry and aggressive
odin lloyd was with aaron hernandez at the club that friday night
she told jurors she danced with aaron hernandez at the club in the early morning of june 15 , 2013
" arma testified that she danced with aaron hernandez for about 10 minutes
when he returned about 10 minutes later , arma said , aaron hernandez grabbed her arm and took her to another part of the club
during cross-examination , defense attorney michael fee showed surveillance video of arma dancing with aaron hernandez
" aaron hernandez 's mouth looked like a " grunt , " he said
nicholas , a college student , was at the club with friends -- some of whom were friends with odin lloyd
when odin lloyd was talking closely with one of his friends , aaron hernandez looked angry , according to nicholas
aaron hernandez was standing near the dj at the time , about 15 feet away from odin lloyd and his friend
the defense showed jurors nicholas ' initial recorded interview with detectives in which he gave a different description of what he saw and was less critical of aaron hernandez
nicholas also remembered aaron hernandez " storming out of the club
during that video , odin lloyd is also seen following aaron hernandez at a distance
though prosecutors are trying to establish that aaron hernandez was angry , jurors still do n't know why
shayanna jenkins , aaron hernandez 's fiancÃ©e and mother of his baby daughter , was not in court to see the dirty - dancing video
but shayanna jenkins ' name did come up in court regarding a defense motion to suppress evidence gathered from aaron hernandez 's house in november 2014
the prosecution showed before - and - after photos of a closet in aaron hernandez 's home in north attleboro
one photo from june 2013 showed the sneakers aaron hernandez wore the night odin lloyd was killed
mccauley referred to the defendant 's jailhouse comments that " she does what i want , " referring to shayanna jenkins
" singleton is aaron hernandez 's cousin
will testimony about aaron hernandez 's liaisons with other women -- and negative texts about shayanna jenkins -- affect her testimony ? does her absence mean she 'll turn on her fiance ? the answers may be a few weeks away
there are indications the commonwealth may wrap up its case by mid-april , much testimony focused on the shoes aaron hernandez wore the night odin lloyd was shot
the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney sultan that other nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression yet bennett , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footwear impression left near odin lloyd 's body was " in agreement " or consistent with the air jordan retro 11 lows size 13
it 's clear from the testimony and the filing for a search warrant in november 2014 that investigators overlooked the shoes worn by aaron hernandez , ortiz and wallace -- another co-defendant -- the night of odin lloyd 's death , despite having a photo of them from june 2013
seventeen months into the investigation , they searched aaron hernandez 's house again
the prosecution brought in three separate witnesses who either owned or worked for companies in the industrial park along john dietsch boulevard where odin lloyd 's body was found
with these witnesses and collected surveillance videos , prosecutors gave jurors a road map of the route they say aaron hernandez drove to the corliss landing crime scene
while the car 's make and model are n't distinguishable in the video , jurors could see its lights go by at specific times that match when aaron hernandez , wallace , ortiz and odin lloyd would have been in the car
singleton arranged for her aunt to drive her and wallace to georgia in the days after odin lloyd 's death
wallace has pleaded not guilty to the charge of an accessory after the fact of a slaying in odin lloyd 's death .
