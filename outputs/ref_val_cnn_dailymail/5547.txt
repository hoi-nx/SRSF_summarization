amazingly , the driver survived without any major injuries as the dangerous object came flying off the truck at an almighty speed headed straight towards the nissan navara instantly smashing through the windscreen
before the driver knew what had happened the car veered off the road and spun around 180 degrees before abruptly stopping as the car was facing the wrong way in the left hand lane of the m1 motorway in brisbane
to add to the miraculous escape , the car was towing a trailer which crashed into the grassy embankment and then slid under the car it was attached to , which ended up on two wheels but neither vehicles managed to completely flip
the male driver who had the camera attached to his dashboard can be heard repeatedly saying : ' woah ! woah ! woah ! ' on the video that was posted on the dash cam owners australia facebook page
