the nra has taken aim at former arizona rep. giffords just as she is seeking to push for bipartisan legislation on gun safety
giffords spoke on capitol hill on wednesday and called for expanded criminal background checks on all commercial firearms sales including at gun shows and internet sales
' giffords : everyone should have to pass background check my attacker passed , ' tweeted the nra , which is n't in favor of the legislation , in response on thursday
the tweet , sent to the organization 's 264,000 followers , included a link to an article published on the right - wing breitbart website that argued that background checks do n't reduce gun violence
nra executive vice president wayne lapierre is n't in favor of giffords legislation calling for expanded criminal background checks ' giffords is a fighter , ' sen. kirsten gillibrand , a friend of giffords , told the daily news
' ' the nra 's brazen response is as predictable as it is pathetic , ' said rep. kathleen rice , who is among the co-sponsors of the bill
supporters of the law say that even though the likes of jared loughner passed background checks , a uniform federal requirement would help stop many other dangerous people from buying gun and reduce gun violence rates
