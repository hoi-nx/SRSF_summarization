the average length of an erect penis is 5.2 inches ( 13.12 cm ) , they found
meanwhile , the average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches ( 9.16 cm ) and 5.2 inches ( 13.24 cm ) when flaccid but stretched
and when it comes to girth , the average erect circumference was 4.6 inches ( 11.66 cm ) and 3.7 inches ( 9.31 cm ) when flaccid
the british research also found there was a small correlation between the erect length of a penis and a man 's height
the average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches ( 9.16 cm ) and 5.2 inches ( 13.24 cm ) when flaccid but stretched , the researchers found ( file photo ) the researchers say the graphs they have plotted , which show the size distributions of a penis , will help clinicians dealing with body dysmorphic disorder ( body dysmorphic disorder ) , a serious anxiety disorder relating to body image
some men are concerned about their penis size , and those who are preoccupied and severely distressed may even be diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder
the researchers created a graph ( or a nomogram ) depicting the size distributions of penis ' among men of all ages and many races
experts plotted graphs showing the size distribution of the length of the average penis when flaccid , flaccid and stretched and erect
the graph above shows average penis length of men - in centimetres - in each percentile the researchers also plotted a nomogram showing the size distribution of the girth of the average penis
the graph shows the average penis girth of men in each percentile - again in centimetres ' they are unlikely to be helped just by looking at a size distribution graph , they will need more formal treatment like cognitive behaviourhal therapy or medication too
