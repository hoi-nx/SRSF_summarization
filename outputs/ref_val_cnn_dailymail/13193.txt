early thursday -- during the ongoing protests that continue to shake ferguson , missouri -- two police officers were shot
but the unrest during which it occurred demonstrates that the people of ferguson have lost all confidence in their police department
and the resignation of the police chief this week wo n't be enough to restore faith in law and order
after a police officer shot michael brown , the u.s. justice department conducted an investigation into the ferguson police department
now , the justice department has an opportunity to gut the ferguson police department and rebuild it from scratch
the justice department report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department can not be ignored , and the problems it reveals can not be fixed from the inside
the police department should be completely reconstituted under justice department control in a manner that ensures that citizens of ferguson receive the type of public service they pay for and deserve -- and more importantly , in a manner that protects their rights , not only as citizens of ferguson , missouri , but as constitutionally protected citizens of our country
a new ferguson police department could show what a concerted , roots - up effort toward nonracist behavior in a police department can be
under justice department leadership , the ferguson police department could become a model for practices such as equipping all police with body cameras , community policing and better use of force training
and if the black community in ferguson -- in fact , people of every race in ferguson -- can look back five years from now and see an unbiased organization of public servants who give respect and get respect , who reduce fear rather than cause it , then perhaps the tragedy of michael brown 's death will stand for something .
