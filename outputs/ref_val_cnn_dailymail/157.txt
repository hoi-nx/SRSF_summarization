of all the terrible things a single mother has endured since discovering a malignant tumour in her breast , one of the worst was how to explain to her young daughter that she had cancer
following her diagnosis in may 2014 , 42 - year - old city worker ebba worried most about how six - year - old lene would take the news
her greatest fear was that lene would be left without a mother at a young age , just like her own mother had been
ebba 's grandmother had died of liver cancer when ebba 's mother was only 10
ebba is proud of how daughter lene , six , has dealt with her breast cancer diagnosis ebba , who is originally from germany and now lives in london , said : ' when i was first diagnosed , i had all the shock , horror and anxiety to deal with and i worried history would repeat itself
' my grandmother died of liver cancer when she was 33 and my mother was 10
' after finding a lump in her breast , ebba waited until she had confirmation that it was cancer following a number of tests before broaching the subject with her daughter one bedtime
' i thought it would be the worst thing ever to tell lene and i was worried i would dissolve into tears , ' she told mailonline
' beforehand i was very stressed and tearful at the thought of having to tell lene but when it happened she was calm
' mother and daughter pictured after one of ebba 's chemo sessions when she started to lose her hair ebba tried to make her hairloss fun for her daughter so it was less traumatic for them both since her diagnosis , ebba and lena have found ' the clouds toolkit ' a useful resource to help them through the incredibly difficult time
created by the fruit fly collective using money raised through red nose day , the resource pack provides invaluable guidance to parents on how to talk to their children about what cancer is and the treatments and side - effects involved
as ebba explains , children often need reassurance about issues that adults would n't usually consider - like whether cancer is contagious - and are most alarmed by the hair loss caused by chemotherapy
' when we initially talked about it , lene was most concerned about hair loss , i still remember her eyes looking big and shocked when i told her my hair would fall out , ' ebba said
' she was also worried about catching cancer and i found her looking for lumps
' when ebba did start to lose her hair , she found a way to make it less traumatic for lene
but lene found my hair loss very tough to deal with , very disconcerting
ebba wearing a scarf , left , and wig , right , her daughter helped her choose following her chemo ' i 'd decided i was going to shave my hair off so we had a little party and my daughter cut my hair
lene took the scissors and then everyone else got involved
' ebba said it 's been a difficult time for both her and lene but she has felt proud of the way her daughter has adapted and coped
she said : ' i 'm amazed at how calm lene has been all the way through
lene kept her mother 's spirits up with get well cards like this one she created lene wrote her experiences down in a book to hep her deal with them , like when she helped ebba chose a wig lene 's story , which she wants to sell to raise money , shows how they coped when ebba 's hair fell out ' it was a great way to kick off the conversation
the selfless six - year - old wants to get the book published so she can support other children going through what she has experienced and give any money made from sales to charity
