however , researchers have discovered a rural community in brazilian that still follows the natural sleep cycles of the past - despite having access to the same technology as its urban neighbours
and they now plan to study this group to learn more about how our move away from the natural rhythm could be damaging our health
researchers have discovered a rural community in brazilian that follows the ' natural sleep cycles ' ( stock image ) of our ancestors who rose with the sun , and typically went to bed when it set
the experts now plan to study this group to learn more about how our move away from the natural rhythm could be damaging our health the community was discovered in the small town of baependi in south - eastern brazilian in the state of minais gerais
the community was discovered in baependi ( marked ) in south - eastern brazilian
residents were asked when they would prefer to wake up and go to bed , and the average answers from the town dwellers were 07.15am and 22.20pm
whereas people in the countryside preferred to rise at 06.30am and go to bed at 21.20pm in particular , the residents were asked when they would prefer to wake up and go to bed if they were completely free to plan their day
the average answers from town residents were 07.15 and 22.20 , whereas people in the surrounding countryside preferred to rise at 06.30am and go to bed at 21.20
the researchers believe the difference is due to town residents following much less of a natural sleep / wake cycle because of the influence of artificial lighting
the paper explained that people in baependi maintain a stronger link with the so - called solar rhythm because they predominantly work outdoors
they therefore have similar patterns as pre-industrial ancestors
