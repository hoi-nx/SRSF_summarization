kearney has vowed that the â real ireland â will roar into murrayfield to try and salvage a six nations title win on saturday , amid continuing criticism of the performance in defeat to wales
ireland face a major challenge to retain the championship with english enjoying a better points difference and wales expected to run up a big total against italy in rome
kearney has vowed that the â real ireland â will try to salvage a six nations title win there are two six nations trophies and one will be in murrayfield , and the other in twickenham , a planning decision that has caused anger amongst some welsh supporters
it will require a more coherent and less error - addled performance from ireland to defeat the scots , and kearney did not shirk the challenge laid down before he and his team - mates
â this week will be a big test and will give a really strong insight into the group as a whole , how we react after a very disappointing defeat , â the full - back said
â we âll see the real ireland step up this week
â ireland âs message for the week appears to have been decided : they will say they have no interest in chasing a big points total against winless scotland , but kearney did intimate that at least the desire for a more attacking style is there
wales will also be confident of eating into the irish and english points â advantage against italy
wales dash ireland 's grand slam hopes - highlights ireland will need a more coherent and less error - addled performance to defeat scotland â but we do know that we have to go out and give this game a right bash
â the ireland style council remain unmoved by criticisms of their game , and the claim in its aftermath that they were forced to work outside the strict instructions provided by schmidt in chasing the match last saturday
that explained the dislocated moves close to the wales line , goes this argument
ireland were criticised for their poor performance in six nations defeat by wales no new casualties were sustained , and it is certain that the coach will stay largely faithful to the team that started in the millennium stadium
iain henderson was the most dynamic of the subs used against wales and is the most probable point of discussion in team selection this week , with a start in the second row rather than the back row a possibility
