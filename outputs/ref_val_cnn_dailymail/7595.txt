reaching down the rabbit hole by ropper & b. d. burrell some years ago a policeman stopped a driver who had been circling a roundabout for nearly an hour
â ropper gives a fascinating account of his work as a neurologist in boston ( stock image ) the confused driver , a salesman , was taken to hospital , where a junior doctor found nothing wrong with him , apart from memory loss
the junior doctor asked dr ropper , then the hospital âs senior resident in neurology , to authorise the patient âs discharge , expecting that his memory loss would , as usual in incidents of tga , return within hours
ropper examined the man himself
unconvinced by the tga diagnosis , ropper decided to keep him in overnight , suspecting a stroke
after 23 hours , the patient âs speech became slurred and ropper knew instantly he was suffering a stroke
an arterial blockage was restricting blood flow to part of his brain
treated with anticoagulants and other drugs , the man quickly recovered with only minimal memory difficulties
ropper âs fascinating and gripping account of his work as a neurologist at boston âs brigham and women âs hospital in massachusetts reveals what a mysterious and little understood organ the brain is , not least in the list of all the things that can go wrong with it
extensive testing showed no evidence of brain damage , seizure or stroke
in the case of a young mother admitted with what appeared to be a severe asthma attack , ropper âs heart sank when he spotted the muscle between her thumb and forefinger twitching
