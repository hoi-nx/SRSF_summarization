an alabama jury has found a woman guilty of capital murder after she made her 9 - year - old granddaughter run for three hours as punishment - causing her to collapse and die
she made granddaughter savannah hardin , 9 , run for three hours as punishment in 2012 the youngster collapsed and had a seizure after carrying wood
authorities claimed the 49 - year - old woman forced savannah to run and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy
savannah eventually had a seizure and died three days later in a hospital
garrard had testified she only made the girl pick up sticks in her yard as punishment the day of her collapse
garrard testified that the girl did run , but only as practice for races at school
prosecutors contended that garrard refused to let savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise
in court , they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson
she now faces the death penalty or life without parole assistant district attorney carol griffith said garrard killed the child intentionally by berating her and making her run around the yard picking up sticks ' she was tortured , ' griffith said
defense attorney richard rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9 - year - old savannah while the girl 's father was overseas working as a contractor for the u.s. state department
some witnesses who testified about seeing garrard force savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than garrard appeared to be , griffith said
a 911 operator told the court garrard asked ' for a smoke ' while the girl was unconscious outside their home
