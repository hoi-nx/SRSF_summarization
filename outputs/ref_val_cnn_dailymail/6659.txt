planets wandering through space , unattached to any star or solar system , may be much more common that previously thought , according to an expert
the planets are hard to find because , without orbiting a star , they reflect very little light
but 50 have now been found in the past 15 years , leading some to suggest they may be abundant in the universe
ashley yeager for science news has explained that solo planets ( artist 's impression shown ) could be common
this is thanks to more regions of dust and gas than we thought
planets become ' rogue ' when they are ejected or form on their own and about 50 have been found in the last 15 years the potential for these free - floating planets to be common was discussed in an article by ashley yeager for science news
rogue planets , or interstellar planets , are planetary objects that were either formed by themselves or were ejected from a system
as they do n't emit much light it âs thought there may be many rogue brown dwarfs drifting through the galaxy waiting to be discovered
but ms ashley yeager explained so - called globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make them more common than thought
â rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star
ashley yeager explained that so - called globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make them more common than first thought
