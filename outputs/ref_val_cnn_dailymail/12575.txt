scientists at nasa are one step closer to understanding how much water could have existed on primeval mars
these new findings also indicate how primitive water reservoirs there could have evolved over billions of years , indicating that early oceans on the mars might have held more water than earth 's arctic ocean , nasa scientists reveal in a study published friday in the journal science
" our study provides a solid estimate of how much water mars once had , by determining how much water was lost to space , " said villanueva , a scientist at nasa 's goddard space flight center
" to find answers to this age - old question about mars water molecules , scientists used the world 's three major infrared telescopes , in chile and hawaii , to measure traces of water in the planet 's atmosphere over a range of areas and seasons , spanning from march 2008 to january 2014
as a result , water trapped in mars ' polar ice caps has a much higher level of hdo than fluid water on earth does , the scientists said
the scientists compared the ratio of h2o to hdo in mars ' atmosphere today to the ratio of the two molecules trapped inside a mars meteorite , a stone that broke off from mars -- perhaps when an asteroid hit -- and landed on earth some 4.5 billion years ago
they were able to determine how much that ratio had changed over time and estimate how much water has disappeared from mars -- about 87 %
" with mars losing that much water , the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought , suggesting it might have been habitable for longer , " said mumma
