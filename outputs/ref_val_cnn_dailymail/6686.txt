if you 're an amazon customer in the britain your future online purchases could arrive at your home or office by drone
frustrated with how long it is taking to get approval for its flying delivery service in the us , amazon is said to have approached the uk government to launch a trial of the technology in britain
transport minister robert goodwill revealed the plans at a press conference for driverless cars and wider technologies earlier today
amazon has approached the uk government about trialling its flying prime air in the britain , transport minister robert goodwill has confirmed
one of its prototype delivery drones is pictured â i had some people from amazon coming to see me the other day ; they want to replace van deliveries with drone deliveries , and they ca nât do any trials in the us because they âre over-regulated , â he said
â so my favourite word is deregulation , and we need to make sure that wherever you are in the world , and if you want to innovate and you want to invest in this sort of technology , come to the britain because we âre here to help you
' the faa ( faa ) in the us last week approved amazon âs plan to begin testing drones for online deliveries , though the e-commerce firm first made the request in july last year
but in the time it took to approve the use of its first - generation drone , amazon has developed a new version , which makes the ruling ' obsolete '
amazon âs paul misener wrote in a letter to the faa in december : â without approval of our testing in the us , we will be forced to continue expanding our prime air r&d footprint abroad
â under us law , operating drones for commercial purposes is illegal , however it is allowed in the britain if permission is granted by the caa ( caa )
amazon is developing aerial vehicles as part of prime air
about 86 per cent of amazon 's deliveries are five lbs or less , the company said
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making prime air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' amazon has said
' as our database grows , it will help services such a amazon âs prime air , dhl âs drone delivery service and google âs project wing among others realistically get a foothold in the britain while simultaneously addressing current security and privacy concerns , ' he added
