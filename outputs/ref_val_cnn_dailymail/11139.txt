the white house excluded former president george bush from the official photo of last saturday 's march through selma to commemorate bloody sunday
the original photo is a wide shot of crowds walking on edmund pettus bridge led by barack , michelle , obamas and sasha obama , as well as georgia rep. john lewis , al sharpton , george bush and his wife , former first lady laura
however , in a move that incensed republicans , the administration 's blog post documenting the historic occasion omitted the former president , with a sharper , close up picture that showed only the obamas and the crowds behind
both pretend george bush was n't at selma
