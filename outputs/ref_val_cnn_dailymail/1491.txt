wills works as a paintball target , with colleagues firing paintballs at him at close range when student wills goes to work he must prepared to pelted by bullets , fired at him at close range and at speeds of almost 40mph
the 19 - year - old from london works as a human bullet impact tester , or more simply a paintball target , and every week faces the pellets being fired at his torso to test how hard they are on impact or how large a welt they leave
he beat more than 10,000 other applicants from around the world to land the Â£ 16,000 a year job as a tester and fits in being used for target practice around his university studies
' i guess i have a high pain tolerance - but it 's really not as painful as people think , ' said the kingston university computer graphics student
' and while most people playing paintball will wear some form of protective clothing , mr wills does his job in just a t - shirt
he works 16 hours a week at different uk paintball sites across the country on a pro-rata salary of Â£ 40,000 , which works out at a wage of around Â£ 16,000 a year
mr wills , who stays in shape as a rower , said despite the welts and the occasional pain he loves his job
he added : ' when people find out what i do they think i 'm crazy - but i love my job
' the teenager wears protective goggles to cover his eyes - but trusts his well - trained colleagues to steer clear of other vulnerable body parts and stop when he tells them to
the paintballs are fired at wills 's torso at close range - between 25 and 30 feet by a professional shooter at a speed of almost 40mph
rather than take the usual approach of fleeing the oncoming paintballs , mr wills must stand still while players take aim at him
he reports back on the impact of the paintballs so that manufacturers can ensure new batches are not too hard
mr wills was selected for the role out of 10,000 other applicants because of his knowledge of paintball the 19 - year - old often suffers welts on his body from the impact which take three or four days to disappear the practice leaves him with welts over his body , but the student said he barely notices
the teenager does his job wearing just a t - shirt , and endures balls being fired at him at very close range as part of the role mr wills must stand still and resist the urge , as happens in actual games , to run away ' i work two days a week and my hours are flexible
what 's not to like ? ' toohig , uk paintball owner and the student 's boss , said : ' jordan 's a great guy
mr wells insists he does n't really feel pain from the impact of paintballs being fired at him at close range mr wills said he does not mind being hit or the resulting welts and thinks he has a high threshold for pain ' in the end we interviewed 18 guys and wills got the job
' when the job was advertised last year mr toohig was quoted as saying : ' we want to hear from people with a high pain threshold and those to whom fear is a foreign concept
