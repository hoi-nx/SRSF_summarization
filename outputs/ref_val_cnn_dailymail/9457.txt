i would imagine he must have reflected upon his actions every day over the past 40 years
' it 's inconceivable the killer of eve and lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years
it 's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner , a friend , even a cellmate - and i would appeal to anyone with information to contact us
