top earner : the scottish national party have voted to make nicola sturgeon the best - paid politician in uk the scottish national party has voted to make nicola sturgeon the best - paid politician in uk
the scottish parliament , which is controlled by the scottish national party , rubber - stamped a pay rise for all its members that takes miss nicola sturgeon âs official salary to Â£ 144,687 a year
her pay is now well above david cameron âs Â£ 142,500 earnings as well as the Â£ 143,911 that boris johnson is paid for his role as mayor of london
the row follows the scottish parliament âs vote on a 0.7 per cent salary rise yesterday
the move â which was passed unopposed â increases the first minister âs official salary by just over Â£ 1,000 to Â£ 144,687
critics pointed out that she only serves about five million people , compared to 64million served by mr david cameron
her aides said that she would actually draw a more modest salary of Â£ 135,605
â if people in scotland want to pay for nicola sturgeon and her msps then that would be one thing â but it is taxpayers in england who are picking up the bill for the scottish national party âs profligacy
nicola sturgeon 's pay is now well above david cameron âs Â£ 142,500 earnings - even though she only serves about five million people â they are also sick to death of seeing the scottish national party , who wanted out of this nation six months ago , now wanting to run the country
â nicola sturgeon is obviously not worth more than david cameron â the idea is laughable
but the scottish national party have no appreciation of the struggle faced by millions of people who work hard , pay their taxes and do their best to make ends meet
nicola sturgeon 's pay is also above the Â£ 143,911 that boris johnson is paid for his role as mayor of london
