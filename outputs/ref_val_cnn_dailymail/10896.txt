but robotics engineers have now come up with what they say is the best way to fold a variety of clothes into neat little rectangles
their findings , of course , are intended to help a new generation of robots take on some of our more monotonous household chores
the diagram above shows the approach outlined by the scientists for folding a jumper or long sleeved t - shirt however , their work has also revealed the most effective ways of folding clothing so it can be stacked and packed away that may also help humans too
they use a principal that they have called the ' g-fold ' - where clothing is laid out on a flat surface and gravity is used to help assist the folding of clothing
the robot developed by researchers at the university of california berkeley is able to wash and fold clothes , recognise different items so they can be folded neatly away
dr abbeel , an associate professor in computer science at the university of california berkeley , and his colleagues who have been conducting the research , said they attempted to solve the problem of folding clothing by treating it as a problem of geometry
' the researchers have now used their findings to help develop a robot that is able to sort and fold laundry
they developed software that allowed the willow garage personal robot to grip clothes with claw like gripper hands and lay it out on a flat surface
this is the technique the engineers recommended for folding up a standard t - shirt into a neat rectangle folding a pair of trousers or jeans requires just the simplest of folds shown above according to the research the approach outlined above shows how the researchers recommend folding a variety of different clothing the researchers have written software that enables a robot to fold clothing into neat rectangles ( shown above ) it is then able to assess them best way of folding the clothing based on its shape
in a series of tests they found the robot was able to fold up to 40 different articles of clothing , including trousers , towels , sweaters and t - shirts
folding a towel might seem simple but for a robot it requires the ability to use some complex geometry writing in a paper in a new journal on household robotic services , the researchers said : ' the g-fold method worked reasonably well on pants
recently an approach known as the japanese folding method , where a t - shirt is folded by gripping just two points on the cloth , has become popular
however dr abbeel and his team said : ' while this study dealt explicitly with the task of laundry folding , we believe the tools put forth may generalize well beyond this to many deformable object manipulation challenges , such as ironing or bed - making
