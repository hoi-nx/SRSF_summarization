evans ' book , which he wrote along with his co-authors helen padarin and charlotte carr , will get a worldwide digital release in april , according to a post on the chef 's instagram page
evans and his co-authors announced they would be releasing the book independently , and it would get a digital and print release earlier on monday , publisher pan macmillan announced it was ditching plans to publish the book
' the authors of paleo way : the paleo way - for new mums , babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly , and will , therefore , no longer publish the book , in any format , with australia , ' the statement read
paleo way : the paleo way , which is co-authored by my kitchen rules judge evans , nutritionist helen padarin and blogger charlotte carr , has been panned by dietitians and doctors over the past week
evans , who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle , has long been a passionate advocate of the diet one recipe in the book - a do - it - yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth - was said to have the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development
the criticism came as it emerged evans ' facebook page was being scrubbed clean , with comments that were negative towards the paleo lifestyle were being deleted
after accusations from readers that their feedback was being erased , a rival facebook page called blocked by evans was started , where people could raise their concerns freely
evans visited a primary school in ballarat , victoria , last week to promote the paleo diet to children the cancellation of the book comes as critics of evans and the diet have claimed the chef deletes negative comments from his official facebook page ' my comments were never abusive , derogatory , rude or full of swearing
they just put the factual information across about why the baby formula recipe and other recipes in the new book were dangerous to babies
' daria , a paediatric occupational therapist , had a similar experience on the page when evans posted to his facebook page comments linking the modern australian diet and the rise of autism
despite the criticisms , evans has been a passionate defender of the paleo lifestyle daria said she was surprised to see that evans was advocating the elimination of entire food groups , including grains , and posted a further question regarding how the celebrity chef came to the conclusion ' despite good scientific evidence to show their nutritional benefit , particularly in wholegrain form
