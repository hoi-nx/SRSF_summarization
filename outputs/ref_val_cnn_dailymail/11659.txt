the first â significant â solar flare of the year has been spotted by a nasa observatory
the flare peaked at 12.22pm edt ( 4.22pm gmt ) yesterday and was watched by the orbiting sdo ( sdo )
this flare was the most powerful of the year so far , and is predicted to cause a geomagnetic storm on earth tomorrow following blackouts today
it was the biggest eruption of the year and peaked at 4.22pm gmt yesterday ( shown ) this flare was classified as an x2.2-class flare
solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation , but harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through earth 's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground
this flare was emitted from active region 12297 ( ar12297 ) on the sun. according to the us space weather prediction centre ( swpc ) in boulder , colorado , the flare caused an hour - long blackout in some high - frequency radio communications over some areas
the flare ( seen in different wavelengths on the left and right ) has already caused radio blackouts on earth and a minor geomagnetic storm could occur tomorrow
this flare was emitted from active region 12297 ( ar12297 ) on the sun. solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost
. â this is yet another significant solar flare from active region 12297 as it marches across the solar disk
â the combined effects of these storms have prompted a g1 ( minor ) geomagnetic storm watch to be issued , with the possibility of additional or upgraded watches if / when additional data can be analysed , â they wrote
a geomagnetic storm is a temporary disturbance of earth 's atmosphere , which can cause communication problems
it captured the images of this latest large flare according to the us space weather prediction centre ( swpc ) in boulder , colorado , the flare ( shown ) caused an hour - long blackout in some high - frequency radio communicatiosn over some areas a solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots
