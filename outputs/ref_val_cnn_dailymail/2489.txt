coppell is sipping afternoon tea in the lounge of a hotel just off the m25 when the conversation turns to football âs â f - off mentality â , as he calls it
â a lot of young players have an â f - off mentality â these days , but i honestly did nât mind it because i was the one picking the team , â he admitted
â coppell has been out of work since leaving his role as director of football at portsmouth a year ago coppell played as a winger for manchester united for eight years between 1975 and 1983 coppell leads his palace side onto the wembley pitch in the first 1990 fa cup final against manchester united coppell knows all about the sport âs â f - off mentality â , on the receiving end after leaving an unpaid role as director of football at portsmouth last march
it seems incredible that this man , with more than 1,000 games in the dug - out and who has twice been named lma manager of the year ( 2006 and 2007 ) , is out of work
it just does nât feel right to see coppell , a man of integrity and honour , on the fringes of football
something , somewhere , has gone wrong when coppell is working on his golf handicap every day
â i won the lma award two years on the bounce with reading and looking back , yes , massive , â he admitted
â at 59 coppell is a statesman of the game , one of the shrewdest operators in the sport
coppell issues his side with instructions after drawing 3 - 3 with manchester united in the final before extra-time coppell poses with his manager of the month award in 2006 during his spell in charge of reading â i just wanted to be known as a good manager , i never wanted to be famous , â he admitted when he was reluctantly coaxed to the runnymede - on - thames hotel
it is clear , after a couple of hours in coppell âs illuminating company , that he has the itch to work again , but it will only be on his terms
if you want a five - year plan , fannying around , building from the bottom up , i âm not your man
â coppell celebrates with then palace chairman ron noades after winning the 1997 play - off final coppell , pictured at the spain 1982 world cup finals , won 42 international caps for england to recap , coppell won two promotions with palace , took them to their only fa final , won promotion with reading to the premier league and finished eighth in their first season in the top flight
â if i got really busy around football clubs then i could work again but i choose not to be , in the footballing sense , â he admitted
â i still go to games and i enjoy the core things that football gives me , which is working out how people win matches and influence players
â coppell is a student of the game , a manager who travelled all over the country to watch players at every level and build up an encyclopaedic knowledge of teams and tactics
â palace players doused coppell with champagne after winning the division two play - off final in 1989 coppell admits being a manager consumes every part of your life and he found it difficult to switch off coppell 's last job in management was with bristol city in 2010 coppell is a fascinating man to listen to as he talks through his management career
the premier league is a handicap system , with the big clubs putting 25 or 30 players out on loan â football should be provocative and change it
the premier league are 100 per cent successful in what they set out to do , which is to make as much money as possible
â when you sit down with coppell , he is a million miles away from the monosyllabic character who would turn up at press conferences when he was in work
the 59 - year - old won consecutive lma manager of the year awards in 2006 and 2007 â i look at bill belichick , the head coach of the new england patriots , and he âs won four super bowls in 11 years
â so did coppell , a popular figure in dressing rooms at his clubs
this is a man who consciously spent a year out of the game when he left reading after they failed to beat burnley in the championship play - off semi-final in 2009
â coppell is tempted to move abroad himself , to test himself in another country if england really has turned its back on him
ideally i would probably like to work abroad and i am at an age where if it does nât happen now it might never happen
