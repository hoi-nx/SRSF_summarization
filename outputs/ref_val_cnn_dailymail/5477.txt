a wave of migrants 4,500 years ago left their trace in the dna and languages of modern europeans
this is according to a study that found evidence of this stone age migration by analysing dna of 69 people who lived across europeans between 8,000 and 3,000 years ago
among the shifts in the genetic make - up of ancient europeans they found that dna associated with the yamnaya people appeared strongly in what is now northern germany
researchers have identified a mass migration of kurgan populations ( yamnaya culture ) which went from the russia steppes to the centre of europeans 4,500 years ago
previously , researchers had believed it spread 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east , now modern day turkey , brought it to europeans there are two main theories as to how indo-european spread in europeans
the first is the anatolian hypothesis , which claims spread of the language occurred some 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east ( currently turkey ) brought it to europeans
this theory suggests their language spread throughout europeans after the invention of wheeled vehicles , from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago
the yamnaya were herders who lived in the steppe north of the black and aral seas
previously , researchers had believed that indo-european language spread some 8,500 years ago , when the first farmers from the near east , now modern day turkey , brought it to europeans
the latest study suggests that europeans was first reshaped during the neolithic revolution 8,500 years ago
