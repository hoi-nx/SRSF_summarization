president obama 's most secretive and controversial adviser is n't going anywhere , despite six years of whisper campaigns and public derision offered up by republican
valerie jarrett , the onetime aide to then - chicago mayor richard daley , was introduced to obama by a young staffer then named michelle robinson

' the president listens to people who have interesting things to say â that could be the most junior person on the staff or it could be a senior adviser or it could be a person who whispers something to him across a rope line
' night - stalker ' : jarrett has access to both the west wing and the upstairs presidential residence , drawing resentment from other senior staff but a republican congressional staffer who requested anonymity spoke frankly about jarrett on friday , telling daily mail online that she ' is clearly obama 's rasputin , subtlely steering the ship of state

' she went to whatever meeting she wanted to go to â basically all of them â and then would go and whisper to the president
' jarrett told the new york times that having obama 's ear and knowing his instincts ' initially it probably made people a little uncomfortable , ' but ' i think that has faded

klein cited sources who told him jarrett and obama are jointly behind it since neither wants sto see mrs. hillary clinton measuring the oval office 's drapes
' ' all of this , i âm told , is prompted by valerie jarrett and the president , who do not want to see hillary clinton president of the united states , ' klein said
