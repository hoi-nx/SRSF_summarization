it recalled one of the most memorable moments in comic book history , but for critics on social media , one comic book cover went too far , and it 's now been pulled
dc comics pulled the cover for the upcoming " batgirl " # 41 , which portrays the joker threatening a frightened batgirl with a gun , with " joker makeup " on her mouth
for the month of june , dc comics 's variant covers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the iconic villain
the cover recalls barbara gordon 's encounter with the joker in the classic story " the killing joke
after being shot , the character remained in a wheelchair for decades , until dc comics retconned barbara gordon 's fate in 2011 , allowing her to walk again and be batgirl
dc comics ( owned by time warner , which also owns cnn ) said in a statement late monday that artist rafael 's cover was going to be pulled
" regardless if fans like rafael 's homage to alan moore 's the killing joke graphic novel from 25 years ago , or find it inconsistent with the current tonality of the batgirl books -- threats of violence and harassment are wrong and have no place in comics or society , " they said
" we stand by our creative talent , and per rafael 's request , dc comics will not publish the batgirl variant
" albuquerque said in his own statement , " my batgirl variant cover artwork was designed to pay homage to a comic that i really admire , and i know is a favorite of many readers
' the killing joke ' is part of batgirl 's canon and artistically , i could n't avoid portraying the traumatic relationship between barbara gordon and the joker
" albuquerque added in a tweet on monday night that he was never threatened ( the " threats " dc comics referenced were aimed at those objecting to the cover , per " batgirl " writer stewart )
