as we find more planetary systems elsewhere in the galaxy , something is confusing astronomers - why does our solar system appear so unique ? many other systems have â super-earths â and other planets in tight orbits close to their star , but ours does not
and now we might know why - because jupiter acted like a â wrecking ball â in the early solar system and knocked planets out of the solar system or into position
university of california scientists have presented a new theory for the solar system
they say early in its life , jupiter swung through the inner planets ( illustration of early solar system shown )
this explains why there are no planets between mercury and the sun. but it may also indicate our system is an ' oddball ' in the galaxy if this is true , it would suggest that the conditions that have allowed life on earth to thrive are incredibly rare
â now we can look at our own solar system in the context of all these other planetary systems , one of the most interesting features is the absence of planets inside the orbit of mercury , â said professor laughlin , of california university in santa cruz , who co-authored the study
â aliens are real - not little green men visiting earth as depicted in movies , but rather microbial life in our own solar system and intelligent life beyond
â the new findings provide an explanation for this â gaping hole â in our inner solar system between mercury and the sun. but they also reveal certain characteristics of earth and the other rocky planets , which would have formed later than the outer ones from a depleted supply of material
namely , jupiter may have helped earth form in a habitable part of the solar system
computer models of the early solar system showed the migration of jupiter may have shepherded small early planets - initiating a â collisional cascade â in the inner solar system
â as jupiter ( pictured from the cassini spacecraft on 8 october 2000 ) moved inward in the early solar system , gravitational perturbations from the giant planet would have swept the inner planets and large space rocks into close - knit overlapping orbits - setting off a series of collisions that smashed all the planets into pieces the study published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences helps explain why our solar system is so different from the hundreds of others discovered in recent years
ultimately , jupiter 's interaction with the inner solar system billions of years ago may have given rise to the solar system we know today ( illustrated ) - and also the conditions necessary for life on earth , namely a habitable distance from the sun and a suitably - sized world planet hunters have detected well over a thousand exoplanets orbiting stars in our galaxy , including nearly 500 systems with multiple planets
what has emerged from these observations as the â typical â planetary system is one consisting of a few planets with masses several times larger than the earth âs - super-earths - orbiting much closer to their host star than mercury is to the sun. in systems with giant planets similar to jupiter , they also tend to be much closer to their host stars than the giant planets in our solar system
only the formation of saturn in our own solar system pulled jupiter back out and allowed mercury , venus , earth , and mars to form
