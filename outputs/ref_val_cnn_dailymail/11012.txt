cabinet office minister rob wilson said thornton , the chief constable of thames valley police , tried to stop him raising allegations of police errors in a â sickening â paedophile scandal
rob wilson claimed he received â darkly veiled threats â to drop claims that police failed to warn a young mother she was working with a dangerous paedophile who went on to abuse her son
and he said one of the â threats â was made by ms thornton
but ms thornton , said to be david cameron âs favourite police leader , hit back angrily last night
in a statement to the mail on sunday she rejected the allegations as â unfounded â
â i categorically deny ever making any sort of threat â veiled or otherwise â to rob wilson mp
mr rob wilson , who is the woman âs local mp in reading , offered to raise her case in the commons in 2008
â there were all sorts of darkly veiled threats if i went head - to - head and toe - to - toe with thames valley police , â he said
â â the the mail on sunday has confirmed that mr rob wilson claims ms thornton was one of those who tried to deter him
â but ms thornton , who is next month set to become the boss of the new national police chiefs â council , said : â such allegations are unfounded and libellous
he criticised ms thornton for threatening to sue him and claimed she was continuing to try to stop the matter being discussed openly
' unfounded ' : thames valley chief constable thornton has categorically denied making any threats â it is very disappointing that thornton is making legal threats which will prevent proper open discussion
his differences with ms thornton follow criticism of thames valley police over the way it handled the oxfordshire child sex scandal in which as many as 373 children could have been targeted for sex by gangs of men over the last 16 years
earlier this month , ms thornton repeated an apology to victims and their families after an official review found the force had made mistakes
mr rob wilson said he referred obliquely to the conduct of police when he defied the alleged â threats â and raised the matter in a commons debate in 2008 when he said he was there â to represent my constituents without fear and favour
