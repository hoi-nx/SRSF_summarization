with its green spaces , pavilions and cafes , this planned redevelopment of the manhattan waterfront looks like any other city regeneration project
but in fact the plans have been designed with a far more serious goal in mind â to protect the island and its 1.6 million residents from a repeat of the devastation wreaked by hurricane sandy in 2012
the 10 miles of parkland and public open space that skirt in a u-shape around manhattan will in fact be used to camouflage raised barriers and deployable walls that will be essential to battle rising waters in the event of a storm
the project by danish designers , the big ( big ) , aims to create a protective ribbon around lower manhattan , shielding buildings from flood and storm surges
deployable walls , clever planting , kiosks , sport areas , cycle routes and walkways have also been incorporated into the scheme that will defend the city
an sirr report recommends eight continuous miles of integrated coastal protection around manhattan after hurricane sandy the flooded defences should prevent flooding like that scene seen in manhattan in the wake of hurricane sandy in 2012 and also double as leisure amenities before and after : the bridging berm will provide ' robust vertical protection ' for the lower east side from future storm surges and rising sea levels
pictured : existing condition , left , and improved condition , right this is the big 's long term vision for the bridging berm , which will be transformed as part of the first phase of the scheme phase one : the bridging beam will create vistas over the lower east side of manhattan that visitors will be able to use to relax , socialize and enjoy river views there are also plans for outdoor public pools , similar to the harbour baths in copenhagen , to be incorporated into the proposals on 10th street as part of the bridging berm alongside the bridging berm a new scenic cycle way will be created for bike riders to enjoy on the banks of the manhattan shoreline this bridge , right , and the view of east river park , left , will be improved as part of the first ambitious of the project to protect manhattan the bridging berm or shelf will provide robust protection for the lower east side from future storm surge and rising sea levels
how the flip downs would work in the event of flood water surging towards manhattan and the homes and businesses ' when you go there you 'll see landscape , you 'll see pavilions , but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects manhattan from flooding
' hurricane sandy left parts of new york in ruin when it battered the us eastern seaboard in october 2012 , damaging 305,000 homes and leaving in its wake $ 19 billion worth of destruction
in fact , big was the only company to bid to create flood defences for manhattan

the dryline project also features plans for swimming pools , aquariums , pavilions , and parks the scheme , created by the big ( big ) , has been created with the help of local communities when fully completed the ambitious scheme will create new public open spaces running from west 57th street , down to the battery park and up to east 42nd street the design includes open spaces and sports areas that people will be able to use in good weather bjarke ingels said : ' when you go there you 'll see landscape , you 'll see pavilions , but all of this will secretly be the infrastructure that protects manhattan from flooding
fishing piers , an aquarium , swimming pools and pavilions are also said to feature in the 10 - mile long scheme
