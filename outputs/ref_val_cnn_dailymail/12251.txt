iran 's supreme leader ayatollah khamenei on thursday accused the six world powers involved in negotiations over iran 's nuclear program of " deception , trickery and backstabbing " in their dealings with tehran , according to iranian state media
he also criticized a letter sent by 47 u.s. republican senators to iran 's leaders , which threatened to scupper any deal if a republican president is elected next year , iran 's official press tv reported
he suggested that the letter was part of a u.s. strategy of last - minute reversal aimed at undermining a comprehensive deal covering iran 's nuclear ambitions , press tv said
the six world powers -- the u.s. , russia , china , the united kingdom and france , plus germany , a group known as the p5 +1 -- are seeking a deal that will ensure that iran does n't develop nuclear arms
the republican senators ' decision to write to iran 's leaders has stirred up a political firestorm in the u.s.
did 47 republican senators break the law in plain sight ? " it purports to tell the world that if you want to have any confidence in your dealings with u.s. , they have to negotiate with 535 members of congress , " kerry said
