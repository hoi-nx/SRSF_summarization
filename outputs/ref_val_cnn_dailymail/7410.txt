despite the rather clunky acronym , mitsubishi 's outlander phev has been a runaway success on the quiet
the prototype xr - outlander phev ( plug-in electric vehicle ) ii is a compact , lightweight suv powered by a new hybrid electric system
mitsubishi 's xr-phev ( plug-in electric vehicle ) ii ( pictured ) will cost up to Â£ 40,000 ( prototype pictured ) mitsubishi says of its baby phev : ' the system is estimated to achieve very low co2 emissions of below 40g/km while also delivering gutsy and smooth performance with its 163bhp electric motor
' it adds that it is developing plug - in electric hybrid systems best suited to each model in its line - up with a view to introducing them in the near future
the outlander phev can be charged overnight at home , run on electric - only power or operate in hybrid mode , switching automatically between petrol and electric power , depending on which is most efficient
the result is great fuel economy and low co2 emissions
here 's why : bought outright privately , the outlander phev costs Â£ 28,249 to Â£ 39,999 , which includes a taxpayer subsidy of Â£ 5,000
but company car drivers can look forward to an increase in their pay packet equal to an average of more than Â£ 4,000 every year , says mitsubishi
its twolitre petrol engine linked to two high - efficiency electric motors gives a combined range of 510 miles , of which 32.5 miles can be in pure electric mode
average co2 emissions are a tiny 44g/km and combined fuel efficiency is 148 mpg
the new prototype 's big brother is the mitsubishi outlander phev ( pictured ) plus , its low co2 emissions mean you are exempt from road tax â and in london , the congestion charge , too
there 's a benefit for firms , too , notes mitsubishi : ' a company purchasing an outlander phev is able to write down 100 per cent of the cost of the car against its profits chargeable for corporation tax in year one
' less than a year on from its uk launch last april , mitsubishi has sold more than 10,000 outlander phevs
it 's overtaken every other plug - in hybrid and pure electric car , even passing vehicles that have been on sale since 2011 , such as the nissan , to become the uk 's favourite plug - in vehicle , says mitsubishi
