a michigan couple has completed a quest to visit all 3,108 counties in the lower 48 states after driving around the country in a green 1999 dodge intrepid for almost nine years
jennifer and jonathan put the finish touch on their journey this week when they boarded a ferry to nantucket in their car , which has accumulated almost 540,000 miles
jennifer and jonathan , 32 and 31 , completed their journey to the lower 48 states ' 3,108 counties when they arrived in nantucket , their last county , with their green 1999 dodge intrepid they have preferred sticking to physical maps since their journey began in 2006 , though the riehls bought a gps device in 2012 to help out in the remote corners of the us where the streets are n't labelled
riehl , 32 , a research scientist at michigan technological university , and her husband , 31 , an engineering instructor at the institution , typically drove about 50,000 miles a year
jonathan , who does the majority of the driving while his wife navigates , hangs a map of their travels in his office and says that colleagues are ' genuinely baffled ' by the accomplishment
the car and both of its primary passengers have been to all 3,108 counties , and the vehicle is still using the same engine it had when it was bought despite many 16 - hour days on the road
they think a 15,000 - mile trip from new jersey to alaska to their home on michigan 's upper peninsula over 38 days in the summer of 2012 may have broken a record for the long distance speed in a car
the contiguous 48 states have 3,108 counties , and the addition of alaska and hawaii brings the total to 3,143 the couple reached their final county in the lower 48 states on tuesday during their spring break trip
the couple has already visited some boroughs of alaska , but plans on finishing the state and starting on hawaii
jennifer 's mother lives in texas , but the travelers do n't take the direct interstate route when they go to visit
their parents accompanied them on the final ferry leg into nantucket , ma , on tuesday
jonathan proposed to jennifer on a 2011 trip to manitoba , canada , where they have added roughly half of the provinces to their total in addition to three mexican states
however , their first hours as an engaged couple were spent driving south to winnepeg in blinding snow with jennifer keeping track of the road 's white line out of the car window and her fiance drove
jonathan and jennifer like to visit the county seat of each county if they can
above , the travelers stand in a new jersey wood by jonathan 's uncle 's house jonathan and jennifer say they can navigate small towns just because they know how they are set up
they do n't play children 's car games and occasionally listen to xm radio , but spend most of their time in the car catching up on each other 's lives
who both work at michigan technological university , have been going to different counties together since 2006 and drive about 50,000 miles a year
