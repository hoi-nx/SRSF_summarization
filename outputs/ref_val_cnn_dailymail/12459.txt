under harsh lights in a private , rented room in berlin , women face each other in violent , sometimes bloody battles of brute strength
there are no official rules to this female fight club
the fighters are both beginners and professionals , anywhere from age 20 to 50 , said photographer mazur , who spent months documenting the club in 2013 and 2014
i had never seen something like that before , and it was really interesting to experience all of this so close , " said mazur , who photographed the fight club as part of her work toward graduation from photography school
" inhibition and fear do not exist on the mat. " at first , mazur said , she shot the fight club in color , but the look of the blue mat and neon lights did n't satisfy her
" for all the aggression built into fighting , mazur said , the project required a lot of sensitivity
mazur said she had to examine her own limitations , questioning " how far can i go ? do they trust me ? am i allowed to do that ? " social media follow @ cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography
" i enjoy exploring new worlds , especially a world which exists in a gray area , " she said
even years later , the fight club is still running and is " better than ever , " mazur said
" mazur is a polish photographer based in berlin
