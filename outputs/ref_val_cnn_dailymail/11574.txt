kayley atkinson , 23 , and victoria , 22 , from newcastle , were on a night out in the town centre when they decided to take a snap to send to friends
they were having drinks in the slug and lettuce on quayside , which they said was virtually empty , when the image was captured

' she said there was a figure in the background , and i am quite sceptical about things like that so i just laughed at the time
â the image also comes just days after an australian family apparently photographed the spirit of a young girl who drowned in a swimming hole while they were taking a dip there
after the image attracted a lot of attention online the pair did some research and found that a young girl drowned in the same spot 100 years ago .
