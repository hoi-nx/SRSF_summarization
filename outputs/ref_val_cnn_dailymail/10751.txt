a volcano that erupted on the moon 3.5 billion years ago has been mapped in detail , showing it was much more explosive than thought
the research reveals that the eruption would have sent debris across an area the size of scotland on the lunar surface
and the team are going to use their same technique to map the eruption of the largest known volcano in the solar system : olympus mons on mars
research led by durham university studied a lunar volcanic eruption
the team found that the eruption was much bigger than was thought
it erupted 3.5 billion years ago ( illustration of earth from around this time with the moon shown ) and covered a scotland - sized area in debris
this was thanks to the low gravity of the moon the findings were led by experts in the institute for computational cosmology and department of earth sciences at durham university , uk
with the help of the moon 's low gravity , debris from the eruption spread over an area of 27,000 square miles ( 70,000 square kilometres )
based on this information , the durham - led team used a ' pixon ' image enhancement technique , originally designed to peer into the distant universe , to sharpen the map and reveal the enormous size of the thorium deposit from the volcanic eruption
the green area shows where debris from the eruption went , spreading 185 miles ( 300km ) east nasa 's lunar prospector spacecraft ( illustrated ) first spotted the volcanic site in 1999 by detecting an isolated deposit of thorium - which is associated with volcanic activity
' volcanoes were common in the early life of the moon and in fact the dark " seas " you can observe on the lunar surface were created by runny , iron - rich , lava that flooded large areas , filling in impact craters and low - lying ground , ' he said
' the research team is now planning to apply its mapping technique to the largest known volcano in the solar system , olympus mons on mars
