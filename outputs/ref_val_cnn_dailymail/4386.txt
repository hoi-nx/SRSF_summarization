a team of experts has found a way to bypass the iphone lock screen using a diy hacking kit apple phones are designed to ward off hackers by locking the phone after too many incorrect attempts at entering a passcode
but a team of experts has found a way to bypass this security feature using a diy hacking kit made from parts bought online
the gadget plugs into a phone and simulates the pin entry over usb meaning it can bruteforce every possible combination until it finds the correct one
importantly , by connecting directly to the phone 's power source , it can override the ' erase data after 10 attempts ' setting
the hack and device was devised by experts from london - based mdsec , authors of the mobile application hacker 's handbook
' although we âre still analysing the device it appears to be relatively simple in that it simulates the pin entry over the usb connection and sequentially bruteforces every possible pin combination
the hack and device was devised by experts from london - based mdsec
' mdsec 's total setup cost around Â£ 200 ( $ 297 ) , and the researchers explained that because each pin entry takes approximately 40 seconds - including the phone shutting down - it can take more than four days to bruteforce a four - digit code
