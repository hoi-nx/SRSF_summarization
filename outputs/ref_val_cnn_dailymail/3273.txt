a video has emerged believed to show isis executioner jihadi john ranting on camera shortly after he arrived in syrian from the british
the footage is of two bands of fanatical fighters joining forces in 2013 under the command of notorious terrorist shishani
a man thought to be jihadi john proclaims allegiance to a terror group in footage filmed in 2013
the video is thought to be the first known appearance by the executioner now unmasked as mohammed emwazi the video is thought to have been filmed just months after mohammed emwazi is understood to have fled british to take up arms alongside the extremists
it shows a pledge of allegiance made when the so - called ' army of emigrants and supporters of muhammad brigades ' group joined forces with the so - called ' brigade of migrants ' , of which emwazi is believed to have been a member
' mohammed emwazi , now 26 , attempted to join al-shabaab in somalia after finishing his university course in london in 2009 , but was refused entry to tanzania and returned to british , from where he later went to syrian
ellekhlifi , 22 , fled to syrian while on bail and was killed fighting near aleppo in august 2013 , months after the video thought to feature mohammed emwazi was filmed
in the latest video , the man suspected of being mohammed emwazi stands at the front of a long line of gun - toting militants , with shishani standing behind him arm - in - arm with two other fighters
the video shows a pledge of allegiance to omar al-shishani , now a commander of isis in syrian mohammed emwazi is thought to a fighter ( second right beneath flag ) who appears in another photo featuring al - shishani mr winter added : ' while he does have certain features that resemble mohammed emwazi , there have been numerous false alarms with id - ing " jihadi john " in the past
' others have cast doubt on whether the man is mohammed emwazi , saying the speaker in the film looks shorter than the londoner and appears to be holding the kalashnikov rifle with his right hand , whereas jihadi john held his knife in his left hand
if the video does show emwazi , the footage would be the first known time he appeared on camera in syrian after going to fight
the group were not part of isis at the time the video was filmed , but joined the group in the months that followed
mohammed emwazi is believed to have among a group of brits , which also includes ibrahim al-mazwagi ( left ) , choukri ellekhlifi ( centre ) and mohammad el-araj ( right ) , who were among the first to travel to syrian to fight ibrahim al-mazwagi ( centre ) , the first british jihadi known to have died in syrian , is pictured here with abu omar al-shishani ( right ) , one of the most feared military commanders of the islamic state of syrian and iraq omar al-shishani has moved from the conflicts of the caucasus , south of russia to become one of the most feared commanders in the isis army now terrorising syrian and iraq omar al-shishani , whose real name is tarkhan batirashvili , is an ethnic chechen from the caucasus nation of georgian , specifically from the pankisi valley , a centre of georgian 's chechen community and once a stronghold for militants
