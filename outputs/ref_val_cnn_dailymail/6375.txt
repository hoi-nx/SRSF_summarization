ireland went into the game on the back of a nine - match winning run , including autumn victories over australia and south africa , while england were buoyed by a four - game unbeaten run against today âs hosts
jonny sexton kicked the penalty from 40 metres , with barely two minutes on the clock , before england conceded another penalty from the kick off and ireland roared back into their opponents half
