it had been a theme of the season for everton to provide hope in europe after poor champions league results but not this time
things spectacularly unravelled against dynamo and roberto martinez looked haunted as the reality of this 5 - 2 slaying sank in
roberto martinez had complained a punishing fixture list is compromising the ambitions of premier league teams but fatigue had nothing to do with this night of high farce
dynamo players celebrate during a rampant display which saw the ukraine league leaders ease into the quarter - finals yarmolenko lets fly with a stunning strike to give the hosts the lead on the night teodorczyk celebrates after scoring kiev 's second on a disastrous night for everton in europe veloso hit the third to give dynamo the lead on aggregate which they never looked like relinquishing gusev followed his goal at goodison park with another against everton as the hosts heaped the woe on the toffeemen antunes completed dynamo 's scoring with a beauty from the portuguese defender to knock the stuffing out of everton lukaku gave his side hope but his equaliser proved to be a false dawn for everton , who subsequently conceded four dynamo ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : shovkovskiy 6 : silva 7 , khacherdi 7 , dragovic 7 , antunes 7 : rybalka 7 , veloso 7.5 : yarmolenko 8.5 , sydorchuk 6.5 ( buyalskiy 64 , 7 ) , gusev 7.5 ( kalitvinstev 90 ) : teodorczyk 7.5 ( kravets 74 , 6 ) subs not used : rybka , garmash , kravets , burda , buyalskiy , mbokani booked : rybalka , dragovic , antunes , goals : yarmolenko 21 , teodorczyk 35 , veloso 37 , gusev 56 , antunes 76 everton ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : howard 6 : seamus coleman 4.5 , phil jagielka 5.5 , antolin alcaraz 4 , leighton baines 5.5 : barry 5 , mccarthy 5 ( besic 78 ) : christian atsu 4 ( leon osman 65 , 6 ) , steven naismith 5 ( arouna kone 65 , 4 ) , ross barkley 5 : lukaku 6 subs not used : robles , gibson , stones , garbutt
booked : besic , leon osman , arouna kone goals : lukaku 29 , phil jagielka 82 motm : andrei yarmolenko attendance : 67,550 referee : deniz aytekin ( germany ) everton conceded five times and were fortunate not to ship another three or four , as dynamo ruthlessly exposed their naivety
to stand any hope of progressing , it was imperative for everton to take the sting out of the contest early on and , more importantly , quieten an excitable home crowd that had whipped themselves into a frenzy long before kick - off
andrei yarmolenko had made an impression on everton âs players with his style and grace in the first leg and he opened the scoring with a quite brilliant goal , bending in a 25 - yard drive that flashed past howard
the execution of the strike was magnificent but , on the touchline , roberto martinez stood aghast
why , the manager must have been wondering , was a player of his yarmolenko âs quality allowed to run 20 yards without anyone making a tackle ? it was the moment that sparked the game to life and for 10 minutes , the two teams began trading blows like boxers going through the gears
everton roared back and had rattled the hosts with a brilliant effort from lukaku , the belgian scoring the 100th goal of his career with a bending left - footed effort from the edge of the area after seizing on a loose ball
dynamo went through the gears and ripped into everton with a spell that left roberto martinez and his players bewildered and broken
so bad was everton âs play , you sensed dynamo could score every time they got within shooting distance
teodorczyk made the aggregate all square in the 34th minute , nipping in front of antolin alcaraz to smash past the stranded howard
as he wheeled away gleefully , followed by his ecstatic team - mates , a number of everton heads started to drop
yarmolenko 's sensational strike lit the touchpaper on a seven - goal game

everton ( march 19 , europa league last 32 ) : thumped 5 - 2 by kiev in ukraine
this time veloso profited from another defensive mix - up , his shot taking a slight deflection off seamus coleman on its way past howard
how had it come to this ? half - time should have given roberto martinez a chance to unscramble the senses , to make changes and give everton clarity but , for some reason , he chose not to make any substitutions and dynamo simply re-emerged to pin them back on the ropes
why were everton going to make a tackle now ? eventually , everton stemmed the tide and scored another of their own , with phil jagielka glancing in a leighton baines corner , but this was no consolation
