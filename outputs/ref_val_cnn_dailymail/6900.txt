snacking on unhealthy food should be viewed in the same way as smoking indoors , a leading anti-obesity expert has today claimed all meals should be served with vegetables , snacking should be socially unacceptable and a fizzy drinks tax must be introduced if the obesity epidemic is to be tackled , an expert said today
the government 's anti-obesity adviser said she wants food policy to be subjected to the same tough regulations as the tobacco industry
professor susan jebb , from oxford university , said social norms are ' terribly important ' , and as such , grazing on unhealthy snacks should be frowned upon
preventing these avoidable diseases should be the government 's focus , if the health service is to become more sustainable , professor jebb is expected to say tomorrow at the annual oxford london lecture
the components of a healthy diet , consuming less saturated fat , sugar and salt while instead eating more fibre , fruit and vegetables , are well known
professor jebb , is expected to call for a tax on fizzy drinks to help tackle the issue
' in addition assistants in fast food chains should refuse to serve dangerously fat customers
faffing about talking about food choices will no longer achieve the results we all want to see
' professor jebb , told the times : ' when i was small , eating or drinking on the street was really , really bad form
' the other norm i worry about is around vegetable eating , because in our house it would be inconceivable if a meal did n't come with vegetables ... yet you go and have a meal out and often it will come without vegetables , you will have to buy those separately
' professor susan jebb , from oxford university , is calling for a tax on fizzy drinks , which have no nutritional value but rot teeth , to start a series of new , tougher measures , to change the way society perceives unhealthy food and drink
and she championed a more structured approach to meals , with less emphasis on grazing , noting when snacking it is difficult to know how much you have eaten
both the conservatives and labour have ruled out introducing a tax on junk food and fizzy drinks if they are to win the election on may 7
she said fizzy drinks are a good place to introduce food taxation , because they have no nutritional value and rot teeth
professor susan jebb is one of the key anti-obesity advisers to the government professor jebb added : ' it sends out a powerful message that these are unhealthy foods and it is one way to start shifting consumer behaviour
' we now have the mind set that we eat on the go , snacking anywhere , in front of the tv , in the car , anywhere
' the government needs to say to them that unless they bring down unhealthy levels of certain ingredients in their products they will be fined
' we need legislation of some variety , professor jebb is absolutely right , some kind of tax on fizzy drinks is a no brainer , we should have seen it 10 years ago
' professor jebb pointed to evidence in mexico where the number of people drinking fizzy drinks dropped dramatically after the government there introduced a 10 per cent tax on sugary beverages
