â parenting expert ryan from support service babybliss told daily mail australia the age of when a child should go into a public toilet alone is a â tough question â

sydney dad mark elias , whose son jacob is almost two years old , told daily mail australia he would let his child go to a public bathroom at â 11 to 12 years â

' ' parents i know make decisions based on the needs of their child as an individual
