a french teacher from florida has been suspended for five days without pay after she was accused of calling her 14 - year - old muslim student a ' raghead taliban ' when he walked into class wearing a hoodie
the administrative complaint filed against maria valdes also claimed that , when the teacher called on on wardani , she once asked ' okay the taliban , what is the answer ? ' it also alleged that the cypress bay high school teacher would say ' ah no ! the taliban is here ' when he walked into the classroom and would refer to him as a ' terrorista , ' which is spanish for terrorist
' valdes will also have to undergo a diversity training program
the punishment is not enough for wardani 's father youssef , who said that , at a minimum , he believes the teacher should have been suspended for a year without pay - if not fired
wardani said the five - day suspension amounted to a ' vacation '
superintendent runcie , who filed the administrative complaint after he was notified of valdes ' alleged comments , said the matter was taken ' very seriously ' and was addressed with the ' appropriate sense of urgency '
the punishment is not enough for wardani 's father youssef , who said that , at a minimum , he believes the teacher should have been suspended for a year without pay - if not fired during the meeting runcie , a jamaican immigrant , said that he had personally been affected by racism
district administrators said the degree of punishment that could be leveled against valdes was limited because of an agreement with the teachers union
as for wardani , he said he is ' very proud ' of his father and is getting support from his peers , but that he now feels a ' strange vibe ' from his french teacher , ' like she does n't want me to be there
