cuts of 20 per cent to the police budget by the tory will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror , a retiring senior officer has warned
sir hugh orde , the retiring president of the association of chief police officers ( association of chief police officers ) , claims the ' tipping point ' between cutting resources and staff and increasing the risk to the public is close
since 2011 the home office reduced the amount spent on police by 20 per cent and the home secretary theresa may has said there will be further cuts if the tories win the forthcoming election
sir hugh orde , the retiring president of the association of chief police officers , warns that cuts to the police budget of 20 per cent , proposed by the tories , will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror one way some forces are reportedly going to try to operate on smaller budgets is by reducing the number of officers
sir hugh orde , who is due to stand down ahead of the creation of the national police chiefs ' council , told the observer that taking police off the streets is a clear risk in the fight against extremism
' asked directly whether police would have adequate resources to protect the public in the context of cuts , he said : ' in my professional judgement , the answer is no. ' he added that cuts to other public services had put an increased pressure on the police , with officers having to fill in for ambulance crews and those let down by depleted mental health care
sir hugh orde , who left association of chief police officers two weeks ago , said while it is accepted police can not be exempt from cuts , he questioned how much more the forces can take
he added that 44 police forces is too many and collaboration is important and cited the work of sir stephen house , chief constable in scotland , who has brought together eight forces , where crime is at an all - time low
yvette cooper mp , labour 's shadow home secretary , said cuts would take spending back to 1930s levels and would sign the end of neighbourhood policing labour has claimed another 30,000 police officers could be lost if the tory are returned to power in may
yvette cooper mp , labour 's shadow home secretary , said : ' conservative plans to cut spending back to 1930s levels would mean the end of neighbourhood policing
' these figure show that under these extreme and risky tory plans a further 30,000 police officers could be lost - the equivalent of almost the entire metropolitan police force
' metropolitan police commissioner sir bernard hogan-howe said his force had lost about 15 per cent of its grant , Â£ 600 million , in 12 months
