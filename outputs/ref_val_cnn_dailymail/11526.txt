talk show host and prankster kimmel fooled sxsw attendees for the second year in a row , by asking for their opinions on fake bands
a television crew at the austin , texas , festival spoke with people in man - on - the - street interviews
those interviewed seemed unaware it was for kimmel 's ' lie witness news , ' which catches people fibbing
all but one claimed to be familiar with the musical artists discussed , despite the fact none of them are real , apparently in an attempt to be cool
' he 's really mixing it up with actually turntable - ism and bringing that back in , scratching , right ? so it 's something that is oftentimes lost on some of the newer - age djs , and i think it 's great how he 's bringing that back in
' another man at sxsw says he 's a ' dj gluten ' fan - though the interviewer says some find him ' hard to take
' pretending : the man on the left said he was a fan of ' dj cialis ' - like the erectile dysfunction medication - and the man on the right said he was a fan of ' dj gluten ' the video shows one man with a full beard and hat describing the group ' eddie and his manpurse
a man in glasses lies that he 's familiar with ' dj cialis ' - named for the erectile dysfunction medication
' yeah dude , he 's got the beat , ' the man says
' jokingly referring to the drug 's potential harm , the interviewer asks ' is dj cialis a little dangerous if he lasts more than four hours at one of his sets ? ' ' dangerous ? really ? ' the man says , puzzled
he even says he 's looking forward to hearing ' kimmel and the kimmels
' ' wait , you said kimmel and the kimmels ? ' he asks
' not like kimmel , like kimmel , but just like , just like ... ' ' like lie witness news , ' the interviewer says
' why not man , why not ? ' a woman lies that she knows the band ' ashley and the kale chips ' - and fibs she 's seen the group in person , but ' only once
' interviewed : one woman ( left ) claimed to be a fan of ' ashley and the kale chips , ' while another ( right ) said she was a fan of ' cheez whiz khalifa ' and three other fake artists a woman in a pink shirt lies that she knows four different music acts
um , one of my friends is really into him , and so he 's more - he 's showed me a lot more of him than i 've been exposed to
