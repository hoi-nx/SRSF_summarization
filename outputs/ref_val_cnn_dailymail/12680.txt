for four years , james called the oklahoma 's sigma alpha epsilon his home
that 's because not only is he an sigma alpha epsilon alumni , he is also african-american
how do you make sense of the fact that those behind these hateful words wore the same pledge pins , occupied the same house , preached " the same motto that i hold dear to my heart " as james did ? " i could n't look at myself , " he said , " still claiming to be that
" since the video surfaced sunday , students have been expelled and sigma alpha epsilon 's oklahoma chapter has shut down
the episode has left james disgusted , horrified that members of a fraternity that once welcomed him could espouse such hatred
students expelled over racist chant " i do n't know what happened to the culture of my home , " he told cnn on tuesday
" while the oklahoma frat has never had a lot of black members , that did n't matter to james when he joined in 2001
" james does n't believe the racist chant was an isolated incident , not given how many on the bus seemingly sang it so easily and enthusiastically
that 's what james thinks that his own fraternity brothers would 've done , whether he was around or not
" that 's what being an sigma alpha epsilon is
" and i do n't know what 's happened to ( the sigma alpha epsilon chapter ) since then
" many members of that pledge class , as well others who he knew from sigma alpha epsilon , have reached out to james in recent days by text , phone , email and facebook
he knows he is not alone , including in his support for disbanding oklahoma 's sigma alpha epsilon chapter
" his former frat brothers are different from him , of course
those on this weekend 's video may not be his brothers , but those he knew from 2001 to 2005 still are
