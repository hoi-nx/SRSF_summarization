paul 's rich neighbours have blown nearly half a million pounds fighting over a leaky gutter that would have cost just Â£ 7,000 to fix
multi-millionaire property tycoon fenton - who lives next door to the former beatle - has been at war for years with surveyor , lewis , whose Â£ 20million mansion adjoins her own listed home
the trouble between the pair centres on water overflowing from a blocked gutter on an extension at the back of mr lewis 's house and creating a damp problem in mrs fenton 's mansion next door
now a county court judge has ordered mr lewis to alter his house and pay his neighbour Â£ 250,000 in costs and damages , leaving him facing an estimated total bill for the dispute approaching half a million pounds
a row broke out between the owners of these two west west london mansions over a Â£ 7,000 leaky gutter the owners of the properties , which neighbour paul 's home , ended up going to court over the dispute and paid hundreds of thousands in legal fees the court heard that wealthy widow mrs fenton , 84 , moved into her home in st john 's wood , west london , 35 years ago
both mrs fenton and mr lewis are friends with the former beatle , judge bailey told central london county court , commenting that mrs fenton ' enjoyed an excellent relationship with her famous neighbour
fenton ( left ) insisted the extension of neighbour lewis ( right ) was ruining her own home miss shea told the judge : ' mrs fenton is an elderly widow who has occupied her house for 35 years
' philip byrne , for mr lewis , denied that mr lewis had caused a ' nuisance ' to his neighbour and dismissed expert reports linking the damp in mrs fenton 's home to the gutter as ' erroneous
it is unacceptable that , having built a gutter right against his neighbour 's wall , mr lewis did n't have a system of maintenance
sir paul 's home is separated from the two homes in the case and was he was not involved in the case of the extension the judge said : ' this was a bog standard construction , not of good quality for a terraced house in clapham , a semi-detached in ealing and certainly not in line with the quality of this detached house in st john 's wood , which has been valued , modestly , at Â£ 20million
' the judge ordered mr lewis to pay his neighbour Â£ 27,000 damages to repair her house , plus Â£ 50,000 for loss of amenity
the judge concluded by saying that it would have cost mr lewis about Â£ 7,000 to get a contractor to fix the leaky gutter , and thus avoid the costly court case
