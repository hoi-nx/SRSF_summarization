the american civil liberties union is challenging an alabama law that will force those under 18 seeking an abortion to go through an adversarial process that 's akin to a trial
generally , laws in the united states require parental consent for a minor to obtain an abortion
but for some children , parental consent is impossible or even dangerous
while the bypass is a common feature of abortion laws in other states , this alabama law may have gone too far
here are the suspect provisions of this " bypass by trial " : alabama has turned what is supposed to be an informal , child - centered hearing into more of a trial
the court can appoint a guardian ad litem -- normally an appointed lawyer for a child in , say , a divorce proceeding or a hearing involving unfit parents -- for the fetus
states may pass laws that subject minors seeking an abortion to an additional requirement : parental involvement
however , if the state chooses to require parental consent for a pregnant minor to get an abortion , the state also must provide an alternative procedure for obtaining that authorization -- one that " bypasses " having to get mom and dad 's permission
" plus , and perhaps most importantly , the procedure bypassing parental consent can not be a thinly veiled mechanism for an " absolute , and possibly arbitrary , veto
it 's not surprising that court procedures vary wildly , and that sooner or later , a state like alabama would experiment with state abortion law
in this case , the aclu 's position is that creating an adversarial hearing goes too far
a hearing is fine , it seems , but something approaching a trial rises to the level of an impermissible " undue burden " on the right to have an abortion
the federal court that reviews these state statutes will be charged with determining whether alabama 's law violates established supreme court bypass requirements
in alabama , a judge at one of these hearings is required to waive the parental consent requirement if the judge finds either : ( 1 ) that the minor is mature and well - informed enough to make the abortion decision on her own ; or ( 2 ) that performance of the abortion would be in the best interest of the minor
) so then , the court must determine whether the minor is mature -- mature enough that she may have the court 's permission to have an abortion
this means the court can then arrive at this kafkaesque , perplexing alternative : a particular minor is too immature to have an abortion -- with the result being that this immature minor ... should therefore be ... a parent of an infant ? it gets stranger : what about a finding that it is in the best interest of the young mother to have the baby , even though she is deemed too immature to have an abortion ? how would it be in the best interest of the immature mother to have a child ? state courts and legislatures are not completely to blame ; after all , the law of minors and juveniles is always going to be about some difficult but arbitrary line - drawing
