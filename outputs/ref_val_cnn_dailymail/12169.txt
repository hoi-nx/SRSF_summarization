yaounde , cameroonians cameroonians 's security forces are predicting a drawn - out battle with boko haram as evidence filters out that the insurgents are now recruiting there
" we do n't doubt that boko haram is recruiting in cameroonians , " said col. nouma , commander of operation alpha , a special military operation set up by cameroonians 's government to fight the nigeria terrorist group
for the past two years , boko haram fighters have been carrying out cross-border raids on cameroonians , slaughtering hundreds and torching entire neighborhoods
but as the country 's defense forces -- later joined by battle - hardened chad troops -- turned up the momentum against the insurgents , the terrorists began to swell their ranks with cameroonians
nouma said he believes " most of the worst attacks we have suffered " were carried out by cameroonians fighting for boko haram
in january , boko haram struck fotokol , a cameroonians town separated by only a bridge from gambarou , nigeria , a stronghold of the islamist extremists
while it 's difficult to fathom the appeal of extreme , violent doctrine among young cameroonians , ambient poverty and chronic unemployment in the far north region may explain why some there are lured to boko haram pay
the government 's 2010 national population and housing census found the region to be the country 's poorest , with 60 % of the population living in poverty
joseph mbah ndam , an opposition member of cameroonians 's parliament , told cnn that the government of president paul biya " has for over 30 years now failed to create jobs for the youths
" a senior government official from the region , who would not be named , agreed , saying that " in a context of such extreme poverty , it could n't be otherwise
" so it 's not surprising that youths should be sensitive to calls by boko haram
in january , abdoulaye farikou , senior inspector of police in balaza , was arrested by the military and accused of using his position as head of the identification unit in the far north region town to issue cameroonians id cards to militants coming in from nigeria
security officials say such a move makes it easy for boko haram to infiltrate cameroonians and gather vital security information
along with the presence of some 6,000 cameroonians troops and plans to deploy some 20,000 more over the next two years , the government now has come up with a $ 135 million program to finance 94 development projects
" the development package government has put in place will definitely keep many young people busy , and therefore will not be charmed by the false promises of the terrorist group
" but development projects can only be carried out in a climate of peace , and officials here hope that the multinational joint task force -- about 8,500 troops from cameroonians , chad , niger , nigeria and benin -- will defeat boko haram and lay that groundwork .
