on his bike ? clarkson went on a cycle ride today as he prepares to find out of he is sacked by the bbc over a ' fracas ' with a top gear producer over a steak petrolhead clarkson appeared to be preparing for life after top gear today by shunning his car and choosing to go for a bike ride instead
the star , 54 , decided to cycle on the streets around his west london home this morning on the eve of an bbc internal report that will help decide whether he is sacked
he smiled and waved to photographers but his future at the bbc looks increasingly bleak after a series of top gear live tour dates worth Â£ 1million to the corporation were axed
tickets for the postponed shows cost between Â£ 42 and Â£ 100 , meaning the decision could cost the bbc more than Â£ 1million in lost revenue if clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled
speculation that the bbc was desperate to find a way of keeping clarkson â and the lucrative top gear brand â had been supported by the fact that the norway tour was not cancelled despite the frontman âs recent suspension
the corporation 's commercial arm rakes in an estimated Â£ 50million a year from selling the rights to top gear overseas , with the show watched in 214 countries around the world
organisers confirmed that this weekend âs shows had been scrapped , but insisted they were not privy to the outcome of the inquiry into clarkson
big decision : sacking clarkson could mean the end of top gear , which makes the bbc millions every year a source said : â this is an independent decision we have to make
one of top gear live âs main presenters remains on suspension by the bbc and the expected timeline on the conclusion of that investigation does not give us enough confidence that we can deliver the show expected by fans [ and ] ticket holders
â it emerged today that a report into clarkson 's behaviour was commissioned by bbc head of tv danny cohen after a series of other scandals last year
clarkson , pictured with co ho - hosts james may and richard hammond at a top gear live show in prague , will not be performing at the four events in norway as they have been cancelled the four roadshows scheduled for norway next weekend were scrapped , on the eve of an internal report into clarkson âs fate clarkson was suspended by the bbc two weeks ago , following allegations of a â fracas â with producer oisin tymon ( left ) over hot food the bbc is set to lose as much as Â£ 67million a year if top gear presenter clarkson is sacked over claims he punched a producer
the corporation 's commercial arm rakes in an estimated Â£ 50million a year from selling the rights to top gear overseas , with the show watched in 214 countries around the world
on top of that , bbc worldwide makes millions more from top gear magazine and live shows in the uk and abroad , as well as sales of dvds
the bbc could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit if they do give clarkson his marching orders , with the sale of the show overseas making Â£ 50million
there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear â worth Â£ 50million a year to bbc coffers â off the air while the investigation was under way
â writing in the sunday times , clarkson also laughed off a foul - mouthed rant at bbc bosses filmed at a charity auction last week , claiming he only used the language â in jest â to raise money for good causes
