the captivating motion of various satellites orbiting our planet has been revealed in a fascinating nasa video
created by the agency âs goddard space flight centre in maryland , it shows their entire earth - observation fleet and the paths they take around earth
while the iss sweeps across â diagonally â , in the video at least , others like the landsat series are seen travelling from pole to pole
it shows dozens of earth - observing satellites currently orbiting our planet
they include landsat 7 and 8 , part of nasa 's long - serving series
and the iss can also be seen sweeping diagonally across earth the animation solely shows nasa 's earth - observing satellites , and not any run by other space agencies or private organisations
â together , they provide a picture of the earth as a system , â said nasa
the animation shows the day of 16 february 2015 from 00.00 gmt to 12.00 gmt. while the satellites might look close together , the amount of space in earth orbit is vast , and there is little to no chance of any colliding
in 2009 , a us iridium satellite and a defunct russian cosmos satellite collided , creating hundreds of new pieces of debris in orbit
the landsat series of satellites have , since 1972 , been used to measure earth âs continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored
some satellites , like landsat 7 and 8 , orbit from pole to pole , known as a polar orbit
