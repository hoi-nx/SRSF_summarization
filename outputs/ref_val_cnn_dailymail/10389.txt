ofcom , the broadcasting regulator , called for the crackdown after a flood of viewer complaints about the way children are treated on shows like benefits street or jeremy kyle , where they are openly mocked or shown in severe distress
in one instance , a 17 - year - old guest on jeremy kyle was accused of having slept with 33 men , and told that her mother would disown her for stealing
in a new set of guidelines , which raise worrying questions about the lengths people will go to for fame , ofcom has now told television producers to be wary about parents â motives for allowing their children on air
broadcasters should continue featuring children in their programmes , but they must take care that they are emotionally and mentally mature enough to cope with the public exposure , ofcom said
in another instance , children were â vilified â on benefits street , the channel 4 series which follows a street - full of families which live off state welfare
pictured is benefits street where the show was set â children and young people differ in their vulnerabilities and resilience ; their age , gender , physical and mental capacity , their maturity , their cultural , ethnic and religious background and their previous life experiences can all affect how they might respond to specific circumstances and nature of performance
â ofcom warned television companies to watch children âs body language , and made it explicit that they have a choice to opt out of appearing on television , in order to ensure that they are not being pushed into it by adults
in late 2013 , itv was found guilty of breaching broadcasting rules for airing an episode of jeremy kyle , where a guest called her 17 - year - old sister a â silly anorexic slapper â , and alleged that she had slept with 33 men
