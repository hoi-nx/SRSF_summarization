an australia couple spent five terrifying hours trapped inside the car with their two young children not knowing whether they were going to survive the wrath of cyclone pam which tore apart the island of vanuatu
beth and kris russet moved to the island in 2009 and spent 18 months building a cyclone - proof house before moving into the beautiful home just four months ago in november with their children charlotte , 3 , and henry , 14 months , and also beth 's mother
but nothing could have prepared the couple for the hell they endured as each room in their brand new home began to rapidly fill up with water after the ceiling was ripped off leaving the petrified family exposed to the ferocious and deadly elements of the worst cyclone to have hit the pacific region in living memory
beth russet - left with henry , and kris russet - right with charlotte , 3 , spent five terrifying hours in their car as cyclone pam hit vanuatu the polished new deck before it got ripped apart - pictured are the two german shepherds who survived the cyclone on back of the ute the entire roof of the decking blew off during the cyclone and exposed plywood was flying through the house the brand new open kitchen and dining room where the family used to spend a lot of their time the ceiling in the kitchen was ripped off and rain started coming in sideways along with a ferocious wind tunnel the night began like any other for the russet 's on march 13 , they had settled in to watch a movie with a glass of wine in hand after putting the kids to bed
however , within two hours the pair were frantically moving their children and beth 's mother from one room to another as their family home began to resemble an indoor swimming pool
' our walls started to rain - it was coming in too hard and too fast , ' beth said
' three - year - old charlotte 's room is completely trashed after the epic storm the ceiling was blasted open with parts falling onto the ground in 14 month old henry 's nursery probably the scariest of many hairy moments throughout the night was when beth 's mum and kris russet had a ceiling collapse from above them in the master bedroom just as beth had moved the children into her son 's nursery
' the family vowed to stick together from that point on - including their two german shepherds and a reluctant cat

' so while the car was shaking and rattling around we tried to move it forward a few hundred feet and no way - there was too much wind , it was so dark and it was crazy with trees and debris , ' beth said
