by the time falardeau read about alex , a little boy who got a battery - powered robotic arm last summer , she had made peace with her son wyatt 's limb difference
her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands
so when a friend shared a story from the " today show " with wyatt in mind , about a team of ucf ( ucf ) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6 - year - old alex using a three - dimensional printer on campus , falardeau was defensive
falardeau got in touch with the orlando students through e-nable , an online volunteer organization started by rochester institute of technology research scientist jon schull to match people who have 3 - d printers with children in need of hands and arms
middle and high school student groups and girl and boy scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free
the ucf team , which operates a nonprofit called limbitless solutions , is special because it 's the only group in the 3-d volunteer network making electronic arms
most 3-d arms are mechanical , which presents a challenge for children without elbows
the students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep
that 's what engineering is all about
comprehensive statistics are n't available for the number of children with amputations , such as wyatt
the ucf project started when manero , an engineering doctoral student , heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-d printed hand
" my mother taught us that we 're supposed to help change the world , " manero said at the time
" the students were blown away by what happened after that
families in more than 25 countries have asked the ucf students to help their children
in february , microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world
the students use the printer in the school 's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $ 350 -- through donations
" i found out he was working on an arm , and i thought that was the coolest thing in the world
" eventually manero moved to germany for a fulbright scholarship and left petresky in charge of running the operations in orlando
children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes , disney 's " frozen , " and in wyatt 's case , the blue - skinned men from " blue man group
" the team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including wyatt
" the adoration of college students was an affirmation that money ca n't buy
he was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself , " she wrote in her ireport
" wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children
