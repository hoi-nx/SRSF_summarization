the lavishly gifted exeter threequarter has already overcome more hurdles than many encounter in a lifetime
battle type 1 diabetes to forge a burgeoning professional rugby career ? no problem.outshine jonny wilkinson on his first european appearance ? by a distance.be included as the wild card in stuart lancaster 's world cup squad ? just maybe
exeter playmaker slade ( right ) is being touted as a potential wildcard for england 's world cup squad the 22 - year - old has been in superb form for exeter this season and could slot in nicely in the england set - up for his many talents , slade , 22 , named aviva premiership player of the month for march , remains humble , grounded and reluctant to talk up his world cup prospects
but his consistently high - quality displays in the exeter midfield are making his case hard to ignore
the only player name - checked by stuart lancaster as a possible world cup bolter after impressing on attachment to the squad during the six nations , the lithe left - footer from plymouth has been told he will definitely feature in england 's pre-world cup camp where he can stake a claim for inclusion
many believe he could yet prove england 's missing midfield link as a physically robust , footballing 12 of enormous potential
it does n't get any bigger than a home world cup and of course i 'd love to be involved
' slade 's humility is evident as we sit and talk in sandy park 's main stand enjoying the milky devonian spring sunshine
but just like the exeter club he joined as a teenager , slade refuses to get carried away by success
' slade has overcome many challenges in his career , including diagnosis with type 1 diabetes aged 18 a less welcome experience has been the daily injections of insulin and regular blood tests required to check his blood sugar is not at dangerous levels
' thriving under the tutelage of director of rugby rob baxter at the upwardly mobile aviva premiership club , slade is making a name for himself by stepping up to every challenge put in front of him
he first made the headlines as a 20 - year - old in 2012 with an outrageously composed display against jonny wilkinson and his toulon team - mates after being called on as a first - half replacement for gareth steenson
' now standing 6ft 2in and weighing in excess of 14st , slade has proved his defensive mettle countless times this season , most notably against leicester early in the season when he proved a match for his hulking opposite man manu tuilagi on a string of occasions
similar in style to wallaby maestro matt giteau , slade has taken heart from the performances of fellow ' lightweights ' jj and george ford during england 's six nations campaign
slade kicks a penalty during the aviva premiership match between exeter and bath at twickenham ' jj is not the biggest of players but his footwork and the way he beats defenders is top class
it 's the beauty of having a ball player and a physical , trucking - up type centre
' comfortable at fly - half or centre and an outstanding left - footed goal - kicker , slade would be a more than useful squad player
