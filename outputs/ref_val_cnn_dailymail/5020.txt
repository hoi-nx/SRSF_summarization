the photograph , which dates from a trip to tripoli , libya in september 2011 , was even adopted by the former secretary of state herself for her twitter profile picture
but it seems the picture , which inspired hundreds of comedy memes , could be no laughing matter for hillary as it emerges the photograph could be a figurative smoking gun
indeed , hillary herself has removed the image removed from her twitter account because it could show her using her controversial personal email account to conduct diplomacy in libya
switcheroo : hillary swapped out a picture of her using a blackberry on her way to libya for a silhouette promoting a gender equality initiative the picture , regularly seen by her 2.9 million followers , was removed sunday - to promote a political campaign for gender equality , timed to coincide with international women 's day
the image was once a symbol of hillary 's funny side as the face of the texts from hillary meme , which she said had given her ' many lolz '
but the change also comes at a time when senior figures in congress are intensifying scrutiny of hillary 's communications from 2009 - 13 , which it was recently revealed were not conducted via official state department accounts
proof ? the chairman of the house committee on benghazi mentioned that he has seen no emails from hillary 's time in libya , despite pictures such as this one from 2011 , showing her using a blackberry the picture inspired hundreds of comedy memes posted on a parody tumblr account last year
rep. trey gowdy ( r - south carolina ) , today told cbs 's face the nation that he has been provided with no emails from the september 2011 trip - despite hillary being clearly pictured communicating while aboard the plane
' so , it 's strange credibility to believe that if you 're on your way to libya to discuss libya policy that there 's not a single document that has been turned over to congress
suspicions : rep. trey gowdy ( r - south carolina ) mentioned the pictured of hillary while contending that emails from her time in libya had not been handed over as of sunday evening , hillary 's profile still featured the blackberry image , but as the ' header photo ' displayed at the top of the twitter page
