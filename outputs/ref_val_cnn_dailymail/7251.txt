women struggling to lose weight after childbirth should be given special government help , a tory minister has said
perry said many women found it a real struggle to shift the pounds while raising small children and needed incentives to â motivate â them
but she rejected calls for sanctions on people who are overweight
her remarks come just weeks after the prime minister called for people who are too fat to work to be stripped of their benefits if they refuse to go on weight - loss regimes
she said : â if it was all about willpower i would weigh eight stone
â mrs perry added : â i âd prefer to see real incentives for people to get healthy , get more active
â i think for many women who are struggling having to lose weight after children it is a real problem and anything we can do to motivate people and give incentives to do
â the transport minister âs intervention comes after mr cameron said people who can not work because they are too fat â or addicted to drugs or alcohol â should have their benefits cut if they refuse to get treatment
mrs perry , appearing on the daily politics show today , said she â preferred to see incentives â to encourage people to lose weight rather than taking people âs benefits away almost 2,000 people are registered as long - term sick because of obesity
