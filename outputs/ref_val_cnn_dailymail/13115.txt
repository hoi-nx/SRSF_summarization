kano , nigerian boko haram , the islamist extremist group already blamed for numerous horrific attacks in west africa , posted a graphic video online monday showing the apparent beheadings of two men who the group said were suspected spies
site said the video , which included arabic , english and french subtitles , was posted online via twitter and " borrows certain elements from productions " of beheadings by isis
the video was posted by the media division of boko haram , site said
although this is the first purported beheading video boko haram posted online
â the group has previously issued more detailed and extremely violent beheading videos directly to journalists through intermediaries
unlike the video posted monday , previous ones have shown the actual decapitations
in february 2014 , another video showing the beheading of an alleged informant who led the military to a boko haram camp in sambisa forest during an offensive was issued by the group
â observers of boko haram , which has inflicted years of terror on northern nigerian , note that its actions in the past six months have frequently mimicked those of isis -- from punishments such as stoning and beheading of its victims to taking territory and an increasingly sophisticated use of social media that 's very much in the isis " style
" zenn , who follows boko haram 's operations and propaganda closely , recently told cnn , " it 's clear boko haram is leaning toward isis in terms of doctrine , ideology and an emphasis on holding territory after operations
" in terms of ideology , boko haram 's leader , abubakar shekau , has said that kidnappings and hostage - taking are approved in the quran , a claim isis also makes
zenn and other analysts point out that recent boko haram videos have resembled the polished media productions of isis
