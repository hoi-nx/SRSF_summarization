revealing satellite images show how syria has been flooded with darkness since the beginning of the civil war with 83 per cent of the country 's lights being extinguished since 2011
in a picture taken four years ago , the nation 's heavily - populated cities are clearly visible due to the dense cluster of lights they emit
but in a photo taken this month , major cities including the war - torn country 's capital damascus , have all but disappeared from sight due to destruction , power shortages and people fleeing their homes
destruction : once syria 's commercial hub , aleppo has been devastated by fighting and has lost 97 per cent of its night - time light the war - torn city of aleppo , pictured last week , barely shows on the satellite images after four years of civil conflict ' the international community can and must supply more intense political pressure to stop the violence and human rights abuses that are fueling this crisis
' more than 200,000 people have been killed and another four million have fled the country since the conflict between rebel groups and president bashar al-assad began in march 2011
one of the most prominent eclipses depicted in the satellite images has taken place in the northern city of aleppo where fierce fighting between rebels and government forces has decreased the night - time lights emitted by 97 per cent
in government - held cities such as damascus , the change has been less dramatic with a 35 per cent reduction in light output
also affected : the nation 's capital damascus has also been hit by fighting since 2011 with satellite imagery showing how night - time light has been reduced by 35 per cent people fleeing their homes , power shortages and physical destruction can all contribute to the decline in night light , which offers a unique glimpse into the destruction wrought by the violence in syria
