the state department said tuesday it had no record of clinton signing a statement attesting that she had turned over all unclassified documents related to official business when she left her post as secretary of state in 2013
state department spokeswoman psaki said tuesday that bush - era secretaries colin powell and condoleezza rice had also never signed such a ' separation statement
' ' we have reviewed secretary clinton 's official personnel file and administrative files , and do not have any record of her signing the of - 109 , ' psaki said , referring to the form 's bureaucratic name
asked if the state department considered the case closed , psaki snapped : ' i hope so , there 's quite a bit going on in the world
if clinton had signed the form while holding on to tens of thousands of emails , he said , she was ' committing perjury
questions about whether clinton signed such a document have swirled since the revelation of her use of a personal email account for government - related work
republicans , among others , have said that the state department , along with other federal agencies , generally requires outgoing employees to turn over job - related materials before leaving
the republican earlier tuesday had submitted two freedom of information requests to the state department seeking copies of the ' separation statements ' signed by clinton and her top aides and related records
