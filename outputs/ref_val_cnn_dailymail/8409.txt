ruling : mr justice mostyn said today a millionaire sperm donor must pay Â£ 20,000 to cover the legal costs of the lesbian couple in a row over access to the seven - year - old boy the millionaire gay father of a child brought up by a lesbian couple he donated sperm to must pay Â£ 20,000 to cover their costs in an extraordinary triangular legal battle between the boy 's three parents
the man - named in high court papers as jf - helped the women have a child in 2007 but the mothers now say he is being too demanding over access to the seven - year - old
after the boy was born jf - who has dual britain and america citizenship and lives in a Â£ 1.2million pound home in the south of england - had irregular contact with him and took him to america twice
today mr justice mostyn - one of britain 's most senior family judges - ruled that in the absence of legal aid jf must pay 80 per cent of the mothers ' costs as they continue to fight him in court
the judge blamed the government 's ' grossly unfair ' legal aid cuts that mean the father should have to pay Â£ 20,596 now , and 80 per cent of future costs run up by the women , known as mg and jg ' but that it where the government has left him
they wanted a child and responded to an entry by jf in a register for ' lesbian women and gay men seeking a non-sexual parenting partner ' and accepted his sperm so they could have a child
turned sour : the seven - year - old boy is now at the centre of a bitter and expensive legal battle between his parents in december 2013 jf issued an application in the high court for more regular contact with his son , sparking an ongoing legal battle with the lesbian couple , who have since split up and run out of money
during eight court hearings legal costs have built up and the mothers have extended their mortgage to pay for it
under the old system both would have been entitled to legal aid , said the judge
mr justice mostyn said : ' with the state washing its hands of mg and jg they now look to jf to fund their representation
' now the father must pay more than Â£ 20,000 to the women the high court battle will continue , with a ruling over access now likely later this year
' in some cases , though , court clearly is the only answer which is why , even after reform , we will still have one of the most generous legal aid system at around Â£ 1.5 billion a year
