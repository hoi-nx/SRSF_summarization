isis militants in northern syria released 19 assyrian christian hostages on sunday , according to abdelrahman , the chief of the london - based syrian observatory
on saturday , the observatory -- citing an assyrian christians commander -- said that isis planned to release 29 assyrian christian hostages
isis captured at least 220 assyrian christians , all christians , on february 23 during an attack on the villages around the town of tal tamer in the northern syria province of al-hasakah
the syria observatory said saturday that a self - proclaimed isis court ordered the release , citing an assyrian christians commander
since the declaration of its " caliphate " last june , isis has killed 1,969 people , the syria observatory said saturday
isis also executed 125 of its own members for " exceeding the limits in religion , " the syria observatory said
" we in syrian observatory believe that the real number of people that had been killed by ( isis ) is higher than the number documented by syrian observatory because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the ( isis ) jails , loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-shaitaat tribe , ( and ) dozens of kurds who have still been missing " since isis attacked the syria town of kobani in september
