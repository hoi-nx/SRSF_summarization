four lufthansa subsidiary flights left barcelona around the same time on tuesday morning and division 1 team dalkurd , from borlã¤nge , central sweden , had players on three of them
the team had initially planned to travel on flight 4u9525 to dusseldorf , but instead split the team over the three remaining flights from barcelona , via germany
' when we got to the airport in barcelona there were four flights leaving that time , flying north over the alps
' dalkurd , formed in 2004 by kurdish immigrants , play in sweden 's division 1 , the third level of sweden football
mr kizil told the newspaper how they had tried to fit the entire team on the germanwings flight , but that the connection time in dusseldorf to continue their journey home to sweden was too long
