a man who was brutally beaten and left for dead after witnessing his mother 's murder is still fighting for justice 36 years on - and says he knows who is responsible for her death
garrett , from muncie , indiana , was just four when a man entered the home he shared with his mother , 22 - year - old paula garrett , on march 25 , 1979 and savagely beat them with a blunt object - killing her and fracturing the little boy 's skull
a few weeks later , when he was finally well enough to speak with police , he named the attacker as green , his mother 's on - off boyfriend and a married father - of - four
even though prosecutors concluded green was not responsible for the attack , garrett continues to stand by his childhood claim , while neighbors have also recounted the couple 's troubled relationship
witness : garrett , pictured left , is calling for a new investigation into the 1979 murder of his mother , 22 - year - old paula garrett , right
paula garrett and green had met at the restaurant where paula garrett worked as a waitress and the night before her death , he was at her apartment , investigators told nbc 's dan slepian
but family members told nbc 's dan slepian that green had been possessive and abusive , and that paula garrett had been trying to break up with him at the time of her death
a neighbor , smith , added to nbc that he often heard the couple fighting and the night she was killed , he heard green shout : ' you think you 're going to get away with this ? ' the following day , green barged into smith 's apartment and told the neighbor that paula garrett had killed herself , he said
he told nbc that he had been sleeping when green walked in and switched on the light , giving him a good view of his mother 's killer
questions : no one has ever been charged in the murder of paula garrett , left , or the attack on her son garrett , when he was four
her boyfriend was initially arrested but was freed after passing a lie detector test two months after the death , green was arrested and charged with his girlfriend 's murder , although he protested his innocence
he was taken back to indiana where prosecutors dropped the charges - to the anger of police , the star press reported
despite the decision , garrett 's father , robbie garrett , said that his son maintained green ' sent my mommy to heaven '
testimony : neighbors said they often heard the young single mother , pictured with her son , arguing with her boyfriend , while one testified that he saw the boyfriend , green , near her apartment that night ' i was pretty well convinced he did n't commit the crime based on evidence at the scene , ' he said
after the attack , garrett , who was struck as many as 15 times with the blunt object , was left with partial paralysis on his right side and still has nine dimples on his head where his skull was fractured
