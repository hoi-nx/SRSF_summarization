a mother and her daughter who both have a rare condition which makes their skin wrinkle prematurely have undergone matching Â£ 50,000 facelifts
tracey gibson , 45 , and her daughter zara , 18 , both suffer lipodystrophy , a rare condition which makes fat dissolve beneath tissue
while zara had a face - lift at the age of 16 to stave off bullies , her mother has long suffered lingering stares and cruel nicknames
having been rejected by the nhs for a free operation , the mother of seven thought she would be forever trapped in a sinking face
but , two years since her daughter received free surgery from american doctors , the 45 - year - old has unveiled her new Â£ 50,000 face after being flown overseas to receive the same vip treatment
both women have suffered at the taunts of bullies who made fun of the rare condition which sees their skin wrinkle prematurely after : the mother daughter duo were treated to free surgery by doctors in american after being turned down by the nhs speaking of the treatment - a face and neck lift plus botox injections - mrs tracey gibson , who was constantly teased as a child , says she has never felt better
' my face is worth Â£ 50,000 and it feels absolutely amazing when i get up in the morning , ' she said
now the pair say they enjoy better self - esteem and higher levels of confidence despite being turned down by the nhs the pair ( left , after the procedure and right , in 2011 ) are among a handful of people afflicted with lipodystrophy in the uk zara ( pictured aged seven ) was born with the condition and teased at school
when she was 16 she was contacted by surgeons in american who offered to perform a facelift free of charge three of mrs tracey gibson 's seven children were born with the condition though zara ( left ) was the worst afflicted
they are pictured above with her daughter jolene who also has lipodystrophy , in 2012 mrs tracey gibson , who has been married three times , said that for the fist time in years she is being chatted up by men

mrs tracey gibson , for example , has more pronounced wrinkles in her arms , neck and face

the dissolving of fat beneath tissue can occur in different body parts in every patient
the pair stayed in touch and , after watching her daughter 's skin improve , the doctor offered mrs tracey gibson , who had already been rejected by the nhs , the same treatment
' and while she was delighted with the facelift and subsequent botox injections , the 45 - year - old stopped short of transforming her whole face
