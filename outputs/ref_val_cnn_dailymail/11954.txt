gold standard : a pot of freshly brewed white smoked tea from the wee tea company , scotland , which has been named the world 's finest cuppa when going in search of the world 's best cup of tea , you might think of heading to lowlands of assam in india , or of taking a trip to the far east and the mountains of oolong
but the finest brew in the world is actually being grown by a northern irishman on a disused sheep farm in scotland , and has just been awarded the prestigious salon du thã© gold award in paris
the fragrant leaf is so rare and so highly prized that grower tam o'braan is selling it for Â£ 1,150 per lb - 200 times the usual price - making it the second most expensive in the world
in addition , most of his tea is being exported to china , a feat likened to selling coals to newcastle
the success comes as something of a surprise to mr tam o'braan , who founded his wee tea company in 2011 with Â£ 140,000 and just three plants
mr tam o'braan told the times that he spent years on organic farms around the world , studying how best to grow crops in scotland 's cold climate , and convinced himself he could do it
while he initially met with success , creating 2,000 cuttings from his original plants , disaster struck in 2012 when the coldest winter in 200 years all but killed his crop
but on valentine 's day last year the plants sprouted again , at which point mr tam o'braan revealed his scheme , along with his first batches of white and white smoked tea
he sold his first tea at christmas by mail order , with most of it going abroad , and fortnum and mason have now started stocking the leaves at Â£ 30 for a 35g sachet , or roughly Â£ 10 per cup
tam o'braan , who is from northern ireland , developed his tea plantation on an old sheep farm in perthshire ( pictured ) using Â£ 140,000 and just three plants from which he managed to grow 2,000 cuttings and today the white smoked tea variety was handed the top gong at paris 's prestigious tea awards , making it officially the best cuppa on the planet
mr tam o'braan said : â we started with a dream and pursued it
pinkies out : jim mcbeth detects a hint of smoky apple flavour and a hint of botanicals in the clean , fresh flavour of the award - winning white smoked tea these terms are used by the visionary who has produced the first tea in the world to be grown in scotland
oâbraan has created something very special , so special in fact that he is on course to sell it to the china â the tea retailing equivalent of sending coals to newcastle and persuading the people of the inuit tribe to buy a refrigerator
mr oâbraan assures me , however , that experts who know about things , men whose tongues are insured for Â£ 1million , have informed him officially that he is making the best tea in the world
the tea 's makers believe it benefits from altitude , clean mountain air and fresh spring water which is unique to scotland high - class london store fortnum & mason has already sold 230 kilos at Â£ 2,300 a kilo â or Â£ 30 for a convenient 35g sachet
working out at Â£ 10 a cup , it is the second most expensive tea in the world
and from today , in the sumptuous surroundings of the palm court in edinburgh âs balmoral hotel , an iconic venue for afternoon tea , mr oâbraan âs produce is , in another world first , now up for the public taste test
the prestigious hotel on princes street has secured exclusive rights to put the teas on their menu , a snip at Â£ 10 a pot â twice the usual cost of ordinary afternoon tea â with an accompaniment of the â finest shortbread in the world â
this is highly pleasing to a man who was once regarded as mad for sinking Â£ 140,000 into the dream of growing tea in the cold â marginal â climate of scotland â and producing a drink of such distinction and quality that it costs 200 times more than the usual stuff
his tea came first in the prestigious french salon de thã© awards in paris , which was , he said , like receiving an accolade for making the finest of fine wine
â the honour of being the most expensive tea in the world rests with a black china tea costing Â£ 4,000 a kilo
