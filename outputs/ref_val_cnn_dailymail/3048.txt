it is almost a full month now since the despised old regime at rangers was routed in the battle for control of ibrox
one particularly nasty surprise exploded into the public domain on tuesday as it emerged the price of promotion to the premiership for rangers will include an extra Â£ 500,000 payable to mike ashley
newcastle owner mike ashley will be laughing all the way to the bank if rangers win promotion mike ashley will receive payment for the loan of five newcastle players including haris vuckic ( centre ) , gael bigirimana ( left ) and streete that sizeable sum is in return for mike ashley loaning the ibrox club five of his newcastle players ; four of whom turned out to be either injured , ill or unfit
of course , the long - suffering rangers fans have grown wearily accustomed to their club being treated with contempt while ruthless businessman mike ashley lines his pockets
the support have witnessed the newcastle owner âs placemen sell the naming rights to their beloved ibrox for just Â£ 1 â albeit mike ashley subsequently gave up those rights amid a backlash from the rank and file
they then watched in disbelief as a deal was sanctioned with the billionaire âs sports direct firm that sees just 75 pence of every Â£ 10 spent on rangers merchandise going to the club
but tuesday 's revelation in the club âs latest accounts is perhaps the most depressing example of the callous regard in which the outgoing board viewed the ibrox club
had that happened , rangers would have found streete and shane ferguson were in no state to play while kevin mbabu was patently unfit
proper testing would also have shown that gael bigirimana was ill , with a condition that had already been diagnosed by medics at newcastle
haris vuckic has been the only player loaned from newcastle that has been a success at ibrox 20 - year - old defender streete suffered an injury in his one and only first - team appearance for rangers of the five loan rangers , midfielder haris vuckic has been the sole success - but campaigning rangers fan houston says the situation jars when he recalls the sale of star player lewis to brentford in january
â but i believe they only got Â£ 250,000 for lewis and then they shell out Â£ 500,000 for five loan players
and i would rather have lewis at ibrox on a permanent basis â increasing his value â than all five newcastle loan players , even if they were all fit
defensive midfielder gael bigirimana has been ruled out of action for rangers with a mystery illness not only did the previous board fail to announce this , or seek a replacement , they inexplicably included the reappointment of deloitte on their resolution notice in november for the following month âs agm
â he vowed that , under the new board , the ibrox club would be back competing at the top level at home and in european by 2022 - in time for the 50th anniversary of the club âs 1972 european cup winners â cup triumph in barcelona
