cdc officials have arrived at a louisiana research center to try to determine how at least seven monkeys became exposed to a deadly bacteria used in bioweapons
three of the monkeys had to be euthanized after showing signs of the bacterium , burkholderia pseudomallei , which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500 - acre tulane national primate research center , usa today reported
questions also remain over how far the bacteria , which is primarily found in southeast asia and northeast australia , has spread around the complex and surrounding areas
concerns : monkeys at the tulane national primate research center in louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened reach : worryingly , the center is close to a river ( top left ) , homes and a school
although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria , further tests are required animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas
the monkeys , rhesus macaques , had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages , where around 4,000 macaques are kept
worryingly , the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes
infected : at least seven rhesus macaques ( file picture ) have shown signs of exposure and three have died potentially deadly : burkholderia pseudomallei the bacteria , burkholderia pseudomallei , can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis
the bacteria , which is primarily found in southeast asia and northeast australia , has never been found in nature in the u.s. last week , tests by the cdc determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria , bring the number of infected monkeys to seven
the u.s. department of agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners , veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed
those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area , suggesting there was no public health risk .
