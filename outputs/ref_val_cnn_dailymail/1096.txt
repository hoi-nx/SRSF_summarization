now , with their vision of a global schedule as a viable alternative to the american behemoth having survived intact , the european tour is set to embark on the next phase in its development
i can reveal negotiations have reached an advanced stage with the pga of aussie for some sort of merger
but it âs surely good news for european tour members , who were given an outline of the plans at the qatar masters recently
the australian open , last won by jordan spieth , could make its way onto the tour their schedule in december as well as here in europeans , there are events in american , asia , south africa and the middle east that all count towards the race to dubai , seen here with 2014 winner rory mcilroy for their part , the pga of australia have the titles and golf courses but linking up with the european tour would surely help in terms of improving strength of fields and attracting sponsors
aussie is just about the only great golf playing region the european tour will not visit this year as part of its international schedule
