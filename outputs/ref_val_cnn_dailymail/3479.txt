â my wrist had started to get uncomfortable , so i decided to get it checked out , â said lucy norman as she looked at the piece of paper in front of her , lucy norman massaged her fingers and puzzled over the spidery , illegible writing
â i âd start writing as normal , but within just a few words , it would fade into little more than a scribble , â says lucy norman , 42 , who lives in barford st michael , oxfordshire , with her husband angus , 64 , an engineer
â initially , lucy norman blamed the problem on tiredness from long working hours and her commute into central london to work at an energy company
' if i could nât write or type , how could i continue to be a pa ? â her doctor diagnosed repetitive strain injury ( rsi ) in the wrist , caused by typing and writing over 20 years , and told her there was nothing they could do
â i accepted the diagnosis without question , â says lucy norman
â rsi is an umbrella term for pain in the muscles , nerves and tendons caused by repetitive movement and over-use
lucy norman began to experience tremors in her leg 18 months after being diagnosed with rsi
â i âd also started having difficulty with simple tasks , such as brushing my teeth , so i began to get concerned , â she said since there is no test for rsi , diagnosis is usually made on the basis that the condition developed following a repetitive task and is relieved by resting from it
but experts warn that the term rsi is increasingly being used as a blanket diagnosis , and could mask other more serious conditions , such as rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , diabetes and even parkinson
that âs because the early signs of each of these conditions are so similar to rsi that doctors often consider it first
for example , with diabetes , long - term poor management of blood sugar levels ( often because the condition has nât been diagnosed ) can lead to tingling , numbness and pain in the fingers â all symptoms of rsi , too
â the most common are rheumatoid arthritis and ms , but it could be a different neurological condition , such as parkinson âs , or diabetes
â â the consultant seemed to be taking it far more seriously than 18 months previously , ' said lucy norman he says that when rsi is suspected , and particularly where there is pain but no sign of injury , such as inflammation , swelling or problems with nerve function , this should be the starting point of investigations to pin down the root cause
he says that once the specific cause has been worked out , each individual condition that may be put under the umbrella of rsi is â absolutely treatable â
â lucy norman âs was a classic case of rsi misdiagnosis
but 18 months later , she began to experience tremors in her leg , so returned to her gp
â the consultant seemed to be taking it far more seriously than 18 months previously , but they still did nât give me any indication of what it could be , â says lucy norman
a week later , she had a dat scan , which determines the level of dopamine in the brain â this chemical plays a vital role in regulating movement
lack of dopamine is characteristic of parkinson , causing tremors , slowed movement and stiff , inflexible muscles
the dat scan confirmed that lucy norman did have parkinson âs , and she was put on medication to slow the progression
â ' my symptoms are very mild and progressing very slowly , so i consider myself lucky , â said lucy norman lucy norman also insists she has no anger or animosity towards the gp who misdiagnosed rsi
â it âs notoriously difficult to diagnose parkinson âs in its early stages â and even if i had been diagnosed earlier , it âs unlikely it would have made any difference to the progression of my illness
â indeed , it can be difficult for any gp to pick up on the wide variety of symptoms of parkinson âs , says professor david burn , a neurologist and clinical director of the charity parkinson âs uk
having been diagnosed with rsi , she was referred to a physiotherapist for strengthening exercises
â parkinson âs awareness week runs from april 20 to 26
