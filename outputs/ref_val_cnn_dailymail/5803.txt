there 's a first time for everything , is n't there ? first time in a new country
first time you go on a holiday that leaves you speechless
and the first time you take one of those ' selfies ' that everyone is talking about
the country was burma , which has just started opening up to touris , and since the best way to see the sights is by taking a river cruise , i booked up for a few nights onboard
' a floating paradise ' : a river cruise on the sanctuary ananda was the best way to see the sights the brochure promised enchantment and luxury , along with the chance to experience this fascinating land close up
i have to say , they were true to their promise
ox - cart ride anyone ? stan enjoyed his bumpy ride in the back of the taxi the only way to see the temples ...
from a balloon our guide later explained that the owners of sanctuary ananda , obviously aware of the negative impact tourism can sometimes have on real lives like these , are working with the village elders to plan for the future
we stopped off to explore ancient ruins and temples that were still very much in use
i hailed a passing ox cart , which had the word ' taxi ' scrawled on the side , and got a delightfully bumpy lift back to the shore
i live in bristol , which is pretty much home of the hot air balloon
so there i was , on a gorgeous boat in a land of loveliness , crossing my fingers for good ballooning weather
the balloon sighed into the sky just in time for the sun to rise over the 2,000 temples of bagan
as balloon rides go , it was magical
the early morning sunlight shone through the mist , picking out temples and pagodas with golden sparks
days were spent exploring ancient ruins and temples that are still very much in use bagan at dusk : the ancient capital of burma has more than 2,200 buddhist temples and pagodas on our last evening we were treated to a candlelit feast under the night sky
moments later , a harvest moon peeped over the horizon , lighting up the river
