on friday , the pound was worth â¬ 1.38 â which for british holidaymakers heading to , say , france , spain , italy and greece is the most favourable rate for more than seven years
it âs around 14 per cent better than this time last year , and 20 per cent better than five years ago
holidaymakers booking a village in the south of france can save more than Â£ 200 compared with last year put more graphically , if that villa in the south of france you âre looking at costs â¬ 2,000 ( Â£ 1,450 ) a week to rent , it âs Â£ 231 cheaper than it was in 2014 and Â£ 353 cheaper than in 2010
likewise , a meal for two in venice with a â¬ 100 ( Â£ 72 ) price tag costs roughly Â£ 12 less than this time last year , and Â£ 18 less than in 2010
here are some issues that the better pound / euro exchange rate raises â but remember that if you use cards to get cash out of overseas atms , settle hotel and restaurant bills and make purchases , the actual exchange rate wo nât be quite as good , due to the banks taking commission
holidaymakers may get a better deal by booking direct , in euros , as most prices were fixed last year book direct ? most holiday companies will have fixed their prices with hoteliers and villa owners last year , when the pound was weaker against the euro
that said , i know of a number of operators and villa agencies that have recently lowered prices to take into account the better exchange rate , and tailor - made arrangements may be based on current exchange rates
if you do book direct , to be sure of benefiting from the current good exchange rate , you need to pay in full now rather than putting down a deposit or paying on arrival / departure
you could hedge your bets by obtaining some ( but not all ) of your spending money now buy euros now ? the pound was worth about â¬ 1.40 a week ago , but by friday it had fallen slightly
consider doing so with a pre-paid euro currency card â the exchange rate used will be whatever it is on the day you upload the funds
a driving holiday on the continent ? the combination of more favourable exchange rates and lower oil prices means that filling up the car in eurozone countries is costing british motorists a lot less than a year ago
according to a post office travel money report , when converted into pounds , the price of a litre of unleaded petrol in france , italy , spain , germany and austria is down year - on - year by at least 20 per cent
