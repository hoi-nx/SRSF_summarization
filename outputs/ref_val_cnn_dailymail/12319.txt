freshman katy ma sees it in a different light after learning about bingxin , the influential 20th century chinese writer and activist who attended the massachusetts single - sex college in the 1920s
she knows better now thanks to her involvement with activist group spark , which is putting women on the map , with a little help from google
ma and a group of girls around the world spent the past five months researching locations of significance in the lives of women who do n't always get a mention in history class
starting this week , their stories will be featured on google 's field trip app tagged to significant locations in their lives
for 19th century journalist annie smith peck , it 's musho , peru , the village at the base of mount huascarã¡n , which she scaled in 1908 in a record - setting feat. for journalist nellie bly , it 's the site of women 's lunatic asylum on roosevelt , now roosevelt island in new york , where she went undercover for a story
" these women have been edited from history not because they did n't make meaningful contributions to society but because someone deemed their stories not worthy of being told
" the initiative started in 2013 when spark approached google with data showing that women and people of color were underrepresented in the popular doodles featured on its search homepage
the encounter led to talks about another spark project on representation of women and people of color in parks , monuments and public spaces -- " all the places outside a school textbook where we learn about who 's important in the world , " spark executive director dana edell said
the conversations led to google 's niantic labs , creator of field trip
the app displays geotagged stories within a certain geographic radius created by different publishers
google agreed to publish the stories if spark created them
after all , spark 's vision fit into field trip 's goal to help people " discover the stories around them , " said google 's yennie solheim fuller , who worked with spark
the hard part was not finding women , 15 - year - old spark member saini said
saini , a student at middlesex county academy for science , mathematics and engineering technologies in new jersey , knows firsthand that women 's contributions to science , technology , engineering and math do n't usually make it into the lesson plan
through this project and other spark initiatives , she hopes to change that
" it 's time we recognized the female scientists , researchers , musicians who are invisible to us , " she said
