males of a species of crab , nicknamed after hoff because of their hairy chests , spend largely separate lives from the females , according to new research
in a study looking at the private life of the deep - sea crab known as the ' hoff ' have found that the males and females spend separate lives at volcanic vents 1.5 miles deep near antarctica
males of a species of crab , nicknamed after hoff because of their hairy chests , spend separate lives from the females , according to new research
' the researchers found that large male hoff crabs live highest on the mineral spires of the deep - sea vents , closest to the hot fluids that jet from them
a university spokesman said : ' at the base of the mineral spires , smaller males mingle with females in spectacular piles , many crabs deep , where they get together to mate
' the females then crawl away from the bustling piles of crabs and the warm mineral - rich fluids seeping from the seafloor , which can be toxic to their young
' away from the mineral spires , the few crabs found by the researchers were all females , carrying developing offspring under their curled - up tails
males do n't share in ' child - care ' arrangements with the females , and can climb up the mineral spires of the vents to take advantage of the warmth and conditions best suited for growing bacteria on their hairy chests ' moving away from the warmer waters of the spires takes the females across a gauntlet of predators , such as large sea anemones and seven - arm sea stars
males , meanwhile , do n't share in ' child - care ' arrangements with the females , and instead can climb up the mineral spires of the vents to take advantage of the warmth and conditions best suited for growing bacteria on their hairy chests
by scraping off and eating these bacteria using comb - like mouthparts , the males can grow much larger than the females
