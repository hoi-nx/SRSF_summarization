the phrase , first used in a nike advert in 1988 , was pitched to the firm by advertising executive dan wieden , who admitted that it was borrowed from something a utah murderer uttered as he faced a firing squad
the condemned man in question was gilmore , who was sentenced to death in 1977 for robbing and murdering two men in utah the previous year
the phrase inspired one of the most successful advertising slogans of all time he chose to be executed by firing squad and it was reported that he said â let âs do it â in the moments before he died
mr dan wieden , speaking at an advertising conference in cape town in february , said that he recalled this line in 1988 just before he had a crunch marketing campaign meeting with nike bosses , and decided to suggest a slightly altered version as a slogan
dan wieden ( pictured ) revealed that the slogan ' just do it ' was borrowed from the last words of utah murderer gilmore mr dan wieden said : â we â¦ came up with five different 30 second spots
â he murdered a man and a woman , and was put before a firing squad
â at first , he recalled , nike hated the idea , but he won them round and the slogan appeared at the end of an advert featuring 80 - year - old runner walt stack
it is now one of the most famous slogans in the world , described by campaign magazine as â arguably the best tagline of the 20th century â .
