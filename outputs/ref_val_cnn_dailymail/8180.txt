a couple of weeks back , after chelsea âs fiery 1 - 0 win over everton , twitter âs support team took swift and decisive action over a series of deeply unpleasant tweets
branislav ivanovic got to grips with james mccarthy in angry exchange during chelsea 's win over everton ... the incident , a major flashpoint in the game at stamford bridge last month , was covered by reporters ... and at that point the twitter users took it as their invite to join the party click here to follow neil on twitter there was worse , much worse , but publishing the depressing details , which would bring a family member of mine into the public domain , would be an invasion of privacy - and the accounts involved , along with many others that week , were suspended for violating twitter âs rules
social media should be a theatre for healthy debate , a chance to forcefully bat around some ideas or opinions about a sport many of us have devoted our lives to
unfortunately twitter has become the elephant in the room , the one subject we are reluctant to discuss in depth because an admission that the medium can be psychologically taxing is perceived as a weakness
a piece about tevez , pictured here unhappy at being substituted by roberto mancini in december 2010 , just before his transfer request , did not go down too well with some people out in cyber space tevez is much happier now at juventus ... twitter can still be just as horrible and angry a place though there are people who will tell you that this is part of the game , that these attacks are just twitter trolls hiding behind the anonymity of a keyboard in a bedroom at their parents â house
twitter is a modern phenomenon , a bear pit for the football reporters who cross a very fine line when they write about some of the most high - profile issues in the game
taarabt was answering claims he was overweight neil is up for sports news reporter of the year at the british sports journalism awards this month - an award he won during his time at the news of the world ( above with long - time daily mirror man john jackson ) many will argue that journalists , with the undoubted privileges we enjoy at times , are fair game
errors are seized upon , with reporters called to account in a way that was never possible until dorsey dreamed up twitter in 2006
dorsey , pictured in october last year , is a co-founder of twitter surely this is an environment we should encourage , to take responsibility and trade messages about subjects in an atmosphere that is not intoxicated with bile , abuse , threats or intimidation
he attempted suicide after he was bombarded with , among other things , abuse such as â fat , red hamster â on social media
it is little wonder that twitter âs chief executive costolo told the company âs staff , in a leaked email in mid-february , that it was time to clampdown on the pollution in this social forum

â in the days after costolo âs memorandum was leaked to the media , the company began to take action on the users mentioned above , along with scores of others who were being abusive or harassing people
this is an opportunity for twitter to evolve , to make it clear that this remarkable concept is to be used in a way that is socially acceptable
in september 2013 the met police admitted they were powerless at times to investigate and prosecute twitter trolls for their hounding of various public figures
progress is slow , but twitter has suspended accounts of those threatening physical violence and have emailed others to remind them that a behavioural policy is in place
