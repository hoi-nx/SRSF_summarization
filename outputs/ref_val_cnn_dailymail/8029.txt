dundee united star paton has launched an astonishing attack on celtic as he accused the parkhead club of having a long history of â manipulating â people and situations for their own benefit
the frustrated tannadice star claimed there have been â continual injustices â across the three games between dundee united and celtic this month that have yielded six red cards - four for jackie mcnamara âs team
in the wake of the stormy 1 - 1 scottish cup draw at tannadice , celtic manager deila and his captain brown both accused dundee united kid aidan connolly of â diving â to win his side a penalty
paton ( right ) believes celtic ' manipulate people ' and have been doing so for the past few years despite deila calling on the sfa to take action , none was forthcoming but dundee united were subsequently denied a penalty when brown barged ryan dow in the league cup final , won 2 - 0 by celtic at hampden last sunday
but the dundee united camp felt the reaction of celtic âs players may have influenced murray âs decision to send the australian off
the dundee united star and deila have previous when they clashed at tannadice in the quarter - final and ahead of the fourth and final match between dundee united and celtic at parkhead in the premiership on saturday , paton appeared to accuse celtic of heaping pressure on match officials
â but i think celtic as a club can manipulate people more than dundee united can
the tough tackling midfielder goes up for a header with celtic star nir biton in the cup final on sunday â we have seen injustices in the last few games we have played and that causes frustration
â ryan mcgowan ( right ) was sent off for a tackle on conor henderson and angered celtic 's players paton âs sense of injustice was also stoked by the failure of referee murray to hand a second yellow to efe ambrose for a foul on nadir ciftci at 1 - 0
it was a clear yellow card
paton believes efe ambrose ( centre ) should also have been sent off for a second bookable offence â then efe ambrose should have got sent off when we were on top in the game and it did not happen
â paton also defended himself after celtic âs stokes yesterday accused the dundee united midfielder of catching him with a â sly elbow â
