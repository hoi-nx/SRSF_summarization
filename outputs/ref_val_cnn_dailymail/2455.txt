parents are increasingly pressuring doctors to delay vaccines for young children , raising the threat from preventable diseases such as the flu , measles and mumps , a new study suggests
researchers from the university of colorado surveyed 534 physicians across the country with 93 per cent reporting that they had received requests for jabs to be rescheduled
some parents wanted to space shots out so their children were n't jabbed so many times in one sitting while others worried about possible vaccine - related neurological complications
children in the u.s. receive around 29 vaccines for about 14 illnesses between birth and six years , based on recommendations from the cdc
growing trend : parents are increasingly pressuring doctors to delay vaccines for young children , raising the threat from preventable diseases such as the flu , measles and mumps , a new study suggests three - quarters of the doctors surveyed said they agreed to vaccine delays at least some of the time , even though they knew it was potentially harmful
the potential repercussions are worrisome and are happening ' right now with the measles outbreak , ' said dr. allison kempe , a university of colorado researcher and a member of the federal cdc 's vaccine advisory committee
the recommended cdc vaccine schedules are based on research around what time they will be most effective at preventing disease
doctors involved in the university of colorado investigation were all certified members of the american academy of pediatrics and the american academy of family physicians - the two leading groups of doctors who treat young children .
