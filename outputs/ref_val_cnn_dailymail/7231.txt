a boy suffered multiple seizures after overdosing on liquorice sweets
the 10 - year - old boy was admitted to hospital in bologna , italy , after suffering a seizure
hours later , doctors reported he suffered another three seizures
he appeared to be suffering from posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( pres ) , a condition characterized by headache , confusion , seizures and visual loss
a 10 - year - old boy suffered four seizures which doctors found was due to his habit of eating 20 liquorice sweets a day for four months but doctors were baffled as ct and mri scans ruled out all the major condition that lead to pres. during a medical examination a week later doctors noticed that the boy âs teeth were black
that volume is well above the world health organisation âs recommended maximum of 2 mg / kg. this excessive consumption had resulted in his development of high blood pressure , and in turn pres after the boy stopped eating the sweets , his treatment was gradually reduced and his blood pressure returned to normal
in light of the case , doctors are now calling for a recommended daily amount to be printed clearly on sweets packets as a safety measures
