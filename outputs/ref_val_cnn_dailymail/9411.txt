downing street has given a ' final offer ' over the proposed election tv debates , involving seven party leaders , including cameron a â final offer â has been given to broadcasters for cameron to take part in one , seven - way tv election debate
downing street has accused the bbc and other networks of causing â chaos â by attempting to dictate the terms of debates and repeatedly altering their proposals
number ten is proposing a debate involving mr cameron , ed miliband , nick clegg , nigel farage , green leader natalie bennett , snp leader nicola sturgeon and plaid cymru âs leanne wood at the end of this month
â this is our final offer , and to be clear , given the fact this has been a deeply unsatisfactory process and we are within a month of the short campaign , the prime minister will not be participating in more than one debate , â the prime minister âs director of communications oliver wrote to the bbc
the tories â ultimatum is unlikely to be agreed by other parties , or broadcasters who each want to hold one debate , prompting doubts about whether any will now take place
mr ed miliband has accused mr cameron of deliberately sabotaging negotiations over the debates and â running scared â
snp leader nicola sturgeon ( left ) and plaid cymru âs leanne wood ( right ) would be two of the seven candidates in the televised debate , if broadcasters agree with number ten 's suggestion they would be joined by the green party 's natalie bennett , who the tories always argued should be included under plans unveiled by the bbc , itv , sky news and channel 4 last year , for this election , ukip âs mr nigel farage would have been invited to take part in one debate also featuring mr cameron , mr ed miliband and mr nick clegg
earlier this year , the broadcasters suggested an alternative format , which would have seen two clashes involving seven parties , including the greens , plaid cymru and the scottish nationalists but excluding the dup , followed by one head - to - head between mr cameron and mr ed miliband on april 30
the 2010 election was the first to feature the debates , leading to so - called ' nick clegg ' following the success of the liberal democrats leader ( right )
if they are to go ahead , it will be the first televised debate for ed miliband ( left ) under plans unveiled by the bbc , itv , sky news and channel 4 last year , ukip âs nigel farage ( pictured ) would have been invited to take part in one debate alongside ed miliband , nick clegg and cameron ukip , meanwhile , was angry that its position was diluted , while some labour figures doubted the wisdom of taking part in two debates with the greens and the snp , both eating into their party âs vote
â three months later â and again without consultation â you surprised us again by proposing a new seven - party structure , this time not only inviting the greens , but plaid cymru and the snp as well
â to â cut through this chaotic situation â , he said the prime minister would take part in one , 90 - minute debate with the leaders of the green party , labour , liberal democrats , plaid cymru , snp and ukip , to take place in the week of march 23
