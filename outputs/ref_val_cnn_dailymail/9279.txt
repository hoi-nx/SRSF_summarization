so - called ' range anxiety ' is a fear that has apparently plagued some owners of tesla âs model s vehicle , but now ceo elon musk has revealed he has a solution
in a tweet he said he would reveal a way to tackle the issue at a conference on thursday , and while no further details are known , it seems the smart money may be on either navigation software that shows the best route to a charging station or an update that boosts the car 's battery power
california - based tesla is to announce a software update on friday
elon musk revealed it would be for the ' entire model s fleet ' in a tweet
this suggests it may be a trick to boost the battery power of the car ( model s pictured in a promotional shot )
others have suggested it could be new turn by turn navigation software in the tweet musk said : â tesla press conf at 9am [ pacific time , 4pm gmt ] on thurs
â about to end range anxiety â¦ via ota software update
that elon musk says this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory , namely more of tesla âs â supercharger â stations being added
several outlets have been reporting that the answer may lie in some trickery with the car âs software that can boost the battery power
that elon musk says in his tweet ( shown ) this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory , namely more of tesla âs â supercharger â stations being added
however , the fact that it affects the entire model s fleet may also pour cold water on the â turn by turn navigation â theory - as not all the cars have this ability only certain models of tesla 's model s car have the ability to charge their car quickly at the company 's supercharger stations , which tesla lets owners of the model s use for free
