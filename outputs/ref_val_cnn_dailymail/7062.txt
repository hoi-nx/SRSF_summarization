arranging to meet a stranger in a busy cafe last week , i needed to describe my appearance
i started : â i have long , dark hair with a fringe
â that âs not because it âs an easy way to spot me , but because my hairstyle is the very thing that i recognise myself by â when i look in the mirror , when i picture myself , when i think of myself in the past or the future , it is my hair that i see first
for while other people might notice different features , or describe themselves in terms of their clothes , height or figure , for me it has always been this one thing that defines me
then there are women like me â and jemima khan â who keep the same hairstyle throughout their entire lives
this week , jemima khan tweeted a photo of her childhood hair â golden , thick , long and framed with a fringe â identical to the style she still has
for us , our hairstyle is such a fundamental part of who we are that to change it would be as brutal and unthinkable as having plastic surgery
jemima khan : the socialite tweeted this picture of herself as a young girl ( left ) with the words : ' if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it
sometimes it is longer , sometimes there are a few layers , but though i am 53 , i have nât changed my style since childhood
and somehow the style has come to encapsulate my character â it is shiny on a good day , albeit slightly messy and reliably straight
my style is driven by my personality , too , for while there are women who do nât mind facing the world with their hair scraped back off their face or with pixie cuts that mean every emotion is visible , i am not one of them
my world has transformed since i was a child , but throughout school , university , marriage and children , one thing has remained constant : my hair
without the hairstyle i have always known i would feel strange and vulnerable
i had just started a new job and part of me thought a sharp new style might turn me into a sharp , decisive person
kate winslet : the award - winning actress and titanic star obviously loves the casual wavy style she sported at nine brooke shields : at 13 she was hollywood royalty , and 37 years later the actress still has chic long tresses i was hoping for liberation ; instead when i saw myself shorn all i felt was horror
jodie kidd : the catwalk queen retains the simple , quick and easy hairstyle she wore as an outdoors - loving school athlete angelina jolie : from tomb raider star to un envoy , she favours the sideswept look she had at the age of 11 i stopped feeling attractive
in the last years of her life she had worn her hair up mostly , but when i saw these photos i realised she , too , kept the same hairstyle pretty much all her life â and it was identical to mine , shoulder length with a fringe
so , this hairstyle has nât just been worn for one lifetime , but two
of course , there are moments when i think i should try a more mature hairstyle
