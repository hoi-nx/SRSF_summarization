just as i ca n't travel to liverpool without thinking of the beatles , so i ca n't travel to los angeles without thinking of beach boys
their songs of beaches , baggies , boards and bikinis painted a picture of a sun - kissed paradise , and their voices sounded as bright and as laid - back as california itself
this time i was travelling specifically to discover the people and places that inspired the band
i started in hawthorne where the three wilson brothers-brian , carl and dennis - were raised , and joined up with guitarist jardine and vocalist mike love to form a group
beach boys were famously non-surfers but that did n't stop them tapping into the sun , sea and sand culture of the golden state the wilson family home on 119th street , where the boys taped their first single surfin ' in 1961 , was demolished to make way for interstate 105
the rest of the street remains though , its neat lawns , porches and fluttering flags reminders of the group 's clean - cut all-american origins
a redbrick memorial now stands at the site of the wilson house , with a bas - relief frieze showing the group carrying a surfboard and a plaque noting that the music conceived here ' broadcast to the world an image of los angeles as a place of sun , surf and romance '
hawthorne is indeed a place of sun ( 263 days a year ) but no surf and little romance
it 's a charmless city that expanded on the back of the post-war aviation industry ( los angeles international is only five miles away )
i could see why the teenagers of the 1950s would get ' bugged ' driving ' up and down the same old strip '
hawthorne boulevard , with its low - rise jewellery shops and furniture stores , is no place for the young
the pizza show ( hawthorne ) added a splash of colour when it arrived in 1956 and became a home from home for the fledgling beach boys
now run by the son of the original owner , it retains its kitsch medieval italian interior , with wrought iron chandeliers , tiled awnings and mock grilled windows
beach boys came back to play the 1969 prom and honoured the institution in their song be true to your school
the broad beaches of huntington beach stretch for more than eight miles other than dennis wilson , beach boys were famously non-surfers , but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning oceanside culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it
as if on cue , a local surf music tribute band , the breakaways , dressed in faded blue denims and short - sleeved hawaiian shirts , began playing at the pier entrance
on the drive down he told me his story
when beach boys adopted this sound the hard - core sports crowd initially shunned them
' but when they went on to celebrate california youth culture at large by singing about cars and cruising , that broadened their appeal
' when beach boys started recording their focus shifted from hawthorne to hollywood
beach boys ' earliest albums were recorded at capitol but by the time of surfer girl and little deuce coupe , they were also recording around the corner at united and western ( 6050 sunset boulevard )
at the petersen automotive museum there are plenty of cars from the era beach boys celebrated now called ocean way studios , this is where they recorded their 2012 comeback album that 's why god made the radio
several beach boys ' albums , including smiley smile , wild honey , 20/20 and surf 's up , were partially recorded here , while charles manson , a fringe figure on the los angeles music scene in 1969 , visited to tape songs that he 'd written
in songs such as little deuce coupe , shut down , little honda , and fun fun fun , beach boys explored the parallel teenage subculture of cruising and hot - rodding
spread over two spacious floors , there are plenty of cars from the era beach boys celebrated - a peach - coloured 1957 lincoln premiere once owned by jayne mansfield , a black 1957 chrysler , and a wonderful boat - sized 1959 red cadillac convertible
on my final day i headed north on the pacific coast highway to malibu
there 's probably no road that better embraces the geographical joys of los angeles - steep hills and canyons to one side , broad beaches and ocean to the other - and no drive is better suited to a beach boys ' soundtrack
maybe that 's why beach boys came here - and why they kept their shirts and jeans on during the shoot
