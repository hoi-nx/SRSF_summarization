the islamic state cherry picks sections of the koran and misinterprets the accounts of the prophet muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits , experts say
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in iraq and syria , where isis has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' , ruled by its often brutal version of islamic law
the group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the prophet muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet 's example

experts have now said that isis misinterprets the koran in order to wage jihad but now muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out , saying that the group hand picks what it wants from islam 's holy book , the koran , and from accounts of prophet muhammad 's actions and sayings , known as the hadith
writings by the group 's clerics and its english-language online magazine , dabiq , are full of citations from koran verses , the hadith and centuries of interpreters , mostly from hardliners
he explained that islamic scholars throughout history have used texts in a ' decontextualised way ' to suit their purposes and says that isis represent the extreme
islamic clerics say isis just hand picks certain parts of the koran to boost their cause while ignoring other parts that contradict their selections meanwhile khaled abou el fadl , an islamic law scholar at the university of california , says despite its claims to the contrary , isis is a largely political group , borne out of the conflicts of syria and iraq
' islamic clerics also say that while misreading some texts , isis also ignore certain koran verses which promote mercy , preservation of life and protection of innocents , all of which are binding under islamic shariah law
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in iraq and syria , where isis has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' many mainstream clerics compare the group to the khawarij , an early sect that was so notorious for ' takfir , ' or declaring other muslims heretics for even simple sins , that it was rejected by the faith
part of the problem in countering the group 's ideology is that moderate clerics have struggled to come up with a cohesive , modern interpretation , especially of the koran verses connected to prophet muhammad 's wars with his enemies
most muslims denounced the burning of a jordanian pilot as a violation of islam with some calling for the perpetrators to be subjected to the same punishment pivoting off these , isis contends that anyone who rejects beheadings or enslavement is not a real islamic and has been corrupted by modern western ideas
