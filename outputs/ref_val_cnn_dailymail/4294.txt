but this week , a cetacean with no flukes was spotted diving off the coast of southern california
the migrating gray whale , whose tail was likely amputated after it became entangled in fishing gear , was seen adapting a new style of swimming to allow it to negotiate its way to warmer waters
diving sharply into the ocean , it corkscrewed its body so that it could use the side of its peduncle - the area between its main body and where its flukes would be - to generate sufficient thrust
although experts believe the style of swimming could cause the whale to develop back problems , it is probably the only way it could make the migration
the flukeless creature , dubbed the ' whale without a tail ' by some whale watchers , was first spotted swimming alone off the coast of point loma in san diego on saturday , according to grind tv
chopped off : the migrating gray whale ( pictured ) , whose tail was likely amputated after it became entangled in fishing gear , was seen adapting a new style of swimming to allow it to negotiate its way to warmer waters diving sharply into the ocean , it corkscrewed its body so that it could use the side of its peduncle - the area between its main body and where its flukes would be - to generate thrust

' the whale , which will average 40 to 50 feet in length when fully grown , likely lost its fluke recently after becoming entangled in fishing gear , such as ropes from crab or lobster traps or gill nets
this may have led to the whale 's flukes dying and falling off without harming the rest of its body
iintelligent : captain tom white of the dana pride whale watching boat , which runs from dana wharf whale watching , said the rare sighting of the whale ( pictured swimming ) proves how intelligent the creatures are another appearance : on monday , the determined young cetacean was caught on camera swimming in waters off point vicente ( above ) in los angeles , accompanying two other gray whales on the northbound migration speaking to the dodo , marine biologist michael j. moore , ph.d. , of woods hole oceanographic institution , said chronic entanglement trauma could be ' the worst form of animal welfare abuse '
' according to captain dave 's , researchers estimate that entanglement in fishing gear and other items kills nearly 1,000 dolphins and whales across the world on a daily basis
