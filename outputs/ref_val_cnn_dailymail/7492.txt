a former pennsylvania cop who retired after 25 years service to start an ammunition manufacturing and wholesale business has now developed vending machines that dispense ' pretty much everything ' when it comes to bullets
but while sam piccini , of rochester , says that gun clubs from all over are ' chomping at the bit ' for their pay - as - you - go dispensaries , complaints about the machines and their safety seem just as widespread
sam piccini has installed two at his local gun club , the beaver valley rifle and pistol club , which , like many , refuses to sell ' non-jacketed ' rounds of ammunition , making the machines popular among members
controversial : an ammunition salesman and former cop has installed two vending machines that dispense ammunition at his local gun club in rochester , pennsylvania ' it 's not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition ' : former cop sam piccini says the machines are perfectly legal and that he created them for the convenience of gun club members only the machines are kept behind locked doors that require a digital key fob - which all members have - to open
in pennsylvania , people ages 18 and over can buy long gun ammunition , and people over 21 can buy bullets for handguns
