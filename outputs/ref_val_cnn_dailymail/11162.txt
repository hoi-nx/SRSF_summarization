the second rule of brazil versus chile is : you do not talk about brazil versus chile
brazil may have come away with a 1 - 0 win through roberto firmino âs second - half strike , but this match between two south american rivals was more like a scene from cult â 90s film fight club , in which brad pitt and ed norton get normal men kicking lumps out of each other every week , than the showpiece friendly expected
no - one told the chileans players as they repeatedly floored neymar with challenge after challenge after challenge

miiko albornoz was next in referee martin atkinson âs book , nailing neymar twice in a matter of minutes as the chileans competed against each other for how many times they could take out brazil âs star man
the former cardiff defender was lucky to remain on the pitch , perhaps helped by neymar writhing around as if he had been tasered
on gary medel âs stamp , he added : ' the decision is the referee âs
on 37 minutes , neymar scooped the ball out of an opponent âs reach , which prompted their best chance of the first - half
neymar also came close with an in - swinging free kick from out on the right after 26 minutes , which almost tucked into the far right post before claudio bravo tipped it wide
the first 45 minutes were brought to a close by fernandinho flying in with studs raised only to find air and neymar being booked for tripping gonzalo jara
