there were three selma in march 1965 , and parks had missed the first one
but on march 1 , 1965 , she abruptly quit to join american rep. john conyers ' staff in detroit
the voting rights movement in the southern , led by the rev. king , coupled with the assassination of malcolm x that february , had re-energized her appetite for direct political action
on sunday , march 7 , parks was at home in detroit watching the abc television premiere of " judgment at nuremberg " when the broadcast was suddenly interrupted by a news flash from selma , alabama
a peaceful throng of voting rights activists had marched onto the steel - arched edmund pettus bridge that spanned the alabama river , only to be brutally assaulted by police and alabama state troopers , most of them wearing gas masks
that sunday afternoon , 25 - year - old john lewis , then chairman of student nonviolent coordinating committee and today a american congressman from georgia 's 5th district , had been tear - gassed and billy clubbed as he tried to cross the bridge
john lewis had emerged as the bravest and youngest of the major civil rights leaders of the kennedy-johnson era , even speaking at the march on washington in 1963
therefore on march 9 , to protest " selma , " as the incident became known , parks walked down detroit 's wide woodward avenue in full solidarity with brother lewis and the others arrested in selma
" the photos taken that day made me think of the bridge as a battlefield , like at lexington and concord
" once back in montgomery in late march at king 's request , parks looked around to see what had changed since the ' 50s
the fight for voting rights was just beginning
as american reflects on the significance of the 50th anniversary of selma this weekend , it 's important to honor the martyrs of " selma " in a lasting way
certainly , the fact that obama , an african-american , is american president proves that john lewis did n't get his head dented in vain
" one thing " not right " on the 50th anniversary of the selma marches is the sad fact that the edmund pettus bridge has n't been renamed the john lewis bridge
continuing to honor pettus -- a confederate general , american senator and white supremacist -- is insulting to american 's civil rights heroes
dallas county blacks had no say in the bridge being named to honor a reconstruction - era white supremacist
but let 's go further than just removing pettus ' name ; let 's rename the bridge for someone who deserves our admiration
it is , however , the modern - day battlefield where the voting rights movement was born
there is no more fitting tribute to the death of jim crow than to rename the " selma " bridge after john lewis
i urge president obama , the national park service , the state of alabama and the city of selma to " do the right thing
" like the statue of liberty , the john lewis bridge would become a sacred place for visitors to reflect on noble american traditions -- in this case , peaceful protest and voting rights
