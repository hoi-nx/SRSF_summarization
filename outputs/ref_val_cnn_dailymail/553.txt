estee lauder has renewed her contract for the 21st year in a row , she has a lead role in the new ( and unapologetically daft ) us series the the royals and her swimwear line is selling well in saks fifth avenue and harrods
it 's now nearly 21 years since the british actress , model and businesswoman was catapulted into the spotlight at the four weddings and a funeral premiere
she calls the dress ' a landmark dress in fashion history ' just being on hugh grant 's arm would have garnered headlines enough but famously pouring herself into that revealing black versace dress saw her steal the entire show , even if she was thereafter constantly referred to as ' hugh grant 's girlfriend '
still pin thin , there 's barely a wrinkle on her , something which she puts down to nothing more than a lifetime of lathering on moisturiser - with at least spf30 if she 's in the sun - and a great diet
' ' quite sexy ' : liz 's new show the the royals sees her play queen , based on an ' obviously fictitious ' royal family living in modern - day london
joan collins plays her mother and was handpicked by liz flawless skin ( ... and plenty of diamonds ) : the star ( pictured left in a recent selfie ) says she has n't experienced ageism in hollywood and has had her 21 - year contract with estee lauder renewed it 's hard to believe but exercise has hardly featured ' for years ' thanks to a gruelling work regime that means she does n't find it easy to make time for working out
new show the royals , described as ' obviously fictitious ' sees liz playing the character of queen helena reigning over modern - day england , with joan collins , who was handpicked by her , playing her mother
' she admits that her 12 - year - old son damian , born in 2002 to entrepreneur steve bing , was privy to some of the racier scenes , having spent part of his school holidays on the set
although mr steve bing denied that damian , now 12 , ( right ) was his child , a dna test proved otherwise taking a sabbatical from relationships : after plenty of romances including a marriage to arun nayar , an engagement to shane warne and a short friendship with financier david yarrow , liz is enjoying a break still the one ? they 've been apart longer than they were together but the lives of liz and hugh grant are still very much entwined with both being godparent to the other one 's child
hugh grant is pictured above with liz 's son damian at a fundraising event in 2013 after a string of high - profile relationships , liz seems to be settling for the single life as she approaches her fifties
' her life is , she readily admits , still entwined with former beau hugh grant 's
the actor is godfather to her son damian , born in 2002 to entrepreneur steve bing and she has returned the favour , being godmother to one of hugh grant 's daughters , tabitha
he lives next door to me and he 's godfather to my son and i 'm godmother to one of his children
' after a brief dalliance with steve bing which resulted in a dna test to prove his paternity of damian , she married india textile heir arun nayar in 2007 after a five - year relationship , with a ceremony in the british and a lavish six - day ceremony in jodhpur , india
a new episode in the life of liz : the star has been promoting new e ! show the the royals when the relationship crumbled five years ago , a series of headline - grabbing romances followed including an engagement to australian cricketer shane warne
it seems , with son damian , a small herd of pets to nurture including five dogs , chickens , alpacas and piglets , that she already has more than enough affection in her life
