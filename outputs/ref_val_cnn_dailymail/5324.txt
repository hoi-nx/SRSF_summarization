there 's nothing more destructive than a knee - jerk reaction , whether it âs a trifling disagreement that escalates into a row or a mouthful of cake that becomes a whole slice , decisions made on the hoof can cause us unnecessary anguish
thanks to the frenetic pace of our lives and the constant juggling of friends , family and work , it can seem impossible to put real thought into our actions
but now a brilliant new book , 4 seconds , by best - selling leadership coach peter bregman , promises to help you break this bad habit once and for all , thanks to a seductively simple technique
here âs how you can do it ... stop sabotaging yourself our basic needs â fulfilling relationships , success , peace of mind â are surprisingly straightforward to achieve
but in many cases our best efforts to achieve them are built on habits that do nât work
worse , we do nât even realise we âre sabotaging ourselves
for example , when we feel overwhelmed by a to - do list , our reaction is to work longer hours and pack more into them
we multi-task and work late
our intention is to reduce stress
but , of course , our actions have exactly the converse effect
or we say things we think will impress someone , but instead prompt rejection
we try to comfort a friend , but somehow make her more upset
if we feel overwhelmed by a to - do list often our immediate reaction is to work longer hours and do more , intending to relieve stress , but actually the opposite is achieved ( picture posed by model ) all of these situations could be avoided with just a moment âs pause to consider the consequences of our actions and make a better choice
this is where the four-second rule comes in
what is the four - second rule ? the secret to making good decisions that can simplify your life is always to take a single breath â lasting four seconds â before acting
it may sound incredibly simple , but that pause has been proven to be all the time you need to reign back your impulses and find the presence of mind to make the smartest choice
it allows you the space to breathe and to realise that sometimes not following through on something you want to do is a problem , such as not hitting a deadline or not having that difficult conversation
the secret to making good decisions can be a single breath lasting four seconds
the pause this takes may be all the time you need to find the presence of mind to make a good choice ( picture posed by model ) but other times the problem is that you do follow through on something you do nât want to do , such as speaking instead of listening , or playing politics instead of rising above them
a four - second break teaches you old - fashioned self - control
the four - second rule gives you a chance to question your actions and get the right outcome
if you 've tried meditation , you 'll know how unwanted thoughts can appear , when you try the four-second rule identify the impulses that want to take a destructive path rather than ignore them ( picture posed by model ) peter bregman estimates that a new idea will spring into your mind every four seconds , but having an awareness of the way the brain tries to distract itself is valuable
in the four seconds , try to see another way you could respond to the situation at hand
the power of being silent even when you know that taking that four - second pause can help prevent you from making poor decisions , you may find bad habits get in the way of good decisions
make a decision about something you want to do during the four seconds and do nât question it
make a decision during the four seconds and do n't question it later ( picture posed by model ) ditch perfection : to get the most important things done without losing your mind , stop trying so hard and aiming for ultra perfection
instead , make a pact in your four seconds to race through the next phase of work
take four seconds to listen to yourself
if you happen to become involved in a tense email conversation , be sure to apply the four - second rule before replying , giving yourself time to let any anger diffuse ( picture posed by model ) ask yourself : what âs going on for you ? what are you feeling ? take a deep breath and relax into an undistracted moment
