the 21 - year - old man who underwent the world 's first successful penis transplant has been able to resume a sexual relationship with this girlfriend just five weeks after the transplant
professor graewe , who took part in the nine - hour surgery on the south africa man , said : ' he gets good quality erections , ejaculates and has frequent sex with his partner
' he said doctors are now also appealing for donors to enable more men to have the operation
just five weeks after the transplant was carried out by surgeons from stellenbosch university and tygerberg hospital in cape town , south africa , the 21 - year - old patient was able to have sex with his partner the operation was carried out by surgeons from stellenbosch university and tygerberg hospital in cape town , south africa , using a donated penis
he received the donated organ harvested from a man who was declared brain dead
professor graewe said the recipient had accepted the new organ as ' his own ' â and added the skin tone of the donor penis is similar to that of the patient
as part of the procedure , doctors transplanted a new penis , donated by a deceased man
the pictures , left and right , show the veins and blood vessels they connected ' it will never be 100 per cent similar , because even when the individuals have the same skin colour , complexions differ , ' the doctor added
ten years ago , a man in china received a transplant , but asked surgeons to remove the donated penis two weeks after the operation
professor der merwe , who led the operation on december 11 last year , had spent years experimenting on cadavers to see which nerves , blood vessels and other elements had to be joined to guarantee full functioning
the procedure was performed as part of a pilot study to develop a penile transplant procedure that could be performed in a typical south africa hospital
after the nine hour operation , the man recovered rapidly
the picture shows how the nerves of the donated penis were joined to the man 's genital region professor van der merwe said they were surprised by the patient 's rapid recovery
he said : ' our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery

this was the first successful operation of its kind , as a previous attempt did not lead to long - term recovery while full statistics are not available on the number of non medical circumcisions carried out in eastern and southern africa , reports from the world health organization show it is as low as 2 per cent in parts of south africa and up to 35 % per cent in kenya , cnn reports
