just for a moment , when he gained a thin edge to an attempted pull off pakistan ' s sohail khan in auckland , it was possible to believe that ab de villiers was human after all
all other evidence suggests the south african known as ab de villiers is some kind of super power , a man so talented in so many sports that cricket was blessed when he decided to make taking one - day batting to another , exalted level his destiny
nothing sums up england 's out - dated methods at this otherwise expansive cricket world cup than to watch the extraordinary de villiers going about his work

de villiers grew up in pretoria playing hockey , football , rugby , tennis and badminton to international standard at age - group level while also being an accomplished sprinter and swimmer
these days , in his spare time , he plays golf off scratch on top of being an all - round cricketer who keeps wicket , bowls and fields to a high level for his country as well as indisputably the best limited - overs batsman in the world
perhaps the suggestion of a receding hair - line , at the age of 31 , is his only nod towards mortality
de villiers has been around for 10 years now at the highest level but it is with two particular innings in the last two months that he has breathed life into the 50 - over format and re-written the rules on what can be possible
de villiers now holds the records for the fastest 50 , 100 and 150 in one - day international history
joe root leaves the field after being dismissed during the cricket world cup match between england and sri lanka a younis khan talks to ab de villiers during the cricket world cup match between south africa and pakistan the lesson for england to absorb is that the pioneers of this new impossible is nothing brand of one - day cricket are basically playing twenty20 over 50 overs
even now , while all evidence points to a different approach , they still prefer to treat a one - day international as a shortened test innings
' ab de villiers is i someone i look at who has played some amazing knocks
england simply have to rip it up and start again in one - day cricket and build a new side around the likes of buttler , joe root , moeen ali and those coming through like jason roy and sam billings
