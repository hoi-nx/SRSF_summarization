if uxizandre âs ryanair chase success on thursday is to be mccoy âs last festival win - the 31st of his career - it will stick long in the memory
but , typically , at least for the time being , it will be confined to the recesses of the mccoy memory bank as he fixes his thoughts on the prospect of a fairy - tale end to his festival career on friday afternoon
over breakfast , he might afford himself a smile - of contentment not satisfaction , you do nât win 19 championships being satisfied - as he dares to dream what might be when his betfred gold cup mount , carlingford lough , begins his bid for glory shortly after 3.20pm
mccoy rides uxizandre to victory in thursday âs ryanair chase for his 31st festival win mccoy celebrates with the trophy after his first festival win of 2015 with his peadar mccoy by his side chanelle admitted the atmosphere had been â melancholy â after two fruitless days amid , no doubt , a creeping fear that things were not going her husband âs way for his last performances on the greatest of jump racing stages
mccoy 's wife chanelle admitted a â melancholy â had come over ap after two winless days but that he was delighted to break his duck on the 16 - 1 shot all that changed when 16 - 1 shot uxizandre , not even the first string of his trainer alan king in the ryanair chase but transformed by the fitting of a visor , galloped out in front and never looked like being caught as he passed the finishing line five lengths clear of ma filleule
after being joined on the winner âs podium by chanelle , his father peadar and boss mcmanus , mccoy said : â festival is a very special place
mcmanus , ap 's ally for a decade , was as delighted for his jockey as he was for his own win mcmanus said : ' i am so happy he has had a winner at his last festival ... that we provided it for him makes it better ' â i remember years ago christy roche rang me and said â â have you seen this young lad ride ? he should be handicapped , not the horses â â
â mccoy will wear the green and gold mcmanus colours on john kiely - trained carlingford lough , as well as his three other four rides on his last day as a jockey at the festival â hargam , princely conn and ned buntline in the concluding grand annual chase which carries his own name
mcmanus has not ruled out the dream betfred gold cup ending he said : â carlingford lough has a chance in a very open race
he improved from the run in the lexus chase at christmas and has a good 10 - 1 chance of winning in an open betfred gold cup
mccoy stands with carlingford lough after their win in the hennessey gold cup at leopardstown on february 8
he 'll be riding the same mount in the betfred gold cup on friday shortly after 3.20pm but his lack of course form is a worry and , the chaotic and close nature of last year âs finish means it is surely better to look at one of the younger first time runners ; horses like noel meade âs road to riches , oliver sherwood âs many clouds and jonjo oâneill âs holywell , who at one point looked like being mccoy âs mount
but if mcmanus acknowledged he was unsure if his horse could supply the win everyone craves , he reckons he has found a way to replace his soon - to - retire jockey
