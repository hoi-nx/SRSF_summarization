police have been accused of creating a â charter for criminals â with a scheme that allows officers to ignore low - value offences
the powers mean they can dismiss a crime if the investigation cost outweighs the value of the item stolen or damaged
victims have been told that unless the stolen object exceeds Â£ 50 in value , police do not have to bother with an investigation
police have been accused of creating a â charter for criminals â with a scheme that allows officers to ignore low - value offences ( file picture ) last night the move was roundly condemned by mps , anti-crime campaigners and criminologists who said the scheme handed offenders a â licence to steal â
they said the police power of â discretionary disposal â could forever change the criminal justice system which was founded on a principle of caution or prosecute
williams , a businessman who had his fridge stolen , was stunned to hear police would not investigate as it was worth less than Â£ 50
williams ( pictured ) was told police would not investigate the theft of his fridge because it was worth less than Â£ 50 but he received a letter a few days later from merseyside police , which read : â i am sorry to inform you that the theft that you reported will not be investigated due to the low value of the fridge ( Â£ 16.00 ) as the cost of the investigation would outweigh the cost of the item stolen
â mr williams said : â i was absolutely astonished police have been handed the power â¦ it is a charter for criminals , a licence to commit crimes
â he added : â this anoints police the judge and jury â¦ criminals who can be pursued and brought to justice will simply escape unpunished to go on to more serious and larger crimes
