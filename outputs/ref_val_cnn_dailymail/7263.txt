depraved mothers who gave up their lives in the west to live under the rule of islamic state terrorists in syria are taking photographs of their newborn children sleeping alongside handguns and assault rifles in a sickening game of one - upmanship on social media
featuring titles such as ' the little terrorist ' and ' generation kilafah ' , the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents ' extremism in raqqa
while some shots feature children so young that they are unlikely to be aware of the significance of the photographs , another shows a masked young girl of around three - years - old dressed in full combat gear , carrying an ak47 and raising her index figure to make a well - known jihadi gesture
' the little terrorist ' : a newborn baby is seen sleeping under a hello kitty blanket
the otherwise adorable photograph is ruined by the fact an ak47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby 's bed exploited : a masked young girl of around three - years - old is seen dressed in full combat gear , carrying an ak47 assault rifle , and raising her index figure to make a well - known jihadi gesture although the images were posted on twitter over the past year , they form part of a new study of the everyday lives and , inevitably , deaths of the young western women who chose to live under isis

she identifies him as her son 's ' lil best mate ' , suggests he has already been killed , and adds that she hope her own child ' grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him ' the study reveals numerous other images of young children being exploited for shocking photographs that are later posted by their twisted parents on social media
the majority show young boys and girls dressed in combat clothing and brandishing weapons and are captioned with horrific messages by their parents wishing the children a hasty death
others show young boys and girls wearing clothing daubed in the chilling black and white isis logo , stating that the children are being ' raised as lions ' who will one day fight against the west
the use of sickening images of gun toting children also allows the often very young militant parents to brag and boast about how ' hardcore ' they are , distancing themselves from western ideals of parenthood and encouraging them to take part in a pathetic one - upmanship on social media
