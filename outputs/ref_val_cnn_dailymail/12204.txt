tikrit , iraqi while iraqi government and allied forces were on the defensive friday in ramadi , they remained on the offensive in tirkit -- trying to win over not only the strategic city , but the hearts and minds of its nearby residents
iraqi forces steadily bombarded the last part of tikrit still controlled by isis , with fighting described by one wounded man as intense
" the iraqi military is joined by some sunni fighters and a predominantly shiite militia , working together to retake the city best known to most westerners as the hometown of former dictator saddam hussein
members of the badr organization , a powerful shiite armed group , handed out food and supplies friday to residents of the sunni village of albu safah , whose 30 families have been holed up the last 10 months amid the fighting
the village 's leader , jamid , said the shiite fighters ' efforts were working
" in june , tikrit fell to isis , which has conquered large areas of iraqi and syria and claimed them as part of its islamic caliphate
by thursday , the government controlled about 75 % of the besieged city , with about 150 holdout isis fighters controlling the rest , said main al-kadhimi , commander of the hashd al-shaabi militia
