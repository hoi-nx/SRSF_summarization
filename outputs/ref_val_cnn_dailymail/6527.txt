on sunday manchester united will travel to liverpool for their biggest match of their season
and yet last year 's champions league man - of - the - match , a man who also played at the world cup in brazil , may well struggle to make louis van gaal 's starting line - up
angel di maria has had a difficult start to life in a manchester united shirt since arriving from madrid di maria ( second right ) has suffered a fernando torres - eque loss of form that nobody saw coming based on ability , angel di maria should be a shoo - in
but the skills that made ed woodward write madrid a cheque for the best part of Â£ 60m have rarely been displayed after di maria suffered a fernando torres-esque loss of form that nobody saw coming
louis van gaal has stuck by his man so far , but he has a big decision to make ahead of sunday 's match manchester united travel to liverpool , and di maria may not be in the starting line - up at anfield di maria , however , did not want to leave madrid and that is where the problems began
di maria also struggled to adapt to louis van gaal 's tactical switches
the problems for di maria began when he left madrid - he was happy there and did not want to leave di maria was sent off in manchester united 's fa cup clash with arsenal earlier in march van gaal pointed out that most players do not find their feet until their second season - but try telling that to chelsea fans who have seen diego costa fit seemlessly into jose mourinho 's premier league leaders
juan mata started for manchester united in di maria 's absence against tottenham and impressed throughout van gaal now has to decide whether to stick or twist - juan mata ( centre ) or di maria ( right ) on sunday ? yes , the thugs were disturbed by the alarm system and made their getaway
di maria has shown flashes of his potential , scoring four goals in manchester united colours since his arrival in august di maria ( right ) was all smiles on international duty in september , but his form has been poor for manchester united in the subsequent victory over tottenham , for which di maria was suspended , manchester united delivered their best 45 minutes of the season
replacement juan mata linked well with ander herrera as van gaal 's side displayed a synchronicity rarely seen this season
di maria is a better player but can he finally deliver when manchester united need him most ? with Â£ 60m already spent it is a gamble worth taking .
