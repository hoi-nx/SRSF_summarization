salmond suggested that jettisoning an attempt by the conservative to govern alone would allow the snp to prop up a minority labour administration salmond has threatened to bring down a conservative minority government , even if cameron wins more seats than ed miliband
the former scotland first minister said the snp would vote down a tory queen 's speech if it holds the balance of power after the general election
the tory said it was proof the snp would ' sabotage the democratic will of the british people ' to install mr ed miliband in downing street
speaking to the new statesman magazine , mr salmond said the snp could enter a ' confidence and supply ' arrangement with labour - under which the smaller party would agree not to bring down a minority government in return for concessions on particular priorities
mr salmond rejected labour 's argument that the party with the most seats after the may 7 poll will have the opportunity to form the government , insisting that the key question is which leader can command a majority in the commons
' the snp would act to prop up a labour government with ed miliband in number 10 , even if cameron wins more seats although mr cameron would remain incumbent prime minister until a new government was formed , the act - passed by the coalition in 2011 - would restrict his ability to call a new election in the hope of securing a decisive result , said mr salmond
the former snp leader said he had ' no idea ' whether a labour government emerging from such a process would have mr ed miliband as its leader , and suggested that he was wrong to have ruled out formal coalition with the snp so firmly ' if i were him , i would n't have ruled it out , ' said mr salmond
' a new poll of voters in scotland this week put labour down to just 27 per cent , which professor john curtice says could leave the party with just two mps , the same number as the tory mr salmond said it was ' bad politics ' for mr cameron to float the prospect of english votes for english laws on the morning after last year 's independence referendum and said it was now ' not a question of if , but when ' a second referendum on separation from the rest of the british would take place
a conservative spokesman said : ' salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the british people in order to make ed miliband prime minister
