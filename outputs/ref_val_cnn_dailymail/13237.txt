for the first time ever , we 're getting a live - action " star wars " movie without the man who composed the " star wars " theme
" star wars : rogue one , " the recently - announced " star wars " spinoff movie starring felicity jones , will not include the soaring music of oscar winner williams

" williams ' best known non- " star wars " music is almost entirely from steven spielberg films , including " jaws , " " raiders of the lost ark , " " e.t. the extra terrestrial " and " jurassic park
