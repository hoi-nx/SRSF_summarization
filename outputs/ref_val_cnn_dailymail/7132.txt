the white house said on wednesday that it does n't care that hillary clinton deleted emails she says were personal and not in any way related to her work at the state department
nor did federal officials review them before clinton 's team trashed them , it said , because they were part of her private communications
he also revealed that president obama has n't spoken to hillary clinton since it became public that she solely used a private email address while serving as secretary of state , saying it 's been at least a ' couple weeks ' since they last talked , as far as he 's aware
it 's been at least a ' couple weeks ' since they last talked , as far as he 's aware in an endeavor to put an end to the uproar , now in its second week , clinton held a press conference on wednesday at the united nations ' headquarters following her remarks to the body about women 's rights that , of course , does not mean that other senior administration officials have n't talked to clinton or her aides since the controversy began over clinton 's personal email system , which she maintained on a private server located at her home in new york
rather than quench the public 's thirst for information , clinton ginned up questions anew by admitting that she eliminated half of online correspondence from her tenure in the obama administration - more than 30,000 emails - that she deemed private
asked about the matter on wednesday , the president 's top spokesman revealed that the executive branch did not sort through clinton 's emails before she tossed them out , so it has no idea if she obeyed federal regulations
' the federal government did not review secretary clinton 's personal email
' it is not the practice of this administration to review the personal email of federal government employees , ' he added
earnest also suggested that the white house was left out of the loop on clinton 's decision to dispose of emails she says were personal in nature
as it pertains to clinton 's compliance with the federal records act , though , which requires her to give the state department copies of all her government emails , he indicated that the white house had come to terms with the situation as it currently stands - that clinton 's emails are out of the government 's reach and only she can choose to release them
seemingly exasperated with reporters ' nearly endless questions about clinton 's emails , earnest also deflected a question about whether the white house would offer up the the former cabinet official 's conduct as an example of ' model ' behavior given that she violated state department and administration guidelines that warn against using personal email for business purposes
