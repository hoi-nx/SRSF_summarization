babylon , iraq isis has smashed priceless ancient statues in mosul , bulldozed the ruins of nineveh and hatra , and dynamited centuries - old churches , mosques and shrines
in a battle between iraq forces and isis over control of tikrit recently , the tomb of hussein was squashed to rubble , though it 's not clear which side did it
luckily , the ancient city of babylon is outside the extremists ' grasp , south of baghdad
they bear his name and describe him as the son of nebuchadnezzar , who had the reputation of being ancient babylon 's greatest king
but it continues to be source of great pride for iraq who see themselves as the heirs of the world 's oldest civilization
hussein 's vain brick inscriptions may annoy him , but isis ' destruction appalls him
why did you do that ? " the defacers ' reasoning ? the artifacts , some of the oldest in ancient civilization , are from the " age of ignorance , " isis says , before the advent of islam
antiquity is an integral part of iraq 's national identity
history is measured there not in centuries but in millennia , and iraq 's take such vandalism to heart
safa ad - hassan and other parents took iraq scouts on a camping trip near babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them
hassan fled mosul when isis overran it last year then later ransacked the museum
iraq will defend its heritage against isis , said mohamed hattab from iraq 's antiquities department
" it 's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians , who have destroyed much of it in the north , which has been out of the defensive reach of iraq soldiers
