the investigation into claims of a vip paedophile sex ring widened dramatically yesterday after police raided the home of a disgraced tory mp
harvey proctor , 68 , had been named on a list of politicians passed to police by campaigning labour mp mann
scotland yard officers spent two days searching his grace - and - favour home at belvoir castle in leicestershire after a police team arrived on the estate on wednesday
harvey proctor insisted he was a ' discreet ' man and had never been part of ' any rent boy ring ' with cabinet ministers , mps or military top brass former essex mp harvey proctor , who quit parliament in 1987 after admitting â spanking sessions â with rent boys , was forced to deny any knowledge of the abuse and deaths of three young boys
he said he did not attend westminster â sex parties â at an exclusive address near parliament and claimed to be trapped in a â kafka-esque fantasy â
it is understood that investigators now have up to nine current and former senior politicians on mr mann âs list in their sights as the sensitive inquiry gathers pace
speaking last night , mr mann said he was pleased at the progress of the investigation and insisted that â no stone must be left unturned â
mr harvey proctor today said he knew nothing about the allegations and wanted to talk to police at the ' earliest opportunity ' harvey proctor faces being interviewed under caution within weeks by detectives with the metropolitan police âs operation midland squad â which was set up in november to investigate claims of a westminster child sex abuse ring in the 1970s and 1980s
in addition , detectives are examining a list passed to them by mr mann last december which identifies 22 potential suspects across the political spectrum
on wednesday , detectives arrived at belvoir castle near grantham â the seat of the duke of rutland â where harvey proctor has lived since 2003
i have never attended sex parties at dolphin square or anywhere else
â mr harvey proctor , 68 , lives in the 16,000 - acre grounds of belvoir castle ( pictured ) , near grantham in leicestershire he added : â i was a discreet person and regarded in the house of commons as a very independent mp and a loner
mr harvey proctor said that he had pleaded guilty to four charges of gross indecency in 1987 for offences relating to to the age of consent for homosexuality , which has since been lowered from 21 to 16 he added : â i believe the number of victims grows by the day , and the number of alleged perpetrators â through death â diminishes
â harvey proctor , who represented basildon and nearby billericay , was an outspoken hard - right tory but left parliament after pleading guilty to gross indecency
campaigning mp mann passed his dossier naming suspected westminster paedophiles to police in december last year
as a young councillor in london , mr mann uncovered evidence a tory cabinet minister was allegedly involved
