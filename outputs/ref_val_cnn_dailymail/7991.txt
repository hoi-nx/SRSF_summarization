education : david cameron and his wife samantha have accepted a place at a church academy a short walk from downing street for their daughter nancy david cameron is to become the first conservative prime minister to send a child to a state secondary school after accepting a place at a church academy a short walk from downing street
now he and wife samantha have decided to send daughter nancy , 11 , to the grey coat hospital , a cofe school in westminster , from september
it is a significant break from tradition for a tory leader â and for the camerons personally , given that the prime minister was educated privately at eton and his wife at marlborough college
grey coat hospital is thought to have been the family âs second choice for nancy , after another church school in west london
like hundreds of thousands of parents , the camerons heard this week from their local authority which of several applications had been successful
a family friend has revealed that they have now accepted a place at grey coat hospital â a choice which will be seen as an indication of mr david cameron âs confidence that he will still be in power later this year , given its proximity to number ten
the school is rated outstanding by education watchdog ofsted and is one of the most sought - after state schools in the area , with seven applications for every place
