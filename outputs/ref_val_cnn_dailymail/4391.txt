labour and the snp are ' half way down the aisle ' to stitching up a deal to put ed miliband in number 10 , the tories claimed today after nicola sturgeon dropped the party 's red line over nuclear weapons
ms nicola sturgeon said the snp would still be prepared to put mr ed miliband in downing street even if labour refused to scrap britain 's trident nuclear deterrent â a key plank of the nationalists ' manifesto
the scotland first minister said the snp would never vote to renew trident but she insisted there were ' many issues we could agree on '
ms nicola sturgeon played down the prospects of a formal coalition , but said the snp could prop up a labour government ' on an issue - by - issue ' basis
nicola sturgeon said the snp could still do a deal with the labour party even if ed miliband insists on renewing britain 's trident nuclear weapons she said : ' on that basis , there are many issues we could agree on which we would support but we would not vote for trident
' ms nicola sturgeon 's remarks , to the guardian , come amid growing pressure on mr ed miliband to rule out going into coalition with the snp in a bid to stem the party 's loss of support in scotland
tories chairman grant shapps said ms nicola sturgeon 's move opened to door for a deal between labour and the snp after the election
' a labour government propped up by the snp - handing mr ed miliband the keys to number 10 - moved a step closer after nicola sturgeon dropped a red line over trident nuclear weapons scotland will be able to ' call the tune ' at westminster after the general election , according to salmond
' it comes after a poll of marginal constituencies in scotland revealed that a dramatic surge by the snp could see labour lose almost 40 seats north of the border
the survey , by the tories peer lord ashcroft , showed the snp could win as many as 56 of scotland 's 59 seats â up from just six at present
but a labour government could be propped up by the snp â handing mr ed miliband the keys to number 10
however , labour 's scotland mps are urging mr ed miliband to rule out a deal with the snp ahead of the election in an attempt to reverse his party 's dire poll ratings north of the border
former prime minister sir john major has also warned labour against doing a deal with the snp
sir john major claimed ' the snp would enter into any agreement with labour with one overriding aim : to break up the britain '
' if the outcome of the general election is inconclusive , will they refuse to govern with the support of a party whose principal aim is to break up the britain ? ' the snp said that labour would ' not be forgiven by the people of scotland ' if they refused to work with the nationalists
' ' there are no circumstances in which the snp would put the tories into government - the question is if labour have the same commitment , with a number of senior labour figures promoting voting tories in scotland , and even the idea of a ' grand alliance ' between the tories and labour .
