now , researchers have found the mediterranean diet can help people with depression , too
a study found people who followed the diet were happier , less stressed and reported an improved quality of life compared to those who ate fewer mediterranean foods
the diet consists of plant - based foods such as vegetables , legumes , fruit , nuts , seeds and olives , extra virgin olive oil , fish , with moderate red wine intake
it also involves a low consumption of processed food , processed carbohydrates , sweets and chocolate and red meat
omega-3 , a fatty acid found in fish , plays a vital role in maintaining and improving mental health and stability as part of the study , australian researchers recruited a total of 82 adults with depression , aged between 18 -65
they then assessed how strongly they followed the mediterranean diet through a 14 - item questionnaire
the study âs lead author , dr parletta , of the university of south australia , said there was a strong link between the mediterranean diet and lower scores for mental illness
â it âs not that people are getting depressed and then eating badly , eating badly causes the depression in the first place
â so it was amazing that there was a significant correlation the mediterranean diet and mental illness , even for people with low scores on the consumption of wholefoods
inflammation and insulin resistance which occurs in the body and causes heart disease could also cause depression in the brain , she said
a mediterranean diet is high in nutrients such as omega-3 , vitamin b , vitamin d , healthy fats and anti-oxidants , she said , which are all important for keeping the brain functioning well and staving off mental illness
it can be a deficiency in some of the nutrients that keep the brain functioning properly there has been a lot of research on how omega - 3 fatty acids , found in fish , play a vital role in maintaining or improving mental health and stability
deficiency in these nutrients can impair the brain âs functioning and lead to depression , she added
she explained hat highly processed foods , red meat and confectionary increase our blood glucose levels , leading to sensitivity to insulin â the hormone that controls how much sugar is in our blood â and obesity
eating vegetables , fruits and legumes ensures it has the nutrients it needs to function properly when a person is stressed and anxious , they go into a â fight or flight â mode in which stress hormones are released , making the body more aroused and responsive , shifting blood from the skin to the muscles , and raising heart rate
' you âll be in a better state to replenish the nutrients if you âre eating a nutrient - rich mediterranean diet
' so no stress is best of all , but a mediterranean diet with stress is better than a poor diet with stress
