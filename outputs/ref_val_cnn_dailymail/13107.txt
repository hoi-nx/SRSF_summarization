during a conversation with a professor at an ivy league college , a mother nudges her daughter to share how she 's president of her school 's " survivors - of - bulimia " group
looking to give their child an edge , parents hire a college admissions consultant when their child is in the eighth grade and know the total tab will be roughly $ 50,000
but sadly , they are all - too - real examples included in a provocative new book " where you go is not who you 'll be : an antidote to the college admissions mania " by award - winning new york times op - ed columnist and bestselling author frank bruni
those examples , bruni said , should really be " wake - up calls " for any parents or students currently engaged in , or one day likely to be consumed by , the " what school will i get into ? " annual game
student goes 8 for 8 in ivy league college admissions for many families in the united states , the challenge is n't getting into the right college
it is being able to afford the school of their choice , or any school for that matter
but for many middle - and upper - income families , the college admissions process is as frenzied as ever with the belief that one school can make or break a child 's future
i had to ask bruni , whom i met during my time covering presidential politics , how exactly college admissions became so insanely intense and ridiculously competitive
we both laughed that the process was definitely not nearly as manic or as charged when we both went to college in the ' 80s
bruni points to a number of factors all mixed together , creating " this kind of perfect storm of just absolute fixation , panic , etc. " about where kids are going to go to school , whether it 's exclusive enough and whether they 've " breached the inner sanctum
" i think all of that has made parents feel anxious on behalf of their kids and has made them feel like their kids have to have anything that might be a leg up , and if an elite school is a leg up , well , then dammit , let 's get them that
that " industry " did n't exist just three decades ago when frank bruni and i were applying
" so when you have colleges drumming up extra applications so that they can then claim an acceptance rate below 15 % , that becomes part of the discussion that adds to the anxiety because you look at these numbers and you think , ' oh my god , if i do n't begin doing sats prep as a freshman in high school , if i do n't hire the private tutor , ' " i wo n't get in -- or so the thinking goes , said bruni
but how much does where you go really determine how successful you will ultimately be ? consider the fortune 500 and the alma maters of the heads of the 10 companies with the highest gross revenues back in the summer of 2014
there was only one ivy league school on the list ( dartmouth ) , bruni says in his book
the point is there is n't one exact path to the corner office , and an ivy league degree or a degree from another prestigious private university is neither a requirement nor a guarantee
sure , there are presidents who hail from the ivy league ( george w. bush , bill clinton ) but there are many who do n't : ronald reagan went to eureka college , a small school in illinois , and richard nixon got his undergraduate degree from whittier college in southern california
bruni said a big reason for writing the book was that when he surveyed the accomplished people he has known and interviewed , there did n't seem to be any " exaggerated concentration " of people coming from the most selective colleges
" one of the most poignant stories that bruni shares in his book is the letter matt levin 's parents wrote to him the night before he received his first college response
" is it possible to restore any sanity to the entire college admissions process ? bruni said what we can do is try to change the conversation and begin to also talk about the negative consequences of this push to get into the most selective school
" bruni hopes parents and students read his book , but he especially hopes graduating seniors read it before they head off to school
