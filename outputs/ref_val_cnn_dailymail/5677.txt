bank provoked fury last night after handing out lavish bonuses â including an Â£ 859,000 windfall to its former boss
the state - backed lender âs annual pay report showed 110 staff received more than 1million euros ( Â£ 720,000 ) last year , despite it racking up a Â£ 3.5billion loss
this marked its seventh consecutive annual loss since the financial crisis , when it was rescued with a Â£ 46billion bailout from taxpayers
still on the books : stephen hester , left with a warwickshire hunt , is set to pocket a Â£ 1million bonus from the bank - one of around 70 , Â£ 1million - plus , payments in 2014 one of the biggest winners was former chief executive stephen hester , who pocketed Â£ 859,000 from a long - term bonus awarded in 2012
last night the awards were branded â excessive â and â unacceptable â , with campaigners criticising mr osborne for failing to stamp out fat - cat pay at bank
but yesterday it emerged he could still receive up to Â£ 3.9million for 2015 , including a long - term shares award of up to Â£ 1.6million that will pay out for several years
warning : boss ross mcewan admitted it could be several years until taxpayers finally get their money back after seven consecutive losses he will also receive a Â£ 1.5million â golden hello â shares payment in august to compensate him for bonuses he forfeited when he left his previous job at commonwealth bank of australia in 2012
he added : â here is a bank that âs not doing very well that the taxpayer owns and has underwritten , so why should these few not very successful bankers get paid so much money ? â the boss of bank âs so - called â bad bank â also hit the jackpot as separate filings to the stockmarket revealed he received a Â£ 2million shares windfall yesterday
cullinan , who is responsible for getting rid of the lender âs most toxic loans , was among seven senior figures to pocket a total of Â£ 5.5million from bonuses awarded in previous years
in the money : bank , which is based in edinburgh , pictured , has paid Â£ 7.6bn in bonuses since it was bailed out â the chancellor needs to be far more engaged in the process than he is now , and ask the board to justify these salaries
he was convinced by the bank âs former management , including mr stephen hester , that it could trade its way out of trouble
â mr osborne also said he would look to start selling off bank as quickly as possible after the election , but admitted this could take years
before the 2008 financial crisis , bank was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world
one of the biggest deals came when bank joined a consortium to buy dutch bank abn amro for Â£ 49billion , which was later revealed as a major overvaluation
