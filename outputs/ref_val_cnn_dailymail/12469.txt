in a side room at the american university , four girls chat and giggle
we met her just a few weeks after boko haram had attacked her school and abducted almost 300 students
as the boko haram trucks carrying them began to speed away to the militants ' territory , she and her friend bravely jumped , barely escaping with their lives
studying with her here are 21 other girls from chibok
they , too , escaped boko haram
like hundreds of others across north east nigeria 's north east , they were targeted simply for going to school
choosing to go back to class is a statement of their courage and focus on education , which they hope will bring change back home
" and me going to school will make that change , " she wants to be a surgeon
it is hard to imagine sitting with her now what she and the other girls have been through at boko haram 's hands , what they almost lost
there are 46 other chibok girls who also escaped boko haram , but there are no funds available to pay for their education
even on campus , though , the specter of boko haram is never far away
for the girls , to remain in school , they must draw upon all their reserves of courage
