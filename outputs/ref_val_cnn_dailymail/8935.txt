at one minute to three , mowbray walked from the spacious ricoh arena tunnel , gave a thumbs up to the photographers clicking away and returned to the capricious game that is football management
by five oâclock , he must have been wondering quite what he âd thrown himself back into after a rollercoaster afternoon that did nothing to soothe coventry âs acute relegation anxieties
coventry 's jim o'brien opens the scoring for the home side in just the fourth minute of the match coventry : burge , aaron phillips , pennington , martin , stokes , jim o'brien ( jackson 77 ) , , barton ( sanmi odelusi 62 ) , john fleck , nouble , tudgay ( williams 63 ) , samuel subs not used : webster , turgott , finch , charles - cook booked : jim o'brien scorer ( s ) : o'brien 4 , sanmi odelusi 70 vale : neal , veseli , inniss ( mcgivern 36 ) , robertson , dickinson , byron moore ( daniel 81 ) , michael brown , michael o'connor , mark marshall , williamson ( dodds 77 ) , tom pope subs not used : yates , birchall , lines , johnson booked : dickinson , inniss scorer ( s ) : tom pope 40 , mark marshall 45 , michael o'connor 76 referee : mick russell attendance : 9,446 the 51 - year - old yorkshireman , late of hibernian , west brom , celtic and teesside , spoke of restoring coventry âs glory days when he arrived in the week
but his short - term contract speaks of a more pressing mission - saving the coventry , famously fa cup winners in 1987 and staple of the top flight for many years , from the indignity of league two football
on the first sunny afternoon of spring , the whole place seemed energised by mowbray âs arrival and coventry had a precious lead just four minutes in
mowbray issues instructions from the touchline during his first game in charge of coventry â we are staying up â , sang the home faithful , confident again that a club in the premier league as recently as 2000 - 01 would nât be playing fourth tier football next season for the first time since 1959
but vale , who still harbour hopes of reaching the play - offs , slowly grew into the game and took command in the minutes just before half - time
first , tom pope was left with a straightforward side - foot finish after the ball was played across the penalty area , nobody seemingly wanting to take responsibility
then , four minutes later , coventry âs fragile confidence at the back was dented again
the impressive mark marshall played a neat one - two with michael oâconnor around the home defence and produced an emphatic finish
the coventry wide man wheels away in celebration after giving his side the perfect start to make matters worse , mark marshall had been released by mowbray âs predecessor steven pressley last summer having been deemed unworthy of a new contract
â mowbray sent his players out five minutes early for the second - half and , having composed themselves following the double blow before the break , they started on the front foot
frank nouble , brought back into the side by mowbray , bulldozed his way forward on the counter-attack before picking out sanmi odelusi bursting up on his right
from their next piece of attacking play , vale were awarded a free - kick 25 yards out after oâbrien felled michael brown
