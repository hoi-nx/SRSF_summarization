celtic have turned up the heat ahead of a potentially - fraught league cup final by slamming the sfa âs decision to let dundee united midfielder calum butcher play in sunday âs hampden park showpiece
the englishman escaped a red card after referee craig thomson sent off team - mate paton instead in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy scottish cup quarter - final
that decision will be the subject of an appeal tribunal on wednesday , when celtic will also challenge the red administered to defender virgil van dijk following his clash with calum butcher last sunday
celtic have slammed the sfa âs decision to let dundee united 's calum butcher play in the league cup final celtic will challenge the red shown to defender virgil van dijk following his clash with calum butcher last sunday dundee united âs ciftci â already banned from the hampden park showpiece â faces a further two - match suspension for violent conduct after kicking out at parkhead skipper brown
but celtic are furious that calum butcher will be free to play in the final , even if paton is found to be the victim of a miscarriage of justice
a club statement read : â it seems completely illogical and fundamentally unfair that , in an incident where mistaken identity has been claimed , the dundee united player now identified as being involved appears to have no case to answer â and would be available to play in the league cup and the scottish cup replay between the teams â while celtic âs player ( virgil van dijk ) may potentially miss both of those matches
â celtic and virgil van dijk maintain their position that no red - card offence was committed by virgil van dijk
virgil van dijk will appear at hampden park to put his case on thursday and we will fully support him in this appeal
â dundee united refused to comment publicly on tuesday night , but are privately furious at some of celtic âs comments
the dundee united striker lashed out in retaliation at the scotland midfielder before virgil van dijk and dundee united âs paton were controversially dismissed by thomson on the advice of assistant graham chambers
celtic 's brown accused dundee united forward ciftci of ' blatantly ' kicking him in the head there will be no sfa action against tannadice winger aiden connolly , however , despite claims by celtic the youngster dived to win a penalty in the scottish cup stalemate
â the failure to penalise brown âs challenge was blamed by dundee united boss jackie mcnamara for sparking the incident which saw ciftci lash out with his boot
despite rising tensions , johansen believes the league cup final will not go the same way as the scottish cup tie â which was the first of what will now be four games between the teams in a short period
