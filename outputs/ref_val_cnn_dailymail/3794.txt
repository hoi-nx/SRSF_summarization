a kidnapped journalist who survived jihadi john has told of the blood - chilling moment the british extremist ran the cold blade of a sword across his neck in a mock execution at an isis prison
espinosa , a spaniard captured alongside colleagues while reporting the conflict between president assad 's regime and militant soldiers in 2013 , was freed last year after a deal was brokered between his government and front - line extremists
he had spent months at the mercy of emwazi , the british hooded executioner now ominously referred to as jihadi john , and other terrorists while in captivity
in an harrowing account printed by the sunday times , he relives the moment emwazi , now the world 's most wanted man , ran the cold blade of a sword across his neck , threatening execution
' he caressed my neck with the blade but kept talking : " feel it ? cold , is n't it ? can you imagine the pain you 'll feel when it cuts ? unimaginable pain , " ' mr espinosa wrote
emwazi , who ' wanted maximum drama ' , was among ' psychotic ' extremists who pillaged the espinosa 's belongings to put towards a haul of stolen cash apparently so large there were rooms filled with millions of dollars
mr espinosa was snatched with his colleague photographer ricardo garcia vilanova when the pair were working near the turkish border in 2013
mr espinosa and his colleague ricardo garcia vilanova were kept alongside other hostages for months emwazi ( right before joining extremists in syria and left in his trademark hood ) was among mr espinosa 's captors alongside american journalists and aid workers including british alan henning and david haines , they were locked in isis prisons - as mr espinosa describes them ' elegant mansions ' and the former government headquarters in raqqa - across the war - ravaged country for months
while their comrades have all but been murdered - john cantlie is seemingly still alive but in the group 's clutches - the two spanish were freed , spared to tell the world of the group 's atrocities
' they liked scaring their captives , forcing us to look at photos of sergei gorbanov ... " you might end up with him , ' recalled mr espinosa
on one occasion , the espinosa notes , a young boy was beaten to a pulp after being caught smoking - a forbidden habit under oppressive sharia law
the european and american hostages who disappeared had been either freed or moved , mr espinosa claims to have been told
while the journalist does n't describe in depth any hopes he had of escaping , he revealed that asking his captors how to pray was among his first actions once taken
in march last year mr espinosa , a veteran journalist for the spanish national newspaper el mundo , and mr ricardo garcia vilanova were taken into the care of turkish authorities after six months of captivity
to secure his release the spanish government is understood to have paid a sum to the terror group
his first victim : american journalist james foley was the first western citizen to have been killed on film by jihadi john in a sickening propaganda video slaughtered : british alan henning ( left ) and david haines ( right ) are among the hostages who were savagely murdered by the group emwazi was unmasked as jihadi john the son of a kuwait minicab driver , young emwazi arrived in british speaking only a few words of english , and appeared more interested in football than in islam
the british officer accused him of planning to travel to somalian to join the militant group al shabaab , he said , and said mi5 had been watching him
