george osborne vetoed plans for a ' patronising ' tory election slogan which said ' well done you ' in an attempt to thank voters for putting up with spending cuts
according to one source , the slogan was dreamed up by advertising agency m&c saatchi , which is working on the tory ' campaign ahead of may 's poll
but it was quickly rejected by the chancellor , who said it was ' patronising and insensitive '
' we already have a struggle on our hands to rebut labour claims that cameron and george osborne are rich and out of touch
' it did n't take very long for george osborne to tear it up
' m&c saatchi went back to the drawing board and later produced the far more successful image of labour leader ed miliband peering out of the top pocket of former scottish first minister alex salmond
the brothers ' previous firm , m&c saatchi and saatchi , designed margaret thatcher 's famous ' labour is n't working ' poster in the run - up to the 1979 election
last night a tory spokesman said of the slogans : ' we do not talk about campaign matters
