ker was diagnosed with a brain tumour after enduring eight months of migraines ker woke up one morning with numbness on one side of his body
when the 24 - year - old construction worker went to a doctor the next day , he was sent home with some headache pills and told he was probably suffering from a bad migraine
' i ended up meeting a beautiful woman named rikki , â mr ker told daily mail australia
â but after three weeks of getting to know rikki , the left side of his body turned numb again
i was trying to explain to rikki that it was all normal and it was just a side - effect of my migraines
â when mr ker arrived at the hospital , he undertook a ct scan but alarm bells started ringing when he was told to do a second scan but with contrast dye injected into him
â then the doctor walked in and all i remember her saying was : " i am very sorry and there is no right way to explain this but you have a large tumour in the right side of your brain
" ker pictured getting his head shaved after undergoing a surgery to get the large tumour removed mr ker said he did nât know what was going to happen next , which prompted him to end his relationship with his girlfriend at the time
â i have no idea what kind of pain rikki would have been in watching it all unfold - my family members were crying on my shoulder while i was sitting in a wheelchair - having to do all this without really even knowing me
â the new zealand man pictured here with stitches after having his large tumour removed from his brain ker 's brother jordan ( left ) pictured with rikki and mother sharon during the tough recovery when mr ker went in for his mri scan , he claims the doctor made a â mistake â after leaving his ct scan on his hospital bed
ker received good news when he was told the tumour was non-cancerous â then right before the scan , she walked in and knelt down beside my bed with a lollipop ring in her hand from the cafeteria downstairs and said : " i do n't need a ring ... ker will you marry me ? " â i instantly said yes
â after his mri results returned , he received some good news - he was diagnosed on september 2 with a meningioma - a benign ( non-cancerous ) tumour , which is normally found in elderly people
â the neurosurgeon told me there was a 20 per cent chance i 'd never move my left side again and an even higher chance i 'd never get the same sort of movement in my left side , â he said
â i looked at my left side , too scared to move it , then i just open my mouth and start rapping a song i had written and tears started streaming down my face
â i looked down and moved the toes on my left side and then my hands
' ker , who now lives in melbourne , is a hip hop artist and hopes to get back into the industry when he 's well again after his surgery , ker tried to go back to work but was soon forced to leave after suffering seizures recalling the time before the tumour was found , mr ker said the pain was nearly unbearable
â i could nât move my body so he convinced me to see a doctor but when the ct scans came back â nothing showed up so i thought i was fine , until the migraines started
the pain endured , weeks and turning into months of excruciating migraines during which he suffered physically and mentally
' when ker was released from hospital after his surgery , his fiance took time out of work to look after him
â the 24 - year - old woke up one morning when he found half his body was numb where he struggled to move after being released from hospital , ker started working again but he soon suffered non-convulsive seizures , which forced him to quit
â but i have promised rikki i âll fly her back to our beautiful country new zealand for a holiday
