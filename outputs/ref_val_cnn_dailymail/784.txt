diatribe : an image of twitter founder dorsey in cross-hairs was posted alongside a rant in arabic it is nine years since mr dorsey launched the site , which is trying to avoid being a vehicle for jihadi videos ' how will you protect your employees and supporters , helpless jack , when their necks officially become a target for the soldiers of the caliphate ? ' it also claimed killing employees ' outside a neighbourhood pub ' would be no more preventable than the massacres of charlie hebdo killer amedy coulibaly and copenhagen shooter omar el-hussein
