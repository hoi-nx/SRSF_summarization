scientists wanting to develop a spacecraft carrying a nuclear device to blow up asteroids are preparing to seek funding this year
called the hyper velocity asteroid impact vehicle ( haiv ) , their system would be able to launch and reach an earth - bound asteroid within 100 days or so , destroying it before it reached our planet
but the unmanned spacecraft relies on one crucial aspect - tracking and finding an asteroid , before it is too late to stop it impacting earth
the front of the spacecraft would create a small crater , which the nuclear device would then travel in to and explode the concept was created by the emergency asteroid defence project ( eadp ) , based in danish
they are seeking to find a way to protect earth from destruction when all other methods have failed
a few seconds later , an aft body ( a follower spacecraft ) carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times
the eadp team says there is a significant threat of an asteroid hitting earth shown is a diagram of how the spacecraft might look , with the nuclear device in the middle
sensors at the front direct the spacecraft towards its target , before it impacts last year , the privately - funded b612 foundation discovered that earth is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought
if a potentially dangerous object is identified , the spacecraft can then be launched and sent on its mission to blow it up , before it has a chance to threaten earth
' launching a nuclear device into space may not be as easy as the team thinks , as there are a number of legal issues to do so
however , they say there are no safety issues with launching a nuclear device and , as the haiv will be hitting an asteroid so far into space , â no nuclear material , radiation or shock wave will reach earth
most notably , in february 2013 , hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of chelyabinsk in russia - the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century on the left is a typical journey for the haiv vehicle to intercept an asteroid that could dangerous to earth
and by the end of the decade , they want to be ready to stop asteroids up to 985ft ( 300 metres ) in size - which account for 99.9 per cent of asteroids near earth
they note that their method , using a nuclear device , should be considered a last resort and only used if other methods have failed
â however , in extreme cases with less than one year warning time and when all non-nuclear methods fail , we believe the haiv system is the only and most appropriate technique currently available to defend earth , â the team said in a statement .
