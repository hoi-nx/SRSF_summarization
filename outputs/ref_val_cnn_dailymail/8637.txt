chelsea were knocked out by psg on wednesday night , with subjects ranging from the referee 's performance , ibrahimovic 's comments on the blues being ' babies ' , david luiz 's return and whether the premier league is still the best in the world
also , arsenal overcame their old trafford hoo - doo to beat manchester united on monday night , and the former gunners legend was at the game
but what was that ' money ' sign to arsene wenger all about ? you can read all the answers below
host commentator it âs certainly a good way to sum it up
he probably thought the referee had got it so wrong , and everyone could see it , that he âd get off the hook
the controlled reaction of the chelsea players was definitely a factor in the red card
many years ago , when i was playing under george graham against manchester united , he accused us of being too nice during half - time
it was a clear demonstration from manchester united that he âs not going to be a part of their future
though his last contribution for manchester united , winning a penalty against sunderland , was very important and has been largely overlooked
i think van gaal is largely responsible for manchester united âs situation at the moment though , not the players
man management was sir alex ferguson âs forte , and some players find it harder to cope than others
alex ferguson would squeeze every ounce out of his players
if he were still there , they would nât be so far away from top of league
they were shown the door , so why not ? when roman abramovich first took over at chelsea , he offered a lot of money for henry , but arsenal refused and henry was flattered by it
i think david luiz would have been half - hoping for that same reaction from chelsea
as for danny welbeck , he âs a young man early in his career and was never really given a chance as a centre forward â his preferred role
and then there were the unnecessary comments from van gaal , claiming danny welbeck was only good enough to be a substitute at manchester united
he wanted to fulfill his dreams at manchester united and he had to listen to that
now he has the chance to fulfill his dreams with arsenal
maybe , because the fans were so young , that had nât seen everything that used to go on ! there was one occasion when i exclaimed out loud when arsenal wasted a chance â that got a few comments from the crowd , but it was good to feel like part of my old club again
all credit to david luiz â he has so much self - belief
people were saying jose mourinho was a genius for letting him go , but was he a genius last night , calvin ? of course , he had to let him go for that kind of money
however , i think chelsea âs performance has quite a lot to do with winning the capital one cup
they were probably thinking they had the league title wrapped up that weekend as well as the capital one cup
they look to have the wrong mentality
i do nât think it makes it any less interesting , nico , but whether it âs the best ? i âm not even sure i thought it was best when chelsea and manchester united were in the champions league final in 2008
before christmas , it looked like chelsea and real madrid could win it
it âs all about finding consistency and form at right time
they tried to press , but the likes of thiago motta and marco verratti were so calm and technically gifted ... this forced the chelsea players to sit off a bit as they could nât get the ball off them
psg did nât panic with ten men , they were brave and kept the ball in tight situations
it was like they had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men ! jose mourinho was just as guilty as his team
the speed at which the chelsea players all surround the referee is important â it âs the quickest you âll ever see john terry run ! they ca nât even be certain what âs happened or if their player is injured , but it does nât stop at least five or six of them waving their arms in air
it âs a calculated , orchestrated reaction , and they âve been doing it for a while .
