dozens of mps are claiming taxpayer - funded expenses to rent homes or stay in hotel rooms in london while letting out property they own nearby , it emerged last night
the 46 mps have claimed more than Â£ 1.3million for rent or hotel rooms at the same time as receiving rent from properties that were often purchased and refurbished from taxpayers â money
an investigation by channel 4 news found 25 conservatives , 14 labour and four liberal democrat had benefited from the expenses loophole , which is not against parliamentary rules
many of the mps bought their london properties with the help of the taxpayer under the previous expenses system that allowed claims for mortgage payments
46 mps - including labour leader murphy ( left ) and former conservative health secretary lansley ( right ) - have claimed more than Â£ 1.3million for rent or hotel rooms at the same time as receiving rent from properties but since the claims were banned by the independent parliamentary standards authority ( ipsa ) following the expenses scandal , the mps have switched to renting out the properties they own and instead claimed expenses for rent and hotels
under the current system , mps are allowed to claim Â£ 20,600 a year in london rent and Â£ 150 a night for hotels
labour âs shadow culture minister bryant has claimed Â£ 35,350 in the past two years to rent a property in london despite already owning a penthouse

lansley , the former tory health secretary , has claimed more than Â£ 7,440 since 2013 to stay in london hotels , despite owning a flat with his wife in upmarket pimlico , which was bought with help under the old expenses system
â last night mps said the rules banning mortgage claims had forced them to let out their second home to be able to afford the mortgage payments
mps have been obliged to let out their own properties since 2010 because the new rules say they can not claim mortgage interest â only rent
my relatively few overnight stays in london ( barely once a month in the last year ) meant that my expenses claims would be lower for occasional hotel stays in sitting weeks than for the costs of maintaining a flat in westminster
