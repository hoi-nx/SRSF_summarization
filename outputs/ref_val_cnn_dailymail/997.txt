a 21 - year - old man has undergone the world 's first successful penis transplant
the ' ground - breaking ' operation took south africa surgeons nine hours to perform , and allowed the patient to urinate normally and become sexually active again
three years ago the man , who remains unidentified , was forced to have his penis amputated after a botched circumcision
each year thousands of young men , mainly from the xhosa tribe in south africa , have their foreskins removed in traditional rituals , with experts estimating around 250 losing their penises each year to medical complications
professor frank graewe , another of the hospital 's surgeons who assisted on the operation , said : ' it 's a massive breakthrough
as part of the procedure , doctors transplanted a new penis , donated by a deceased man
the pictures , left and right , show the veins and blood vessels they connected after the nine hour operation , the man recovered rapidly
the picture shows how the nerves of the donated penis were joined to the man 's genital region he does n't necessarily have the psychological capability to process this
' he added that finding a donor organ was one of the main challenges to the procedures , and called the man who donated his penis , and his family , ' heroes '
the procedure was performed as part of a pilot study to develop a penile transplant procedure that could be performed in a typical south africa hospital

this was the first successful operation of its kind , as a previous attempt did not lead to long - term recovery a man in china received a transplant in 2005 but that man asked surgeons to remove the new organ two weeks later
