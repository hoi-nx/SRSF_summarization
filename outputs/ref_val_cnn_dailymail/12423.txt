what 's your company doing this year for march madness ? if your workplace is like most , the answer is a big fat nothing
instead of leveraging the ncaa 's annual tournament and turning it into a genuine bonding experience between colleagues , most organizations pretend it is n't happening
on the surface , ignoring a sporting event that takes place during regular work hours might appear like sound business practice
after all , companies need to generate profit , and it 's hard to generate profit when your employees are huddled around a television , right ? wrong
research has consistently demonstrated that we are more effective at our jobs when we feel attached to the people around us
performance aside , workplace friendships benefit organizations for another reason : employees with richer friendships tend to stay on with their company for longer periods of time
despite these considerable benefits , at most companies , friendships are an afterthought
to motivate employees , managers tend to rely on bonuses , promotions , and salary increases , ignoring the fact that as humans , we all have a basic psychological need for meaningful relationships
yet the research is clear : when we feel valued and respected by those around us , we 're not only more motivated -- we 're also happier , healthier , and more productive
but here 's the truth : while awkward collaborations may spark brief experiences of closeness , they rarely translate into lasting friendships
so what does ? studies suggest three factors are essential to the development of authentic , meaningful friendships : familiarity ( being around the same colleague often ) , similarity ( finding commonalities in your background ) , and self - disclosure ( revealing personal information about yourself every now and then , and having your co-worker do the same )
for many , the ncaa basketball tournament is associated with their experience at college , which leads them to share stories about their past , prompting co-workers to do the same
unlike team - building experiences that compel employees to engage with one another , game - viewing parties position people to connect voluntarily
ogilvy & mather , for example , an international marketing agency based in new york , invites employees to watch tournament games on projection screens in conference rooms and the office cafeteria
here 's one idea : instead of having employees pay an entry fee ( which discourages nonfans from joining in ) , sponsor prizes so that everyone participates
this way , employees have reason to root for one another , fostering a sense of collaboration
as the ncaa tournament tips off this month , organizational leaders would be wise to re-examine their approach to march madness
instead of treating the tournament as a nuisance that prevents employees from working , perhaps it 's time we considered embracing it for what it is : an inexpensive opportunity for bringing our work teams closer together
