oettinger , 41 , had been denied urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son zaki died on train tracks in south london in march 2013 , it was claimed
just three months before her death , she took an overdose while visiting a friend in yorkshire and was ' disappointed ' to have survived , the inquest was told
a care worker treating the accounts assistant from croydon in south london then told her family she needed ' urgent ' home care on her discharge
despite being promised this by mental health bosses , ms oettinger was then told the home team could not provide psychiatric help , the inquest heard
an inquest into the two deaths at croydon coroner 's court today heard her mother carol oettinger describe the family 's battle to secure the right therapy for her daughter
she told the inquest her daughter went alone to visit friend frances felt in yorkshire to ' work on her anxiety ' in december 2012 but took an overdose
in a statement given to the inquest mr paul willison said he contacted health workers in croydon with his concerns and said : ' [ they ] said there was a home treatment team that covered oettinger 's locality
' however her mother told the court that on her daughter 's return to london , a psychiatric nurse said this was not the case
mrs oettinger told the inquest : ' we said oettinger had just come out of intensive care , paul willison had faxed his concerns through saying she needed urgent treatment
' i do n't really know how the home treatment team ( htt ) works in rotherham , there is a suggestion that there is some psychological treatment that they could give
' however in tamworth road in london the htt is not experienced in providing psychiatric therapy
' in rotherham they said the htt is necessary because of the skills of the team , but the same may not be same in london
' i also suspect that the htt threshold in rotherham might be much lower than in london
in a statement the social worker told the inquest that he had advised ms oettinger was given home treatment and checked that it would be available in croydon
after seeing ms oettinger on return from yorkshire dr rao advised that she was assigned a ' care coordinator ' to be provided through the london and maudsley nhs foundation trust
' the immediate problem presented to me was how is she doing to be safe , ' she told the inquest
it was not until then that dr rao finally made a recommendation that the nurse be assigned as her care coordinator
' in september 2012 , the family arranged to see a private psychiatrist who diagnosed an anxiety disorder , but they were told that they would have to wait up to 18 months for therapy sessions on the nhs
the mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at riddlesdown station , before their deaths her condition deteriorated to the point she had to leave work and could not look after her son properly , the inquest heard
i looked after zaki , even though oettinger was ill she would give him a kiss in the morning and at night when he went to bed , ' her mother told the inquest
' the inquest heard how ms oettinger threatened to hurt herself on two other occasions with a knife and was referred to a specialist psychologist with the london and maudsley nhs foundation trust in october 2012
the inquest heard a harrowing account from train driver patrick cusak who spotted her jump onto tracks with zaki as he neared the station , just yards from the home they shared with her mother in croydon
