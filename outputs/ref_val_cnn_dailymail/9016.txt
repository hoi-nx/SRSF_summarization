usually when president obama steps out on st patrick 's day , it 's his brilliant green tie which steals the show
but today another accessory won the day - the enormous new ' smart watch ' festooning the commander - in - chief 's wrist
obama was seen today wearing the hefty item - a fitbit surge device - as he walked around washington , d.c. and met with ireland prime minister enda kenny , and later lunched with congressmen on capitol hill
the surge model is the largest and most sophisticated fitbit model , and sells for around $ 250
in a february interview with re / code , he seemed torn between getting a fitbit and an apple watch
' the testing had evidently begun by tuesday , when obama prominently wore the device for his public engagements
