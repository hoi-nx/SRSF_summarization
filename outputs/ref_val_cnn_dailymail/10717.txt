two neighbouring ancient craters thought to be have been formed by the same impact event are now thought to have been created by two separate asteroids
while both had been thought to be 285 million years old , it now appears one of the craters is actually 450 million years old but , by chance , was created in almost exactly the same spot
its thought the east crater asteroid impacted a marine environment during the ordovician period , 490 million years ago
the west crater was created in the permian period 285 million years ago and impacted the landmass pangaea researchers from the university of western australia say the clearwater lakes in canada were formed by two separate events in a ' pure coincidence '
the remarkable finding , if confirmed , has important implications for other so - called ' doublet ' craters in the solar system , previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time
for example , the great ordovician biodiversification event , which saw an explosion in the number of animal species around 470 million years ago , has been linked to frequent impact events at the time
the clearwater lakes in canada are a pair of lakes labelled as west and east
in the original theory , a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago
but the researchers say the original methods used to date the east lake , by measuring amounts of argon - 40 , were inaccurate
upon analysing new samples at the site , they found a maximum age of 460 million years , far older than the west clearwater lake , which is 285 million years old
in the original theory , a binary asteroid - two asteroids orbiting a common centre of mass - struck the ground simultaneously 285 million years ago , but that is now believed to be inaccurate the remarkable finding , if confirmed , has important implications for other so - called ' doublet ' craters in the solar system , previously thought to be formed by binary or multiple rocks impacting at the same time
this part of canada - referred to as laurentia - had less land 460 million years ago than it did 285 million years ago , when waters receded , forming the landmass called pangaea
