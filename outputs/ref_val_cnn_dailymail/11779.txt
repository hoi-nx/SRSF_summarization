he is the latest object of female lust from caithness to cornwall â a heartbroken hero who is all brooding desire and smouldering good looks
and aidan turner , the new ross poldark , certainly has plenty of tumultuous romantic experiences to draw on
perhaps , given his good looks , a rather swashbuckling love life is to be expected : gossips in dublin insist that he was once â when between serious girlfriends â seen leaving a nightclub in the city with no fewer than three attentive females in tow
his first girlfriend was actress india whisker , a pretty blonde whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in dublin
she was followed by another actress , brunette charlene mckenna
aidan turner then fell for lenora crichlow , his co-star in the tv series being human â from 2009 he played a vampire and she a ghost
then in 2011 , he and lenora crichlow parted ways and he decided to quit the series while she stayed on
love is love , it âs the purest and rawest thing we have in life
â aidan turner was also romantically involved with charlene mckenna ( pictured )
their romance is still going strong after three years , but aidan turner admits that they are often separated by work
he explained of the periods of separation : â it âs all we âve ever known [ as a couple ] and it makes for good times when we meet up again and maybe have a month straight when we âre both unemployed and watching movies every day
â aidan turner ( left ) also dated lenora crichlow ( right ) from 2009 to 2011 , after they met on the tv series being human
he later decided to quit the series while she stayed on aidan turner is quietly bowled over by his sudden fame
in the show , aidan turner is british army officer ross poldark , who returns to cornwall following the american war of independence to find his father dead , the family âs tin mine in ruins and his sweetheart , elizabeth , engaged to his cousin
aidan turner ( left ) is seen with ex-girlfriend actress india whisker ( right ) whom he met in 2004 while at drama school in dublin since the opening episode on sunday , there has been praise for the ensemble acting and the script â but mostly for how dishy the lead looks in a pair of britches
â that is very funny , â aidan turner told me this week
â i can reveal that aidan turner is contracted to be in a further five series of poldark , should the bbc make the obvious decision to make more
aidan turner ( pictured as ross poldark ) has been bowled over by his sudden rise to fame and definitely does n't consider himself a sex symbol one of those watching poldark on sunday was his old drama teacher sutton , director of dublin âs gaiety school of acting , who told me : â i settled down in front of the telly like a child waiting to meet father christmas
â mr sutton , who counts hollywood star colin farrell among his previous students , puts aidan turner âs success down to talent , hard work and good manners â all three of which gaiety school of acting students are taught
the son of eileen , an accountant at a local carpet store , and pat , an electrician , there is no acting background in aidan turner âs family â he had nât even been to a play before he went to drama college
â smouldering : aiden turner with co-star eleanor tomlinson in poldark dumped : in the bbc series , poldark ( aidan turner ) is dumped by his former love elizabeth ( heida reed ) his great talent at that age was ballroom dancing , and he even represented his country
tommy shaughnessy , president of dancesport federation of irish , told me : â i used to teach aidan turner
aidan turner had no idea what he wanted to do after school
â i did nât know anything about this world at all , â said aidan turner
â before he started acting , aidan turner ( pictured with eleanor tomlinson in poldark ) , represented irish in ballroom dancing competitions across the country and internationally he graduated in 2004 , and had various theatre roles before getting a break in an irish television medical drama , the clinic , in 2008
she said : â you âd better not mess this up ! â â do n't mess this up ! aidan turner had n't heard of poldark but was warned not to mess the job up by his mother perhaps we can forgive his ignorance as , since he âs still only 31 , he was nât even born when the original seventies tv version aired
â in aidan turner âs case , the â job â seems to be the play the role of newly minted national sex symbol â and he âs doing it to perfection .
