isis ' recent video showing a child shooting a man whom the extremist group claimed was an israeli spy is the latest example of how the militants exploit children in their propaganda
as isis encourages foreign fighters to bring their families into the parts of syria and iraq where it imposes its brutal rule , the catalog of children taking part in shocking acts is grim and growing
in a video the jihadist group released in january , a boy with long hair wearing a black sweater and military fatigue pants appears to shoot two men in the back of the head
those examples reflect a broader effort to induct children into isis ' campaign of violence
isis has also promoted videos of young boys training as fighters , some of them wearing the militants ' black masks , holding bullets and waving the group 's flags
the jihadist movement has called the boys the " cubs of the caliphate , " a reference to the way isis fighters refer to one another as " lions
human rights watch has said that isis and other extremist groups " have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions
" the united nations has said there are confirmed reports of children as young as 12 undergoing military training
one 15 - year - old boy told cnn in november how he was regularly strapped into an explosive vest and handed a pistol , an ak-47 and a radio to stand guard at an isis base in syria
another boy told cnn last year that isis forced his father to send him to one of its children 's camps in northern syria when he was just 13
the militant group , also known as isis and the islamic state , is aggressively using social media to try to lure more young people to join its ranks
" there 's no question what we 're combating with isis 's propaganda machine is something we have not seen before , " u.s. state department spokeswoman jen psaki told cnn last month .
