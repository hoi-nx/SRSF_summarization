keepers at taronga western plains zoo are looking for help to name one of their latest additions to their family of otters
the oriental small - clawed otter pups were born on january 8 at the zoo located in dubbo in nsw ' central west
' both emiko and pocket are very hands - on parents and have been displaying ideal nurturing behaviours , ' keeper anderson said
' keepers will name two of the otters , while they have enlisted the help of the public to name the third the birth of this litter comes off the success of last year 's first litter as part of the zoo 's breeding program
' oriental small - clawed otters are a social species and live in large families so it is anticipated that the family will remain together for the near future
this is the second litter for emiko who had her first in january last year as part of the breeding program a statement from the zoo said emiko and pocket were ' exceptional parents ' and were taking ' great care of their offspring right now , they are still spending a lot of time in their den and rarely seen at the zoo
