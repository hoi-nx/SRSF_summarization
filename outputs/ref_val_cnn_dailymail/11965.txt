so , to settle the argument of which is the greatest premier league since it started in 1992 - 93 , sportsmail has studied every pfa team of the year to find out which players are most highly - regarded by their peers
legendary united goalkeeper peter schmeichel was selected in only one pl all - star team ( 1993 ) , as was dennis bergkamp ( 1998 ) and therefore are well short of being considered for the greatest xi. peter schmeichel famously saves a penalty from dennis bergkamp in 1999 ... but neither make the all - time xi eric cantona and paul scholes were n't voted for often enough either while gianfranco zola â regarded as one of the best players in chelsea 's history â was never picked in a pfa side
likewise , stars like luis suarez and gareth bale performed too briefly on the premier league stage to be chosen as often as other players
based on the number of times they were voted for by their fellow professionals in the pfa premier team of the season , here is the best xi over the last 23 years
the premier league all time xi edwin van der sar ( pfa team 2007 , 2009 , 2011 ) played in premier league for : fulham , united sir alex ferguson compared the dutchman 's influence with peter schmeichel 's after he helped united return to the top following a period of dominance by jose mourinho 's chelsea
edwin van der sar celebrates with his united team - mates after beating chelsea in may 2011 gary neville ( 1996 , 1997 , 1998 , 1999 , 2005 , 2007 ) played for : united the heart of united 's team that dominated english football for two decades and part of the 1999 treble - winning side
the right - back for united and england was the most voiceferous member of the famed class of 92 and since retirement has become a hugely influential figure both as a television pundit and england coach gary neville was a stalwart of the united side and was named six times in the pfa xi rio ferdinand ( 2002 , 2005 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2013 ) played for : west ham , leeds united , united , qpr a skilful centre half in the continental mould , rio ferdinand started at west ham but was first voted into the premier league team in 2002 after an excellent season at leeds united
he became an integral part of united 's success in the 2000s culminating in their premier league - european cup double in 2008
nemanja vidic ( left ) and rio ferdinand formed a formidable partnership at the heart of united 's defence ashley cole ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2011 ) played for : arsenal , chelsea considered by many the greatest english left back of all time with more than 100 caps , ashley cole won the premier league title with arsenal and chelsea with fans in north london not forgiving him for moving to stamford bridge
ashley cole ( left ) gets the better of cristiano ronaldo during the 2004 - 05 season cristiano ronaldo ( 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 ) played for : united hard to believe he was only in the premier league for six years such was the impact he made
he was voted into the pfa team for four seasons in a row before he signed for real madrid for a then world - record fee of Â£ 80million
cristiano ronaldo treated old trafford to a series of stepovers on his debut and by 2008 was voted world player of the year , the only time that honour has gone to someone in the premier league after michael owen in 2001
cristiano ronaldo was named world player of the year during his outstanding united career steven gerrard ( 2001 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 , 2014 ) played for : liverpool indisputably the best player of the premier league era not to have won the championship , steven gerrard is nonetheless regarded as the greatest player in liverpool 's history alongside kenny dalglish and was man of the match when he led their comeback in istanbul to win a fifth european cup in 2005
steven gerrard in his prime was the ultimate box - to - box midfielder , stopping goals , creating goals and scoring goals , often spectacular ones
no player has been named in the pfa xi more times than liverpool captain steven gerrard ( centre ) vieira ( 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 ) played for : arsenal , manchester city was voted into the pfa team for six consecutive years between 1999 and 2004 , an unprecedented spell of dominance in the premier league era
patrrick vieira ( right ) gets in the team ahead of his great rival at united , roy keane ( left ) ryan giggs ( 1993 , 1998 , 2001 , 2002 , 2007 , 2009 ) played for : united statistically the greatest player in the premier league , with a record number of titles ( 13 ) and appearances ( 632 ) , ryan giggs was named six times in the pfa team spanning a period of 16 years
ryan giggs back in 1993 , when he was entered in his first pfa xi , 16 years before his last alan shearer ( 1993 , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 2003 ) played for : blackburn , newcastle the premier league 's record goalscorer with 260 â more than 70 goals ahead of anyone else , alan shearer won the championship with blackburn and became the only premier league player to also be the world 's most expensive player when he signed for hometown club newcastle for Â£ 15million having just finished as leading goalscorer at euro 96 for england
. and an unlikely all - star xi. these players all made the premier league team of the season on one occasion : tim flowers ; david bardsley , ugo ehiogu , thomas vermaelen , stig inge bjornebye ; nani , scott parker , tim sherwood , harry kewell ; emmanuel adebayor , chris sutton
