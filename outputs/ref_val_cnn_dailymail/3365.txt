laser beams could help detect cervical cancer at an early stage , say researchers from china
the way the cancer cells react to the light means they can then be picked up on an ultrasound scan
the way the cancer cells react to the light from the laser beams means they can then be picked up on an ultrasound scan more than 3,000 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the uk , with around 1,000 women dying from it
cervical smear tests are used to screen for abnormal cells â and the results may lead to a physical examination ( where the cells are examined in situ using a microscope ) and then a biopsy
a ct or mri scan is performed only if the biopsy suggests there is cancer
although cervical screening â offered to all women over 25 â has led to a large drop in the numbers affected by cervical cancer and in deaths , lesions can be missed and visual examinations can also lead to unnecessary biopsies
the new technology , known as photoacoustic imaging , requires neither a biopsy nor a smear test
this is because of changes in cancerous tissue such as the formation of new , abnormal blood vessels and fewer collagen fibres ( a tough , connective tissue )
cervical smear tests are used to screen for abnormal cells â and the results may lead to a physical examination ( where the cells are examined in situ using a microscope ) and then a biopsy the cancerous tissue can then be picked up on an ultrasound scan because the extra energy absorbed from the light is converted into heat , which causes the cells to expand and affects the way soundwaves bounce back to the scanner , creating an image of the cells with cancerous changes
fiona osgun , cancer research uk âs health information officer , said : â this small study is at a very early stage and we are a long way from knowing if this technique could diagnose cervical cancer
