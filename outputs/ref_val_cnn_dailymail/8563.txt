he said : ' to charge Â£ 10 is just unfair because you have nothing better to do but to watch tv while you are in hospital
' hard working tax payers are forking out Â£ 10 per day to watch tv from their hospital bed when they have nothing better to do , but criminals pay a small fraction of the same amount - when they 're supposed to be locked up
i understand they have costs to meet but i would be shocked if it costs as much as Â£ 10 a day
