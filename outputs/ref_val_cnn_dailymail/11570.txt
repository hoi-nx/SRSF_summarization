the great religious fissure between sunni and shia muslims that dominates the middle east has erupted into open conflict in yemen , the region âs poorest country , threatening to engulf the entire area in a wider war
in a dramatic escalation of the stakes , a sunni coalition of arab states led by saudi launched airstrikes against iran - backed shia houthi rebels who have swept south through the country
but the far more pressing concern is whether we are now seeing a proxy war in yemen between its neighbour saudi , the leading sunni power , and iran , the leading shia houthi power , explode into a regional conflict that could sweep us all up in its wake
saudi warplanes targeted shia houthi positions in the country âs capital sanaâa killing 18 civilians and injuring many more
britain and america supported the saudi - led military intervention in yemen as the coalition deployed 100 fighter jets and amassed 150,000 soldiers to fight in the region
anticipating the worsening situation , britain elite soldiers â in yemen to train government troops to fight al qaeda , which has established its most dangerous branch in the country â pulled out last friday
s. to evacuate their remaining military personnel as the country teetered on the brink of civil war between the internationally recognised government of president hadi and the shia houthi rebels
the yemen president , who is backed by the u.n. , was forced to flee his palace in the former britain colonial port of aden on the southern coast and there were reports last night that he had left by boat for the saudi capital , riyadh
just 35 miles to the north , shia houthi rebels had seized al anad air base , which until recently had been used by america counter-terrorism forces to fight terrorists
an armed member of shia houthi militia stands over the rubble of houses which were allegedly destroyed by a saudi air strike in sana'a , yemen a fierce , tribal society , yemen has long been torn apart by tribal conflicts
but the recent shia houthi advances have proved too much for saudi , whose primary aim is to re-establish order in yemen
it amassed a formidable coalition â egypt , jordan , sudan , morocco , pakistan , united arab emirates , qatar , kuwait and egypt â of sunni - led states and sent in its fighter jets to send a powerful message to iran : stop meddling in arab affairs
nothing happens in lebanon , for instance , without the approval of the iranian - backed shia houthi militia hizbollah , which also provides syria âs beleaguered president assad with his light infantry
shia houthi fighters manning a heavy machine gun fixed on the back of a pick - up guard a rally protesting saudi - led airstrikes for its part , iran has condemned the air strikes
what if iran took over much of iraq , whose government and population is largely shia houthi as well ? would the saudi stand for that ? and if a shia houthi government succeeds in yemen , then would nât saudi âs own downtrodden shia houthi population , some 10 - 15 per cent of them in the kingdom âs oil - rich eastern province , want some independence ? the western response to this chaos is understandably hesitant
washington is unsure whether iranian strategy is really to establish proxy shia houthi governments all over the region or simply to use the shia houthi in yemen to taunt saudi and pacify the country âs own hardliners
we now have a bizarre â and potentially very dangerous â situation in which america warplanes are providing air cover for iranian - backed militias in iraq in a joint effort against isis , while 1,200 miles to the south in yemen , the america are helping saudi pilots bomb shia houthi insurgents supported by iran
