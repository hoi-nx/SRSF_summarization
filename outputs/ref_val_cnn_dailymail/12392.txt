this weekend marked the official opening of " fish in the dark , " the broadway debut of larry david of " seinfeld " and " curb " fame
that 's because larry david has a huge built - in audience for his unique brand of humor , which " curb " fans know to be as abrasive as sea salt and as astringent as lemon , unyielding in the face of social niceties , epic humiliation or even common human decency
it 's polarizing , and the poles are pretty clearly drawn : by and large , fans of larry david 's work tend to loudly proclaim that as long as abuse is sprayed pari passu -- e.g. , proportionately in all directions -- no one should take offense
when a group of affluent white protagonists in an almost exclusively white " new york " behave badly toward a handful of cartoonish parodies of working - class ethnic nobodies ( a pretty fair synopsis of many " seinfeld " episodes ) , it 's hilarious if you belong to the former category
so it 's not entirely surprising that some of the whispered early concerns with " fish " related to the character of fabiana , the puerto rican maid of the late patriarch of larry david 's fictional family , the drexels
the naap , a nonprofit theater company that produces works from the traditional broadway canon featuring all - asian american casts , had announced its next production would be a big - budget , asian american adaptation of jerome kern and oscar hammerstein ii 's " showboat , " to be developed and directed by broadway wunderkind tommy tune
the problem , as asian american actor and blogger quill immediately called out , is that unlike naap 's prior projects , which have included shows such as " oliver ! " and " carousel , " " showboat " is set in the deep south , among the laborers and performers working on and about the cotton blossom , a paddleboat theater offering entertainment to audiences up and down the mississippi
asian american were not recovering from being ripped from their homeland and bound in chains due to the color of their skin
naap 's all - asian american " showboat " would seem to be not very different from the public theater 's present production of " hamilton , " featuring a multiracial set of american founding fathers -- including puerto rican author and composer lin-manuel miranda as the titular hamilton and african americans actor leslie odom jr. as his rival , aaron burr
having actors of color play characters written for white actors , who are cast in 79 % of all broadway roles ( by contrast , asian american and hispanic are cast in just 3 % each and african americans in 14 % ) , is an act of disruptive defiance
could naap have weathered the spectacle of asian american performers speaking in southern black dialect , performing a plot that 's entirely dependent on black history ? could an asian steve have cut an julie 's hand , sucking her blood , then declared defiantly to an asian american sheriff that if julie was a " mulatto , " so was he , because he now had " black blood " in him ? after a contentious town hall , in which numerous other performers of varied race and background expressed their vehement doubts , the asian american theatrical community , and ultimately naap as well , decided it could n't
but what , by contrast , of " fish " ? the reality is that fabiana ( performed by rosie perez more or less as rosie perez ) does n't stand out as offensive when compared with the rest of the play 's characters ; for that matter , there 's nothing inherently hispanic about the role , which , if the show had an unlimited run , could easily be recast as asian american , black or white , losing very little in the process
by contrast , nearly all of the rest of the cast fit familiar comedic portrayals of jewish family members -- most intensely so , the neurotic protagonist , norman ( performed by larry david himself more or less as larry david )
