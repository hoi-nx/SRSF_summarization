have you ever read through a particularly expletive - laden passage in a book and felt the language was a bit too rich for your tastes ? if so , you might be interested in clean reader which censors swear words from ebooks - and allows children to enjoy works of literature that contain profanity
the app replaces certain words that might be deemed r - rated with more friendly alternatives , but one author has derided it as encouraging ' suppression '
an idaho - based couple has released a censoring app for ios and android
called clean reader it deletes certain swear words from books
alternatives are then suggested when the user taps on the deleted word
shown is an excerpt from gone girl , where ' sh * * * * ' becomes ' crappy ' the app is available now for free on both ios and android devices and was developed by couple jared and kirsten maughan from twin falls in idaho
lady chatterley by d. h. lawrence before : â i do nât want to f * * * you at all
â after : â i do nât want to [ freak ] you at all
when a book is opened , readers can switch between â clean â , â cleaner â or â squeaky clean â settings
the lowest setting only blocks â major swear words , â according to clean reader , which includes â the f - word â
the â cleaner â setting blocks slightly more words , while the highest setting â is the most restrictive setting and will block the most profanity from a book including some hurtful racial terms
â in the books , deleted words are covered up with a grey box , removing them from view
for example , in an excerpt from best - selling novel gone girl , a censored sentence reads : â the girl is one step ahead of me in everything , even [ crappy ] luck
â in another example , a segment of d. h. lawrence âs 1928 novel lady chatterley reads , in â squeaky clean â mode : â i do nât want to [ freak ] you at all
' the famous intro to irvine welsh âs 1993 novel trainspotting , meanwhile , reads : â choose sitting oan a couch watching mind - numing and spirit - crushing game shows , stuffing [ freaking ] junk food intae yir mooth
users can pick between ' clean ' , ' cleaner ' and ' squeaky clean '
the lowest setting blocks ' major ' swear words , and the highest blocks all profanity
alternatives for the deleted words are suggested when reading
