the us military âs defense advance research projects agency says they may have a method to stop all infectious diseases - including ebola
by encoding rna and dna in a specific way , darpa say a person could simply go into a shop and get an injection to protect them against a disease
this could be used to prevent mass outbreaks in affected areas
us military 's darpa has developed a method to stop infectious diseases
it involves encoding rna and dna with instructions for antibodies
a person could then be injected with the antibodies at a pharmacy ( stock image shown )
this enables a person 's cells to fight an infectious disease â we âre going to take the genetic code and put it into a format where you go to your drug store or doctor and get a shot in the arm , â said darpa programme manager dan wattendorf at an event in san francisco , reported fusion
â the method works by creating powerful antibodies from survivors of an infectious disease
â instructions â on how to make these antibodies are then encoded into rna and dna , which are injected into people who might come into contact with the disease
their cells then start creating the antibodies , protecting them from catching the potentially dangerous disease
antibodies are typically grown in large vats of mammal cells or in some cases , tobacco plants , such as us pharmaceutical company mapp biopharmaceutical 's experimental ebola treatment zmapp
experts say the method , if proven to be safe and effective , would be faster and cheaper than conventional drug production and could potentially be used to treat illnesses such as seasonal flu , malaria and ebola

' darpa has awarded emory up to Â£ 7.3 million ( $ 10.8 million ) over three years to direct the project
testing in people could begin within two years , with the goal of having a better weapon for the next outbreak - whatever it may be .
