ford 's flying ability was called into question in an official report following his first aviation crash , daily mail online can reveal
the hollywood star , who was rushed to hospital after crashing a vintage plane in venice , california on thursday , also slammed a helicopter into a riverbed back in 1999
it is not believed that ford , 72 , is to blame for his latest - and what is his third - aviation incident at penmar near santa monica airport , with early reports suggesting engine failure is at fault
but an official report into ford 's october 1999 accident , obtained by daily mail online , reveals it was caused by ' the pilot 's delay in adding power during a power - on recovery '
ford had flown the helicopter from van nuys airport in los angeles 45 miles northwest towards santa clarita when he hit trouble

the flight instructor said that when he saw the pilot was late adding power , he attempted to correct the situation but was unsuccessful
the official ntsb determines the probable cause ( s ) of this accident as follows : the pilot 's delay in adding power during a power - on recovery from an autorotation , which resulted in a hard landing and rollover
source : official ntsb ford was practicing ' auto rotations ' - an emergency landing technique that simulates engine failure
the unidentified flying instructor who was aboard with the actor was forced to take over the controls and try to level the helicopter but he was unable to do so and the aircraft came crashing down into the lake piru riverbed near santa clarita and flipped over
coincidentally the helicopter was registered to mg aviation â the same firm to which the 1942 vintage plane involved in ford 's latest crash is registered to
the official report , which does not name ford or his instructor , states : ' on october 23 , 1999 , at 1115 hours pacific daylight time , a bell 206-l4 , n36r , landed hard and rolled over in the lake piru riverbed near santa clarita , california
the official ntsb concluded that the accident was caused by , ' the pilot 's delay in adding power during a power - on recovery from an autorotation , which resulted in a hard landing and rollover
' ford was not named in the official report but its timing and circumstances were identical to a report at the time by the respected los angeles times that he had been involved in a helicopter crash
seasoned aviator : ford , who has been flying planes since the 1960s , was the only person in the plane at the time of the crash ford crashed into the penmar golf course ( left ) after appearing to veer off course from the runway ( right ) in order to avoid homes in between witnesses described how the veteran actor was bleeding profusely from his face and he was rushed to hospital in a ' critical ' condition but this was soon downgraded
fellow aviators have come out in praise of the star for managing to navigate the vintage plane away from the nearby residential area and on to an empty part of the golf course , with one experienced pilot stating ' everything he did was perfect ' .
