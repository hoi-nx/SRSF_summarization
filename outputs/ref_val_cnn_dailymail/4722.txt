agonising wait : catherine , 32 , who is 26 weeks pregnant , wo n't know if the abortion drug has affected her baby until she is born it was the heart - stopping moment that every mother - to - be dreads
a routine scan to determine catherine âs due date revealed her longed - for second child was dead in her womb
numb and bewildered , she was told she could miscarry naturally or have an abortion
she and husband andrew were distraught
â i âd gone along expecting to see a baby on the scan , â she recalls
â reluctantly , the couple agreed to an induced abortion and catherine took medication to start the process
two days later , after a bout of heavy bleeding , catherine returned to salford royal hospital to complete the abortion
though thrilled , the couple now face an agonising wait until their daughter is born , fearing she will have long - term health problems as a result of the medication that was intended to induce the abortion
to make matters worse , doctors have told them that the heavy bleeding catherine suffered could have been a miscarriage of a possible twin â killed by the procedure
as catherine and andrew struggle to understand how it could have happened , and what it could mean for them , the nhs hospital has launched an urgent investigation
the couple have decided to speak of their experience in the hope that hospitals will ensure they perform a second scan with a different sonographer if it is suspected a baby has died in the womb
â to say this has ruined my pregnancy would be an understatement , â says laboratory manager catherine , 32 , who is now 26 weeks pregnant and already has a son thomas , two
â in hindsight we believe a scan should have been carried out before i took the pill to double - check the diagnosis that the baby had died
â yesterday , holding hands with her plasterer husband andrew , also 32 , at their home in walkden , manchester , catherine told how they had desperately wanted a second child
as her periods had been irregular and catherine was unsure how many weeks pregnant she was , her midwife suggested she had a routine â dating â ultrasound scan and referred her to salford royal hospital
however , within minutes of doing the scan the sonographer told catherine there was a problem
during a routine scan , medics told catherine her child had died in the womb and that she should start an induced abortion , but the baby survived the process

then two days later she would return to the hospital for the final stage , which would involve a second drug , misoprostol , to bring on contractions and expel what remained of the pregnancy
the evening after taking the mifepristone , she began to experience heavy bleeding , but thought it was part of the process
to check the mifepristone had worked , catherine underwent another scan , before taking the misoprostol
â shaking , catherine rang andrew who hurried to the hospital
â a consultant came in and said it was our decision , but due to the possible harm our baby may have suffered from the pill , it was still an option to continue with the abortion
â doctors explained that , as the drug acts by shearing off the embryo from the uterus , they could not guarantee a miscarriage would nât happen in the coming days or weeks
â a spokesman for salford royal hospital ( pictured ) apologised for the error and launched a probe into the incident since then , catherine has imagined every little twinge is a miscarriage
â jack sharp , executive director at salford royal hospital , said : â we again apologise unreservedly to mrs catherine for the error and the distress this has undoubtedly caused
