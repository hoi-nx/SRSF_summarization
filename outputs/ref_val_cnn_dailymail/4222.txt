victoria evans , now 28 , was just two years old when she experienced her first beating at the hands of her adoptive mother , spry
but instead of laughing off the mischievous toddler 's prank , she ' went mad ' and insisted that the little girl to eat the contents of one of the cans , regardless of what was inside
spry 's response ? instead of a hug , she forced the child to eat the vomit as well
the incident heralded what would turn into more than 19 years of abuse at the hands of a woman described as ' britain 's most sadistic mother '
victoria , and her siblings christopher and alloma , were subjected to a catalogue of appalling abuse at their foster mother 's hands , while her own biological daughter judith and adopted daughter charlotte , were pampered and well - cared for
now , all three children have spoken out for the first time and appear in the latest episode of britain 's darkest taboos which will be screened just months after spry 's release from prison
spry , who was initially jailed for 14 years for her crimes in 2007 , first had the tariff reduced to 12 years by the high court and was released last summer after serving just half of her sentence
depraved : spry , pictured left after her arrest , meted out horrific abuse to her children
appalling : one of the cruel injuries inflicted on the children by twice - married spry in a cruel twist , the evil foster mother was rehomed close to the scene of her crimes - and within a few miles of her victims own homes
â why do criminals have more rights than their victims ? she has served her punishment but mine will never leave me , ' says mrs victoria evans
' spry 's crimes began shortly after she was given approval by social services to become a foster mother
ruined : spry , who was tied to a van and dragged around a field by spry , calls her a ' psycho ' shocking : as a toddler , victoria was made to eat catfood and then her own vomit when she threw it up beaten : like her brother and sister , alloma gilbert was viciously beaten with ' a variety of sticks ' by evil spry ' she thought i was demonised or that i was working in satan 's name and that we were the devil 's offspring , ' says spry
' as the abuse escalated , spry began to haunt the children even when they were at school , insisting that they tell no one what was happening to them and ordering them to present a happy appearance to teachers
' she told me not to tell the teachers anything , and that she would know , ' explains alloma gilbert
' but their troubles , which included being forced to stand against the wall for hours on end and eat branflakes soaked with linseed oil , were about to become much worse
concerned that teachers were becoming suspicious , spry decided to relocate to an isolated farm on the edge of the village of eckington
' victoria and i lived in an old mobile home , and it had no electric , had no water , ' recalls mr spry
road to recovery : all three children have written books detailing their abuse at spry 's hands ' there was very little food , and i used to eat chicken pellets to try and survive
but the worst beating of all was dealt out to mr spry who , as a 10 - year - old boy , was tied by the feet to spry 's van and dragged at speed across a recently ploughed field
brave : alloma initially had to be persuaded to testify against spry but says her life is better now sandpapered : victoria , whose face was once sandpapered by spry , escaped aged 18 ' there is no way to describe how horrific that was
' for mrs victoria evans , the worst incident came at the age of 14 , when she and spry 's daughters charlotte and judith were involved in a fatal car accident
shockingly , when mrs victoria evans was offered the chance of physiotherapy , spry turned it down and forced her to stay in a wheelchair for almost two years - even though she was able to walk
' but the years of abuse were drawing to a close and when mrs victoria evans was offered a job as a babysitter , she saw a chance to escape
' eventually , she revealed what had happened to friends and although feeling guilty about the possibility of her foster mother getting into trouble , agreed to tell the police
her siblings christopher and alloma , although initially reluctant , agreed to testify against spry and in april 2007 , the evil foster mother was jailed for 14 years
so shocking was the scale of her crimes , judge simon darwell-smith told spry that her 19 - year reign of terror was one of the ' worst i 've seen in 40 years '
' i 've heard her being called britain 's most sadistic mother , and while that is true , that would seem to suggest she was a mother at all , and to me , she does n't even deserve that , ' says mr spry
