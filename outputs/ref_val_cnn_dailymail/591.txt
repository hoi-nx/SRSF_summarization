colorado 's legal marijuana is three times stronger than it was a generation ago and is often contaminated with heavy metals , pesticides , fungus and bacteria , a startling chemical analysis of 600 samples has found
additionally , modern pot has very low levels of cannabidiol , or cbd , the compound that medical marijuana advocates say gives the drug its healing properties
the findings come from andy lafrate , a ph.d. chemist and the founder of colorado testing firm charas scientific
colorado only requires marijuana dispensaries to test and advertise the levels of thc - the compound in pot that gets user ' high
children who are given marijuana to control epilepsy can actually be worse off because they 're being given strains of the drug with virtually no cbd and high levels of thc , which can trigger seizures , he added
andy lafrate 's tests used liquid chromatography , a highly accurate method of chemical analysis that separates out the component parts of a substance
andy lafrate says more testing is needed on the effects of contaminants on people who consume marijuana he found that colorado 's legal marijuana has thc levels of 18 to 20percent
marijuana from the 1980s usually had thc levels of less than 10percent - meaning modern pot is two to three times stronger than it was a generation ago
additionally , much of colorado 's marijuana is contaminated with high levels of fungus spores and bacteria
many samples also contained traces of cancer - causing heavy metals , which come from the plants growing in contaminated soil
because they are concentrated doses , they can also contain very high levels of heavy metals and pesticides - as the thc level is dialed up , so are the levels of background contaminants
