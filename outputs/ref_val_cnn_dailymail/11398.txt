dramatic : the stand - off saw the antelope refuse to back down when the beast approached her calf - and at one point even clashed horns with it coming together : the antelope , ramina , kept her baby phoenix behind her at all times as she charged at the massive rhino , njanu keepers say ramina , a scimitar oryx antelope , was being overly defensive of her baby on her first outing in the park following a difficult birth
â taking him on : keepers say ramina , a scimitar oryx antelope , was being overly defensive of her baby in the park following a difficult birth coming together : the calf , who lives at longleat safari park in wiltshire , was brought back to life by mouth - to - mouth resuscitation after birth but he added : â happily phoenix made a full recovery and that was why she was allowed out in to the park properly
come on then : the scimitar oryx - oryx dammah in latin - gets its name from its scimitar - shaped horn which can measure up to 5ft in length it 's back : originally from north africa , the oryx antelope is thought to have gone extinct in the wild in 1999 - due to hunting and loss of habitat the horns are made from hollow bone , so can break off quite easily and do not grow back - making one horned oryx a relatively common occurrence
