carver says he can not defend cisse after admitting the newcastle striker spitting in the face of evans was worse than breaking the leg of an opponent
newcastle will be without their 11 - goal top scorer for the first time at everton on sunday since he was hit with a seven - game ban following the altercation with evans
the manchester united defender was suspended for six matches for his part in the incident , in which he first spat at cisse to provoke the reaction from the magpies striker
newcastle 's cisse and manchester united 's evans squared up to each other at st james ' park cisse has been banned for seven games , while evans has received a six game suspension for the altercation there has been a lot of debate in the 10 days since the disgusting clash as to whether or not spitting merited a ban double the length of one for a tackle which could cause serious injury
â when you have played the game it ( spitting ) is worse , yes , â he said
â evans ' actions have been described as ' simply disgusting ' by the fa 's regulatory committee both evans and cisse were charged and banned by the fa for spitting , but cisse admitted the offence cisse âs future on tyneside is now uncertain
despite boasting the best goals - per - minute ratio in the premier league this season , newcastle remain concerned about a lingering knee issue for which he underwent more treatment this week
when asked if the 29 - year - old would be at the club next year , carver said : â it 's a difficult question to answer because i 'm only thinking about the now , and i have n't got him for seven games
â but he scores goals and i do n't think his knee is a big issue
newcastle finished fifth in 2012 but were nearly relegated the following season and cited the rigours of a europa league campaign as reason for their struggle
â ask any of these managers who qualified for europe how it affects your league form - you all start fighting for your lives down the bottom of that league table - it 's not easy , â he said
