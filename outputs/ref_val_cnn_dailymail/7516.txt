it âs nearly time for brook to make an emotional walk to the ring and fight jo jo dan on march 28
he has the world at his feet again and i âm looking at fights against the likes of juan manuel marquez , brandon rios and keith thurman in the summer and then the winner of manny pacquiao and floyd mayweather
but it was so nearly game over for brook
jo jo dan is going to face a fighter in sheffield who has only thought about fighting for the past six months
it has been hard on brook â he won a world title and what was supposed to be his moment has been spent recovering from that attack
brook with his world title in september as he began his recovery from being stabbed in the leg the challenge â and it is a big challenge â will be handling himself in the right manner on the night
but brook is different to normal people
my dad walked over to brook just before he put his gloves , grabbed his arm and said to him : â this is your time , do nât let this moment pass
that is why i will make the biggest fights possible for him if he comes through this next challenge against jo jo dan
i have already made contact with juan manuel marquez âs people and also brandon rios âs representatives
juan manuel marquez is a legend and that would be a huge fight and brandon rios has been a world champion
keith thurman is also keen and a quality fighter
any one of those guys in sheffield in june would be a very big fight
after that , i would love to see brook fight manny pacquiao or floyd mayweather
after those two fight on may 2 , the winner and brook will be the only world champions in the welterweight division
of course , the fight the whole country wants to see is brook versus amir khan
amir khan âs team told us the fight would happen one day but why not on june 13 at wembley ? we ca nât wait forever for them
all brook can do is take care of his own business later this month
brook is putting together his final training preparations before fighting jo jo dan later this month another fight everyone is desperate to see is carl frampton versus scott quigg
talks are underway between me and barry mcguigan âs cyclone promotions , who look after carl frampton
scott quigg is not worried about where the fight is staged or what television channel it is shown on â we just want to make this fight
we can talk about world titles and legacy and exposure but ultimately this is a super fight â and in a super fight it is only right that these two great fighters get the best deal possible financially
if we can all reach an agreement , then i would love to make this fight in june
there is a long way to go but who would nât want to see this fight ? scott quigg ( right ) joins carl frampton in the ring after he beat chris avalos in belfast last month i was disappointed to lose the purse bids for james - dirrell after some long negotiations with dirrell âs team
we are heading for a brilliant battle of hull lightweights this summer
golden boy luke campbell was brilliant again in beating levis morales in hull at the weekend and tommy coyle survived a huge scare against martin gethin on the same card
they are both huge draws in the city and now i am going to make the fight between them for this summer
they are a great mix. tommy coyle âs family is known all over hull â they have a fruit and veg stall in the middle of the city and tommy is full of beans
tommy coyle celebrates his win over martin gethin at the hull arena on march 7 above all else , they are tremendous fighters
many people would have luke campbell as favourite but how can anyone underestimate tommy coyle ? this will be a huge night
