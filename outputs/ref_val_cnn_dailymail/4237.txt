anyone who enjoys reading over someone âs shoulder while on public transport , or indeed looking at their laptop screen , should be aware
the video maker recorded the man via photobooth on his laptop , which he opened and left hidden in the background of his screen the man sitting next to him sits with his arms crossed and with his eyes on the screen
the man puts on a pair of glasses so as to get a better look at the screen , much to the amusement of the filmmaker caught in the act ! the passenger quickly turns away as the man looks around to confront him smiling as he catches him out a further three times , the video maker notes with a caption that the man is pretending to look out of the window even though it is pitch black outside
explaining how he came about filming the man , the video maker wrote on his original upload of the video that he opened up photobooth â an apple mac application that allows you to take pictures and videos â and left it on hidden in the background
