the real - life ' up ' house , which saw its elderly owner refuse to take $ 1million from developers to move out looks set to be demolished by a wrecking ball when it is auctioned off
in 2006 , macefield took a stand against developers by staying in the house in seattle 's ballard neighborhood where she had lived in for almost 60 years despite being offered money to leave so new retail and office space could be created
both she and the 1,000 square foot house became a symbol of standing up to corporate giants after developers were forced to awkwardly build around it
however , ms macefield passed away from pancreatic cancer in june 2008 , leaving the house boarded up and empty
it comes after a friend she left the house to sold it to a company called reach returns , who planned to keep it in tact for a new project
the row with developers came after the neighborhood of ballard , just across salmon bay from seattle , held out against the forces of gentrification until 2000 when developers came knocking
by 2006 , ms macefield 's home stood almost alone , her neighbors long gone , as developers prepared to build ballard blocks , a retail and office development
she was offered $ 1 million in cash for her property , in addition to assistance with housing and healthcare
macefield refused to leave her home of 50 years , and construction began on the development that would end up surrounding her house and garden ms macefield had lived in the house for almost 60 years , having originally moved there in 1952 to take care of her ailing mother
ms macefield never had to leave her home , and she died there aged 86 , leaving the small house sandwiched between a trader joe 's and an l.a. fitness
ironically , she left the house to the supervisor of the very project that had tried to displace her
martin was one of several construction workers that got to know ms macefield , often dropping in to check on her
' as concrete walls began to tower above her home , her fame grew and she earned the grudging respect of the construction workers that would pass by every day macefield never had to leave her home , and she died there aged 86 , leaving the small house sandwiched between a trader joe 's and an l.a. fitness
ms macefield , a very private person , did not like the worldwide attention she received for just wanting to stay put in her home
