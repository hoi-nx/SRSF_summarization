sir jeremy heywood , nicknamed ' sir cover-up ' has overseen a move that will ban civil servants from speaking to journalists without prior approval a ban on civil servants talking to journalists without prior ministerial approval will â intimidate â them into silence , critics said last night
a line has been added to the code , saying : â ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media
the move , which follows a similar clampdown on members of the armed forces talking to the media , has been overseen by cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood , the head of the home civil service
he has been nicknamed â sir cover-up â for preventing the chilcot inquiry into the iraq war from seeing letters and records of phone calls between tony blair and george bush
his influence is such that david cameron is said to have once joked : â remind me , jeremy heywood , do you work for me or do i work for you ? â a source at the cabinet office â which is in charge of the civil service â insisted the move was an attempt to increase ministers â accountability of civil servants in their department
â the public has a right to open and transparent public services , yet this change now requires ministerial authorisation before a civil servant can respond or make any contact with the media â from a prosecutor being asked for comment outside of court , to a job centre manager dealing with a local news story , â he added
