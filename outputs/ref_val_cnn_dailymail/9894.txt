thousands of infertile couples could realise their dreams of becoming parents thanks to a new test that allows ivf treatment to be tailored to a woman 's individual fertility cycle
for the first time , scientists believe they are able to identify the point in a woman 's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant in the womb
there are more than 60,000 ivf cycles performed in the uk each year
meanwhile in the us , 175,000 ivf cycles were performed in 2013 , according to the cdc
there , success rates ranged from 16 to 47 per cent , depending on a woman 's age
experts at the ivi fertility clinic in madrid believe a new test , which identifies the point in a woman 's cycle when there is the greatest chance an embryo will successfully implant , will help thousands of infertile couples realise their dream of becoming parents while the nhs offers the treatment , strict guidelines mean many couples are forced to use private clinics , incurring bills that runs into thousands of pounds
but a team of scientists , led by professor garcia velasco at the ivi fertility clinic in madrid , said they believe failed attempts often happen because an embryo is implanted at the wrong time , missing a woman 's crucial window of fertility
they hope their new study will improve success rates for couples undergoing ivf , after they identified a test which can predict each woman 's individual fertility window
professor garcia-velasco , told mailonline : ' the trial we are currently undertaking is trying to answer if the era test may help all couples from the first day they attend a fertility clinic , to detect endometrial defects
' my hope is that this test will explain why some women do not get pregnant when good quality embryos are transferred , and thus , avoid repeated ivf failure
' the test involves taking a biopsy of a woman 's womb lining
experts then analyse 238 genes , allowing them to determine when the woman 's endometrium - the womb lining - will be most receptive to an implanted embryo
a pilot study of 17 women , who had endured failed ivf attempts , saw nine become pregnant after the test a case report detailing one woman 's experience , followed by a pilot study involving 17 women , showed success rates were significantly improved after using the test
in the pilot study , none of the 17 women had become pregnant despite repeated ( between one and six ) rounds of ivf , when traditional techniques were used
but after the test was used to determine each woman 's window of implantation , nine of the 17 became pregnant and went on to have a baby
during ivf , an egg is surgically removed from a woman 's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory
the fertilised egg , or embryo , is then returned and implanted back into the woman 's womb to grow and develop
embryo transfer is the final part of the treatment process , and as a result women will still have to go through a rigorous treatment programme to reach the point where they may benefit from the new test being trialled by professor garcia velasco
once the woman 's eggs have been collected she is given medication , including progesterone , to help prepare the lining of the womb to receive an embryo
it is at this point that the test being trialled by professor garcia velasco could be used to determine a woman 's opportune fertility window
their case report details how a 39 - year - old woman attended the clinic , reporting she had endured two failed attempts at ivf
the researchers then attempted to diagnose the woman 's window of implantation , using the endometrial receptivity array test ( era )
the team took a biopsy of the woman 's womb lining five days after hormone therapy - the point at which the previous attempt had failed
a pilot study followed with 17 patients taking part
the researchers diagnosed each woman 's window of implantation and instead of routine embryo transfer , each woman underwent implantation according to her cycle
for one of the 17 women , six rounds of ivf had previously failed
after two further rounds of ivf , based on her individual cycle , the woman became pregnant and gave birth to her baby
professor garcia-velasco is now leading a clinical trial of the test , with around 2,500 women who have suffered two or more failed attempts , in more than 10 countries taking part .
