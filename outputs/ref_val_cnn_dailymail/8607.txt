prime minister tony abbott 's chief of staff has come under fire yet again for her controversial decision to ban labor appointments from retaining their positions on government boards
the move by credlin has been derided by the business community as ' unrealistic ' because nearly all of the directors on government boards were employed during labor 's six - years in government
speaking at an australian institute of company directors lunch , chairman of csiro , mckeon confirmed the ban on labor appointees to government boards , claiming he will lose his position when his contract expires in june
' labor was in power for six years
virtually everybody currently serving on the boards of government bodies was either appointed or reappointed while labor was in power , ' mr mckeon said
' if tony abbott persists with his policy , there will be a full clean out of directorships
' mr mckeon , who is also chairman of amp , said the policy was at odds with what the australian institute of company directors and business council of australia subscribed to as good governance
many of them are part of the boards for humanitarian or charitable reasons
but tony abbott 's devotion to credlin is unmoving
the prime minister has defended her time and time again , calling her ' the fiercest political warrior i 've ever worked with ' in february , it was revealed that peta creddlin was at loggerheads with top cabinet ministers over her attempts to micro manage julie bishop and steal hockey 's thunder
