guilty - stricken : rick abath , pictured above as police found him , has spoken about his involvement in the 1990 heist from a boston art gallery the security guard who was duped into letting the thieves at the center of america 's most notorious unsolved art crime into the boston gallery from which they looted paintings worth $ 500million has spoken of his guilt
rick abath , who was a college drop - out working night shifts at the gardner museum in 1990 , said he still feels ' horrible ' about his inadvertent role in the crime , which has baffled investigators for decades
rick abath was duped by two thieves in police uniform , who persuaded him to let them into the gallery , then overwhelmed him and left him in the basement covered in duct tape
he spent the next seven hours handcuffed to an electrical box alongside another guard , while the two men cut loose enormously valuable old masters from their frames , including works by rembrandt , vermeer , degas and manet
the fbi has never come close to finding the paintings - despite supposedly promising leads last may - and there remains a $ 5million reward for information leading to their return
rick abath reflected on the night of march 18 , 1990 , in an interview published by npr
' in total the haul including three rembrandt works , five sketches by degas , a manet painting and a painting by vermeer - one of only 36 in the world
missing : the gardner museum continues to display empty frames in the spots where the paintings should be a petty boston criminal , who had broken into the gallery before denies having anything to do with the heist , has since said he believes his boasts to criminal associates may have sparked the crime
according to kurkjian , whose recently - published book about the heist was previewed in the washington post , the information passed up the chain in the criminal underworld until a boston gangster decided to make the attempt
reward : the fbi has claimed to be hot on the trail of the paintings in the past - but little has emerged
pictured above is a 2013 press conference at which a $ 5million reward was announced in 2013 , the bureau claimed to have made ' significant investigative progress ' after figuring out that the stolen paintings had been taken to connecticut and philadelphia
