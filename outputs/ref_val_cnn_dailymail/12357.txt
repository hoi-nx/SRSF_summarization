hong kong taipei is fast becoming the go - to asian city for some of hollywood 's biggest hitters
martin scorsese is filming his latest opus " silence " there , and french director luc besson chose taipei over seven other asian cities for his sci - fi thriller " lucy , " starring scarlett johansson
tasked with attracting international film makers , jao , head of the taipei film commission , said that 92 foreign film crews shot in the city last year , up from 56 in 2013
jao 's commission was set up in 2008 to court international film makers but it was n't until director lee , who was born in taiwan , filmed the oscar - winning hit " life of pi " on the island that it began to earn a reputation as an accommodating and affordable place to shoot
japan director takashi miike used taiwan 's high - speed rail system in a bullet - strewn action sequence for crime drama " shield of straw , " which competed at the cannes international film festival
and martin scorsese 's " silence , " due to release in 2016 , is a historic drama about two jesuit priests who travel to japan
taiwan is also a popular alternative to china , where there are many restrictions on filmmakers -- authorities can censor scripts considered politically sensitive or obscene
hong kong director woo used both taiwan and china as locations in " the crossing
" dubbed china 's " titanic , " it focuses on a ship that sank when the nationalist government fled china for taiwan in 1949 as the communists took over -- a sensitive period in china history
the commission offers incentives for international film crews
while many of the film crews are from neighboring asian countries , the city has hosted crews from latvia and germany , while the bbc shot some of its newly released drama " x + y " in the city
