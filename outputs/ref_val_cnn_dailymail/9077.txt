it may look like a stunning rainbow of colour , but the psychedelic hue of this hot spring in yellowstone national park , is a result of years of unintended vandalism by visitors
the pool has been dubbed the fading glory , due to the transformation from its original colour to the yellowy - green hue it has today
the site first gained popularity in the 1940s when a million tourists would visit the site pool on fire ! the fierce colours are influenced by how light interacts with the water âs depth , with yellow and orange colours in the shallows and green in the deep waters the rainbow hot spring has been clogged up with debris , which block the heat vents , and affecting the water circulation in the pool it is estimated that the destruction of the hot spring has been building up for decades
as the underwater vents started to get clogged up , water circulation was affected , decreasing the temperature of the waters and causing a migration of the orange - coloured bacteria towards the centre
over three million people enjoy the yellowstone national park annually , spans an area of 3,468.4 square miles , comprising lakes , canyons , rivers and mountain ranges unless some subterranean shift happens where more hot water can again flow to the surface , morning glory will never be fully blue again half of the world 's geothermal features are in yellowstone national park , fueled by yellowstone caldera , the largest supervolcano on the continent the pool has warning signs around it , in an attempt to reduce further vandalism to its waters , ( left )
