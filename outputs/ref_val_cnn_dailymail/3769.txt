the full extent of the impact of good schools on house prices around england is laid bare by research released today
a map produced by savills estate agents shows the cost of homes near the best performing schools can be more than 25 % higher than in other areas
savills say the map shows that certain areas can be classed as ' educational hotspots ' , in which a choice of good schools leads to a spike in property prices
the company say the best examples of these are northwood in middlesex , brighton in west sussex , shrewsbury in shropshire and ascot in berkshire
' a graph produced by estate agents shows that house prices are higher than the regional average in places where pupils perform well at school the report states : ' for many [ house buyers ] , rather than pinning their hope on a single school , a choice of good schools will determine whether they will look to buy
' in locations such as northwood , brighton , shrewsbury and ascot that will be driven entirely by a cluster of high performing independent schools
