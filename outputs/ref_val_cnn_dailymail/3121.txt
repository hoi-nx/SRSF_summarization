but scientists have now found that macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans , such as shying away from a group , losing their appetite and adopting a hunched posture
by studying creatures in a social situation , they hope to learn more about why humans may become depressed , which could improve treatment for the debilitating mental disorder
scientists have found that macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans , such as shying away from a group ( shown in e ) and adopting a hunched posture ( shown at a , b , d and e )
image c suggests bullying from dominant monkeys ( marked in the pictures with red arrows ) in the form of a cut to the monkey 's ear
intimidating behaviour ( b and d ) may explain the monkeys ' depression previous studies have used rodents , which ' do not realistically resemble the etiopathological [ causal ] development of depression , which occurs naturally in a social context , â according to the study , published in nature
researchers at chongqing medical university , china , and wake forest university in north carolina , examined depression in cynomolgus macaque monkeys living in social colonies at zhongke experimental animal co. in suzhou , eastern china
the cause of depression in some cases , appears to be down to bullying behaviour by dominant members of the colonies , such as intimidating and even attacking lower status monkeys
dominant behaviour is marked with red arrows , above and depressed monkeys with blue arrows
behaviour : they spent less time resting on elevated perches such as shelves and hanging chains , which are favourites with healthier and more dominant monkeys
the authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops than humans ( illustrated with a stock image ) than rodent models as well as behavioural changes , they also identified metabolic differences between depressed and healthy monkeys , which has also been witnessed in humans
