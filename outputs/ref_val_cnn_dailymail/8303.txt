de bruyne or cesc fabregas ? jose mourinho knows who he 'd choose
the chelsea boss made a brave decision when he shipped the former off to wolfsburg , basing the spine of his team on Â£ 30million man cesc fabregas
but could it have been the wrong choice ? this season , de bruyne has racked up more goals and more assists than cesc fabregas , while jose mourinho 's current midfield maestro searches desperately for his first goal since december
de bruyne has scored more goals and assisted more than cesc fabregas has this season cesc fabregas ( centre ) has not scored a goal for chelsea since mid-december , while de bruyne is impressing de bruyne is in the process of establishing himself as one of the biggest talents in the bundesliga , helping wolsburg cement their place in the top echelons of germany football
cesc fabregas is more suited to a defensive midfield role , while de bruyne roams further forward
de bruyne was signed for just shy of Â£ 7m in 2012 , but mostly consigned to a place on the stamford bridge bench , starting just two premier league games in two years at the club
19 assists to cesc fabregas ' 18 , 13 goals to cesc fabregas ' four
de bruyne was sold to wolfsburg , and has scored 13 goals in the bundesliga this season for chelsea , de bruyne was only given two starting places in the premier league in two years cesc fabregas was stifled against psg in the champions league on wednesday was jose mourinho right to sell de bruyne ? was jose mourinho right to sell de bruyne ? now share your opinion they have not been desperate for scorers , admittedly - diego costa and eden hazard have that covered - but their side could surely have been improved with the talents of the belgian midfielder
at the start of the 2013/14 season , de bruyne was given a fleeting chance to impress , before the door slammed shut on his chelsea career
perhaps it was the change of surroundings , perhaps slightly easier opposition , but germany rivals wolfsburg later decided that his performances were enough to be worthy of Â£ 18m
he scored 10 goals in 33 appearances on loan in germany , and has continued where he left off this season
wolfsburg are now in a commanding position in their europa league last 16 tie , and that is mainly thanks to de bruyne
de bruyne 's european week was far more impressive , as he scored twice against inter milan jose mourinho has impressed in charge at chelsea , but may be ruing his decision to let de bruyne go cesc fabregas , on the other hand , could not do the same against psg
de bruyne may not have impressed week in , week out in a chelsea shirt , but he was only 20 years old when he joined
