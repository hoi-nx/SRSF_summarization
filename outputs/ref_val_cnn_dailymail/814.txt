jurors on thursday were shown a to - do list written by former new england patriots star aaron hernandez shortly before murder victim lloyd was shot dead
the list , which was on aaron hernandez 's blackberry , contains mostly football related tasks , like purchasing fish oil , watching game film and memorizing the playbook , but also says ' send rounds
' and according to kyle aspinwall , who works for glock and is testifying for the prosecution , this is another way of saying purchase ammunition
kyle aspinwall said aaron hernandez appeared to be carrying a glock in his residence around 3:30am on june 17 , just minutes after lloyd was killed in a nearby industrial park with what the prosecution claims was a .45 - caliber glock handgun
