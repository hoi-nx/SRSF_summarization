referee neil swarbrick has apologised for wrongly sending off west brom 's mcauley during his side 's 3 - 0 loss at manchester city
mcauley was a victim of mistaken identity when he was shown a red card after dawson fouled wilfried bony in the second minute of the premier league clash at the etihad

but it was dawson who committed the original foul on wilfried bony west brom defender dawson makes a challenge on manchester city striker wilfried bony the ivorian striker tumbles to the ground under dawson 's challenge bt sport showed the incident from referee neil swarbrick 's perspective , with no 25 dawson the closest to him wilfried bony continues but mcauley then comes in with a challenge of his own inside the area wilfried bony goes to ground again under mcauley 's challenge and the west brom player is sent off wilfried bony heads to the etihad turf after being challenged by mcauley the west brom players protest as mcauley is shown the red card by referee neil swarbrick 1 mcauley loses the ball inside his own half , with striker wilfried bony now bearing down on goal 2 dawson comes across and makes the tackle , sending wilfried bony crashing to the ground 3 referee neil swarbrick steps in , blowing his whistle to stop play 4 but wilfried bony has picked himself up quickly and continues to run with the ball into the penalty area , clearly not having heard the whistle 5 mcauley then comes back to put in another tackle on the manchester city striker 6 play finally stops and neil swarbrick beckons a player across to him
dawson does not move , however , putting his hands on his leg 7 instead , mcauley walks across to the referee and is then shown the red card 8 mcauley can be seen saying ' it was n't me ' as players surround the referee
but their protests are to no avail the statement read : ' in the second minute of manchester city v west brom , referee neil swarbrick made a decision to send off mcauley for a ' denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity ' offence
' the referee has confirmed the offence was caused by a different player , which should be addressed now as a case of mistaken identity
' neil swarbrick left the west brom players stunned and manager tony pulis livid after showing mcauley a straight red card when dawson had committed the original offence
mcauley 's sending off left west brom with 88 minutes to hold out against manchester city with just 10 men mcauley was seen mouthing the words ' it 's not me ' to referee neil swarbrick but it was n't enough to change the decision
at half - time , neil swarbrick admitted to bt sport that the first number he saw after the incident was mcauley 's no 23 , leading to the case of mistaken identity
speaking on bt sport at half - time , pundit steve mcmanaman said : ' it 's just a simple case of mistaken identity
the two players mistaken by referee mcauley ( left ) and dawson ( right ) mcauley walks past his manager tony pulis as he leaves the field ' it 's a simple thing for the referee , neil swarbrick , he 's just sent the wrong man off
' because wes brown 's sending off in sunderland match at old trafford three weeks ago was a case of mistaken identity , both he and john o'shea got away with bans
roger east sent off sunderland 's wes brown instead of john o'shea after a foul on radamel falcao
wes brown is given his marching orders during the match at old trafford despite the fact it was john o'shea the former liverpool player and sportsmail columnist jamie carragher wrote on kicca : ' another case of mistaken identity in a sending off in today 's game at the etihad
on february 28 , referee roger east mistakenly sent off sunderland 's wes brown rather than john o'shea after a foul on manchester united striker radamel falcao
