the extent of the fall - out between jevans and the rfu hierarchy has started to emerge since the england 2015 chief executive suddenly quit last friday
but it âs now understood that the rfu had become equally fed up with the way jevans always demanded her own way â as in her previous role as director of sport at the london olympics â and did nât properly accommodate the host nation position at a world cup where the financial guarantee stops with them
jevans resigned as chief executive of england 's world cup 2015 organising committee last friday and although jevans resigned of her own accord , the rfu made no attempt to change her mind
the crucial relationship between rfu chief executive ian ritchie and jevans had began to unravel over the last few months and culminated in a series of huge rows in ian ritchie âs office at twickenham last week
the relationship between rfu chief ian ritchie and jevans had began to unravel over the last few months sources say ian ritchie walked through er2015 âs expanded office space recently , wondering what the huge army of employees actually did
also , ian ritchie is not the jovial , happy - go - lucky ceo he portrays on the surface but a ruthless , cold - eyed businessman who has seen off jevans in the same ruthless way he brought her in to replace paul vaughan ian ritchie âs desire to curb er2015 excess and bring the organising committee into the bosom of the rfu can be seen by the installation of rfu finance director stephen brown as the new er2015 managing director
but they have to take some of the blame for the crazy structure of the world cup where they receive an Â£ 80million guarantee but still keep sponsorship , corporate hospitality and tv rights while leaving the host nation and the organising committee to sell the tickets and fight for recognition
the international rugby board , headed by bernard lapasset , have kept their distance from the jevans saga it has nât helped the strained relationship between the premier league and the fa over homegrown player numbers that the clubs kept fa chairman greg dyke waiting for one hour and 20 minutes outside their piccadilly meeting last week
