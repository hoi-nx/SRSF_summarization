having to find a suitable place in which to land and refuel your f - 16 fighter jet can take a lot of time
but this video released by joint base elmendorf-richardson in anchorage , alaska shows the ingenious way to top up the tank without losing any air miles
captured on camera is the moment the f-16 skilfully flies up behind a tanker aircraft and steadies itself in the skies over snowy alaska
the f - 16 fighter jet skilfully flies up behind the main aircraft and steadies itself while getting into position a large nozzle extends from the back of the tanker plane and then manoeuvres towards the fighter jet
the large nozzle hanging from the bottom of the plane manoeuvres towards the fighter jet and it latches on the process is then repeated with another plane moments later
