when it comes to living on mars , there âs one major problem that will affect future astronauts : oxygen , or rather , a lack thereof
but an instrument called moxie - the mars oxygen in - situ resource utilisation experiment - could provide a solution
it will attempt to turn carbon dioxide on mars into oxygen when it is taken to the red planet by a new nasa rover in 2020 - and it could be a precursor to similar technologies on manned misisons
the massachusetts institute of technology is creating an instrument for mars
called moxie ( shown here in this illustration ) it will attempt to turn the planet 's carbon dioxide into oxygen
it will be taken to the red planet by a new unnamed nasa rover in 2020 speaking to business insider , former astronaut and principle investigator for the instrument dr jeffrey hoffman explained the project
the atmosphere of mars is 96 per cent carbon dioxide and less than 0.2 per cent oxygen , but the team hope to convert the former into 99.6 per cent pure oxygen
â nasa âs mars 2020 rover is a planned Â£ 1.2 billion ( $ 1.9 billion ) roving laboratory , similar to the curiosity rover currently on the planet
the atmosphere of mars is 96 per cent carbon dioxide and less than 0.2 per cent oxygen , but the team hope to convert the former into 99.6 per cent pure oxygen
this could then be used for breathable air on future manned missions ( illustrated ) or even fuel to get them off the surface nasa 's 2020 rover ( illustrated ) is the successor to the curiosity rover , with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine mars ' rocks
