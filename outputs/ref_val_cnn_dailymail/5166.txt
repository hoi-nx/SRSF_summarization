the real - life paddington bear who suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws , teeth and fur is closer to finding a new home , thanks to the generosity of mail readers
after the plight of cholita was highlighted by this newspaper last week , readers donated an extraordinary Â£ 30,000 to animal defenders international , which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in peru earlier this month
the elderly bear lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus , where she was kept in a 5ft by 5ft box , and her teeth were broken and her claws removed to prevent her from defending herself
when the organisation has cleared the red tape needed to allow cholita to leave the country , they will fly her and 33 lions they have rescued from other circuses in south america to the wild animal sanctuary in colorado in the united states , where she can live out her days in peace
