george osborne refused to commit to spending 2 per cent of britain national income on defence george osborne infuriated tory mps yesterday after he refused to commit to spending 2 per cent of britain âs national income on defence â despite a steep rise in the foreign aid budget
the chancellor dodged the question repeatedly during a post-budget interview , even though there is growing pressure from politicians and military chiefs
â last night tory mps , who have been campaigning to have the commitment enshrined in the tory party manifesto , were enraged by the chancellor âs response given escalating tensions with russia and the rise of islamic state
they are particularly angry given that the government has committed itself to spending at least 0.7 per cent of gdp â currently around Â£ 12billion a year â on foreign aid
â the institute for fiscal studies warned that it would be impossible to meet such demands to protect defence spending without imposing huge cuts on other areas of spending such as policing , transport and energy â especially with health , schools and foreign aid already protected
yesterday mr george osborne told radio 4 âs today programme that the tory party was â not proposing deeper cuts â to defence spending
shadow chancellor ed balls ( pictured with george osborne ) waded into row saying the chancellor 's desire to get an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts to police and defence forces in years he said : â we are helping in eastern europe , training ukraine forces , our fighters are protecting the baltic states , our military is doing a brilliant job in sierra leone , we are playing a global role
â shadow chancellor ed balls waded into the row yesterday , saying : â his ( george osborne âs ) desire to get to an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts in the next three years to our police , our defence forces than we âve seen in the last few years
