the teenager , who can not be named , was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the high court of the high court in london ( pictured ) today
social services feared he could follow in his brothers ' footsteps barrister martin downs , representing the council , told the court that three of his brothers had gone to fight for the al-nusra - a group with links to al-qaeda
mr justice hayden , who said the four fighters could not be named , added : ' the local authority 's anxiety here is that ( the teenager ) may wish to follow the path which his brothers have walked
mr justice hayden said he was concerned to ' keep this lad alive ' and said an order which barred from travelling abroad was proportionate
he has grown up in modern uk in an extraordinary family - a family where the male members are patently committed to waging jihad in war - torn syria , ' he said
' mr justice hayden made the ruling after social services at brighton and hove city council ( headquarters pictured ) raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers ' footsteps and travel to the war - torn region the boy 's mother , who he lives with , is said to be was ' exhausted by grief ' and there were concerns that she was unable to place ' proper boundaries ' around him
mr justice hayden said the council had considered asking for the teenager to be taken into care but given the boy 's age , staff thought making him a ward of court would be a better option
the judge said by becoming a ward of court the youngster would come under the protection of a judge and added : ' a child who is a ward of court may not be removed from england and wales without the court 's permission
mr downs said it was thought that the teenager 's brothers had left the uk after telling their mother that they needed passports for a ' school project '
lawyers said it was thought this was the first time a family court judge had been asked to take such an approach to prevent a boy going to fight in syria
