messi was at his brilliant , mesmerising best against manchester city and the knee - jerkers have been out in full force proclaiming him as the greatest footballer of all time
barcelona âs little big man was just having fun with one of our pot - holed premier league defences
messi ( second left ) was at his mesmerising best as barcelona beat manchester city on wednesday messi ( left ) takes on manchester city and england midfielder james milner in the game at the nou camp messi was repeatedly denied from getting on the scoresheet by manchester city goalkeeper joe hart 's excellent display it was indeed a delight to watch messi enjoying himself and it was hard to keep a straight face when he made a laughing stock of a player who has been described by his city manager as the complete english footballer
barcelona played football from a different planet to the england of which manchester city are currently champions and messi was the principle , be-dazzling reason for that
yet they only won 1 - 0 when it should have been six and could have been ten and messi missed his share of those chances
messi ( centre ) is adjudged to have fallen short of his high level of performance on the international stage messi was part of the argentina squad that finished as runners - up in the world cup in brazil messi has never won the world cup during his international career and his last chance could be russia 2018 but when someone plays for such a major nation as argentina then world cup impact weighs upon the calculation , in messi âs case against him
russia 2018 now represents his last chance to gate - crash this list of the top five players in the history of the beautiful game â and by the way i saw them all : 1 ) pele pele won the world cup three times as a player and scored over a thousand goals throughout his career pele celebrates with the jules rimet trophy after being part of brazil 's 1970 world cup winning side brazil striker pele 's other two victorious world cup campaigns were in the 1958 and 1962 tournaments there can be no arguing with the three world cup glories , the thousand goals , the rare art of making the impossible look simple , nor that extraordinary ability in the air for the comparatively short man who will be guest of honour at liverpool v manchester united this sunday
2 ) maradona not only as mind - boggling to watch on the ball as messi but capable of winning the glittering prizes single - handed â as he did in lifting argentina to one world cup triumph and , when virtually crippled , to the final of another
brazil forward garrincha ( left ) was held in higher regard by supporters than the iconic striker pele garrincha ( left ) takes on england player ray wilson while in action for brazil , where he was loved for his skill garrincha ( left ) was renowned for his dribbling ability and inspired brazil to two world cup victories also the most loved of all brazilian players , as a bohemian man of the people
â 5 ) ronaldo exempt from our world cup statute by virtue of playing for second - tier portugal , yet still did more for his country at brazil 2014 than messi for argentina
ronaldo has fired in goals at a relentless rate during his career at real madrid ronaldo ( right ) scores for portugal in the world cup group g game against ghana at brazil 2014 ronaldo has a physicality that appears to emulate messi when comparing the two best modern day players he , too , is blessed with little leo âs dexterity on the ball but also brings physical power and serious pace to the argument as to which of these ballon dâor winning rivals should be the representative of the modern era occupying the final place this list .
