a los angeles attorney and single mom who is battling terminal lung cancer that has spread to her brain is launching a campaign for the right to end her own life , in a case that echoes that of brittany maynard
terminal : o'donnell , 46 , is battling lung and brain cancer and now fighting to die with dignity o'donnell , a former police officer , says she has exhausted all her medical options in her battle against stage iv lung adenocarcinoma , which has masticated into a golf ball - sized tumor in her brain
despite surviving the six months life expectancy she was given upon being diagnosed last june , the 46 - year - old has been told her death will be painful , as her lungs continue to fill with fluid that will inevitably drown her
' i think it 's a terrible injustice that i do n't have the choice to die in the manner i want to and instead that i 'm forced to very likely die in protracted pain and i might even die alone , ' o'donnell told people magazine in a new feature
o'donnell is now using what time she has left to support a death with dignity law in california , having been inspired by maynard , the 29 - year - old california woman who moved to oregon to take her own life last year , ending a long battle with brain cancer
o'donnell says she wants to be able to do the same in the bed of her home in valencia , with her 20 - year - old daughter , bailey , holding her hand
legacy : brittany maynard , 29 , moved from california to oregon - one of five u.s. states where terminally ill patients are legally allowed to kill themselves - to take her own life in november an mri and some other tests confirmed her shocking diagnosis
' doctors say the tumor in o'donnell 's lungs causes fluid to build up
