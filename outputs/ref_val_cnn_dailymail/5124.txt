the bbc was last night accused of suppressing an interview that called for corporation boss fairhead to resign over her Â£ 10,000 - a - day second job at scandal - hit hsbc bank
she is due to be questioned by mps tomorrow after mail on sunday revealed that she was paid Â£ 513,000 for just 50 days work at the troubled bank last year , vastly exceeding her Â£ 110,000 salary for what is supposed to be her main job overseeing the bbc
silenced : retired businessman mason-mahon ( right ) who said fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the trust , will not be shown now an hsbc shareholder has claimed the bbc refused to broadcast an interview with him in which he declared that mrs fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be heading the trust
retired businessman mason-mahon says he was invited to broadcasting house in central london to discuss the turmoil at hsbc in an on - the - record interview with a bbc business reporter on february 23
â it âs my personal belief she âs not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the trust
â mr mason-mahon has attempted to obtain a copy of the interview but has been told that this would be against bbc policy
last week former bbc chairman sir christopher bland called on mrs fairhead either to give up her post at hsbc or to resign from the trust
' it is simply wrong to suggest that we would not broadcast an interview due to it criticising someone associated with the bbc
