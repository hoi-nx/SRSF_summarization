contradicts beliefs : a new study has revealed that daily weather variations have little impact on people 's moods it 's long been the belief that rainy days have a dampening effect on people 's moods
but a new study has revealed that daily weather variations have little impact on people 's happiness or sadness - meaning we 're just as content with the odd downpour as we are with blue skies
the research , which also found that people dislike their jobs more when the sun is shining , will come as a surprise to most weather - obsessed brits
the study was conducted by buscha , principal research fellow at the university of westminster , who monitored weather records with people 's happiness
mr buscha merged daily weather data from the met office with individual level wellbeing data culled from the british household panel survey between 1991 and 2008 and found no evidence that the often assumed relationship between sunshine and happiness existed
' i always hear people talk about the weather and that they are happy that the day is sunny instead of cloudy
the research , which also found that people dislike their jobs more when the sun 's shining , will come as a surprise to most weather - obsessed brits

' people 's well - being is driven by life events such as income , employment , health , family , death of a loved one , winning in the lottery , etc. ' it seems we are all smart enough not to be influenced by a bit of rain ! ' what mr buscha 's paper did assert is that people 's job satisfaction is negatively impacted on sunny days
the paper makes a clear distinction between daily weather and seasons
he added : ' one other thing to keep in mind , the paper talks about and short run weather variations ( i.e. 5 days of rain type stuff )
' mr buscha 's findings may be seen as unimportant but levels of well - being are becoming a focus for the office for national statistics
the research fellow suggested that a future line of inquiry could be a study into extreme weather
