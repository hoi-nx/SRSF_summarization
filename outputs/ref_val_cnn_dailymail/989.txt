iranians diplomats twice confronted their u.s. counterparts about an open letter from republican senators who warned that any nuclear deal could expire the day president barack obama leaves office , a senior u.s. official said monday
the official , noting the administration 's warnings when the letter first surfaced , said the republican intervention was a new issue in the tense negotiations facing an end - of - month deadline for an agreement to reduce iranians 's ability to produce a nuclear weapon in exchange for loosing western sanctions
the letter came up in nuclear talks sunday between senior u.s. and iranians negotiators , the official said , and the iranians raised it again in discussions monday in lausanne , switzerland led by secretary of state john kerry and iranians foreign minister mohammad javad zarif
john kerry and mohammad javad zarif met for nearly five hours in lausanne , the start of several planned days of discussions
' the u.s. and iranians are plunging back into negotiations in a bid to end a decades - long standoff that has raised the specter of an iranians nuclear arsenal , a new atomic arms race in the middle east and even a u.s. or israeli military intervention u.s. secretary of state john kerry takes a break during a bilateral meeting with iranians foreign minister mohammad javad zarif over iranians 's nuclear program ' there are areas where we 've made progress , areas where we have yet to make any progress , ' britain foreign secretary philip hammond said
' in lausanne , the u.s. official would n't say how much time the sides spent talking about the letter drafted seven days ago by freshman sen. cotton of arkansas and signed by 46 other republican senators
the iranians have called the letter a propaganda ploy , and mohammad javad zarif joked last week that some u.s. legislators did n't understand their own constitution
in the end , the talks and a potential agreement depend on iranians showing the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , said the u.s. official , who briefed reporters only condition of anonymity

the letter , styled as a u.s. civics lesson , warned iranians leaders that any deal negotiated by the current administration could be tossed by barack obama 's successor

but the senior u.s. official said the goal was to determine by the end of march ' if we can get to a political framework that addresses the major elements of a comprehensive deal
