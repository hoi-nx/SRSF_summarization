reasons to stay alive by matt haig matt haig was working in ibiza with his girlfriend andrea when his life suddenly changed
at 24 , he was a self - confessed party animal who drank too much , while eating and sleeping too little
matt haig 's first - hand account of the brutal sickness is a scintillating read â to escape a mind on fire , where thoughts blaze and smoke like old possessions lost to arson
yet real clinical depression should not be confused with such other faces of gloom
in this short , scintillating , first - hand account of depression and how he combated it , novelist matt haig leaves us in no doubt as to the true , terrifying nature of the beast
writing 13 years after suddenly being struck down by â a new claustrophobic and suffering reality â , matt haig provides enough detail about the symptoms of depression to deter anyone from taking the name of this cruel condition in vain
sadness is not a sickness â but depression most certainly is
suicide kills more people than stomach cancer , cirrhosis of the liver , colon cancer , breast cancer or alzheimer âs , according to world health organisation figures
matt haig takes this a step further : â as people who kill themselves are , more often than not , depressives , depression is one of the deadliest diseases on the planet
â it kills more people than most other forms of violence â warfare , terrorism , domestic abuse , assault , gun crime â put together
â the point is that someone like me can say things like that , but someone suffering from depression can easily retort : â you do nât know because you have nât been there ! â when matt haig focuses on his reasons to stay alive on page 117 , his ten clear points are all the more moving because you know this knowledge is hard won
matt haig âs story of recovery will encourage anyone who feels miserable , whether they are clinically depressed or not , and offers valuable insights to family and friends , too
