scientists have raised concerns about a large , rapidly thinning glacier in east antarctica , warning it could contribute significantly to rising sea levels
they say they 've discovered two openings that could channel warm seawater to the base of the huge totten glacier and bring the threat of potentially disastrous melting
the glacier is bigger and thinning faster than all the others in east antarctica
scientists had previously detected warm water on the seaward side of the glacier
" we now know there are avenues for the warmest waters in east antarctica to access the most sensitive areas of totten glacier , " said greenbaum , a university of texas ph.d. candidate and the lead author of the study
the two gateways on the seafloor that lead to the base of the glacier offer an explanation for why totten glacier has been melting so fast
" the increase in sea levels that would be caused by the melting of all the ice in totten glacier is estimated to be roughly equivalent to the contribution from a collapse of the entire west antarctic ice sheet
