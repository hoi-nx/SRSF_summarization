australia reached the semi-final âs of the world cup as they defeated pakistan by six wickets on friday
under the lights at the adelaide oval a drop by rahat ali proved to be the turning point as australia chased down the below - par 213 set by pakistan
the recalled hazlewood took 4 - 35 to restrict the 1992 world cup winners to such a low total before shane watson hit an unbeaten 64 to give the hosts victory in a fiercely contested tie
starc celebrates a wicket with his team - mates as australia ripped through pakistan 's batting line - up sohail khan successfully appeals for the wicket of aaron finch , as pakistan fought back with the ball sohail khan puts down a catch in the outfield , as pakistan failed to take their chances and apply the pressure aggressive , brave , attacking captaincy choices have been the building blocks for the best sides in the world cup so far
sarfraz ahmed , pakistan âs centurion in their previous match against ireland , could nât replicate his heroics as he edged starc to a diving shane watson at slip for 10
wahab can not hide his disappointment as , despite a strong spell , pakistan came up short shane watson ( left ) and steve smith ( right ) steadied the ship as australia eventually made it home safely with both of pakistan âs openers back in shed , the indomitable misbah strode to the crease , in what was to be his final one - day international match
misbah-ul-haq top scored for pakistan with 34 , as they lost wickets at regular intervals against australia umar akmal works the ball away behind square on the offside , as plenty of pakistan batsmen got in and out starc dives to take a catch which ends the pakistan innings in the final over of their 50 equally it took a stroke of genius and bravery from australian captain michael clarke , who brought maxwell back despite misbah having twice previously sending the allrounder clear of the ropes and initially sending him out of the attack
pakistan bowled well early on , but did n't take their chances as australia began to exert control australia âs fast bowlers ; hazlewood and starc ( 2 - 40 ) had been on top from the beginning of proceedings and after bowling out their opposition for just 213 , they were the side on top going into the break
the statistics really best summed up pakistan âs batting performance ; eight batsmen made double figures , none of them passed 50 , all 10 were out caught
wahab âs second got rid of michael clarke ( 8 ) as another well - directed short ball was gleefully taken by sohaib maqsood at forward short leg
steve smith hit an excellent half century to set australia back on the path to victory at the adelaide oval and for all the world the sensational spell looked to be ending with a third wicket to wahab âs name but for a spectacularly poor drop by rahat ali at fine leg as shane watson sent the ball to him
meanwhile at the other end steve smith , easily australia âs best batsman for the past 12 months , was batting supremely and with great composure as he passed 50 for the third consecutive innings
the task of seeing australia home then fell on shane watson 's shoulders and despite his troubles at the beginning of his innings , he shared an unbeaten 68 - run partnership with maxwell ( 44 not out ) as australia reached their target with 16 overs to spare
australia may have outplayed india , their semi-final opponents , during the tri-series prior to the world cup but the match on thursday will be very different
