as the world awaits a possible nuclear agreement between the u.s. and iran , let us not forget : this is the second time in two years that president obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the middle east
this month brought familiar news : more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator al-assad against his fellow syria
just in june , the administration declared the success of its deal to remove al-assad 's chemical weapons , which had been prompted by his august 2013 sarin attacks on syria civilians and the threat of u.s. airstrikes in response
the deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of al-assad 's chemical weapons arsenal , which he can no longer use to threaten syria and israel or fall into terrorist hands
even while the deal was underway , al-assad continued to attack syria civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs , exploiting a loophole in the agreement
just weeks after claiming success , the administration quietly acknowledged that al-assad had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons
al-assad has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities , as the agreement required
about 50,000 more syria were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of syria throughout the region continued
to the contrary , external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- al-assad on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and tehran on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions
these activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that iran helped cause by preventing political compromise in iraq and syria
as was the case with al-assad , a deal will effectively make tehran a partner to the administration in which the white house accepts the iran regime 's legitimacy by virtue of the agreement
even while negotiations have been underway , iran has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology
amid his continued calls for " death to u.s. , " iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal , not as a result of verified observance of a deal
we are seeing it once again in response to the administration 's efforts with iran
as we learned with syria 's al-assad , making a deal with a terrorist - supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road
