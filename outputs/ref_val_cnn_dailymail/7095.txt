a giant redwood tree that was felled 125 years ago to satisfy a drunken bet is to be brought back to life on the cornwall coast
the tree in humboldt , california , became known as the fieldwood stump after being cut down in 1890 at the behest of a wealthy american living in britain
cuttings from the felled tree have since been planted in cornwall cuttings of the tree have been planted at the eden project in cornwall and are now growing in its nursery but a group of scientists believe they may be able to recreate its former glory after planting cuttings of its wood in the eden project in cornwall
more than a century after meeting its end the tree will be rejuvenated by scientists in cornwall as part of an adventurous project to clone american plants in britain
' the climate in cornwall is not dissimilar from oregon and northern california where these trees grow naturally so eden project offers absolutely perfect conditions for them
the tree is thought to have been felled at the request of lord astor after he made a drunken bet insisting that he could source a 40 - seat dining table from one slice of cross-section for decades tourists have visited the stump , posing for photographs in front of what remains of its base the tree base has a diameter of 35ft and , at one time , is thought to have towered as high as a 30 - storey building scientists began last year by collecting cuttings of trees around california
the cuttings were replanted in nurseries at the eden project in st austell and have now grown to leg height
' ten clone saplings have been planted at the eden project in cornwall ( file image above ) with cuttings taken from the tree david milarch , co-founder of the archangel ancient tree archive , has been cloning redwoods for years scientists believe cloning trees which absorb carbon dioxide at a higher rate than others will help battle climate change
