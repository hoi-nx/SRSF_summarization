after a two - hour car journey from innsbruck we were greeted at rosa alpina - a five - star , family - owned hotel and spa tucked in a valley in the tiny village of san cassiano - with a local speciality : a sweet and comforting hot apple juice
impossibly neat : rosa alpina is nestled in the green foothills of the italian dolomites in the sunshine , the village looked pristine , with pretty wooden chalets stacked against mountain pastures which would have been snow - covered in winter but were now a vivid green
having picked out a buggy from the hotel lobby , with map in hand we set off on a mountain walk but took the lazy way up - in a cable car
as the cable car lurched , my four month - old daughter romilly wobbled in my lap , lip trembling ; looking back down the mountain and up to the peak seemed a long way off
i had feared craggy paths at the summit , precariously winding round the mountain , but found gentle , undulating trails
some were nordic walking , others speed hiking
instead of craggy , unforgiving trails , sarah found undulating trails in the mountains perfect for buggies the views were awesome and the air so pure i took in great gulps in the hope it might benefit my london - worn lungs
for a different view of the mountains , the larch trail runs through meadows and up into the mountains opposite the hotel
it makes for a wonderful outing for energetic children ( and their parents ) and rosa alpina has produced a brilliant educational booklet which encourages little ones to look out for flora and fauna , plus answer questions on their surroundings
sarah and her four month - old daughter romilly enjoy the alpine views from the cable car tucked up inside at rosa alpina , the rooms were wonderfully warm - all sweet - smelling pine and herringbone fabrics - but come dusk it was far too tempting to resist lighting the wood fire
rosa alpina boasts st hubertus , a stunning michelin - starred restaurant , where chef norbert niederkofler uses seasonal vegetables ( no tomatoes in winter ) and 90 per cent local produce
i began to wonder if romilly would grow up craving a life of outdoor activities , of escaping and exploring
