fortunately , the intensive diplomatic efforts to prevent a nuclear - armed iran and another war did n't stop after 47 republican senators , led by freshman sen. tom cotton , appeared to try to goad iran 's leaders into forgoing a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute
indeed , progress toward a political framework would move us closer to attainable safeguards on iran 's nuclear program as well as jump - start a more productive relationship that could pay extra dividends for years to come
before president obama 's phone call with iran president hassan rouhani last fall -- the first direct contact between u.s. and iran heads of state in more than 30 years -- such an agreement seemed unthinkable
now , with clear - eyed diplomacy , negotiators from the u.s. and five other countries , plus iran , are in reach of delivering a peaceful resolution to the decade - long impasse over iran 's nuclear program
they have labored to eliminate iran 's potential pathways to a nuclear weapon while allowing the country to maintain a limited nuclear energy program , but under what is arguably the world 's most locked - down nuclear inspections regime
that plan continues to grant inspectors daily access to iran 's nuclear facilities in order to verify its adherence to the agreement
as a result , iran 's nuclear program will be frozen for the first time since its inception , as diplomats craft a comprehensive resolution to this standoff
if and when a final agreement is reached , the president may temporarily waive some sanctions if iran 's compliance can be verified
all this suggests that to jeopardize such progress at this critical stage would be reckless , if not foolhardy
