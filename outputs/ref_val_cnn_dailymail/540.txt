a hound called coco has become caught up in a remarkable international custody battle after being â rescued â by a couple who are now facing a lawsuit from a woman claiming to be the rightful owner
coco was found wandering a beach in aruba , in the caribbean sea , last october by husband and wife lisa and dan oâconnell , who claimed she was in shocking condition
the oâconnells , from north attleboro in massachusetts , said that they thought she was a stray
believing that they were being good samaritans , they called a vet to get the dog treated then contacted an aruba animal rescue centre to help process adoption of coco
however , when they returned from their vacation they received a message from an aruba resident called hajdinyak who told the oâconnells that coco was actually hers â and called whitey pinky
as well as posting photographs and videos of the dog on the page , she published emails that she âd written to the oâconnells , describing how she found her in 2011 at the front of her house and adopted her
