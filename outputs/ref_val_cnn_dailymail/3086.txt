a convicted child molester claimed he abducted a young boy who looked like etan patz the same day in 1979 that the 6 - year - old went missing , a former federal prosecutor told a jury monday at the trial of another man accused of murder
key defense witness stuart grabois recounted how , once ruling out family members as suspects , he located ramos in prison in the late 1980s after learning the ramos had ties to a woman who was once used by the family to walk etan home from school during a bus driver strike
ramos claimed that he had encountered stan in washington square park in greenwich village may 25 , 1979 , before luring the boy to his apartment to try to have sex with him , stuart grabois said
after the boy resisted his sexual advances , ramos claimed he put him on a subway train so he could go to his aunt 's home in washington heights
the imprisoned ramos , now 71 , was scratched as a potential defense witness in the trial of hernandez after he threatened to invoke his fifth amendment protection against self - incrimination if called to the stand
prime suspect : hernandez , 54 , pictured here in 2012 , is on trial on murder and kidnapping charges after he admitted to killing etan still missing : hernandez told police he bagged etan 's body and dumped it a few blocks away
the boy 's remains were never recovered molester : ramos served 27 years in pennsylvania for rape and molestation of three young boys in the 1980s but with testimony about ramos ' alleged confession and by highlighting his history of molesting children , the defense has sought to portray him as a more plausible suspect than the 54 - year - old hernandez
ramos served 27 years in a pennsylvania prison for the rape and molestation of three young boys in the 1980s
