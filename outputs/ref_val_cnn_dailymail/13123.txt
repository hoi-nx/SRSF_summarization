if you have n't yet been asked by friends or co-workers to meerkat , chances are you will soon
the livestreaming app was the " sxsw sweetheart " this year , despite having only launched on february 27
it 's been adding users rapidly ever since -- even jimmy fallon is streaming his life using meerkat
as part of cnn 's instant startups series , cnnmoney correspondent segall reached out to meerkat 's rubin with some questions
and he agreed to answer them -- on meerkat , of course
but recently rubin decided to dedicate his entire team to work on meerkat after the app 's popularity exploded
we heard more about meerkat and rubin 's vision for the future ; for example , he sees the app branching out to work with other platforms , like facebook or tumblr
