a team of researchers has been customising a defence system used by bacteria and training this scissor - like machinery to recognise the hiv virus ( pictured ) crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code unlike other gene - silencing tools , the crispr system targets the genome 's source material and permanently turns off genes at the dna level
existing hiv drugs target individual steps of this lifecycle ; some stop the virus from integrating into cells ' dna , for instance , while others try to stop the affected cells from producing more virus
' to combat this problem , the team turned to a molecular defence system called crispr that bacteria use to cut up foreign dna at specified spots
the new salk study showed that the method is effective against active , full - length hiv rather than a shortened , inactive version of the virus

they added crispr , the guide rnas and other molecules needed for the system to work to immune cells that had been infected with hiv
they found that crispr successfully cut the right spots in hiv 's genes , inactivating the virus
this resulted in the virus being completely removed from up to 72 per cent of cells
not only did crispr chop up loose copies of the virus as they initially infected the cell , but it also cut up hiv that was hidden and dormant within the cells ' dna
while other research groups have taken similar approaches in targeting crispr to hiv , the new salk study showed that the method is effective against active , full - length hiv rather than a shortened , inactive version of the virus
the salk team also illustrated in a more complete way how crispr targets hiv in living human cells , verifying that it works both before and after the virus is embedded in the genome
not only did crispr chop up loose copies of the virus as they initially infected the cell , but it also cut up hiv that was hidden and dormant within the cells ' dna ' crispr can actually excise the virus out of the human genome , ' liao says
