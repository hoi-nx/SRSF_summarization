given the cost of college , students and families need to know that they 're making a good investment
that 's why we need to move to a system where we measure learning outcomes , not just time spent in a classroom accumulating credits
but for all the attention paid to the price of college , we have n't given enough thought to whether students and their families are getting their money 's worth
is american higher education worth the price ? are students and their families getting what they 're paying for ? there 's plenty of evidence that for many of them , the answer is no. in 2006 , a government study found that nearly 70 % of college graduates could not perform basic tasks like comparing opposing editorials
employers want the skills that higher education says it provides to students : the ability to critically think , communicate , work in a team , write effectively , and adapt
in addition to money , these graduates have spent hours and hours in classrooms and taking tests , but the time does n't seem to have translated into learning
why is this ? perhaps it 's as simple as this : we measure education in terms of time , rather than learning
the carnegie foundation warned against using the credit hour as a proxy for student learning , but the temptation of an easy - to - understand and seemingly standardized measure was too great to resist
it just made organizing the whole higher education enterprise much easier
but colleges routinely reject credits earned at other colleges , suggesting that even though they use credit hours themselves , they know they are not a reliable measure of how much students have learned
given that nearly 60 % of students in the american attend two or more colleges , the nontransfer of credits has huge costs , not only to individuals , but also to the federal government and states that are financing this duplicative classroom time
if higher education does n't trust its own credits , why should anyone else ? and louisiana students are n't alone ; transfer students across the country lose credits , which lengthens their time to get a degree
so we have two problems : students who have earned credits -- at great expense in time and money -- ca n't use or transfer them
employees at a biotech company with a high - quality on - the - job training program might learn more than someone in a two - year college science program , but unless this training is attached to an accredited institution of higher learning , the learning wo n't " count
" for the millions of adult workers looking to retrain and reskill , the focus on time rather than learning , especially when between family and work , their time is scarce , is a daunting proposition
state and federal governments add to the problem , because while they spend hundreds of billions on higher education each year , most of it is for time served , in the form of credit hours , rather than learning achieved
we need to stop counting time and start counting learning
what could that look like ? we do n't have to wonder ; some schools are experimenting with measuring learning rather than time â some for decades
this means they can spend their precious time and money learning what they do n't already know , rather than wasting it on what they already do
students at cfa can be confident that their time and money are well spent and , at the end , they will have a very clear picture of what they know and can do
how are universities staying afloat financially with such low tuition ? in many cases , the answer is surprisingly simple â and , sadly , not commonplace in higher education â by focusing on what students need in order to , wait for it , learn
there is , however , a downside for students : self - paced competency - based programs do not fit in neatly with the historically time - based credit hour , making it difficult for students in these types of programs to receive state and federal support
without access to these dollars , the programs will remain one - offs and unavailable to the majority of american who could use them
only recently has the federal government recognized the role it could play in encouraging the move from seat time to learning by redirecting some of its nearly $ 150 billion - plus financial aid budget
the american department of education is encouraging innovation by colleges looking to experiment with alternatives to the credit hour , and there is strong bipartisan interest in both the house and senate to explore innovative ways of paying for learning , rather than time
as higher education becomes increasingly necessary and expensive , measuring time rather than learning is a luxury that students , taxpayers and the nation can no longer afford
paying for what students learn and can do , rather than how or where they spent their time , would go a long way toward providing students and the nation with desperately needed , high - quality degrees and credentials .
