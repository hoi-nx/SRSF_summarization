the plans were agreed by cabinet secretary sir jeremy heywood who was nicknamed sir cover - up for preventing the chilcot inquiry ministers were last night struggling to contain a spiralling row about highly contentious plans to bar 430,000 civil servants from talking to journalists
critics raised concerns about a quiet change to the civil service code , which they warned could â stifle whistleblowing â and open government
the code has been amended to include a new provision making clear that officials could be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister
a line has been added to the civil service code , which governs officials â conduct , saying : â ensure you have ministerial authorisation for any contact with the media
but penman , general secretary of the fda union that represents civil servants , said it was absurd to enforce a â blanket ban â on all 430,000 civil servants having unauthorised contacts with journalists
mr penman : â civil servants will become worried about every contact they have with the media , and will be looking over their shoulder all the time when talking to the public â as that âs who they are talking to through the media â about the service they deliver
â the cabinet office insist that the amendment will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media
they insist it simply â clarifies â current practice
