as the classic australian invention of the cask wine turns 50 this year , the best goon bags on offer are revealed
many of us associate drinking from a shiny silver bladder as our cheap and nasty introduction to wine in our clueless youth - however casks have come a long way in the past half of a century
so much so that in 2015 , one in every three glasses of wine drunk in australian actually comes out of a cask
a stark contrast to back in 1973 when the cask had n't taken off yet and drinking wine was only consumed on special occasions - hence each australian only drank about 9.8 litres of wine per year
this figure jumped to 19.3 litres per capita consumption over the next decade as people really got into the boxed varietal
drew , a member of the popular wine blog , taste - tested all casks that were taken out of their boxes , numbered and then pegged to the clothes line
drew encourages wine lovers to check out the variety of cask wines that is now on offer
' cask producers have responded to the trend of consumers drinking less wine , but drinking better quality
