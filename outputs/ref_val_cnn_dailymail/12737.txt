i grew up watching " leave it to beaver
" most episodes , ward would come home from work in his suit and tie and there would be his wife june , always in the kitchen , her apron as white as the picket fence outside
june made dinner , of course , and ward and wally and the beav sat at the table and ate
as i recall , june usually cleaned up
maybe once or twice the boys helped with dishes
i would watch the black and white show during dinner , sitting on the couch with a plate of food on my lap that had not been prepared by my own mother
my mother was in her generation 's first cohort of " working moms
" she had a successful career as an executive at at&t and then lucent technologies
she left for work early each morning , but was always home by five or six -- in time to spend time with me , not to cook
my dad also had a full - time job , and across the entirety of my life , i do n't recall him so much as opening a can of soup
he 's only recently learned to use the microwave
sociologist arlie russell hochschild coined this the " second shift " : how even though more and more women started working outside the home , they were still expected to do the same amount of domestic work at the end of the day
what 's more , any conversation about household gender roles would be incomplete without noting that some upper - middle class america pay their domestic workers so painfully little that these workers -- predominantly immigrant women of color -- ca n't afford to put healthy food on their own families ' tables , if they even have time to cook between cobbling jobs together to make ends meet
meanwhile studies show that in working - class straight couples , even where the women work outside the home and the men do n't , women still do a disproportionate amount of housework
it seems that in too many situations , no matter the configuration , women are getting screwed
this is partly why leanin.org today launched # leanintogether , a public service campaign in partnership with the national basketball association and the women 's national basketball association emphasizing how men benefit from equality and providing practical tips for men to do their part at home and at work
the campaign encourages men to " show the world they 're for equality " and women to " celebrate men leaning in for equality " by posting with the hashtag # leanintogether
patriarchy is not the fault of all men , but it is the responsibility of all men to do something about it
after all , whether you want to blame biology or early economic incentives or the cultural indoctrination of " leave it to beaver , " men have consistently failed to do their fair share of household labor in america
we have to value household work as work , which means everything from paying domestic workers livable wages to more men cleaning and cooking and teaching their sons that doing so is honorable and equitable , not demeaning
men need to shift from expecting or enforcing traditional gender roles to becoming role models for more equitable relationships
