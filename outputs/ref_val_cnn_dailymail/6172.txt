patti macdonald of hauser , idaho , was charged with beating or harassing an animal after she allegedly beat a hunter 's pet falcon ( example pictured ) to death with a beaded scarf in an effort to save a duck dinger ( seen with other falcon ) thinks macdonald 's misdemeanor charge was not harsh enough dinger , who was hunting with hornet at the time , was about 500 yards away when the bird of prey made a successful attack and landed with the duck
he said he was approaching the spot when he saw macdonald 's red jeep wrangler pull up
hornet flew away but appeared injured and dinger found him dead about an hour later , the coeur d'alene press reported
macdonald is facing up to six months in jail and a $ 5,000 fine dinger said it was tough to accept what happened because his bird was so young and falcons can live for about 30 years when they 're with humans
beating or harassing an animal is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $ 5,000 for a first - time offender
