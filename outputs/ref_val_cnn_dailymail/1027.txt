the 36 - year - old murdered 77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers - in 2011 after detonating a bomb in oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on utoya
at his trial , breivik sought to rationalise his actions by saying he wanted to recreate the dominant aryan race , claiming the killings were ' necessary ' to protect norwegian from muslims
but a new book suggests that breivik 's shockingly warped mindset was forged by his abusive relationship with his mother behring , perhaps even before birth
