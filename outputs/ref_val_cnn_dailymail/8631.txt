tyson has warned mayweather that he will have to reinvent himself as a boxer if he is to beat pacquiao in the richest fight of all time
tyson , as he celebrates the 30th anniversary of the first fight of his own phenomenal career , predicts that the money man will lose to the pacquiao unless he steps out from behind his masterly defence and comes to fight in las vegas on may 2
the casino odds - makers have installed mayweather as favourite and opinion in boxing is divided approximately along the lines of the 60 - 40 purse split in favour of the money man
tyson believes mayweather 's tactical style will work against him against pacquiao mayweather ( left ) will fall to the pacquiao unless he steps out from behind his masterly defence on may 2 mayweather meets pacquiao in the richest fight of all time and the boxing community is split on who will win but tyson says : â i thought from the start that paquiao is going to win
but he does nât throw anything like pacquiao âs hundred punches a round
â mayweather has acknowledged that â we will both be the best boxer we possibly can because we both want to this fight more than any other in our careers
he needs to take a look at how the only opponents who have given pacquiao trouble are tim bradley and juan manuel marquez , who also throw a hundred a round
â tyson says mayweather should be looking at the boxers who have troubled pacquiao , including juan manuel marquez who stopped the filipino in 2012 at the venue he will fight the us at on may 2 tim bradley was another busy fighter to get the better of pacquiao , although pacquiao won last year 's rematch by his own formidable force of nature , tyson naturally inclines towards the aggression in the ring which first exploded upon a startled world 30 years ago last friday
tyson is lifted by promoter don king after his 1986 win over trevor berbick , one of 44 knock outs early on in his formidable 50 - win career as he embarked on his journey towards becoming the youngest world champion in heavyweight history at 21 , tyson entered the ring at the plaza convention center in albany , new york state as an 18 - year - old and blasted out one hector mercedes in the first round
tyson , now 48 and successfully reinventing himself in movies , video games and one - man shows , also blew the hundreds of millions of dollars which mayweather is now earning
and did he have let slip a startling secret about the massive earning power of the money - pacquiao collision ? he said : â mayweather âs getting $ 250 million for one night âs work
â will those cautionary words â coupled with memory of how tyson battered his way from rags to riches to prison to bankruptcy and now to redemption â convince mayweather to stop gambling and buying the most expensive cars and planes or pacquiao to limit how much of his fortune he gives away to the poor in his native filipino ? probably not .
