the a320 , the aircraft involved in a crash in french on tuesday , has for several decades been a key component in the rivalry between manufacturers airbus and boeing

the aircraft -- flight 9525 -- involved in tuesday 's crash was operated by germanwings , a subsidiary of germany flag carrier lufthansa
airbus said the 150 - seat aircraft , which had been flying between barcelona , spain and dusseldorf , germany , was 24 years old , having been delivered to lufthansa from its production line in 1991
it said the a320 had accumulated approximately 58,300 flight hours in 46,700 flights
the a320 can seat up to 180 passengers in a single - class configuration
according to information from the aviation safety network accident database , there have been 55 incidents involving the a320 , not including tuesday 's crash
" the a320 is a twin engine single aisle aircraft seating 150 passengers in a standard two classes configuration
