jordan , 17 , had broken into the dance made famous by south korean artist psy at a corner shop in gorton , manchester
but it enraged the other boy , 16 , who was shopping in the same store and thought his south east asian ethnicity was being mocked
after claiming jordan bumped into him as he spun round , the 16 - year old attacker , who was with his girlfriend , tried to stop the victim and ordered him to apologise - but the pair became involved in a tussle
as they struggled near the doorway , jordan fell back and hit his head on metal shutters outside the shop before his head hit the concrete floor below
college student jordan got to his feet and walked home not realising he had suffered a serious head injury in the bust up
he was found lifeless in bed at 9am the following morning when his mother kim tried to raise him for breakfast
at manchester crown court on friday , the killer , now 17 , was jailed for eight months
the tragedy occurred at around 7.30pm on friday october 10 when jordan who attended manchester college and described as ' polite , very bubbly , happy - go - lucky type of lad ' was with two friends
they went into the n.a grocer shop on an errand but inside he began doing the gangnam style dance and within 17 seconds there was a ' flashpoint ' between him and the other teenager
discussing the tragedy at na grocers , mr hall said cctv in the shop captured jordan ' dancing ' in the shop before an argument took place
weeping was audible from a public gallery packed full of jordan 's family and friends throughout prosecutor hall 's opening address
he said : ' in a relatively short period of time , the defendant is in the queue at the checkout , jordan is waiting around while others are in the check out queue and while he is waiting he proceeds to dance
as they went to the exit door the two came into physical contact with the defendant raising his hands and pushing and pulling and in effect the physical contact put jordan to the ground outside the exit and regrettably the back of his head made heavy contact with paving slabs outside
