former northern ireland international and real striker gerry armstrong is an expert analyst and commentator for sky sports â coverage of spanish football
here , he shares his thoughts with sportsmail 's craig hope on the bale saga at madrid â¦ bale is under a lot of pressure and sometimes that can get to you
real are only four points behind barcelona in the league and you would fancy them to get past atletico and into the last four of the champions league
bale was heavily criticised after madrid 's 2 - 1 defeat at the hands of la liga rivals barcelona an estimated 400 million people watched bale struggle on television as real moved four points behind barcelona bale has been criticised by real supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013 and do nât forget what an impact he had last year
he 's on 16 now and will better that total this year , what more can you ask ? all this talk of dropping him is rubbish â you ca nât drop bale , he scores and creates too many goals
real have been going through a slump in the past five weeks or so
now that toni kroos and luka modric are back i think you âll see bale really re-emerge and rediscover his best form , because i admit he was nât great against barcelona on sunday
the wales international took his anger out on a corner flag after netting a brace against levante on march 15 cracks seem to be appearing in bale 's relationship with madrid team - mate cristiano ronaldo on the issue of him being unhappy , only he knows how happy he really is at madrid
i would nât say the relationship between himself and cristiano ronaldo is bad , but cristiano ronaldo was so petulant when bale scored his goals against levante last week - he could not hide the disappointment from his face
they say bale should pass more to cristiano ronaldo - that âs nonsense
as say real ' missed and they paid for it ' while marca highlight madrid 's misses during the la liga match i would like to see bale say , â i âm better than all of this â and prove how good he is on the pitch - and i think he will because he has got great ability
there is talk of him going to man united , but it would be a huge mistake on real âs part if they agreed to sell him
