one in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in , with more than Â£ 12 billion needed to sort out repairs , a new study has revealed
emergency funding by the government after last year 's floods helped drive a 33 % increase in pothole repairs , but there has been no reduction in the amount needed to bring the network in england and wales up to scratch , said a report
the asphalt industry alliance ( aia ) said Â£ 12.16billion was needed to get the local road network back into ' reasonable ' condition , adding that money spent on filling 2.7 million potholes in the past year had been ' wasted '
the estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years , said the report
one in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in , with more than Â£ 12 billion needed to sort out repairs , a new study has revealed the annual survey also found a ' dramatic ' increase in the amount paid in compensation to motorists in england , doubling to more than Â£ 20 million outside london
' essentially , the money spent on filling the 2.7 million potholes reported is wasted - it is inefficient and short term in its effectiveness
' so , while we understand that the department for transport is promoting permanent repairs , the point remains that money would be better spent preventing potholes forming in the first place
the estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years , a new report claims ' it is hugely frustrating yet unsurprising that , despite our best efforts , we have not been able to make a dent in the Â£ 12 billion roads repair backlog
