ten reasons to give manuel pellegrini a sliver of hope that manchester city can catch chelsea
ten reasons to disturb mourinho as he turns his full focus on the premier league
mourinho has a five - point lead to preserve at the top of the premier league and a game in hand if he is to bring the title to stamford bridge for the first time in five years
what had seemed set to break into a procession at times could yet become a contest if chelsea can not kick the habit of throwing away the lead
it has happened 10 times this season and the unwanted trend has accelerated since the turn of the year
thiago silva headed home to knock chelsea out of the champions league in another poor result after leading chelsea players surround the referee before zlatan ibrahimovic was sent off during the hot - tempered affair mourinho 's side have let leads slip in no less than 10 games in all compeitions this season problems seemed to kick in after the draw against sunday 's opponents southampton , at st mary 's , on 28 december
it was a day when mourinho fumed about penalties not awarded and a ' campaign ' against his team
maybe the chelsea manager had already detected signs of what might lie ahead
2014 - 15 : p43 w29 d11 l3 before jan : p28 w21 d6 l1 since jan : p15 w8 d5 l2 games are more difficult after the new year , with capital one cup semi-finals and a final and the first knock - out round of the champions league
yet it is chelsea 's inability to close out many games which will trouble mourinho
they closed out the capital one cup final against spurs expertly , but seven times in 15 games since the turn of the year they have let a lead slip

chelsea are not about to implode spectacularly
psg h ( champions league ) led twice 2 - 2 aet burnley h ( pl ) led 1 - 1
thibaut courtois has started to struggle to deal with crosses whipped into the box , leading to goals conceded fabregas , battling marco verratti , has not been firing on all cylinders since christmas mourinho will also like to add another defensive option in midfield , for the really big games at the business end of the champions league
diego costa has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability without the creative flair of fabregas , the goals have dried up for diego costa , who may be off the pace because of his ban , as mourinho claimed , but also seems to be distracted by the need to prove he will not change his physical game to appease those who do n't like it
