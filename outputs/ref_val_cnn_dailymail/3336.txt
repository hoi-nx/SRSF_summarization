captain of st mirren at 17 the course of tony fitzpatrick âs life altered on a january morning in 1983
the day he lost his six - year - old son
his previous existence had been blinkered , revolving around the mainstays of family , football and faith
his family was shattered by the death of son anthony following a two year battle with acute myeloid leukaemia
somehow , the football and faith - subjected to anguished , grief stricken examinations in the months which followed - survived
â i have always believed in god " reflects fitzpatrick , sipping fizzy water in a coffee shop in glasgow 's west end
â but what happened to little tony fitzpatrick made me angry
i wondered how something like that could happen
tony fitzpatrick wants his book to serve as a legacy for the six - year - old son he lost to leukaemia â it challenged my faith for a wee spell
it challenged how i felt
the outcome of his jottings is â the promise , together again â , the 59 - year - old âs first book
it features the adventures of babakoochi bear , the pet name he used for the son lost 32 years ago
â i always remember my wife and i coming out to the car park after tony fitzpatrick died and there being most stunning rainbow i had ever seen
rationalising what kind of kind of god might take the life of an innocent six - year - old child proved impossible
â tony fitzpatrick died in 1983
â former st mirren captain fitzpatrick ( right ) in action for his club against celtic when religion was no comfort for his loss , professional football filled the void
fitzpatrick was just 24 when his child âs illness was diagnosed and 26 when he died
â what the illness of my son did was make me realise there were things in life more important than football
he started under sir alex ferguson at love street , appointed skipper as a teenager , before a move to bristol city , where roy hodgson was the manager he returned to paisley after two years , flirting with a scotland cap and winning a scottish cup winners â medal in 1987
fitzpatrick managed st mirren twice and remains a respected , likable figure in scottish football
his 642 appearances for st mirren make him a club icon , yet grief took a yard from his legs
i played in a good st mirren team with guys like mcavennie , frank mcdougal and peter weir â really good players
when tony fitzpatrick took ill it was nât the same
â i remember beating celtic 3 - 1 and things were going great
â he had septicaemia , meningitis and then they found the leukaemia
â in the course of two and a half years we had tony fitzpatrick at home for no more than three months
â tuesdays and thursdays were spent donating blood to improve the quality of his son âs remaining days
a product of the west of scotland before counselling became the fashiom , however , fitzpatrick found it difficult to express himself beyond the football pitch
â i remember when little tony fitzpatrick died that neighbours and friends did nât know what to say to us
â it occurred to me then that a book might be a way of breaking down the barrier
â babakoochi bear , the star of â the promise , together again â , dedicates himself to pursuing peace on earth while adressing the themes of grief , loss and the rainbow which appeared over yorkhill in january 83
. fitzpatrick concedes that writing was also a form of catharsis
â an initial print run of 1000 books , with professional illustrations , cost money and when it sells out fitzpatrick will use the funds to print more
further stories of babakoochi bear âs travails bulge from notebooks in his glasgow home and the waterstones branch closest to paisley have agreed to stock the book aimed at 7 - 11 year olds
â i did it for tony , â explains fitzpatrick
and more than anything i want this book to serve as his legacy
