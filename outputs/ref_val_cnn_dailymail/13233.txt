two former neighbors of bieber have filed a lawsuit against the pop star , claiming he and his bodyguards repeatedly harassed them and their family , vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them with anti-semitic remarks
in the lawsuit jeffrey and suzanne schwartz say bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in jeffrey schwartz ' face after he complained about the pop star driving his ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in calabasas , california
the suit , filed thursday in los angeles superior court , also alleges bieber 's bodyguards dismissed jeffrey schwartz 's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with " what are you going to do about it , jew boy ? " the suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial
the lawsuit comes after bieber , 21 , pleaded guilty last july to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a january 9 , 2014 incident in which the schwartzes ' house was pelted with dozens of eggs
thursday 's lawsuit alleges a nine - month pattern of " offensive " behavior by bieber and members of his entourage from march 2013 to january 2014
