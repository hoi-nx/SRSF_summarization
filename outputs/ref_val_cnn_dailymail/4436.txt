but these megarich leading ladies of pop banded together on monday to demand even more money from fans
madonna , beyoncã© , rihanna and alicia keys teamed up to convince the world to fork out for a service that lets the public listen to their songs on the internet
at one point 18 of the biggest names in music took to the stage in new york to launch the enterprise , called tidal â which guarantees them much bigger payments than rival services
despite being backed by showbusiness superstars , tidal was the most talked about topic in the world on twitter yesterday , with thousands branding it â greedy â , â out of touch â , â cynical â and â money grabbing â
the music streaming service is the brainchild of rapper jay z , 45 , who along with his wife beyoncã© , 33 , is worth almost $ 1billion ( Â£ 676million )

such services have vast libraries of songs , with one of the most popular firms â spotify â boasting more than 30million tracks to listen to
tidal now offers fans a rival service , providing a huge library of music for users to listen to , but charging a minimum of Â£ 9.99 a month
one person tweeted : â i legit thought # tidalforall was some sort of save the world campaign , not a streaming service to make millionaire artists richer
â a third wrote : â i âm still mad about # tidalforall ! those â artists â are filthy , money grabbing , selfish , disgusting human beings ! it makes me mad ... â tidal is a markedly different approach to that taken by some other artists
speaking in new york , singer alicia keys said she hoped the tidal service will â forever change the course of music history â , adding : â our intent is to preserve music âs importance in our lives â
