the us government is still unable to explain around five per cent of ufo sightings in its archives
among them is a remarkable 1957 photo taken by a test pilot near edwards air force base in california , allegedly showing a ufo following a b - 47 jet
it shows a ufo allegedly following a b - 47 jet another , released by the aerial phenomena group , shows three mysterious lights over the manhattan skyline taken in 1984
â a ufo picture tells a thousand lies , â nigel watson author of the ufo investigations manual told dailymail.com â the basic problem is that if a ufo photograph is taken in daylight and looks close , clear and sharp , you suspect it is a fake
â the pictures here do nât seem to be faked but each has its own story to tell
â on the right is an image taken by felippe orego showing three lights over the manhattan skyline , new york , on may 9 , 1984
the left image , allegedly showing a ufo , was taken in ward , colorado in 1929 searchlights focus on an unidentified object over la on february 25 , 1942
the bright dots around the flashes are anti-aircraft shells exploding the picture on the left was taken on new year 's day in 1939 with unidentified object appearing in the top left
the right image shows a picture of a ufo taken somewhere in the us on june 10 , 1964 , and was discovered in an attic a number of years later nigel watson said that a good case to illustrate this point is the image of the ufo over la
in february 1942 , fears of a japanese air raid and invasion struck la
on 23 february , a japanese submarine allegedly shelled the elwood oil field near goleto , north of la
army chief of staff general george marshall reported in a memorandum to president roosevelt dated 26 february 1942 that as many as 15 airplanes may have been involved
â this invasion scare became the subject of steven spielberg âs high - rolling comedy movie â 1941 â ( 1979 ) that shows how fear ensnares people in a web of obsession and conflict fuelled by rumours and the media , â said nigel watson
â the lasting evidence of the craft was a photograph of a â wigwam â of searchlights converging on an unidentified aircraft over culver city
â an analysis by ufo expert dr bruce maccabee suggests that the object caught by the searchlight beams was 100 feet wide
a ufo can be see in the image to the right of the horse 's ear
on the right a passenger on a plane from hong kong to southwest china claimed to have seen a ' ufo like flying object ' outside the window of the plane in 2012 four brightly glowing , unidentified objects appeared in the sky at 9:35 am.on july 15 , 1952 over a parking lot in salem , massachusetts the us condon committee examined many ufo photographs , and concluded that such cases should be selected and analysed according to the following criteria : how clear is the photograph ? does it present evidence of something unusual after astronomical , meteorological , photographic and optical effects are ruled out ? could it be to misinterpretation ? are light and shadows in the photograph consistent ? if a film camera is used , has the negative been tampered with ? is the sharpness and focus of the picture in agreement with the visual observations ? are the time intervals of a set of photographs consistent with the witness testimony ? does the focus and contrast agree with the given distance of the object ? can the size and distance of the ufo be discerned with reference to objects either in front of , or behind the ufo ? steven lacey , another ufo believer , using photoshop cleared up the image to reveal an image of a classic flying saucer
â â in contrast , aviation historian brett holman puts forward a convincing case that the searchlights are converging on a small cloud rather than a ufo or extra-terrestrial battlecruiser , â said nigel watson
