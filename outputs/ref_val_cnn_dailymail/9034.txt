andrew kearney , 33 , was abducted from his belfast flat and shot by masked raiders in july 1998 weeks after allegedly punching a senior ira member during a bar brawl
his sister eleanor king said mr gerry adams privately apologised for the killing of the father - of - one but has refused to do so publicly
speaking as part of an rtã documentary about paramilitary ' punishment attacks ' , she said : ' he should have come forward and told the ira what to do
and , yes , give a public apology
' and in my opinion , if he had done that , even if he did n't call for anybody to be arrested or anything , but just even the public apology and the public acceptance , it would have caused the family a lot less heartache over the years
' eleanor king said her family had been republicans their whole lives and that her mother maureen welcomed gerry adams ' with open arms ' after her son had been killed
sinn fã©in mla alex maskey told the programme that gerry adams acknowledges meeting the family but is unaware of what was said
the documentary also features marley , whose son gerard took his own life in 1997 after he was the victim of two punishment attacks
