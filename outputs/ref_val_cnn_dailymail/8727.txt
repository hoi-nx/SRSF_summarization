for much of the past four years , forrest has been damaged , both physically and mentally
deila , the celtic manager , describes him as a ' frightened ' footballer
self - belief was never an issue until a relentless series of muscle injuries began
to some , forrest is the best player celtic have
â it âs been a long time since forrest has been consistently good , â said deila
â but , touch wood , that âs six months without a pulled muscle and he is moving in the right direction
celtic winger forrest has been plagued by injuries during the last four years of his career â we have been unbelievably patient with him because we have had to build him up from the bottom
â deila might have been describing â 70s tv character steve austin , the six million dollar man , rather than a winger recently rated in an altogether higher bracket
stripped down and carefully rebuilt in a painstaking quest to get to the heart of the injuries that have rendered him a parkhead bystander at times , there is cautious optimism from deila that â this time â forrest might just be ready
a second - half substitute and the scorer of the second goal against dundee united , the winger was close to stealing the show in sunday âs league cup win
john âs feelings on the spot - kick forrest won and missed were embarrassingly public
knocking the desk before him , however , deila welcomed signs that the physical frailties in the forrest make - up are healing
forrest missed a penalty in the league cup final after arguing with john over who should take it â it has been hard work building his self - belief back up , so that he wo nât get these injuries , â said the celtic boss
â arriving from stromsgodset , deila expected forrest to be one of his key players
according to deila , the balance of his body was all wrong , his running style placing strain on vulnerable muscles
celtic manager deila says he has had to be patient with forrest while he overcomes his injury hell â forrest has been worse than he is now , â he said
â forrest is available for selection against dundee united in their scottish cup quarter - final replay
â i can see he will get better and better , â said deila , who can call again on adam matthews at right - back
forrest smashes the ground in frustration after failing to score the rebound to his missed penalty â his body is not nearly where it should be
hopefully , in six months we will be sitting feeling excited about forrest
â his inclusion in gordon âs scotland squad to face northern ireland and gibraltar surprised some as much as did the exclusion of forrest âs new parkhead team - mates gary and stuart
â i am not surprised about scotland because they are thinking the same as us , â said deila
â the 23 - year - old did get his name on the score sheet however as celtic beat dundee united 2 - 0 after already playing for dundee united in the scottish cup , neither can face their former club on wednesday evening
to that end , leigh and kris will again be assigned spot - kick duties for celtic
