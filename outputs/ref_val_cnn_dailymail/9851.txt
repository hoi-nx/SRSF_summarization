as smalling continues his efforts to convince louis van gaal he is worth another contract at manchester united , he is safe in the knowledge roy hodgson has always admired his qualities , ever since a chance first encounter
roy hodgson signed smalling from non-league maidstone united , seven years ago , soon after les reed , fulham 's director of football , had invited the 18 - year - old centre - half along to a trial at the club 's training ground in surrey
' he was watching by chance and he pulled me into his office and it all started from there , ' said smalling
' i ca n't remember the whole conversation , it 's a bit of a blur , but roy hodgson was very encouraging
smalling ( centre ) in action during an england training session at st georges park smalling is thankful for roy hodgson and is delighted they can rekindle their relationship at england ' he mentioned in conversation that he 'd played for maidstone united
i did n't know many other people who had played for maidstone united
he 's the one who really got it started for me and it 's nice to rekindle that with england
' roy hodgson , who played for maidstone united in the early 70s , convinced smalling he had a career in professional football , although the youngster decided to complete his a-levels first
the defender has become a key player for manchester united this season alongside phil jones there were university places on offer to study financial economics at leicester or loughborough if he secured three bs in his exams , which he did
' i was planning to go to university but a month or two before my exams i was offered trials by fulham and middlesbrough , ' said smalling
it was quite far to travel and i was missing some sessions , so i was n't really developing , and then i went to maidstone united
' roy hodgson signed smalling when he was fulham boss from non-league side maidstone united his education did little to impress van gaal , earlier this season , when the manchester united boss branded smalling ' stupid ' for a red card , during the first half of the derby against city
' i was foolish , and it was a rush of blood , ' said smalling
after being close to going to university , smalling is now an england international and trophy winner ' there 's always people out there that are trying to pick you up , and as a role model for young players you have to make sure you 're on the ball , ' he said
' niggling injuries have proved more disruptive since he left fulham for old trafford in 2010 , but he is back in the team and has delivered some impressive performances as van gaal 's manchester united started to click
smalling of england speaks to the media during the england press conference at the grove hotel he was excellent in the win at liverpool , frustrating mario balotelli in the process , and was looking forward to another duel with the striker in turin until he discovered mario balotelli has been omitted from the squad for the friendly against england
' if you 're doing your job and not giving the striker much of a chance he 'll probably get angry , and mario balotelli is someone who can lose his temper very quickly , ' said smalling
' the defender enjoyed winding up mario balotelli and was disappointed to not see him in italy 's squad smalling 's good form offered encouragement to those who believe the 25 - year - old may yet prove to be a long - term successor to rio ferdinand
he 's not just your everyday defender
rio ferdinand was a major influence on smalling and he admired the way that he played the game ' when i joined it was a case of playing with him for a good few years and picking up a lot of points
with champions league qualification close to being secured , the defender can look forward to europe ' i 've not had too many different managers and this is my first foreign coach , ' said smalling
louis van gaal ( left ) and sir alex ferguson have very different styles of management says smalling ' growing up , first of all you 're a defender but we have more possession than a lot of teams and we have to be a bit more like the midfield and start moves
' smalling 's contract expires next year
i 'm enjoying it at manchester united
