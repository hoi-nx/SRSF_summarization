a fearsome nine - foot - long crocodile that hunted by running on its hind legs was one of the world 's top predators before the arrival of the dinosaurs
carnufex carolinensis , which means ' carolina butcher ' due to its ferocious appearance , was an early ancestor of modern crocodiles
paleontologists believe it roamed the warm , wet rainforests of what is now north carolina around 231 million years ago , preying upon small armoured reptiles and early mammals with its powerful jaws
carnufex carolinensis , shown in the artists impression above , would have chased down prey on its hind legs and probably crunched its way though small armoured reptiles and early mammals with its long powerful jaws researchers discovered fossilised parts of the ferocious crocodilian 's skull , spine and forelimbs in a rock formation in chatham county , close to sanford , north carolina
age : the reptile lived 231 million years ago distinctive features : it had a long slender skull with a bony boss running from side to side
running on its hind legs , carnufex would have been the top predator in the area during the triassic period period
she said : ' fossils from this time period are extremely important to scientists because they record the earliest appearance of crocodylomorphs and theropod dinosaurs , two groups that first evolved in the triassic period period , yet managed to survive to the present day in the form of crocodiles and birds
' until we deciphered the story behind carnufex , it was nât clear that early crocodile ancestors were among those vying for top predator roles prior to the reign of dinosaurs in north america
' the scientists , whose work is published in the journal scientific reports , used high - resolution scanning techniques to reconstruct carnufex 's skull from the fossil fragments
scientists reconstructed the skull of carnufex carolinensis , shown above , using 3d scanning technology at the time it was alive north carolina was part of a super-continent called pangea and was in the warm , wet equatorial region
the team examined variation in the shape and biomechanics function of the lower jaws in over 100 ancient crocodiles during the mesozoic - a period which began 251 million years ago and covered over 170 million years
sample of jaws from the mesozoic crocodile record the research also found that variation peaked again in the cretaceous period - 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food
the research also found that variation peaked again in the cretaceous period - 142 million years ago - where ancient crocodiles evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes as they adapted to a diverse range of food
they also evolved a great variety of lower jaw shapes during the cretaceous - about 145 million to 65 million years ago - as they adapted to a diverse range of niches and environments alongside the dinosaurs , including eating plants
however , the dinosaurs did not come to dominate until 135 million years later when many of these large crocodylomorphs died out
modern crocodiles like the nile crocodile pictured above are the descendants of the smaller and lighter crocodylomorphs that survived the extinctions at the end of the triassic period period and the rise of the dinosaurs ' theropods were ready understudies for vacant top predator niches when large - bodied crocs and their relatives bowed out
