eating three meals a day is as much a part of our routine as getting up in the morning and going to sleep in the evening
in fact , there is no evidence eating three square meals a day is beneficial to the body âs needs for energy , the website mother jones reports
in fact , skipping meals and fasting could actually be better for health than sticking to rigid eating patterns
there is no evidence eating three meals a day is healthier than eating in other forms , such as six or nine meals a day historian abigail carroll told journalist kiera butler that these meals are cultural constructions european settlers enforced on native americans
in her new book , â three squares  â , ms abigail carroll said the settlers ate meals at regimented times and considered this more â civilised â than the natives whose eating patterns varied with the seasons , and included fasting
a quirk of history has meant this pattern has been heralded as healthy , when in fact there is no evidence for this assertion , ms abigail carroll said
new research shows skipping meals and fasting could actually be beneficial for health , triggering weight loss and strengthening the immune system similar university of alabama research found eating breakfast or not made no difference to dieters trying to lose weight
a study found that fasting for two days or more can help to kick - start the immune system , especially if it has been damaged by ageing or cancer treatment
advocates of the 5:2 diet , which involves limiting food to just 500 calories on two days a week , say denying the body food leads to weight loss , a longer lifespan and lower blood pressure
this caused the body 's entire immune system to regenerate , providing better protection against infection and disease , experts said .
