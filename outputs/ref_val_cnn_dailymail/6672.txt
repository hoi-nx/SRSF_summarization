osborne today handed a Â£ 3,000 boost to first time buyers to make it easier to get on the housing ladder
the new savings account will see the government add Â£ 50 to every Â£ 200 which savers manage to put away towards a deposit
but critics said it will still take first - time buyers five years to save the cash by which time house prices will have soared by another Â£ 15,000
he said : ' at first glance , a handout of up to Â£ 3,000 from the government for hopeful first time buyers looks too good to be true
' but to get your maximum Â£ 3,000 bonus , with maximum monthly payments of just Â£ 200 , you 'll be saving for four and a half long years
they will be available through banks and building societies this autumn , with first time buyers able to make an initial deposit of Â£ 1,000 when they open the account
the government has also capped the total bonus they will pay at Â£ 3,000
the chancellor said the soaring size of deposits was making it harder for first - time buyers to get on the housing ladder according to treasury documents released today , people outside london now need almost Â£ 30,000 for a deposit on their first home , while in london they need almost Â£ 70,000 first - time buyers in london will be allowed to use the bonus to buy homes worth up to Â£ 450,000 - but for everyone else the ceiling will be Â£ 250,000
according to treasury documents released today , first - time buyers in london now need almost Â£ 70,000 to get their first home
soaring house prices and tighter mortgage rules have made it harder for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder mr osborne told mps : ' the help to buy isa for first time buyers works like this
for every Â£ 200 you save for your deposit , the government will top it up with Â£ 50 more
' a 25 per cent top - up is equivalent to saving for a deposit from your pre-tax income â it 's effectively a tax cut for first time buyers
