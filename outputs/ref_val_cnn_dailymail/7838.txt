the white house blasted senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on monday for holding up the confirmation of president obama 's nominee for attorney general , saying the ' unconscionable delay ' calls into question the kentucky lawmaker 's leadership abilities
the verbal strike on mcconnell came after the gop legislator said over the weekend that he would n't allow a vote on new york prosecutor loretta lynch 's confirmation until the senate passes a once bipartisan sex trafficking bill that democrats are now refusing to support over a provision limiting funding for abortions
white house press secretary josh earnest said the delay on the attorney general post reflected ' inept leadership , ' not a flaw in the trafficking bill , and that the move suggested the white house could no longer trust congressional republicans to act in good faith
the spat is the latest indication that the respective goodwill professed by the white house and gop leaders after november 's elections , when republicans were swept into control of congress , has since soured and is now curdling
mcconnell is now using the loretta lynch confirmation vote as a bargaining chip in his fight to keep a provision that would place heavy restrictions on use of money for abortion in a victims fund named in the child sex trafficking bill
josh earnest at one point suggested that mcconnell , pictured here last week at a press conferene on captiol hill with other republicans , is ' inept ' as a leader obama 's spokesman lit into mcconnell on monday over the play
' the fact that leader mcconnell ca n't build bipartisan support for a child sex - trafficking bill , i think , is an indication that his leadership here in the majority is not off to a very strong start
josh earnest at another point suggested that mcconnell is ' inept , ' the gop leader , he said , should just take out the offending abortion measure in order to get democrats back on board
in a sharp rebuke , the white house appeared to question whether obama can trust mcconnell and his fellow gop leaders and ' whether their word is good with the president
' josh earnest pointed out that mcconnell had argued last year that loretta lynch 's confirmation should wait until the new gop - run senate was seated in january , but was now claiming publicly that it was democrats who prolonged the confirmation by waiting until 2015
