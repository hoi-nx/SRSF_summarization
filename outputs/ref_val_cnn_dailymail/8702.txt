it is fitted with thermo - piezoelectric materials that convert heat into energy to charge an electric car without the need for a charging station
this conversion happens when the car is both stationary and moving called bh023 , the tyre concept is fitted with thermo - piezoelectric materials
when parked , sunlight heats the tyre and this heat is transformed into electricity using the thermo - electric material
when being driven , the friction between the tyre and the road as well as the â squeezing â and movement of the piezoelectric material as it rolls generates a small electric voltage
â this tyre generates electricity through the action of materials in the tyre that capture and transform the energy created by heat when it flexes as it rolls during normal driving conditions , â explained goodyear
â this visionary tyre technology could eliminate the vehicle - range anxiety motorists may have with electric cars
â goodyear also unveiled a second concept called â triple tube â
when parked , sunlight heats the tyre and this heat is transformed into electricity using the thermo - electric material
the tyre has also been designed to be â ultra-black â to absorb as much heat as possible the tyre automatically adjusts - on its own - to three different positions based on road conditions and modes include the eco / safety , sporty and wet traction
when being driven , the friction between the tyre and the road as well as the â squeezing â and movement of the piezoelectric material as it rolls generates a small electric voltage
there are no immediate plans to release the concept but the tyre - maker said it predicts future cars will use the technology while the wet traction position , with maximimum inflation in the centre tube , stops the car from aquaplaning thanks to a raised tread in the centre of the tyre
