the barnet manager admires jose mourinho 's courage in playing kurt zouma against tottenham but takes aim at the sluggish strikers currently masquerading as manchester united stars
mourinho 's got balls ! chelsea manager jose mourinho threw kurt zouma in against tottenham to shield the back four , to stifle and stop the opposition in the capital one cup final
how many managers would have the confidence to play a centre - back in central midfield in a cup final at wembley ? in front of 90,000 fans and millions watching across the country - across the world
it must be said , jose mourinho âs game management is second - to - none
jose mourinho 's game management is second - to - none , particularly when it matters most he soaks up the pressure , waits for the game to open up and frustrate the opposition
the work ethic he has drawn from those technically brilliant players is astounding
his ranting and raving about the injustices from referees puts pressure on the officials into giving chelsea better decisions
the chelsea manager threw youngster kurt zouma in to protect the back four against tottenham slipping at the top the pressure , the anxiety , the expectancy , not rotating enough ? what is it about the top teams slipping up at this point in the season ? getting close to the finishing line , you start looking over your shoulder
we all know running a race it âs better to chase a person in front than to be looking behind you
even jose mourinho âs chelsea had a blip , although they are managing it well
we see it in darts when the players start missing doubles
eddie howe has seen his bournemouth side slip away from the top of the championship recently manchester united âs sluggish strike force how slow is radamel falcao ? and robin van persie has lost half a yard of pace from his days at arsenal
manchester united have crept up on to the shoulders of the champions league places , but there is far from enough pace and athletic ability in the group to make it into the top four
radamel falcao has failed to hit the ground running and appeared slow in a manchester united shirt robin van persie seems to have lost half - a - yard of pace under louis van gaal at old trafford one person i keep hearing about ... darrell clarke , bristol rovers boss darrell clarke has grafted through the lower levels where he had success
bristol rovers manager darrell clarke has grafted through the lower levels and enjoyed success one thing i 'd change about ... golden eye i think there should be a referee in the stand , who has the opportunity to stop play and call back decisions in exceptional circumstances
roger east ( sending off sunderland 's wes brown ) would 've benefited from an extra official at old trafford the big issue ... manchester city 's squad i must say i do like mr manuel pellegrini
he is cool , he is calm and he managed to put out a lot of fires that were raging in that manchester city dressing room after taking over from roberto mancini
criticising him for playing two up front and getting out - numbered and out - played in midfield
last year , he won the premier league
manuel pellegrini has struggled in the defence of his premier league crown with manchester city captain vincent kompany has n't been able to continue his sterling form at the back for city however , it it not always just about the tactics of the manager
there is clearly something missing in the dna of the city squad
