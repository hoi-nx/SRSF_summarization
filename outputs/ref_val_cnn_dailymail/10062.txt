in the bbc drama , the bustling town of truro is a lost world of 18th - century wooden shop fronts , muddy thoroughfares and pens of geese and sheep
which goes to prove how cleverly the producers disguised the fact that it is actually a real - life english market town a long horse ride from the series â rugged cornwall setting
pens for animals , as well as a vegetable stall and a punch and judy show , were added to create a typical scene from the period demelza 's dirt road that 's really got yellow lines : the street where poldark and his future wife demelza walked is a real row of terrace houses in corsham
the producers hid the modern double yellow lines under a fake dirt - covered road that looked as though it was from another era saddlery that 's really a curry house : with its panelled frontage and rows of saddles , truscott and son is entirely convincing as an 18th - century saddlery

the film crew arrived in town over the may bank holiday weekend , and the familiar shop fronts and neat parking spaces began to be replaced by dirt - covered roads , rickety carts and wandering horses
tell - tale signs of the modern age , such as phone boxes and road signs , were cleverly hidden inside wooden shacks , or temporarily removed
â rope store that 's really a flower shop : theodora 's flower show may have been in corsham for 25 years but there was no space for it in poldark 's truro

a panoply of wheelwright 's instruments were placed in front of the 18th - century store shed that 's a phone box : a phone box was cleverly hidden in a wooden shed and a hay cart added to complete the rustic look filming took just a week and people were allowed to use the high street between scenes , as many businesses stayed open
