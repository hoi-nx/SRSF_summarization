it was late thursday afternoon at a beach in ventura when three - year - old nico raced into the water after a woman who had become trapped by the current began calling for help
" ' the woman grabbed onto nico 's chest and held her boogie board with the other hand , allowing nico to guide her to shore
' it was only a few months ago the clarkes had adopted nico , who was now paying it forward by rescuing the couple caught in the water
grateful : the couple joined their children back on the beach , grateful to nico for coming to their rescue while in the water amazed : clarke , nico 's owner and a former lifeguard , said he had never seen his newly adopted dog perform a feat like the one he saw on the beach warning : signs warn swimmers at the ventura beach not to swim into the water , as the riptide can pull beachgoers out to see ' the woman and the gentleman they were just exhausted , ' said clarke about the unidentified couple
