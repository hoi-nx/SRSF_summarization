a court in ivory coast has sentenced former first lady simone gbagbo to 20 years in prison , the official aip news agency said
her husband , former president laurent gbagbo , is in the custody of the hague - based icc awaiting trial over similar charges
the charges stem from the aftermath of simone gbagbo 's husband 's election defeat in 2010
her husband surrendered to the icc in december of that year , and is currently awaiting trial at the hague on crimes against humanity for the civil unrest and deaths
but ivory coast refused to transfer simone gbago , saying it would try her in a domestic court instead
