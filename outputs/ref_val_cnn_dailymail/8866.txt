cameron last night agreed to a single tv debate during the election campaign
the prime minister is expected to attend a seven - way session at the start of april , to be shown on itv
he will also appear on a number of election specials â but without going head to head against miliband crucially , the bbc , sky , itv and channel 4 appear to have blinked first and dropped their demand for a head - to - head clash between the pm and miliband
labour appeared to deny the validity of the new proposal , insisting it still wanted three debates as originally proposed and accusing the pm of â running scared â of a one - to - one with mr miliband
but , in an attempt to nail down the latest agreement , mr cameron said the other parties should accept it
â labour leader miliband and the deputy prime minister clegg would only face mr cameron in one seven - way debate the latest proposal is thought to have been presented to the parties over the weekend
on april 16 the bbc is proposing a â challengers â debate featuring the greens , snp , ukip and plaid
a week before polling day , on april 30 , the bbc will host a 90 - minute question time - style show with mr cameron , mr miliband and mr clegg appearing one after the other to face questions from a tv audience
â n mr cameron poked fun at miliband for posing for tv cameras in a pokey kitchen that turned out to be one of two in his Â£ 2.5million london home
cameron and miliband would be interviewed one after the other in a channel 4/sky special hosted by jeremy paxman ( right )
