confucius said : " study the past if you would define the future
this is where the world 's first cities were built and where writing and organized government were first developed more than 5,000 years ago
isis , like so many iconoclastic extremist groups through history , seeks to destroy the record of the past
in the past week , video has circulated showing neatly dressed figures wielding rather new - looking sledgehammers and destroying archaeological objects in the mosul museum
isis has been busy trying to damage the famed nergal gate entry to the ancient city of nineveh -- a city with a history reaching back thousands of years -- and most recently it is reportedly bulldozing the site of nimrud , capital of the 9th - century b.c. assyrian king ashurnasirpal ii , and source of the famed nimrud ivories
the destruction eloquently speaks of the human folly and senseless violence that drives isis
the terror group is destroying the evidence of the great history of iraq ; it has to , as this history attests to a rich alternative to its barbaric nihilism
worse , these acts of destruction supposedly in the name of religion are dishonest and hypocritical : the same isis also is busy looting archaeological sites to support its thriving illegal trade in antiquities , causing further incalculable harm
they are the text of the past that helps define our future
we need more archaeology education globally ; in iraq and in other isis - affected countries , but also among people everywhere in order to help communities -- from children on up -- understand the fragility of the archaeological record and its critical importance to understanding the human story
