eurosceptics : conservative mp sir bill cash , who chairs the european scrutiny committee the bbc has a â deeply concerning â pro-european bias and has â fallen down severely â in its obligation to provide impartial coverage of the issue , mps say today
the european scrutiny committee says the corporation does not give enough airtime to those who believe britain should leave the eu or that there should be a referendum on membership
the mps also criticised the bbc âs director - general , lord hall , for failing in his role as the corporation âs editor - in - chief , after he turned down an invitation to give evidence to the committee in parliament four times
sir bill cash , the eurosceptics who chairs the committee , said : â the bbc has fallen down severely on its obligations to viewers and listeners to give them a proper and balanced assessment of both sides of the argument
who can say that the european scrutiny committee question is not important ? â the conservative mp argued that many of the bbc âs flagship shows , including radio âs 4 âs today programme , are stuffed with commentators who talk about the economic and political dangers of britain leaving the eu
sir bill cash said : â there is a [ line ] of questioning which is quite clearly geared to elicit the answers , â i do nât want a referendum â , or â i do nât want britain to leave the eu
why do nât they have more people on so they can represent them ? that [ bias ] is carried through an enormous amount of the bbc âs flagship programmes
mps also criticised the bbc âs director - general , lord hall , above , for failing in his role as the corporation âs editor - in - chief , after he turned down an invitation to give evidence to the committee in parliament four times but in today âs report mps say the bbc has done little to change things , and that they â remain deeply concerned about the manner â in which the corporation tackles the subject of the eu
â he is editor - in - chief , â said sir bill cash
â the bbc provides extensive coverage of both european scrutiny committee and parliamentary issues and while we respect the committee âs role , it would be a breach of our independence if a committee of mps were to instruct us how to cover an individual issue or story
