the u.s. government on thursday asked an appeals court to lift a temporary hold on president obama 's executive action to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation , arguing it ca n't wait for the judge who blocked the action to make a ruling on a similar request
justice department attorneys filed an emergency motion with the 5th circuit court of appeals in new orleans , louisiana , to lift a preliminary injunction issued last month by u.s. district judge hanen in brownsville , texas
the injunction had been issued on the request of a coalition of 26 states that filed a lawsuit to overturn obama 's immigration plan
off to court : president obama has responded to a texas judge 's injunction halting his immigration executive actions by demanding an appeals court overrule him here comes the judge : federal jurist hanen called the obama administration on the carpet and put the brakes on the president 's immigration plan the states , led by texas , argue that obama 's action was unconstitutional and would force them to invest more in law enforcement , health care and education
decision time : federal judge priscilla owen will likely make the call on whether to overturn hanen , her former law school classmate the injunction was intended to stall obama 's actions â which would spare from deportation as many as 5 million people who are in the u.s. illegally â while the lawsuit progresses through the courts
plaintiff : texas gov. greg abbott is spearheading the lawsuit along with 25 other governors anger : conservatives have bristled at the idea of the white house tossing border security overboard in favor of letting 5 million or more illegal immigrants stay at next week 's hearing , hanen was set to have justice department attorneys explain why the federal government granted three - year deportation reprieves as well as work permits to 100,000 individuals before hanen 's feb. 16 injunction
the justice department has said the reprieves and work permits were granted under the 2012 daca program , known as daca , which was not halted by hanen 's injunction
in a separate court document filed with hanen 's court on thursday , the justice department said the acknowledgement that some individuals were granted reprieves under 2012 daca guidelines does ' not bear on the resolution ' of the pending request before the judge to lift the injunction
hanen 's injunction put on the hold an expansion of daca as well as a program that would extend deportation protections to parents of u.s. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years .
