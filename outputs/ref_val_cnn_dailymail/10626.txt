but scientists have discovered one small population of people living in a remote part of the andes in north west argentina who have developed some resistance to arsenic
they have found that over thousands of years the local inhabitants there have developed a genetic ability to metabolise the arsenic to reduce the impact it has on their bodies
local women in san antonio de los cobres in the andes ( pictutred above ) carry a genetic variant that gives them greater tolerance of the poison arsenic by helping them to metabolise the element more efficiently worldwide arsenic poisoning caused by contaminated water and food is thought to harm more than 137 million people
even low levels of arsenic poisoning can cause damage to the lungs , heart , kidneys and liver , leading to cancer , heart disease and diabetes
based on the description , scientists put forward other theories as to why he died - which included arsenic poisoning
the wallpaper used in the emperors bedroom on st helena also contained high levels of arsenic compound used by british manufacturers as a dye
however , people living in the sparsely populated area around san antonio de los cobres , a village high in the andes in the puna region of argentina , appear to have developed a way of dealing with the poison more effectively
for close to 11,000 years the indigenous population there , who are descended from the atacameã±os people , have been drinking water contaminated with arsenic
dr broberg , a researcher in environmental medicine at lund university in sweden , and her colleagues found that some time between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago , the local populations in the region underwent some genetic changes that have given a greater resistance to arsenic
they found that the people living in the area are able to consume more than 20 times the levels that are currently considered to be a safe expsoure level
' yet the people living in this area have a relatively high arsenic exposure and a efficient and less toxic metabolism
they pinpointed a key set of mutations in their genes that appear to have given them the ability to tolerate far high levels of arsenic exposure
the village of san antonio de los cobres is located in a remote part of the andes in north west argentina arsenic was commonly used as an ingredient in medicine and cosmetics but also was often used as a poison they estimate that the increase in this gene variant occurred around 10,000 to 7,000 year ago based on high levels of arsenic found in the hair of a mummy excavated in the region
the bedrock in the area around san antonio de los cobres ( shown above ) contains high levels of arsenic the poison was also implicated in the causing maddness of king george iii and the death of napoleon bonaparte
king faisal i of iraq was also found to have suffered symptoms of arsenic poisoning while in switzerland in 1993 and south american independence leader simon bolivar is thought to have died due to chronic arsenic poisoning
dr broberg said although the people in san antonio de los cobres were not consuming anything near these levels , they did have more resistance than other populations
