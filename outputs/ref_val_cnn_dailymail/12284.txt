the rescue workers battling to gather the pulverized pieces of germanwings flight 9525 and the remains of the 150 people on board must contend with high winds as well as treacherous terrain
bit by bit , bag by bag , high wire daredevils hoist body bags hundreds of feet up to waiting helicopters , trying to remain stable in the high winds
winched down from helicopters on to the steep , icy slopes , where debris lies scattered across hundreds of meters , workers have had to be tied together in two - person teams
complicating matters , very few of the bodies have been found whole , naffrechoux , captain of rescue operations , told cnn on friday
and winds have picked up , making it difficult for helicopters to ferry the workers to the site in the french alps in the first place , he said
authorities have deployed 45 alpine police officers to help forensics teams -- not accustomed to working in mountain ravines -- recover the bodies safely , naffrechoux said
his team is based out of seyne-les-alpes , a normally sleepy alpine village that since tuesday 's crash has been transformed into a hub for the recovery operation
meanwhile , the rescue workers have continued their hazardous mission
before anything could be recovered , the position of the bodies and debris had to be mapped
the workers are now removing more bodies from the site , naffrechoux said
the priority remains to find all the bodies and the elusive second " black box , " the plane 's flight data recorder , he said
" the recovery teams are trying to construct a road to access the site more quickly and aid the transportation of bodies to a dna testing center where they are kept in refrigerated units , said naffrechoux
