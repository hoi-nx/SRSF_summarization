a uk sky researcher who started a new life in the caribbean died after bungling doctors botched a routine operation and starved her brain of oxygen for up to 15 minutes , an inquest has heard
clayton , 30 , fell into an induced coma after medics inserted an airway tube into the wrong part of her throat , causing her face to swell up uncontrollably and leaving her with fatal brain damage
' clayton , 30 , originally from southampton , died after bungling doctors on a caribbean island starved her brain of oxygen during a routine operation , an inquest has heard a leading medic from southampton , where miss clayton was later transferred for emergency treatment , also told the hearing that he could ' not understand ' why it had taken doctors so long to realise their mistake
in a narrative verdict , the coroner openly criticised the care given to miss clayton at georgetown hospital , ruling that she died ' as a direct result of the failed tracheotomy ' which was ' inadequately carried out
' the inquest , which was heard in winchester , heard how miss clayton had been rushed to hospital on the caribbean island in january this year after a horror crash which left her paralysed from the chest down
mrs clayton , who flew to the caribbean from the uk following the crash to be at miss clayton 's bedside , told how her daughter had been conscious and improving in the days before her death
but miss clayton 's recovery was derailed when she underwent the tracheotomy , an operation which went ' horribly wrong ' and left the young woman fighting for her life
the operation had been carried out so that miss clayton , who was relying on tubes to breathe , would be able to breathe on her own
the former researcher was flown back to southampton general hospital ( pictured ) for emergency treatment after an online appeal raised more than Â£ 30,000 in four days , but she could not be saved but , instead of inserting a breathing tube into miss clayton 's trachea , medics inserted the tube into her mouth , meaning oxygen was pumped straight into her neck tissue
mrs clayton told the inquest that she had been waiting outside in the hospital corridor for news of the routine operation when one of the medics took her aside to explain what had gone wrong
' after the botched operation , an online appeal called help kate get home raised Â£ 36,000 in just four days , providing her family enough money to bring miss clayton back to the uk
the 30 - year - old had moved to the cayman islands ( pictured ) to work as a diving instructor in december 2013 colin griffiths , a consultant neuro - surgeon at the southampton general hospital , told the hearing in winchester that he could not understand how doctors had made such an elementary mistake
' miss clayton was treated at the cayman island hospital for significant spinal , pelvic and bowel injuries and in the course of her treatment had a failed tracheotomy procedure where the procedure and its management prevented any oxygen from reaching her brain for at period off at least eight minutes , and resulted in hypoxic brain injury
' on the balance of probabilities and relying on medical records and evidence from miss clayton 's family , her subsequent death on the 18th of february 2015 having been transferred to southampton general hospital , was as a direct result of the failed tracheotomy which the evidence indicates was inadequately carried out
' miss clayton 's family declined to comment after the inquest .
