anjali damania says leaders should take the initiative to change aap , not simply blog or complain the letters by admiral l. ramdas and prashant bhushan are the ones that matter , and the issues they raised should be addressed
my objection is that instead of merely raising questions , people should contribute to the party by working for it
the problems have to be , and will be , addressed
it wo nât take more than a month or so for the party to set everything right
talking about the funds , i will say let the expenses and accounts reach the office
we have fought three elections in a year , which is too much for any small party
every single issue raised is important for the party
the only problem is that this should not be done via the media ; it needs to be done by holding internal talks
mayank gandhi should have demanded that the recordings and the minutes be made public in the meeting which he had attended
what is the meaning of simply raising questions ? every leader needs to think about it
i would definitely like to see him as a leader of the party
