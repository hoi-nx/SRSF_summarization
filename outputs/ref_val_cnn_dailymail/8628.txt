pochettino is nât the selfie type
so when the tottenham manager slipped his camera phone out at loftus road on saturday , you could nât help but notice
â my family was in the stands , my two sons ( maurizio , 13 , and sebastiano , 20 ) and my older brother ( javier )
â pochettino took a photo the tottenham fans at loftus road as his family were among them harry heads past robert green to give tottenham the lead over qpr at loftus road tottenham striker harry celebrates as his goals keep tottenham in the hunt for a top four finish javier still works on the farm where 43 - year - old pochettino grew up in argentina âs murphy province
their career paths have taken different directions but that does nât stop javier providing his younger , more high - profile brother with an honest assessment
he is certain to be in the england squad when roy , who was at loftus road , picks his players for the clashes against lithuania and italy later this month
â is ryan mason close to a call - up ? the question is not for me , but roy , â said pochettino , whose side face manchester united next week
ryan mason ( left ) has been linked with an england call - up after his impressive form for tottenham ramsey refused to get carried away with a points target after qpr lost to tottenham â this is ryan mason âs first full season , even though he is 23 , but he has potential to improve and , like harry , he is progressing in a very good way
