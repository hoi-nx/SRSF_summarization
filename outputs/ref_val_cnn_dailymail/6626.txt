a team of scientists claim it has found a way to inject people âs eyes with â night vision â
the research gave one volunteer the ability to see more than 164ft ( 50 metres ) in almost total darkness for ' several hours '
california researchers have developed a liquid that enables night vision
the solution combines chlorin e6 ( ce6 ) with insulin and saline
they used a solution of a substance called chlorin e6 ( ce6 ) , which is found in some deep - sea fish and has light - amplification properties , and is also been used in cancer treatment research
combining ce6 with insulin and saline , the team produced a solution that can increase vision in low light conditions
in april , researchers revealed a super-thin infrared light sensor , which could become an invaluable tool for the soldiers of the future as researchers work to develop the advance into night vision contact lenses
' they note in their paper , though , that â the high risk of cellular toxicity from outside contaminants being absorbed through the skin make this chemical something that should only be handled with caution
â as a result it is not advisable for people to carry out the procedure themselves at home
' whilst the idea of " night vision eye drops " may seem interesting , this appears to be an unlicensed and unproven solution that has no medical approval
they used a solution containing chlorin e6 ( ce6 ) , found in some deep - sea fish and has light - amplification properties , and is also used in cancer treatment research in the team 's experiment , the liquid was dripped onto the conjunctival sacs on the eye of licina , one of the researchers , which carried the solution to his retinas
â ce6 solution was added to the conjunctival sac via micropippette at three doses of 50Î¼l [ microlitres ] into each eye , â the researchers wrote
to test the effects , mr licina and four â control â subjects who had not been given the solution were taken to a â darkened area â
â the ce6 subject consistently recognised symbols that did not seem to be visible to the controls , â the researchers wrote
and , in the second test : â the ce6 subject identified the distant figures 100 per cent of the time , with the controls showing a 33 per cent identification rate
â as of 20 days , there have been no noticeable effects , â they said
