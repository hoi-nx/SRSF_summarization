these remarkable scans clearly reveal how smoking during pregnancy harms an unborn baby 's development
new ultrasound images show how babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy touch their mouths and faces much more than babies of non-smoking mothers
experts said the scans show how smoking during pregnancy can mean the development of the baby 's central nervous system is delayed
doctors have long urged pregnant women to give up cigarettes because they heighten the risk of premature birth , respiratory problems and even cot death
now researchers believe they can show the effects of smoking on babies in the womb - and use the images to encourage mothers who are struggling to give up
the foetus carried by the smoker touches its face and mouth much more , indicating its development is delayed as part of the study , dr reissland , of durham university , used 4 - d ultrasound scan images to record thousands of tiny movements in the womb
the pilot study , which dr reissland hopes to expand with a bigger sample , found babies carried by smoking mothers may have delayed development of the central nervous system
dr reissland , of durham university , said the ultrasound scans show unborn babies of mothers who smoke may have delayed development of their central nervous systems but she was against demonising mothers and called for more support for them to give up
