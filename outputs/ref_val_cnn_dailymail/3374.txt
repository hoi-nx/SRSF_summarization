mr ridley today said that despite attempts to ascertain why pippa lost control , the foreign and commonwealth office were unable to produce evidence for the inquest
the pair ( tara darlington , left , and pippa , right ) had been travelling across africa before they were tragically killed he added the morocco authorities may not have even conducted any investigation at all and that joshua stump was unable to help with evidence because he was asleep at the time
