it sounds like a scene from a science fiction film but if one food concept designer has her way this is how everybody will be eating in the near future
while 3d food - printing technology is not a new thing , the invention of this self - growing snack that makes its own filling could change the way we consume food , forever
the edible growth project is the brainchild of dutch concept designer chloã© rutzerveld who conceived of the idea to show that high - tech or lab - produced food does not have to be ' unhealthy and unnatural
on her website ms chloã© rutzerveld explained in a video : ' the edible growth project is about creating a fully edible ecosystem with living organisms in which the base gets printed by a 3d - printer and gradually develops towards a fully - fledged dish
according to ms chloã© rutzerveld , the project is an example of high - tech but fully natural , healthy , and sustainable food made possible by combining aspects of nature , science , technology and design
edible growth makes use of natural processes like fermentation and photosynthesis and lowers the use of resources
she explained : ' it shows that high tech food does n't have to be unhealthy or unnatural , but that it can actually have a lot of advantages
' the snack in its various stages : 3d - printed nylon prototype ( left ) and growth test to see if it will take ( right ) success : the inner workings of the edible growth prototype which shows mushrooms and sprouts the food designer aims to use the new food technology to create natural , healthy , sustainable and nutrient rich food that can not be made with traditional production methods
the food designer hopes her concept will change the way we view and consume food in the future the new food technology will create natural , healthy , sustainable , and nutrient rich food that can not be made using traditional production methods after it has been printed , the consumer takes it home and within three to five days , it will develop into a complete dish that contains all the nutrients a the body needs
