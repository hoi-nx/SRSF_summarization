a oklahoma student has claimed today that the sick racist chant that brought national disgust on the sae fraternity is a longstanding tradition among brothers at the organization
a student spoke out to the today show to say that she had heard the ' there will never be a n * * * * * in sae ' chant from members of the fraternity at least two years ago and that the brothers all thought it was a gas
' meanwhile , the national sae headquarters announced that it was investigating reports of other incidents at other chapters across the country
the sae fraternity was disbanded by the national headquarters and banned from campus by oklahoma officials ' several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders , and each of those instances will be investigated for further action , ' the fraternity said
however , the fraternity - which is now headquartered at northwestern university in evanston , illinois - denied claims that the racist song sung by oklahoma brothers was a widespread tradition
