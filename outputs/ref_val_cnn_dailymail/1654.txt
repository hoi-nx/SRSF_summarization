numerous coffees have been shared between jamie roberts and sexton in the cafes of paris but all cordialities will be pushed aside when wales take on ireland this weekend
jamie roberts describes sexton , the ireland no 10 and his metro team - mate , as an â angry man â who has become one of the world âs finest players under the tutorship of ronan oâgara
wales will be keeping close tabs on the fly - half on saturday and jamie roberts is planning to use his inside knowledge to minimise the 29 - year - old âs impact at the millennium stadium
metro 's jamie roberts is adamant wales can nullify the threat of club team - mate sexton â we are good mates in paris and he âs a guy who demands high standards , â said jamie roberts
â he is the commander - in - chief of the ireland team and a guy we need to stay one step ahead of
â ireland 's sexton has won his battle to be fit to face wales in the six nations on saturday few have attracted such far - flung praise during this year âs six nations as sexton , who has overcome a hamstring injury and is expected to be named in ireland âs starting xv at today âs team announcement
the leinsterman has an all - round repertoire but his kicking has been particularly important within the gameplan of ireland coach joe schmidt
off the back of a dominant breakdown , sexton was able to pin back england last week with his accurate footballing skills
ireland often rely on their choke - tackle routine in defence but the kiwi coach neglected it against england to avoid scrummaging against a powerful pack
it could return on saturday and jamie roberts is prepared for more tactical twists in cardiff
sexton was in fine form to inspire ireland to a 19 - 9 win over england in dublin last time out â they are happy to put bombs up in our 22 if they have to , â said jamie roberts
â throughout the week , gatland and his wales coaching staff have emphasised the importance of playing their own game
with sexton âs accuracy from the kicking tee , gatland must also ensure his players keep their penalty count to a minimum , having seen his side concede 37 in the opening rounds
he is hoping to reverse a worrying trend in cardiff , where the irish have lost only twice in 32 years , with retired back - row alan quinlan yesterday writing in his column that â wales do nât scare us like france and england â
â i âll never forget watching ireland win the grand slam in our stadium in 2009
