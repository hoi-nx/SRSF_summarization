five teenage girls who showed ' an interest ' in travelling to syria have been barred by a high court judge from travelling abroad
mr justice hayden today made the two 15 - year - olds and three 16 - year - olds wards of court - a move which prevents them from leaving the jurisdiction of england and wales
the five girls were made wards of court , which prevents them from leaving the british
mr justice hayden made the ruling today at the high court ( pictured ) after hearing the girls had ' shown an interest ' in travelling to syria the judge , who directed that the girls could not be identified although it is believed all five are from tower hamlets in london , also made orders removing their passports and those of a number of adults involved in their care
mr justice hayden told the hearing : ' but the risk contemplated here is as grave as it can be for it is common knowledge that so many have lost their lives in syria and so many have gone knowing that would be likely
the judge added he made the order to include the adults because of evidence that in at least one other case young girls had travelled on passports belonging to members of their family
he also said there was evidence suggesting that the family members in the case had not been full and frank with social services , and that the girls had been moving to a more radicalised position
the ruling comes just three days after the judge banned a 16 - year - old boy from brighton and hove city council from travelling abroad after his two elder brothers were killed fighting jihad in syria
the judge made the ruling after social services at brighton and hove city council raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers ' footsteps and travel to the war - torn region
the ruling prevents the teenager , who has dual libyan and british citizenship , from leaving england and wales
