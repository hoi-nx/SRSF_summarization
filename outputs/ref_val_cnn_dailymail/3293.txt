a woman has been left â gobsmacked â after a camera , packed with memories of her once in a lifetime trip to antarctica , is on its way back to her after she lost it three months ago on a snowy iceberg
photographer boz , from sydney , was on an impromptu two - week holiday to the remote region costing around $ 13,000 after being invited along by friends who had a spare place on their trip
she âd loaded her ipad up with episodes of american comedian ellen degeneres âs chat show to entertain her while travelling to antarctica and had been watching a robin williams episode with her fellow travellers in the moments before she lost her camera
packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg , surrounded by nothing but ice , snow , penguins and seals , ms boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to ellen degeneres on her white canon camera
i took the camera out of my pocket and said â everyone let âs do a very christmas from antarctica to ellen degeneres because she âs entertaining us at the bottom of the earth â , â ms boz explained
' nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera ! ' : this is the distinctive photo that helped tour operator staff identify boz from the photos on her lost camera moments after recording the festive message on december 12 , on day seven of her trip to earth 's southernmost continent , ms boz got up to go to the â bathroom â
â the ship started to pull away and i thought â where is the camera ? where is the camera ? â and we thought â no we were going to send it to ellen degeneres ! â , â ms boz laughed
before departing on the ship to antarctica , ms boz and the rest of her tour group had mugshots taken at the port in ushuaia , argentina â the southernmost city in the world - where they sailed from
