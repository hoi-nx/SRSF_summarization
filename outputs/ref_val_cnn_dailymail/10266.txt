it was on december 21 â the day liverpool began their unbeaten run â that a bloke dressed as jesus christ held a sign at anfield that read : ' brendan , i 've got your back ! ' yet divine intervention has nothing to do with it
it is brendan rodgers that has resurrected liverpool by throwing out the old system and implementing the new
a man dressed as jesus christ was spotted at anfield during liverpool 's 2 - 2 draw with arsenal in december liverpool 's unbeaten run in the premier league began on december 21 at anfield in a 2 - 2 draw with arsenal liverpool 's bandaged - up defender martin skrtel ( right ) celebrates scoring against arsenal as the run began the turning point was at old trafford on december 14 when brendan rodgers finally released his grasp on 4 - 2 - 3 - 1
they lost 3 - 0 in their 3 - 4 - 3 experiment , but that by no means tells the story
at least they were n't as cramped as they were against basle the week before ( shown below , left ) , where right - back glen johnson ( no 2 ) drifted inside and sterling ( no 31 ) led the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation
dec 06 - liverpool 0 - 0 sunderland - 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 dec 09 - liverpool 1 - 1 basle - 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 dec 14 - manchester united 3 - 0 liverpool - 3 - 4 - 3 dec 17 - bournemouth 1 - 3 liverpool - 3 - 4 - 3 dec 21 - liverpool 2 - 2 arsenal - 3 - 4 - 3 dec 26 - burnley 0 - 1 liverpool - 3 - 4 - 3 liverpool played 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 against basle on dec 9 ( left ) with right - back glen johnson ( no 2 ) drifting inside and sterling ( no 31 ) up front ... but they switched to 3 - 4 - 3 against manchester united on dec 14 ( right ) sterling sees his shot saved by manchester united goalkeeper david de gea at old trafford on december 14 it took just 25 seconds for manchester united to go up the other end for wayne rooney to score the opener ( pictured ) manchester united 's mata was offside by more than a yard but the goal counted as the linesman failed to notice mata runs away in celebration while jones , having replaced mignolet , looks towards the linesman liverpool 's average positions in their latest win against burnley shows they still play 3 - 4 - 3 even though liverpool were hit for three by manchester united , they persisted with 3 - 4 - 3 in the next game against bournemouth in the capital one cup quarter - final , and have done since
it 's helped them get 29 points since christmas , while merseyside rivals everton have just 28 in total for the season
just look at their 2 - 0 win against burnley on wednesday , for example ( shown right )
manchester city had 51 per cent against liverpool at anfield , yet lost 2 - 1
southampton had 60 per cent , and lost 2 - 0
gerrard pictured doing keepie uppies during liverpool 's training session at melwood on friday gerrard runs with the ball as he looks to help his team continue their fine form following his injury liverpool have claimed 29 points since christmas , while rivals everton have 28 in total for the season liverpool manager brendan rodgers made the switch from 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 to 3 - 4 - 3 on december 14 and it 's worked ' we have restructured the team and organised the team in a different way , ' brendan rodgers said last month , ' to get that solidity back and get the balance back both offensively and defensively
since then , liverpool have conceded the least ( 6 ) in the premier league and have the best goal difference ( +15 )
no surprise , then , that a table since december 26 puts them top ( 29 points ) ahead of arsenal ( 27 ) and , remarkably , stoke city ( 23 )
mignolet makes a save during liverpool 's comfortable 2 - 0 win over burnley at anfield on wednesday night mignolet was dropped for jones against manchester united in december , but returned to the first team on boxing day yet should we expect anything less ? brendan rodgers has a knack for upping the ante , after all
in 2012 - 13 , liverpool averaged 1.47 points per game between august and december , rising to 2.5 between january and may
only wolfsburg ( 2.67 ) better that out of every club in the premier league , la liga , serie a , bundesliga and ligue 1 , yet liverpool have played three more games
and if they maintain their 2.56 average , liverpool would end up with 77 points â enough for them to qualify for the champions league in nine out of the past 10 years
without him , they average 1.3 goals per game , 1.5 points and their win percentage is a measly 42.1
henderson has captained liverpool eight times in the premier league since november 29 , winning seven and drawing one
brendan rodgers has a man for every occasion , and it 's clicking at the right time
gerrard led liverpool to champions league glory against ac milan in 2005 but is leaving for the mls soon henderson has been in inspired form for liverpool and struck sensational goals in his last two games henderson has led the team in gerrard 's absence as liverpool have made a charge for the top four if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it
their luck with 3 - 4 - 3 â arguably 3 - 4 - 2 - 1 on occasion â may well run out , because imperfections will always be there
