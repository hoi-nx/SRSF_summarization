scientists have developed a necklace dubbed the â diet choker â that monitors everything that goes down your throat - and sends you an alert if you overeat
wearsens is a metal ring that goes around your neck and has a sensor which uses the vibrations in your throat to tell when you are eating and drinking
the researchers behind the device have linked it up to a smartphone app which buzzes if you go over your daily calorie limit
scientists have combined wearsens , a metal ring that goes around the neck ( above ) to monitor eating , with a smartphone app which counts calories it also lets you know if you eat too much of the wrong kind of food
the device was developed by engineers at the ucla , los angeles and so far the tests on 30 people show that the it does work
the ucla team said the wearsens works because each food makes a distinctive pattern of vibrations in the neck so the device is able to work out what it is you are consuming using a piezoelectric sensor , which measures changes in pressure or force
wearsens co-founder majid sarrafzadeh said : â many nutrition methods are based on writing down what you eat
scientists are hopeful the technology will also tell users when they are eating the wrong types of food ( file image ) in a demonstration posted on youtube , the device asks for the user âs age , height , weight and their goal such as to lose weight or stay the same
the wearsens is the latest example of the growing industry of wearable tech and comes on the day that apple is due to release details of its long - awaited smart watch
