when alison norris could n't find work in detroit , she searched past city limits , ending up with a part - time restaurant job 20 miles away , which takes at least two hours to get to using public transportation
norris has to take two buses to her job at a suburban mall in troy , michigan , using separate city and suburban bus systems
for many city residents with limited skills and education , detroit is an employment desert , having lost tens of thousands of blue - collar jobs in manufacturing cutbacks and service jobs as the population dwindled
mayor mike duggan , however , has made rebuilding the population and creating jobs and training programs some of detroit 's priorities now that the city is out of bankruptcy
norris says there are too few jobs in the city but those jobs may not materialize quickly enough for norris and others who 've found local prospects slim , and the lack of reliable public transit is an obstacle that 's driving even those who 've stuck it out to consider leaving
' there no jobs in detroit , ' said norris , 26 , waiting in 16 - degree temperatures for the first of two buses to the somerset collection mall in troy , where she makes $ 8.25 an hour as a bistro hostess
' if it 's no jobs , then why stay in the city ? ' said norris
many residents without cars â about 40 per cent of detroit 's population , according to federal figures â often enter low - paying retail or sales positions far outside the city
the number of detroit residents who work outside the city is nearly double the number with jobs inside the city , according to statistics from regional planning organization semcog ( semgoc )
more than 228,000 detroit residents commute beyond the city limits , while only about 115,000 people who live in detroit also work in the city , semcog says
inner - ring suburbs are the primary work destinations for detroit residents
detroit mayor mike duggan has said that his priorities for detroit are rebuilding the population and creating jobs and training programs
the population of detroit has decreased to 680,000 from 1.8million in the 1950s a regional transportation system â separate from detroit 's and primarily serving the suburbs â also has struggled with funding
the bus routes still provide a cobbled - together lifeline for those like norris , who said she 'd prefer to work in detroit
her desire to one day move closer to where the jobs are collides with mike duggan 's hopes to spur growth in the city , whose population has fallen to 680,000 from a high of 1.8million in the 1950s
' mike duggan has said detroit is working on training programs to prepare residents for skilled jobs in the city
