' divisive ' : patients are left in corridors outside wards they should be in while waiting for a free bed hospitals are being encouraged to park seriously ill patients on trolleys in corridors to ease the a&e crisis
doctors say the controversial practice of â boarding â â which amounts to letting wards overflow â is already being used at a number of under - pressure hospitals in england
it involves putting patients on trolleys outside the wards they should be in while they wait for a free bed instead of keeping them in a&e
as a result , doctors at the influential royal college of emergency medicine ( royal college of emergency medicine ) have now given boarding their backing
but critics question its safety , amid fears that giving the green light to boarding could serve to legitimise overflowing nhs wards
dr boyle , an a&e consultant at addenbrooke âs hospital in cambridge and a prominent royal college of emergency medicine member , argued it was better to have patients waiting on corridor trolleys , after they had been seen and assessed , than languishing outside a&e in queuing ambulances
between mid-december and mid-january , there were 11,203 occasions across england â more than 350 a day â in which ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because a&es were full
dr boyle was speaking at a conference organised by the royal college of emergency medicine , which is advocating greater use of boarding
on 11,203 occasions across england â more than 350 a day â ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because a&es were full emergency doctors also see boarding as a way of making their hospital colleagues realise the problems they are facing
