' miss chloe inman claims she developed severe amnesia nearly two years ago after suffering serious side effects from a lumbar puncture to remove fluid from her spine - after suffering severe headaches miss chloe inman had always suffered bad headaches but it was not until just before her 15th birthday that medical staff diagnosed her with idiopathic intracranial hypertension
she suffered the severe memory loss after doctors performed a lumbar puncture and found she had twice as much fluid in her spine than usual
miss chloe inman , who lives in plymouth , devon with her parents julie , 41 , daryl , 42 , sister ellie , nine and caleb , now seven , said she was awake throughout the procedure
' i did n't recognise my mum or my family
' chloe inman was sent home from hospital to try to re-jog her memories
but it was only the hug from her brother brought all her family memories back
miss chloe inman now wants to raise awareness of her rare condition which she said has ruined her ' entire school life ' i had to fight the memory loss and now i remember nearly everything that i could n't remember before and my life is slowly getting back together
' chloe inman is now on a drug called acetazolamide to help reduce the fluid in her back - and has fortunately not suffered from any headaches now for a year
' but they know that if it comes back to perform a lumbar puncture as a quick solution - but i 'm terrified i could lose all my memory again
