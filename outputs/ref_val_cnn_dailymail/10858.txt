just when you thought echidna puggles could n't get any cuter one shown being cared for at taronga zoo in sydney has upped the charm factor
a wildlife hospital supervisor said it was only around 30 days old when it was brought in
tiny , bald and has no spines , the puggle was found on a walking track at anna bay in the hunter region of new south wales and taken to taronga zoo
it still would have been in mum âs pouch at that time
when they get a bit older â 10 to 15 days older â they are left in a burrow , ' the wildlife hospital supervisor explained in a zoo video
â the puggle just sucked milk out of the palm of the wildlife hospital supervisor âs hand as the mother echida does not have any teats only milk patches which the baby puggle drinks from
â at the moment i âm keeping it in a small esky just to keep it at the right temperature
the esky is really good at keeping that constant temperature , â the wildlife hospital supervisor said
