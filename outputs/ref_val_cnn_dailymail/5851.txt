dr selby said she was left ' speechless ' at the ' blatant sexism ' of pure gym after she was locked out of the female changing rooms a doctor has accused a gym chain of â blatant sexism â for assuming she must be a man because of her profession
but the pin repeatedly failed to work on the door to the women âs changing room because the membership management system was programmed to register anyone with the title â dr â as male
dr selby said she was â outraged â when she asked staff for help at the pure gym in cambridge and was told what the problem was
â dr selby , 31 , from balsham , cambridgeshire , sent a complaint to the gym âs twitter account after having to ask other women to let her into the locker room for several weeks
dr selby said she had experienced sexism in the past with people assuming she is a nurse or secretary because of her sex and says there a need for change
ceo of puregym , humphrey cobbold , said ; ' we would like to apologise for the inconvenience and frustration caused to dr selby and any other female doctors who may have been affected
dr selby was told by staff at the gym that the code she was given to get into the women 's changing rooms would n't work because all people with the title ' dr ' are automatically registered as men the gym said the error was down to a ' glitch ' in its system and that staff were looking into the issue ' it is very unfortunate that an error between two of the systems we use gave the appearance that all doctors are male and we are working to ensure that this does not happen again
