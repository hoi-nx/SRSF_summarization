it may not provide the answer to life , the universe and everything , but when the lhc at geneva 's cern starts up again this month , particle physicists are planning to give this question their best shot
having finally nailed down the elusive higgs boson particle in 2013 -- the elementary particle that has unlocked some of the universe 's longest - standing secrets -- physicists are now on the trail of dark matter
and with the lhc ( lhc ) -- the 27km ( 17 mile ) circumference particle accelerator that occupies a tunnel on the franco - swiss border -- now tricked out with new magnets , more powerful energy beams and a tighter vacuum , scientists are hoping to shine a light on some of the universe 's more arcane phenomena
" higgs was the final piece of the jigsaw of what we call the standard model of particle physics , " dr lamont , operations group leader at the facility , told cnn
" " one of the big things we know is out there -- but we do n't yet understand -- is dark matter
" dark matter is currently a hypothesis
it is a type of matter that ca n't be seen but whose presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter , radiation and even the very structure of the universe
physicists believe this unseen material makes up about 85 percent of all the matter in the universe
regular matter , which we are made of along with all the stars , planets and other tangible cosmic material , accounts for just around 4 percent of the mass - energy of the known universe
particle physicists will no doubt be on the edge of their seats when the new souped - up collider is put through its paces this month , although it can take months for the data to be processed
" there are a number of theories that give you dark matter candidates -- one of the favourites is supersymmetry , " lamont said , adding that the team got no sign of it at all in the facility 's first three - year run
" what the physicists are hoping is that with the step up in energy we will be able to explore a bit more of parameter space and that something dramatically new will show up
the energy of collisions in the lhc in 2015 will be 13 tev ( teraelectron volt ) compared with 8 tev in 2012 during its last run
while the facility is a big industrial user of power -- about 180mw when it 's running at full tilt -- it 's not quite powerful enough to dim the lights or send the air - conditioning down in surrounding areas
" we 're planning a major upgrade in 2023 - 25 -- there 'll be new more powerful focusing magnets installed and some other upgrades and this will allow us to multiply by five the number of collisions we can deliver
