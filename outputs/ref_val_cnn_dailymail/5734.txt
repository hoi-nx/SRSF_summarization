the labour leadership blocked karie murphy , a unite candidate , from the labour shortlist for the marginal seat of halifax the tweet about harriet harman from a senior unnamed official at unite , britain âs most powerful trade union , was short and menacing : â she will have to answer for her actions in due course
â the threat this week was made in response to the labour leadership blocking karie murphy , a unite candidate , from the labour shortlist for the marginal seat of halifax
and the reason for their fury at the deputy leader of the labour party ? the list was agreed by an ad - hoc three - strong committee chaired by harman
and that committee was given a clear instruction by miliband : block karie murphy at all costs
relations between miliband and the union were put under further strain when linda riordan , the retiring labour mp , accused the party leadership of dirty tricks
she has made a formal protest to iain mcnicol , labour âs general secretary
but the heavyweight the front bench should be really worried about is len mccluskey , the general secretary of unite , who is enraged by the actions of miliband and harman
the snub to flame - haired karie murphy , a comprehensive school - educated nhs nurse , is deeply personal to len mccluskey - who was married but is no longer with his wife
len mccluskey and karie murphy - who is separated from her husband - are very close friends
indeed , some people in the labour movement have asked - rightly or wrongly - if they are more than just friends
it âs also personal for len mccluskey because harman is a member of unite , and she presided over the blocking of their candidate
so why was the usually clueless miliband so determined to stop karie murphy ? the answer is to be found far to the north of halifax , in falkirk , where karie murphy âs candidacy in the labour selection process in 2013 triggered a vote - rigging scandal so serious the police were called in by miliband
after the falkirk row , miliband - who pointedly refused to apologise to karie murphy â announced reforms to the party âs links with the unions
furious : len mccluskey ( pictured ) , the general secretary of unite , is enraged by the actions of miliband and harman but that attempt at firm leadership came at a price , and the response from unite was swift and damaging
now , miliband has crossed len mccluskey again and â only weeks before the general election â senior unite officials are privately plotting how to wreak their revenge for the latest rebuff to karie murphy âs parliamentary ambitions
miliband can ill - afford to make an enemy of len mccluskey and unite , for no other modern labour leader has had to rely so heavily on one union to ensure the financial survival of the party
since miliband became leader , unite has given labour an astonishing Â£ 14.3 million
one senior labour figure said : â it will just take the word from len mccluskey for the activists to stay at home , and then our marginal seats operation is in big trouble
â unite , whose block vote swung the leadership for miliband over his brother david in 2010 , has an enormous , and some labour mps say â unhealthy â , sway over the party
miliband ( pictured ) can ill - afford to make an enemy of len mccluskey and unite , for no other modern labour leader has had to rely so heavily on one union to ensure the financial survival of the party unite has also handed Â£ 428,000 directly to shadow cabinet members
since he became general secretary of unite in january 2011 , len mccluskey , according to the union âs own data , has had 11 official meetings with the labour leader - though it is not known how often they talk on the telephone or meet in private
unite âs paw prints can be seen on a number of policies which miliband has announced
the matter is personal for len mccluskey because harman ( pictured9 is a member of unite , and she presided over the blocking of their candidate
but despite the agreements on left - wing policy , the row over karie murphy threatens to overshadow labour âs election campaign
â harriet harman insisted on an all - women shortlist for halifax , but was adamant karie murphy was nât on it
â the halifax labour party is due to choose a candidate from a six - strong shortlist on saturday , at which point the party leadership will be hoping the rancour over the latest campaign selection battle will fade away
