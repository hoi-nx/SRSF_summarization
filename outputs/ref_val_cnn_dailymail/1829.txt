writing in his memoir , the purple revolution , which is being serialised in the telegraph , nigel farage wrote : ' several doctors examined me - registrars , locums , all that lot - and they came to the conclusion that i had a twisted testicle
' an indian doctor told me that the bromley doctors had got it all wrong : i had an infection
all the time , my left testicle was getting markedly larger
' mr nigel farage said that six weeks later he was having difficulty walking and his ' left testicle was as large as a lemon and rock hard '
eventually mr nigel farage said he sought an opinion from a private consultant who diagnosed cancer
on the day of the 2010 general election , mr nigel farage said a plane crash during a publicity stunt and an earlier car crash has left him with the body of a 70 - year - old.d
