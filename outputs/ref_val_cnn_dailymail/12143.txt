the deputy prime minister accused his boss of a â downton abbey attitude â after he brought an end to years of negotiations on the terms of debates
mr david cameron claimed he was â unblocking the logjam â by agreeing to take part in one contest featuring seven party leaders but ruling out two further debates
david cameron tonight insisted he was not putting obstacles in the way of televised leaders ' debates mr david cameron insisted he was not putting obstacles in the way of televised leaders ' debates after he was accused of treating the public with ' lofty pomposity ' by telling tv bosses how the debates are going to happen

at prime minister âs questions in 2008 , mr david cameron also suggested mr gordon brown was â frightened â of tv debates
labour leader ed miliband said that the prime minister was ' cowering from the public ' , after downing street rejected broadcasters ' proposals for three tv debates during the election campaign and made a ' final offer ' of a single 90 - minute show featuring at least seven party leaders to take place before the official start of the campaign on march 30
mr ed miliband added the prime minister was â running away from the face - to - face debate with me that he said he wanted and that the public deserve â
nick clegg leader nick clegg said that he was willing to take the pm 's place in the one - on - one debate with mr ed miliband if mr david cameron refused to turn up for the clash , scheduled to be shown on sky and channel 4 on april 30 - exactly a week before the may 7 election
he was accused of treating the public like downton abbey 's lord grantham by telling tv bosses how the debates are going to happen mr nick clegg said he was ' bemused by the lofty pomposity of the conservatives ' adding : ' they 're behaving as if they 're ordering a drink in the drawing room of downton abbey
' but labour dismissed the suggestion as ' ridiculous ' , suggesting that the deputy prime minister should instead debate with their deputy leader harriet harman
mr nick clegg said he was ' bemused by the lofty pomposity of the conservatives ' adding : ' they 're behaving as if they 're ordering a drink in the drawing room of downton abbey ' the electoral reform society said it would be a ' national embarrassment ' if the debates did not go ahead
speaking during a visit to staffordshire , the prime minister insisted he had been ' completely consistent ' on the debates , saying : ' i have n't put hurdles in the way , the broadcasters came up with a series of proposals that other people realised were flawed
labour leader ed miliband said that the prime minister was ' cowering from the public ' ' then we can actually do what needs to be done , which is to get round the country during the election campaign
' mr ed miliband said he was ready to debate the prime minister ' any time , any place , anywhere '
' meanwhile , mr nick clegg said he would happily take his coalition partner 's place and spare the nation from an ' ed miliband monologue '
as well as the april 30 two - leader clash , the broadcasters have proposed seven - way debates also involving mr nick clegg and the leaders of ukip , the greens , plaid cymru and the snp on itv on april 2 and bbc on april 16
farage accused the prime minister of having ' sabotaged the whole thing ' while nick clegg said he was prepared to take the prime minster 's place in a one - to - one debate against ed miliband asked if he thought mr david cameron was running scared , mr farage said : ' yes , he is
' the ukip leader told itv 's loose women : ' i suspect , had it been a four - headed debate , there are one or two conversations i wanted to have with the prime minister that i do n't think he would have been able to answer
people want to see a set of debates between all major party leaders , yet the prime minister is clearly scared of scrutiny
' i have to say to the prime minister that if he really thinks that these exchanges once a week are a substitute for a proper television debate , then he is even more out of touch than i thought â¦ i have to ask him : what on earth is he frightened of ? ' - david cameron to gordon brown at pmqs , 2008 ' what i have done is to unblock the logjam the broadcasters helped to create and said let âs get on and have the debate that i think matters the most , which is the one that gives everybody a say , and let âs get on with it before the campaign
' - david cameron , 2015 ' compared to other advanced democracies around the world , britain has been extremely late to the party when it comes to tv debates
however we have accepted the broadcasters ' proposals , and believe we should stick with that , rather than allow a conservatives prime minister to dictate the terms of debate
