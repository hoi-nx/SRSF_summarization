schools in ny have decided to observe two muslim holidays and close schools for them
why not add muslim holidays to the list ? conservative family research council president perkins went predictably apoplectic , saying that it was evidence of " discrimination " against christians
" i hate to ally myself with such people , but i sort of agree that mayor blasio 's decision is a bad one
i simply find it to be a problematic endorsement of religion by the secular state
" because of that , i support measures that tell muslim that they are our brothers and sisters , too
first of all , virtually every recognized religion is practiced in ny
christians , jews and muslim have their holidays off , but what about ny 's other religions ? what about my religion ? march 6 has long been " the day , " and as a dudeist minister , should i not demand respect for my beliefs , by insisting that the school district " take ' er easy " on that date every year ? flying spaghetti monster is a recognized religion
by selecting only three " approved " religions for respect , we send the message that we value the beliefs of some over those of others
such a mentality has no place in a secular country -- even if we have a history of recognizing some abrahamic religions ' holidays
in lemon , 403 u.s. 602 ( 1971 ) , the u.s. supreme court gave us a three - part test to determine whether governmental conduct violates the establishment clause : ( 1 ) the governmental action must have a secular purpose , ( 2 ) it must have a principal or primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion , and ( 3 ) it may not foster an excessive governmental entanglement with religion
de blasio should have used this opportunity to change direction , and state that there would be no official religious holidays â that selecting just the abrahamic vein of religion as officially recognized by the state is simply improper
for example , in some school districts in ny , 60 % of the students were absent on chinese new year
i see no problem with kids taking religious days off , if their family 's beliefs require them to
but what blasio did here was wrong
montgomery county , maryland , officials handled it the right way ; they removed all mention of religious holidays on their 2015 - 16 school calendar , including rosh hashana and christmas
myself , i intend to continue to observe the day of the dude every year by takin ' er easy for all you sinners
