scientists have revealed a huge breakthrough in the search for life on other planets
nasa 's cassini spacecraft has provided scientists the first clear evidence that saturnian 's moon enceladus exhibits signs of present - day hydrothermal activity - similar to that seen in the deep oceans on earth
hydrothermal activity occurs when seawater infiltrates and reacts with a rocky crust and emerges as a heated , mineral - laden solution , a natural occurrence in earth 's oceans
according to two science papers , the results are the first clear indications an icy moon may have similar ongoing active processes
cassini team member hsu of the university of colorado at boulder in boulder used spacecraft observations and computer modeling to show that the plume is connected to what 's happening on the lunar sea floor
judging by their size and makeup , the team believes particles in the plume are the result of hot water coming into contact with rocks on the ocean floor
some particles settle around saturnian , replenishing its biggest ring
that activity would make the moon an even more attractive place in the hunt for microbial life
on earth , scientists have found weird life forms living in hydrothermal vents on the ocean bottom where there 's no sunlight
' these findings add to the possibility that enceladus , which contains a subsurface ocean and displays remarkable geologic activity , could contain environments suitable for living organisms , ' said john grunsfeld astronaut and associate administrator of nasa 's science mission directorate in washington
' the locations in our solar system where extreme environments occur in which life might exist may bring us closer to answering the question : are we alone in the universe
' hydrothermal activity occurs when seawater infiltrates and reacts with a rocky crust and emerges as a heated , mineral - laden solution , a natural occurrence in earth 's oceans
according to two science papers , the results are the first clear indications an icy moon may have similar ongoing active processes
the first paper , published this week in the journal nature , relates to microscopic grains of rock detected by cassini in the saturnian system
an extensive , four - year analysis of data from the spacecraft , computer simulations and laboratory experiments led researchers to the conclusion the tiny grains most likely form when hot water containing dissolved minerals from the moon 's rocky interior travels upward , coming into contact with cooler water
cassini 's cosmic dust analyzer ( cassini cda ) instrument repeatedly detected miniscule rock particles rich in silicon , even before cassini entered saturnian 's orbit in 2004
from seafloor to outer space , a distance of about 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) , the grains spend a few months to a few years in transit , otherwise they would grow much larger
the team found that , at the high pressures expected in the moon 's ocean , icy materials called clathrates could form that imprison methane molecules within a crystal structure of water ice
gravity science results published in 2014 strongly suggested the presence of a 6 - mile - ( 10 - kilometer - ) deep ocean beneath an ice shell about 19 to 25 miles ( 30 to 40 kilometers ) thick .
