socialist politician olivier veran , who is also neurologist at the university hospital of grenoble , is demanding that fashion bosses who hire underweight girls be punished with six months in prison or fines of up to â¬ 75,000 ( Â£ 60,000 )
' there are now 40,000 people in france suffering from anorexia , around 90 percent of whom are adolescents , mr olivier veran said
medical experts around the world have warned against the dangers of ultra-skinny catwalk models and images airbrushed to make girls look thinner , which they say encourage anorexia in girls as young as six
