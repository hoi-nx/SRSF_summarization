microsoft co-founder paul allen plans to live - stream an underwater tour of a wreck off the philippines coast that 's believed to be the remains of a long - lost world war ii japan battleship
paul allen , a philanthropist , said last week that he and his research team had discovered the wreck of the musashi , which was once one of the two largest warships in the world
now , they 're planning to take viewers on a real - time tour of the wreck with the unmanned submersible they used to find it at a depth of around 1 kilometer ( 3,280 feet )
the live - stream is scheduled to start at 9 a.m. friday , philippines time ( 9 p.m. thursday , et )
the ship sank on october 24 , 1944 , during the battle of the sibuyan sea , part of the battle of leyte gulf in the central philippines
navy dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times , but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the musashi
last week , he tweeted images of the wreck , including one that he said showed the bow of the ship -- featuring a distinctive chrysanthemum , the emblem of japan 's royal family -- and a big anchor
robert kraft , director of subsea operations for paul allen 's vulcan company , who will provide commentary during the live - stream , spoke more about the process
" todaka , the director of japan 's kure maritime museum , said last week after viewing the information posted by paul allen that it appeared that the vessel was the musashi , although pictures of the entire body of the ship were needed to know for sure
todaka said , given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found , he was " 90 % sure " that the ship was the musashi
" todaka said paul allen 's team had been in contact with the museum about the expedition and the ship 's potential location
