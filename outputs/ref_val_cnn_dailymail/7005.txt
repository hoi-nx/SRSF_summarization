savers should be stopped from cashing in their pensions until the age of 60 to prevent them running out of money , mps have warned
the commons work and pensions committee warned that rules allowing people to dip into their pensions from the age of 55 could create ' unrealistic expectations ' about the age at which they can afford to stop work
reforms of pensions , which take effect next month , give savers discretion over their pensions from the age of 55 , rising to 57 in 2028
government officials warn that allowing people to start dipping into their pension by the time they reach 55 will create unrealistic impressions about when they can afford to stop working but the committee recommended that access to retirement funds should only be granted ' five years before the state pension age '
dame anne begg , the labour chairman of the committee , said savers would waste the tax breaks provided by the government unless they were forced to wait until their 60s
she said : ' our view is that , given the significant tax relief provided to pensions , increased longevity , and the importance of ensuring people do not underestimate the income needed in retirement , the minimum age at which people can access their pension saving , except on ill health grounds , should rise to five years below the state pension age
dame anne begg said savers would waste tax breaks provided by the government unless they were forced to wait until their 60s as a result of reforms announced by chancellor george osborne in his last budget , from next month savers will no longer be required to buy an annuity - providing a regular annual income - when they cash in their pension pot. the committee said that while the measure had the potential to encourage more retirement saving by making it more attractive , there were also dangers involved
' this lack of trust has been exacerbated by the pensions industry 's poor record on acting in savers ' best interests when they access their pension pots , particularly in relation to annuities , ' the report said
' the committee chair , dame anne begg said : ' savers need to be properly protected from being ripped off in frauds or scams , or suffering financial loss from making the wrong decision about how to use their pension pots
