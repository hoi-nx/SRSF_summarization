when an officer kills an unarmed suspect , the question arises time and again : can a police department investigate a high - stakes case involving one of its own , without bias ? for wisconsin residents decrying the death of unarmed teen tony robinson , the question is n't even an issue
we have a new law here in wisconsin where departments are no longer conducting their own internal investigations for officer - involved shootings , " madison mayor paul soglin said
in fact , wisconsin is one of only two states with such legislation
and that brings some comfort to tony robinson 's family
" i trust wisconsin and the way they 're handling the investigation , " tony robinson 's uncle turin carter told reporters
" wisconsin 's law , which was enacted just last april , requires " an investigation that is conducted by at least two investigators ... neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer - involved death
if the district attorney determines there are no grounds to prosecute the officer involved , then the investigators must release their report to the public
connecticut 's law requires the state 's division of criminal justice with investigating any deadly force by law enforcement , according to the ncsl
after that , connecticut 's division of criminal justice must submit a report to the state 's chief attorney detailing whether the use of deadly force was appropriate
while such laws are rather novel , a dozen other states have proposed measures about appointing special prosecutors for , or providing independent investigation in , officer - involved deaths , according to the ncsl
" having laws that require an outside agency to investigate would actually help police and prosecutors , " she said
robbins thinks it 's best to let a unit of prosecutors within the attorney general 's office to review police - involved shootings rather than create an entirely new outside agency
cnn legal analyst and former new york prosecutor callan said there are several reasons why outside entities , such as special prosecutors , are n't tasked with reviewing police shootings
it 's also very costly to create parallel investigative structures just for police shootings , he said , and when budgets are already stretched thin , the idea of creating a new bureaucracy is n't appealing
" though wisconsin 's law has been in place for less than a year , it has already been applied in another officer - related killing
tony robinson 's death stirred memories of two other unarmed men killed by police : brown , who was shot by officer darren wilson in ferguson , missouri , and garner , who died at the hands of new york police officer daniel pantaleo
but there are stark differences between tony robinson 's case and the two others
after brown 's death in august , thomas jackson police chief thomas jackson asked the neighboring st. louis county police department to investigate
the case was not investigated by the state and was referred to a grand jury -- just like in garner 's case
" tony robinson 's case wo n't just by handled by state investigators ; it 'll go through another layer of scrutiny by the district attorney 's office , koval said
" the state of wisconsin 's division of criminal investigation ( dci ) has the exclusive authority to investigate all elements of the officer involved shooting -- forensics , interviews , technology feeds , etc. , " koval wrote on his official blog
the task force 's interim report , released this month , calls for independent investigations and independent special prosecutors in officer - related deaths
