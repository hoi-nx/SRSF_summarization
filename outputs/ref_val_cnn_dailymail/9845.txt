a new itv programme that appears to show members of the public being hypnotised has been branded a fraud by experts
contestants in you âre back in the room compete for cash prizes after being put in a trance by a hypnotist who claims to have â hacked â into their minds
but the last thing a show like this wants is people who are relaxed â as they would nât be able to perform as required
in a trance : experts have questioned whether contestants on new show you 're back in the room , pictured above , are really hypnotised liz mcelligott , chief executive of the national hypnotherapy society said : â the programme sounds sensationalist to me
â it would worry me if vulnerable people are playing along because they want to be on television
â itv selected contestants via auditions , and one who failed to get a place tweeted : â my conclusion is that they are looking for people who purposely carry on for the camera because it will make great tv
â itv , which will air the four - part series from next saturday , said ; â duty of care to the contestants was always of paramount importance
