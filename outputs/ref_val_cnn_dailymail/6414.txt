facebook must face a nationwide class - action lawsuit seeking to force the social media company to provide refunds when children spend their parents ' money on its website without permission , a federal judge has said
a california judge said a class of plaintiffs estimated in the hundreds of thousands may press their claim that facebook should change how it handles online transactions by minors the lawsuit was brought by two children and their parents
facebook said it believes the lawsuit lacks merit , and said it will defend itself vigorously
the april 2012 lawsuit said facebook let children use their parents ' credit and debit cards to buy the virtual currency facebook credits , and violated california law by refusing refunds under its ' all sales are final ' policy when the parents complained
in opposing class certification , facebook said the plaintiffs ' claims were too disparate , and an injunction would not address them
' though some minors undoubtedly may wish to continue making purchases through credit or debit cards they do not have permission to use , such a desire can not prevent the named plaintiffs from bringing suit to demand that facebook 's policies comply with the law , ' she wrote
' the april 2012 lawsuit said facebook let children use theirparents ' credit and debit cards to buy the virtual currency facebook credits , and violated california law by refusingrefunds under its ' all sales are final ' policy when the parentscomplained
' the difference between facebook and other businesses is that the company is on actual notice of a user 's age , but treats children the same as adult users when it comes to taking their money
