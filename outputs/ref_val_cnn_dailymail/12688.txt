i was in florida last year when i got a call asking me to pose for a calendar
what ? a calendar ? as in sports illustrated swimsuit ? victoria 's secret angels ? cover girls
i agreed , and now i am ms. december
but it is n't quite what you think
she was an anchor at cnn headline news at a time when there were few india - america women in high - profile media jobs
she began by telling me her story
gandhi 's political career turned out to be less than stellar , but it was 1971 and i was not yet 9 years old
i have met women who were abducted and forced into prostitution or lived with physically and mentally abusive men
those problems are not limited to india or the rest of south asian
they exist in the immigrant communities in the america , in which abuse and crimes are underreported because of the stigma that still exists
women are often ashamed to talk about these things
as an india - america journalist , i have told stories with hopes of casting light on the world inhabited by many south asian women
it 's not hard to guess the rest of the story
instead of growing up in harsh surroundings , i was raised in a professor 's house
there is not a day that goes by when i do n't think about the life i might have led had it not been for that fateful meeting between an america missionary and a bengali woman pining to become a mother
i shared my story with tripathi and told her i would help
tripathi put together saris to suits as an empowerment tool
she wanted to raise money to help south asian women
she was putting together the 2015 saris to suits calendar and wanted to feature south asian women who had found success in america
i would be the only journalist in the calendar
some of the women opted to wear saris , the traditional dress of india
the 2014 calendar , the first one tripathi published , raised money for various organizations that help south asian women
based in atlanta , raksha provides support for the south asian community in a number of ways
most of its clients are women who are dealing with abusive marriages , divorce and issues with their children
raksha 's executive director , aparna bhattacharyya , told me why the calendar was important
" i think it is a reminder that there are women overcoming obstacles and that they have the potential to achieve their own goals for themselves , " she said
" i think it is powerful for young south asian women to see role models that look like themselves -- role models who are making change and following their dreams
" her words took me back to my school in kolkata where i gazed upward at indira gandhi 's face
maybe a young woman in a sari will be able to put on a suit for the first time in her life
besides , it 's kind of cool to be in a calendar .
