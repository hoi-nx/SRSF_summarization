a nasa mission designed to study the interaction of earth 's magnetic field and the sun launched this morning at 2:44am gmt ( last night at 10:44pm edt )
the magnetospheric multiscale ( mms ) mission will use four identical spacecraft to measure a mysterious process known as magnetic reconnection
by orbiting earth , the spacecraft will seek to understand how energy from the sun is funnelled in to the environment of not only our own but other planets , causing space weather such as aurorae
' i am speaking for the entire mms team when i say we 're thrilled to see all four of our spacecraft have deployed and data indicates we have a healthy fleet , ' said craig tooley , project manager at nasa 's goddard space flight center in greenbelt , maryland
the mms mission will help scientsits understand how this process is taking place in the environment around earth
this interaction transfers energy from the sun to earth 's environment , creating ' magnetic explosions ' when the magnetic field lines connect
at the other side of earth , away from the sun , the spacecraft will pass through a region where earth 's magnetic field lines combine , and produce a similar effect
they were stacked together for the launch ( illustrated ) the spacecraft will fly around earth in an elliptical orbit , travelling through two regions where magnetic reconnection is thought to be occurring
one of these is the side of earth nearest the sun , where plasma from the sun interacts with earth 's magnetosphere the process of magnetic reconnection can release bursts of energy ( illustrated ) that are as powerful as billions of megatons of tnt , which send particles surging through space at the speed of light
on earth , we can see the effects of this in the aurora at the poles magnetic reconnection can harm satellites ( illustrated ) and affect communications , so scientists are keen to understand more about the phenomenon the spacecraft will sturdy the former phenomenon for one and a half years , while the following science phase will focus on the latter phenomenon
' the mission will provide the first three - dimensional views of reconnection occurring in earth 's magnetic space environment
the four spacecraft will be placed in a pyramid formation ( illustrated ) , separated by distances of 6.2 to 62 miles ( 10 to 100km ) , in preparation for science observations that are scheduled to begin in early september the core of each spacecraft is about four feet ( 1.2 metres ) tall and 11 feet ( 3.4 metres ) wide , although with all of their booms and antennae deployed ( illustrated ) , they grow to 369 by 94ft ( 29 by 112 metres ) the mission will provide the first three - dimensional views of reconnection occurring in earth 's magnetic space environment ( illustrated )
scientists will use the data to also work out how the sun affects other planets , and also how the process takes place in other stars the data could also provide information on how magnetic reconnection occurs near black holes and neutron stars , and also at the edge of the solar system at the boundary of our sun 's influence and interstellar space
' mms is a crucial next step in advancing the science of magnetic reconnection â and no mission has ever observed this fundamental process with such detail , ' said jeff newmark , interim director for nasa 's heliophysics division at the agency 's headquarters in washington
