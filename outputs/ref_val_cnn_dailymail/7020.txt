china has seen the first successful flight of a commercial airplane powered by what 's probably the country 's biggest threat to food safety - waste cooking oil
the boeing - 800 aircraft , operated by hainan airlines , flew around 100 passengers from shanghai to bejiing
it meant china joined a handful of countries in the world that possess the research and development ability to create its own biofuel production technology , according to the people 's daily online
pioneer : hainan airlines flew a boeing like this one using a biofuel made from cooking oil but the fact that the new fuel was developed from waste cooking oil - which is in all too plentiful supply in china , leading to many problems with blocked drains and sewers - has prompted excitement in the country
' food safety : the illegal recycling of waste cooking oil is a constant headache for the china authorities fly greener : the government is seeking to promote greater environmental sustainability produced by sinopec , china 's state - owned oil and gas company , this particular biofuel uses restaurant waste cooking oil , often known as the ' gutter oil ' in china , as the raw material
the cooking oil is then blended at a one - to - one ratio with ordinary jet fuel to create the finished product
animal fat is the reason why waste cooking oil can be turned into biofuel
waste cooking oil is often collected by underground dealers in china
