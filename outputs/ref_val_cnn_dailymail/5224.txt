a frail pensioner who was snatched from a care home by his concerned family and flown to turkey to be cared for by his daughter died just five months after she was jailed by the court of protection
john maddocks , 80 , from stoke-on-trent , staffordshire , suffered from dementia and was first placed in a care home in 2009 while recovering from a bout of tuberculosis
however his daughter wanda , 52 , who was living in turkey at the time , had promised her father she would never allow him to be put into care and became frustrated with the situation
in the following years , until his death in january 2013 , she fought with the authorities to free him from the care home and even ended up imprisoned for six weeks under the secret court of protection
an inquest into the death of john maddocks , 80 , ( right ) , from stoke-on-trent , staffordshire , has heard how his daughter wanda , 52 ( left ) , was jailed for taking him out of a care home and to her turkey home in 2009 wanda told the hearing how she was desperate to free her father from the first care home because she claims it was an ' awful place for him to be ' and that he thought about taking his own life while there
her father was later moved to another staffordshire care home in november 2010 , but mr john maddocks apparently hated it just as much as the other homes
the following day , on boxing day 2010 , the three men went to the care home , got their father out of the fire door , took him for a meal and then called wanda
mr john maddocks ( above ) , who apparently hated being in care homes , died in hospital on january 8 , 2013 wanda said : ' two of my brothers got him out through the fire doors and they passed him to me and i took him to turkey
' mr john maddocks was made the subject of a deprivation of liberty safeguards order and taken into care again â at abbots house care home in abbey hulton , stoke - on - trent - while wanda was forced to attend more than 20 court hearings and be subjected to several psychiatric evaluations
her crime was contempt of court , for repeatedly breaking orders not to interfere with her father 's life at his care home
however , she believes her only crime was an act of compassion towards the father she loved and trying to keep a solemn promise to him to keep him out of care homes
following her release from prison , her father was moved to yet another care home in december 2012 before being taken into hospital for illness
wanda told the inquest today : ' my dad always said to me " do n't you ever put me in a care home " and i never forgot those words
she said her only crime was compassion towards her father the jury was also told how wanda was happy for her father to be in a nursing home â which provides additional care â but was n't satisfied with him being in a care home
however , staff at the care home told the inquest that mr john maddocks was being cared for in the right place at the time
