the retailer claimed the smart lg sets with 4k , starting at Â£ 849 , would allow customers to ' watch your favourite christmas movies in greater detail '
but the asa has ruled that this was exaggerated and misleading because no british tv channel is yet broadcasting in 4k
these broadcasts are currently only available via internet based subscription services such as netflix
false claims : pc world - pc world claimed that the smart lg sets , like the one pictured , would allow viewers to watch christmas movies in ' greater detail
' the asa found this to be ' exaggerated and misleading ' as no british tv channel is broadcasting in 4k yet pc world - pc world said the lg set has ' automatic upscaling ' to ensure images are sharper and clearer than on a normal 4k ultra hd set manufacturers including lg , samsung and sony have spent millions of pounds developing the technology â said to be four times sharper than existing hd tv
as such , owners of the sets would see an improvement in picture quality regardless of whether the broadcast was in 4k
but the asa said the advert failed to give evidence of how effective this would be , although it accepted images may well be better on lg sets
' because there was such limited native 4k content available in the british , we understood that any improvement in quality in films or programmes watched over the christmas period was unlikely to be achieved by the use of 4k technology specifically
