it has long been seen as a mythical and powerful city , lost for more than 2,000 years beneath the sea
explorers have traveled to crete , malta , sicily and santorini in search of the the mysterious metropolis of atlantis - described in detai by greek philosopher plato
but a computer expert has challenged these theories after he claimed the lost city did not sink at all , and said he had tracked down the site - to an area on land in morocco
the german computer expert formed his theory using mathematics to calculate the precise gps coordinates of the lost city
he meticulously gathered every detail he could from plato 's ' timaeus ' and ' critias ' which describes atlantis in detail and gives in total 51 clues about the mysterious city
crucially , it was also said to be 3,100 miles from athens
other clues were that atlantis was not in ancient western europe or asia and had very high and big mountains , with morocco having the atlas mountains
the site pinpointed by hubner had many of the 51 clues , including being surrounded by concentric circles hubner 's theory challenges previous ideas about atlantis , that it lies somewhere beneath the sea hubner marked the areas where more characteristics were present and came out with one region which had the most clues - the souss massa plain in morocco , about 100 miles south of marrakesh
this map of atlantis - oriented with south at the top - was drawn by 17th century scholar athanasius kircher , who pinpointed the mythical continent as being in the mid-atlantic before it was lost to the sea the site was in a desert basin just seven miles from the sea and in the centre was a small mound , similar to the raised area at the heart of the ancient city described by plato
surrounding it were circular dry riverbeds , matching plato 's description of the city being surrounded by concentric circles , which alternated between land and sea
' adams wrote : ' the measurements for the diameter of his outermost ring and distance of his capital from the atlantic varied by only about 10 percent from plato 's numbers
' the author also found support for hubner 's idea that rather than sinking into the ocean , atlantis was overwhelmed by a large wave
hubner had claimed that the idea of atlantis being beneath the sea was simply an example of the real elements of the story being lost over years of retelling
also morocco has historically not been examined by archaeologists , suggesting many undiscovered remains that may hold the key to the lost city could exist
the theory differs from many hypotheses that place atlantis as a lost city beneath the sea , as described by plato
according to plato 's account , written around 360bc , atlantis was a major sea power located in the atlantic
