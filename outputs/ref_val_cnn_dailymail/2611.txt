wood , the leader of plaid , said she would refuse to be part of a formal coalition with a labour committed to implementing austerity and replacing trident the leader of the welsh nationalists has vowed never to help prop up the conservatives in the event of a hung parliament - but could work with the snp to drag a labour government to the left
wood , the leader of plaid , said she would refuse to be part of a formal coalition with a labour committed to implementing austerity and replacing trident
but she said the election was ' an unprecedented opportunity ' to force the next government to give wales as much public spending per head of population as scotland
although miss wood is largely unknown outside of wales , this is set to change on thursday night when she takes part in an unprecedented seven - way leaders debate
launching her party âs manifesto in bangor , she said the election offers voters in wales an â unprecedented â opportunity to influence the direction of government policy if plaid holds the balance of power
miss wood said plaid was aiming to use any influence it gains to rebalance power and wealth away from the city of london and towards welsh communities
â this election provides wales with an unprecedented opportunity , â she told supporters
she said : â we 've said we 'll work and co-operate with the greens in england and the snp if the numbers â of course we 've got to have an election and it 's a matter for the people to decide - but depending on the numbers , if it 's in our interests to work with those other parties to secure the very best deal for wales , then we will
â miss wood ( left ) , scotland first minister nicola sturgeon and the green party leader natalie bennett ( right ) could unite after the election to keep david cameron out of downing street plaid , she said , had â no appetite â to see tory policies implemented by labour , adding : â so while we wo n't prop up a tory government , we wo n't back a labour government to implement austerity and trident replacement either
