the woes have increased for qpr , with the club fearing they will lose star striker austin in the summer and their accounts showing they could still face a financial fair play fine of nearly Â£ 58million
manager ramsey insists that austin will not be allowed to leave qpr for a paltry fee manager ramsey admitted that austin , whose contract runs out at the end of next season , could leave in the summer , but is adamant they will not let him go for a paltry fee
hodgson was at loftus road to see austin score a fine strike against arsenal 10 days ago , despite qpr losing
austin has been offered a new deal at loftus road but will wait until the end of the season to make a decision to make matters worse , the club âs financial accounts for the 2013 - 14 season when they were in the championship , filed at companies house on friday , show that their â real â losses last season were almost Â£ 70m
earlier this month , qpr announced they had made a loss of Â£ 9.8m but the accounts now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of owners â mainly tony fernandes â wrote off Â£ 60m of old loans in an â exceptional item â in the accounts
qpr owners including tony fernandes wrote off Â£ 60million worth of old loans in the accounts effectively , qpr counted that write - off as extra income
but that money is noted in the accounts as being a â related - party transaction â â and the football league âs own financial fair play regulations explicitly rule out related party moves of the kind qpr have undertaken , to prevent â artificially â lowered losses
if the league decide qpr âs â real â losses are Â£ 69.8m , the financial fair play fine they potentially face will be Â£ 57.9m
