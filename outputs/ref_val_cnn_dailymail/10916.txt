today show host lisa wilkinson has accused education minister pyne of â apologising â for indonesian president joko widodo about how the bali nine duo 's journey to their place of execution has been handled
a fired - up wilkinson said there had been a â full blown and seemingly over the top operation â as myuran sukumaran and chan were transferred from kerobokan prison in bali to the indonesian â death island â of nusakambangan on wednesday
she also pointed out to pyne and labor frontbencher anthony albanese that bali âs police chief was â all smiles as he took photos with the two men condemned to death â
â elite military vehicles , decoy vehicles , fighter jets , riot squad police - you would have to say right now that president joko widodo , rather than listening to the australia government âs pleas for clemency , he âs treating these men like prize catches , he âs thumbing his nose at us right now is nât he ? , â wilkinson asked pyne
â to be fair , the indonesian justice system and president joko widodo is treating the australia prisoners the same as all the other foreign prisoners in indonesian , â pyne diplomatically replied
pyne : â i think that is much more appropriate but i think to try and characterise president joko widodo as thumbing his nose at australia is something a federal cabinet minister is going to endorse
