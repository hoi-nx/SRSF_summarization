suzette davenport said tougher sanctions are needed for those caught making calls , sending texts and checking emails while driving drivers who use mobile phones at the wheel should be banned from the roads , britain âs top traffic officer said yesterday
suzette davenport insisted that a rise in offending showed much tougher punishments were needed to deter the worst culprits
but she claimed ministers were too scared of losing votes in may âs election to act against the estimated 500,000 motorists who break the law every day
the gloucestershire chief constable said the absence of proper penalties risked making it socially acceptable to text or surf the internet while driving
miss suzette davenport said : â if someone is caught twice using a mobile phone within a period of time we should be considering things like disqualifications
i would take a much harder line in terms of outcomes from enforcement
the minister does nât like my proposal
' an election is not too far away so i âm sure they âre not likely to pick up and run with anything that they feel is not likely to be helpful to them in the next election
â miss suzette davenport , who speaks on road issues for the association of chief police officers , said drivers repeatedly glancing at their smartphones were effectively using a computer
robert goodwill , tory transport minister , rejected the claim that he was blocking road safety reform for electoral reasons
some 1.6 per cent of britain 's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year â up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009 he insisted the government was reviewing the introduction of a six - point penalty , two instances of which would trigger a ban
â research shows that the distraction effect of using a mobile phone is worse than being over the limit on drink or drugs
but the penalties are far lower â unless motorists are convicted of careless or dangerous driving
edmund king of the aa said : â basically we need more cops in cars to target the mobile phone abusers that we observe behind the wheel on most journeys
â the row threatens to overshadow the introduction today of â drug driving â laws
under the existing law it is illegal to use a phone while driving , even when stopped at traffic lights or queuing in traffic
the figures prompted mr nick clegg to call for tougher penalties
' i personally would be prepared to go further until we send out a clear and unambiguous message that this is dangerous and it should not be done
