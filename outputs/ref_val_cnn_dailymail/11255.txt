the amazing stellar object attained its rapid speed when a nearby star exploded as a supernova , sending it out of the milky way
scroll down for a video showing an artist 's impression of the event astronomers in hawaii have found the fastest ' unbound ' star in the galaxy
called us 708 it is moving at 745 miles ( 1,200km ) per second
it will leave the galaxy in about 25 million years
this artist 's concept shows a star ( left ) being ejected from the galaxy , although in reality the supernova would have been faded long ago the star , known as us 708 , was first discovered in 1982 by dr peter usher of pennsylvania state university but had since then remained ignored
us 708 is almost 62,000 light - years from earth , and is on a path that will take it out of the milky way in about 25 million years
using the 10 - metre keck ii and pan-starrs1 telescopes in hawaii , the astronomers calculated that the star is moving at about 745 miles ( 1,200km ) per second
us 708 , which is a helium - rich white dwarf , was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up
at the speed us 708 is travelling it would make the journey from earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the apollo astronauts three days
the specific characteristics of this binary system , its distance and the mass of its companion , allowed us 708 to remain intact while still achieving record speeds for an unbound star
us 708 , which is a helium - rich white dwarf , was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up ( illustration shown )
it is the first star found to be leaving the galaxy caused by such an event , and could provide an insight into these types of supernova in addition , to escape from the milky way an object needs to exceed the â escape velocity â - the strength of its gravitational pull
the escape velocity of our galaxy is about 375 miles ( 600km ) per second , which us 708 easily exceeds
