mayweather versus pacquiao is the fight which just keeps on giving
the initial projection of a purse split of $ 150million to the money man and $ 100m to the pacquiao has just been upwardly revised by pacquiao 's promoter
bob arum is now predicting a ' $ 300m distribution ' to the protagonists - $ 180m to mayweather and $ 120m to pacquiao under their 60 - 40 percent agreement
mayweather could earn $ 180m from his may 2 fight with pacquiao given the huge public interest pacquiao will receive 40 per cent of the purse , which could hit $ 120m on projected record pay - per - view buys mayweather laughs while watching the los angeles lakers take on the boston celtics those figures are based on bob arum 's firm expectation that this , the richest fight of all time , will not just break the pay - per - view record in america â but double it
promoter bob arum believes there will be between ' four and five million buys ' of the fight on may 2 bob arum has only promised one free ticket to the las vegas showdown - to ufc star ronda rousey pacquiao , pictured working out in minila , has already started preparing for his fight with mayweather tickets are expected to be priced from the lowest at $ 1,250 to upwards of $ 6,000 for a seat at ringside
but it is the pay - per - view tv sales â with rival networks hbo and showtime sharing the broadcast â which will generate most of the revenue
oscar de la hoya 's fight with mayweather in 2007 holds the record for the most pay - per - view buys at 2.4m pacquiao was last in action when he dominated chris algieri over 12 rounds in macau in november last year mayweather 's last fight came when he beat marcos maidana in las vegas in september 2014 naturally the charge has risen substantially since then , probably to $ 99.95 per subscription
thus bob arum 's five million buys â along with such ancillary income as tv rights overseas , including britain - would make this ' the half-billion dollar fight '
as for the $ 300m to the two best pound - for - pound boxers in the world , bob arum says : ' mayweather loves cars and he could buy so many as to satisfy very dealer in las vegas
' each to his own â and the las vegas sports books are bracing themselves for seven - figure bets on mayweather , the favourite , and pacquiao , the under - dog .
