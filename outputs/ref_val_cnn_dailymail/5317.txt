the allegation , leveled by a republican chairman for a house committee on benghazi , is the latest in a series of claims that are hammering the former first lady 's reputation as 2016 approaches
clinton 's attorney , kendall , rubbished the claims
the benghazi committee demanded further documents and access to the server after it was revealed that clinton used a private email account and server during her tenure at state
' the state department is therefore in possession of all secretary clinton 's work - related emails from the ( personal email ) account , ' kendall wrote
' rep. cummings of maryland , the top democrat on the benghazi panel , said kendall 's letter confirmed ' what we all knew : that clinton already produced her official records to the state department , that she did not keep her personal emails and that the select committee has already obtained her emails relating to the attacks in benghazi
' dispute : the claims come as the former secretary of state defends her use of a private email system no take two ? analysts warn the saga could have a devastating affect on clinton 's approval ratings before the 2016 presidential race , which could hamper her chances of a second white house stint with husband bill cummings said it is time for gowdy and other republican to stop what he called a ' political charade ' and instead make clinton 's emails public
gowdy also should schedule clinton 's public testimony before the benghazi panel as soon as possible , cummings said
kendall said in his letter that clinton 's personal attorneys reviewed every email sent and received from her private email address â 62,320 emails in total â and identified all work - related emails
