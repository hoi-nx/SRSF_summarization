now scientists have unraveled a 180 year old mystery of the evolutionary origins of south american 's hooved mammals that died out 10,000 years ago
the continents native ungulates - hooved animals - have baffled palaeontologists as they share traits with rodents , elephants and camels
the four - legged macrauchenia patachonica , shown in the artists impression above , has baffled scientists since fossils of the species , which died out around 10,000 years ago , were found by charles darwin 180 years ago but now by analysing the proteins preserved in fossilised bones , scientists have been able to show that the animals are more closely related to modern horses
scientists believe the first primates traveled to south american , which was once an isolated island before it joined to north america three million years ago , from africa on natural rafts that drifted across the atlantic ocean
a reconstruction of the 38 million year old perupithecus ucayalensis ( left ) found in south american is shown above alongside a species it closely resembled - talahpithecus parvus , that lived in libya 39 milion years ago unlike dna , proteins can be better preserved within fossilised remains
the scientists say it could allow them to look back in time 10 times farther than current techniques using ancient dna
the researchers screened 48 fossils of toxodon plantensis and macrauchenia patachonica - the same species that charles darwin discovered the remains of in uraguay and argentina 180 years ago
' the photograph above shows the skull of a toxodon plantensis kept at the natural history museum in london charles darwin ( right ) was baffled by fossils of the toxodon ( shown in the illustration on the right ) when he first discovered it and scientists have struggled ever since to work out where it sits in the evolutionary tree the modern technique , known as proteomics , allowed the researchers to show that the closest living relatives of these species were perissodactyls - the group that includes horses , rhinos and tapirs
this suggests the strange south american animals migrated into the continent from north america around 60 million years ago just after a mass extinction killed off many of the non-avian dinosaurs
the researchers now believe their technique could help to revolutionise palaeotological research by allowing scientists to reach far further back in time than they have been able to with dna analysis
