maintaining defence spending at the minimum demanded by nato is now only a ' target ' , top tory cabinet minister hammond suggested this morning
the foreign secretary refused 10 times to guarantee that the tories would protect the military from further cuts after the election
mr hammond said the final decision on whether or not to ring - fence military spending would not be made until after the election
the failure to protect military spending â while guaranteeing cash for foreign aid â has sparked fury on the tory backbenches
mps claim that if the chancellor george osborne gets his way british 's military spending will fall below 2 per cent of gdp â despite the prime minister using a nato summit in wales to publicly shame other countries into hitting that target
mr david cameron fears it will damage relations with us president barack obama , who urged him last month not to set a bad example to other nato nations by cutting spending
mr hammond said the government would not set out its defence spending plans until after the next election at ' the beginning of the next parliament ' military spending will stay above 2 per cent of gdp until 2015/16
david cameron has pledge an annual 1 per cent real terms increase in spending on defence equipment after the election
but defence spending in the british is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020 defence spending in the british is forecast to drop to 1.7 per cent by 2020 , even without further cuts
mr hammond , speaking this morning on the bbc 's marr show , was asked if british could afford to cut defence spending with the growing threat posed by vladimir putin and isis in the middle east
mr hammond added : ' we 're the second largest defence spender in nato , we 've got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces
' but he said the government would not set out its defence spending plans until after the next election at ' the beginning of the next parliament '
i ca n't tell you what will be in the conservative manifesto but you 'll find out soon enough , and i ca n't prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election
' marr tried 10 times to get the foreign secretary to guarantee military spending marr : â we have russian submarines testing our waters and russian jets buzzing our airspace , and at the same time we are not committing ourselves to maintaining the nato minimum defence spending
where do you stand on that ? â hammond : â well , clearly i was defence secretary for nearly three years , i âm a passionate supporter of the armed forces and of maintaining british âs military strength
and we are spending two per cent of our gdp
â hammond : â well , we âre the second largest defence spender in nato , we âve got a huge equipment programme modernising our armed forces
â marr : â so we want it too then do nât we ? â hammond : â we will have a strategic defence and security review at the beginning of the next parliament and a spending review and we will set out our future plans then
â marr : â through the course of the next parliament ? â hammond : â we will set out the defence spending
as foreign secretary surely you can commit yourself personally to the two per cent
i ca nât tell you what will be in the conservative manifesto but you âll find out soon enough , and i ca nât prejudge the outcome of the security and defence review and the spending review that will take place after the next election
â marr : â and therefore you could at least commit yourself to agreeing with david davis that he would look pretty damn silly if he did nât then commit himself to two per cent for this country ? â hammond : â look , i worked closely with the prime minister on this subject when i was defence secretary for three years
