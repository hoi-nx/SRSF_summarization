the man who attacked a security area at the new orleans airport with a machete and wasp spray also had a bag of molotov cocktails and a car containing smoke bombs and gas cylinders , authorities said
the suspect , richard white , 63 , died saturday after treatment for three bullet wounds he suffered when a sheriff 's lieutenant fired at him to halt the friday night attack , the jefferson parish sheriff 's office said
sheriff normand said earlier that investigators had n't been able to talk to richard white , who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness
he said richard white 's wife and children had been very cooperative
he praised security officials for acting quickly and heroically and doing everything they could to stop the attack
the incident began when richard white , carrying a bag , entered one of the lanes at the security checkpoint for concourse b and began spraying tsa agents and bystanders with a can of wasp spray , the sheriff 's office said
he then pulled a machete from his waistband and began swinging it at agents and others in the area
" what i saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray , " said tsa agent richel , whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at richard white
the officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at richard white to slow him down , but the suspect still barged through , richel told reporters
" when richard white approached the checkpoint , he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him , normand said
" what the bag revealed was six half - pint mason jars with cloth wicks into a liquid that we now know to be gasoline -- what you would commonly refer to as a molotov cocktail , " normand said
a grill lighter and plastic letter opener were also in the bag , and next to his body investigators found powdery material and wicks , which they determined were from crushed smoke bombs
" the bomb squad found more smoke bombs in his car , and in the trunk were three gas tanks -- one for freon , one for oxygen and one for acetylene , a compressed gas used in welding and metal - cutting
" people who had recently interacted with richard white described him as very cordial , calm , cool and collected , normand said
it was n't clear why richard white was at the airport
