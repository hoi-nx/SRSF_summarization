boston tsarnaev 's attorney made one thing clear during her opening statement in the boston marathon bombing trial : he did it
" it was him , " defense attorney judy clarke told jurors
tsarnaev carried one of the pressure cooker bombs on april 15 , 2013 , and placed it near the finish line , she said
so , why even a trial at all ? because there 's disagreement over why tsarnaev did it , clarke said
tsarnaev was influenced by his brother , tamerlan tsarnaev , clarke said
he was enlisted by his brother to commit these horrific acts , she said
the first day of the trial provided jurors with a peek at the strategies of the prosecution and defense
but both sides presented divergent views of why tsarnaev carried out the attacks
the goal of the tsarnaev brothers was to kill as many people as possible , u.s. prosecutor weinreb said during his initial statement to jurors
the prosecutor described in detail the deaths of three victims near the finish line of the 2013 boston marathon and painted a picture of tsarnaev as a holy warrior committed to violence
a fourth person , an mit police officer , was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , allegedly ran from police
so it is tsarnaev who is on trial , charged with 30 counts related to the bombings
weinreb said tsarnaev 's actions after the bombings -- going to whole foods to buy a gallon of milk , hanging out with friends -- show that he did n't care about what he did
to the contrary , the prosecutor told jurors , he believed he had done good
the motive for the attacks can be found in the boat that ultimately became tsarnaev 's hideout before his arrest , he said
there , tsarnaev allegedly wrote messages explaining that he believed the u.s. government is an enemy of islam
boston marathon bombing timeline tsarnaev listened to jihadist lectures and songs , and had an online presence in which he espoused a radical view of islam , weinreb said
he had a collection of magazines published by al qaeda , one with instructions for building the same type of bomb used in the boston marathon attack , he said
the defense pinned the radicalization on tamerlan
the attacks were " incomprehensible , they 're inexcusable , " she said , but also asked , who turned tsarnaev from the smiling kid into a bomber ? it was tamerlan who self - radicalized , and tamerlan who influenced his brother to follow him , she argued
martin , an 8 - year - old spectator , was standing with his family cheering runners on when the second bomb exploded just feet away
martin was only 4 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 70 pounds , the prosecutor said
the bomb blew large holes into the boy 's chest and organs -- " tore large chunks of flesh out of martin 's body , " weinreb said
grilk provided some facts about the marathon , but assistant u.s. attorney aloke chakravarty also asked him to talk about the day of the bombings
" wednesday 's testimony centered on the stories of the survivors
tsarnaev 's lawyers opted not to cross-examine any of the witnesses who testified to what they lived through that day
kilgore and rebekah gregory were part of a large group who were present to cheer on a family member
" her first instinct was for noah 's safety
sydney corcoran was a high school senior on the day of the bombings
race has been an issue raised by tsarnaev 's defense during four unsuccessful attempts to move the death penalty trial from boston
his attorneys argued that the way the court issues jury summons led to picking a panel that 's older and whiter than the community at large
" the prosecution got exactly what they wanted , " said cnn legal analyst mark geragos , a criminal defense attorney in los angeles
the slip away , a boat in which tsarnaev sought cover after the police gunbattle , also is expected to be a key piece of evidence
the prosecution is seeking to remove a panel on which tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so jurors can see it
defense attorney david bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and would n't fairly reflect tsarnaev 's state of mind
court papers have already given the public a glimpse of several statements tsarnaev allegedly wrote inside the boat : " the u.s. government is killing our innocent civilians , " he allegedly wrote
