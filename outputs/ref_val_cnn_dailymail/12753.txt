two years after she underwent a double mastectomy to cut her cancer risk , actress and united nations envoy jolie has had surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes for the same reason , she wrote in the new york times on tuesday
jolie , 39 , carries a mutation of the brca1 gene , which sharply increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer
in her new york times op - ed tuesday , jolie said she had been planning the latest preventive surgery for some time
doctors : jolie did the right thing but a blood test that revealed worrying markers accelerated the process , the hollywood star said
further tests came back negative for tumors , jolie wrote
" jolie stresses that not all women with the same brca1 gene mutation should feel they must automatically leap to surgery , but she urges them to explore their options and take control
while not as complex as the mastectomy surgery , its effects are more severe , jolie said , since it puts a woman into forced menopause
but jolie acknowledged she was lucky because she already has a family , unlike some women who face this difficult decision
" it is not possible to remove all risk , and the fact is i remain prone to cancer , " she said
i know my children will never have to say , ' mom died of ovarian cancer
she wrote two years ago that her preventive double mastectomy had cut her risk of developing breast cancer from 87 % to 5 %
jolie serves as a special envoy for the united nations high commissioner for refugees and has visited refugee camps around the world
