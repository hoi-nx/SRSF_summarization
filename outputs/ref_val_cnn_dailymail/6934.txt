banks will be hit with an extra Â£ 1billion tax until the deficit has been completely cleared , under new lib proposals
the new 8 per cent levy - which effectively strips the banks of the benefit of the government 's corporation tax cuts â will form a key plank of the party 's election manifesto
treasury secretary alexander said the tax hike will help the next government find the Â£ 30billion of savings after the election needed to balance the books
the lib economic spokesman alexander wants to introduce a new 8 per cent levy on banks like the conservatives , the lib are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18
but unlike the tories - who say they would do it through spending cuts alone - the lib say they would seek to raise at least Â£ 8 billion through extra taxes
the annual levy on banks , which was introduced in 2010 , currently brings in around Â£ 2.5billion a year
a ' mansion tax ' on homes worth over Â£ 2million will raise an extra Â£ 1.5billion , and a crackdown on tax avoidance could save Â£ 6billion , the lib claim
' to that end , we introduced the bank levy which is on track to raise Â£ 8billion in this parliament
' the tories and lib are committed eliminating the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18
but the lib want to raise at least Â£ 8 billion through extra taxes , while george osborne ( pictured ) insists it can be achieved through spending cuts alone all the revenue raised from the new bank tax will go towards paying down the deficit
