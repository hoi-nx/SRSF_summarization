a florida middle school student was found with an arsenal of weapons in his backpack last wednesday
the 13 - year - old boy , whose name is being withheld , was caught when another boy was seen handing him a knife in the cafeteria at sunrise middle school in fort lauderdale
the teenager was eventually released , but could now face charges of weapons possession and disruption of a school function
both the boy 's mother and attorney , jim stark , refused requests for comment
the student who was caught giving the other boy a knife was also taken in under the baker act and released
principal michael walker notified parents of the incident in an email last friday , and this week assured them that the school was safe , though he did not reveal any specifics of what had occurred on that day
