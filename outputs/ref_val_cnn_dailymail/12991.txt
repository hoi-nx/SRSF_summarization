" good night malaysian three - seven - zero
" it was a routine sign - off , an all - is - well
on march 8 , 2014 , at 1:19 a.m. , someone spoke those last words from mh370 to air traffic controllers before the boeing vanished
a year later , searchers have no new clues as to where it went with 239 people on board
radar and satellite reports have provided hints , but searchers still have nothing to hold in their hands
no wreckage seen floating at sea or beached on shore
no fuselage resting on the sea floor
experts have said the data indicate the flight path from kuala lumpur , malaysian , to beijing unexpectedly veered , putting the commercial jet over the southern indian ocean
but the water 's vast and intricate depths have revealed no secrets
and as clarity has eluded grasp , analysts have made many speculations about what happened
the most controversial idea : is the maritime search area all wrong ? did the plane land clandestinely on solid ground ? here are some expert theories about what happened to mh370
one theory is that one pilot may have incapacitated the other , then guided the plane to its end , taking the passengers down with him in a dramatic suicide
when people commandeer a plane , they might keep the motives secret , said political analyst bergen
he wanted to crash the plane into the company 's memphis , tennessee , headquarters
" commandeering would fit with the few facts that we do know , and ( it 's ) certainly a theory that we have n't heard a lot of that is n't a conspiracy , " bergen said
experts are divided on this theory , partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world 's attention -- unless potential terrorists were waiting for something
outlandish conjecture or genius insight ? the theory that russians actors on board mh370 found a way to get the plane through the border territory of china , pakistan and india to a kazakhstan landing strip leased to russians comes from science journalist and private pilot wise
another aviation analyst , david soucie , also cast doubt after mh370 went missing on the most widely held belief that the plane hit the indian ocean
in a less sinister but equally lethal explanation , some experts theorized the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction
maybe they turned to look for a landing strip but could n't steer the plane properly
" one possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very , very hard to imagine because ( the plane ) has so many generators coming from different places , " tilmon said
sunday , a year to the day after the plane disappeared , the international independent investigation committee released an interim report on the disappearance of mh370
the interim report also revealed that the battery of the underwater locator beacon on the plane 's flight data recorder had expired more than a year before its disappearance
the battery on the plane 's other so - called black box , the cockpit voice recorder , had been replaced as scheduled , and remained within its expiry date , the report said
