a man has opened up about what happened when he discovered his identity had been stolen online and used to contact dozens of women
at first , jon will chambers , a freelance creative designer from norwich , did n't think much of it when a stranger e-mailed him to say she had been speaking to a man online who was using his pictures under a different name
' david ' was using recent pictures from jon will chambers 's facebook page as well as old ones from his deleted myspace account in order to assume his identity and over a period of four to five years , he had sent thousands of emails using jon will chambers 's pictures
he contacted women through dating sites , social media platforms and teenage forums , using several different email addresses and charming them with poetry and his supposed love of music
even after jon will chambers confronted them , some of the women did n't understand that he and ' david ' were not the same person
speaking to mailonline , jon will chambers said : ' some of the girls had been speaking to him for five years and thought they were in a relationship with " me "
' he tried contacting the police , but to no avail - they told him there is no law preventing people from taking his online pictures , since he had them on a public setting eventually , one of the women hacked into ' david 's ' account and discovered his true identity - a 65 - year - old married man from the uk living in spain
after jon will chambers tracked him down online , ' david ' apologised , describing himself as ' just a sad lonely man ' and claiming that he was mentally unwell
still , jon will chambers felt that justice needed to be served - not just for him , but for the dozens of girls and women ' david ' had duped
