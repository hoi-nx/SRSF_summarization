but she was not ordered to carry out community service after snaresbrook crown court heard she suffers regular headaches and nosebleeds
she received a nine - month prison sentence , suspended for two years , in addition to a three - month curfew
criticising a pre-sentence report suggesting st michaels should be exempt from community service , judge simon freeland qc said : ' this trial included normal working hours , this defendant gave evidence to the jury and was cross examined
' she did n't require any form of facility to deal with these headaches and nosebleeds and there were no outward manifestations of discomfort whatsoever
