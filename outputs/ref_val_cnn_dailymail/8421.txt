the chameleon âs ability to change colour may seem magical , but scientists have finally solved the riddle of how the reptile can blend into the background so effectively
the reptiles are capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival
a stock image of a colourful panther chameleon is shown the process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores
not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage to spectacular mating displays , they also protect it from overheating
like some other reptiles , chameleons display a wide range of colours produced not by pigments but â optical interference â between different wavelengths of reflected light from tiny crystals , the researchers claim

further bolstering the idea that crystals in skin cells are responsible for the animal âs transformation , they compared a sample of â relaxed â chameleon skin with another when the animal was excited and observed a change in the crystal pattern
