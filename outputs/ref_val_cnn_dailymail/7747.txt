fraser and karina mcgruer , pictured with daughter olivia , want their summer born sons louise to start in reception class in september a father has claimed a lack of common sense is preventing his twin boys from starting school a year later because they were born in late august
fraser mcgruer âs boys alistair and louis turned four last summer but they put off joining lessons because they were too young
now they have been told that when they start school in september this year after reaching the legal age for compulsory education , they will have to go straight into year one and not join reception classes with pupils just weeks younger than them
mr fraser mcgruer claims hertfordshire county council is either â unaware of or ignoring â government guidelines in which ministers make clear children âs interests must come first
and it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be ' no barrier ' to the child then starting in reception class
last wednesday schools minister nick gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom , telling councils and headteachers to do ' what 's in the best interests of the child '
but on the same day as mr nick gibb addressed mps , hertfordshire county council wrote to the fraser mcgruer family to say louis and alistair would not be able to join the reception class in september
mr fraser mcgruer and his wife karina , who also have a daughter olivia , 6 , have carried out their own research into summer born children and education start dates
louis and alistair both currently attend flying start montessori nursery , sawbridgeworth
mr fraser mcgruer told mailonline : â academically and emotionally , the boys are nowhere near ready to start year one â they would effectively be a year younger than many of their classmates â we have produced large amounts of evidence from professionals involved in our children âs lives , supporting our case , but the local authority has dismissed it
â the mcgruers have been told they must start in year one
' education minister nick gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom , telling councils and headteachers to do ' what 's in the best interests of the child ' department for education guidance allows parents to delay their child 's schooling until the september after their fifth birthday
' there are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class '
but some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into year one to ease pressure on places in reception
mr nick gibb told mps that there had to be ' flexibility ' from schools and councils when agreeing the start date for children who turn four just weeks before the start of the school year
' she added that summer - born babies who do start school after they are five are starting at compulsory starting age and should not miss out on reception by being placed straight into year one
