a design flaw has left a fighter jet that 's part of the pentagon 's most expensive project ever incapable of carrying the military 's most highly advanced bombs
the f-35b 's internal weapons bay is too small for a sdb ii ( sdb ii ) load , according to an inside defense report
the fighter jet is the centerpiece of the royal navy 's new aircraft carrier - based fleet , and dozens have already been ordered
trouble in the skies : the f-35b 's internal weapons bay is too small for a sdb ii ( sdb ii ) load ( file photo ) the mod has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned uk aircraft carriers - the hms queen elizabeth and the hms prince of wales
though it 's mandated that an f-35b jet , designed by lockheed martin , hold eight sdb iis in the bay , only four reportedly fit
the problem will not affect the royal navy 's consignment of f-35bs , however , as its aircraft are to carry different weapons
the f - 35 program will reportedly cost more than Â£ 2.5billion over the next decade
the f-35b is one of three variants of the f - 35 program - and it 's proved the most expensive and most troublesome to get off the ground
the ship will be launched for sea trials in 2016 the mod has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned uk aircraft carriers - the hms queen elizabeth ( pictured ) and the hms prince of wales since work began in 2007 , an estimated 10,000 shipyard workers and engineers have been employed in building the ship which will employ a crew of fewer than 700 once complete artists impressions of the ship 's flight deck released before construction was underway
' the fit issues have been known and documented and there were larger and more substantial modifications needed to support sdb ii that have already been incorporated into production f - 35 aircraft
' inside inside defense reported that the jsf ( jsf ) program office so far has not publicly recognized problems - and that eight internal and 16 external sdb iis are in fact meant to go on the f-35b
