and on giant game boards
" march 19 marks the official 80th anniversary of the world 's best - selling board game , now manufactured by hasbro
its circuitous history , like its game board , has been filled with several interesting turns
but the roots of monopoly actually date back a few more decades , to a game called the landlord 's game created by magie in 1903
as for darrow , he was inspired in 1932 by a version created by a new jersey quaker community that made atlantic city the locale of the game
darrow added colors and other design elements -- " a look and feel to his board that would prove immensely appealing , " writes philip e. orbanes in " monopoly , " a 2006 history of the game
monopoly has been translated into 47 languages
hasbro prints $ 30 billion in monopoly money each year , and well more than $ 3 trillion has been printed since 1935
not bad considering each standard game comes with $ 20,580 -- though it 's in the rules that the bank can never go broke , so make up some scrip if you need it
even before numerous editions of monopoly were widely licensed , there were local board variations depending on the country
monopoly , for example , is mayfair in britain , schlossallee in germany , kalverstraat in the netherlands and rue de la paix in france , after major streets in london , berlin , amsterdam and paris
the new " here & now " u.s. edition , however , opened the voting to enthusiasts -- and pierre ( population 14,000 ) , the capital of south dakota , won pride of place as monopoly
) still , given the city 's triumph , you probably would n't want to play monopoly against an energized pierre resident
still , the new jersey resort does have monopoly to thank for some of its fame -- not that it was appreciated at one time
the idea caused an uproar among monopoly fans and the idea was eventually shot down
" without them , we could never pass monopoly
" do you put money from chance and community chest in the center of the board and collect it when landing on free parking ? not in the rules
do you give $ 400 for landing on monopoly instead of $ 200 ? not in the rules
) the dismissive line " do not pass go , do not collect $ 200 , " which has worked its way into a few songs , is from monopoly
there are n't many movies featuring the game , but " one flew over the cuckoo 's nest " has a famous scene with william redfield and devito arguing over devito 's play
stay tuned , though : a monopoly movie is back on after several years in hollywood purgatory
want to win at monopoly ? though there 's some chance involved ( pardon the pun ) , the low - rent light blues and the mid-market oranges are the most desirable , according to a study done for maxine brady 's 1974 " the monopoly book
or you could just do what millions have done since darrow 's day : land on someone else 's hotel , get mad and turn over the game board
