on reflection , it would be wrong to describe inter-squad relations back then as frosty
yet the warmth was distinctly a few degrees south of what naismith is currently enjoying each time the scotland squad gathers on the banks of loch lomond
in little over two years , gordon strachan has transformed the national team from a laughing stock into a source of genuine pride and hope
a sense of togetherness - which can only truly be fostered by a string of positive results and performances - is palpable
the scotland squad are in high spirits in the lead - up to their clash with northern ireland on wednesday naismith says : ' from when i joined the national team to now , it âs a totally different dynamic ' the old clichÃ© about a club - like atmosphere surrounding scotland â for so long just empty rhetoric â now has a solid basis in reality
â from when i joined the national team to now , it âs a totally different dynamic in that every single player is chatting away to anybody , â said naismith
it âs great that we âre all of similar mind - sets and it works
but the rangers boys and the celtic boys did tend to stay together
â for much of naismith âs scotland career , a call - up to the national side brought mixed emotions for many
gordon strachan 's reign has brought back a sense of pride to the scotland shirt at times , the pride of being selected to pull on a dark blue jersey was diminished by a realisation that the team was going nowhere fast
frequent numerous call - offs just became the way of things
naismith says there are no cliques in the side â most folk will hang about in the communal areas and chill and enjoy banter , â he added
â it says much that only ross mccormack has withdrawn from gordon strachan âs original party to face northern ireland on wednesday and gibraltar on sunday
â it âs a very good game as we âve both started our campaigns very well , â naismith said of wednesday 's hampden park friendly
â it âs a game with a little more to it , like northern ireland and england , because they are close to home and the players are all familiar with each other
â for naismith , this match is also a case of friends reunited
both steven davis and kyle lafferty shared a dressing room with him at rangers for four years with three scottish titles gleaned in that period
norwich striker kyle lafferty did nât have his troubles to seek at ibrox initially but his latter contributions â together with his current displays for club and country â have long since convinced naismith of his value to any side
naismith will be reunited with friends kyle lafferty , who who played with during a successful run at rangers he will also compete with steven davis , another former rangers star now on the southampton books â ever since he was at rangers he was been a big player for northern ireland , â he said
â the way he finished seasons ( at rangers ) was remarkable
â what everton would currently give for such a lucky charm
everton 's naismith and chicago - based shaun maloney , formerly of rangers and celtic respectively , share a laugh as they warm up with the scotland squad on tuesday typifying how many fans now have the collective memories of goldfish , graffiti denigrating the spaniard has been seen around goodison park
â i âve seen that , â naismith admitted
â to be honest , it âs very unlike everton fans
â the irony of scotland now providing a lift for ailing club players is lost on no one
â the last trip was quite tricky , â naismith recalled
