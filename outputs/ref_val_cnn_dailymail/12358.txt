french striker gomis , who has a history of fainting , said he is now " feeling well " after collapsing during swansea 's 3 - 2 loss at tottenham in the premier league on wednesday
the worrying incident occurred in the first half at white hart lane -- after tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29 - year - old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment
the guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask
as the match progressed , swansea tweeted that gomis was " fine , " with manager monk using the same word to describe gomis ' condition
gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution , swansea said on its website
" i wanted to reassure you concerning my health , " gomis told the website
" gomis had similar fainting spells in french , which prompted the president of his former club , jean-michel aulas of lyon , to tell french television in 2009 : " we ca n't not be worried , it scares you each time
" swansea ran tests on gomis , said monk , prior to signing him on a free transfer last july
almost exactly three years ago at white hart lane , then bolton midfielder fabrice muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest
