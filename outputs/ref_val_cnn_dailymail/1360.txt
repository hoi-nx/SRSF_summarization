ed miliband yesterday left the door open to a labour - snp coalition after the general election â as the latest polls point to a â braveheart battalion â of nationalists storming westminster
in a speech to party members in edinburgh , led by jim murphy , the labour leader ignored calls from his own frontbench , led by shadow chancellor ed balls and health spokesman andy burnham , to rule out a deal with nicola sturgeon âs party
last week a poll by tory peer lord ashcroft put the snp on track to increase its representation at westminster to 56 of scotland âs 59 seats , up from just six seats now
the snp âs projected success could cancel out labour gains in other parts of the britain , leading to a dead - heat between the two main parties â and allowing nationalists to play â kingmakers â
many labour mps think the only way to avert a humiliating collapse is for mr ed miliband to tell voters he wo nât deal with the nationalists , to persuade anti- conservative voters that a vote for him is the only way to remove cameron from downing street
however mr ed miliband barely mentioned the snp at the labour spring conference
the labour leader said : â the tory could wreak havoc in scotland without winning a majority by being in government as the largest party
paul monaghan : caithness , sutherland and easter ross martin docherty-dunbartonshire west martin docherty issued a call to arms to nationalist supporters in january , with the volunteer activist urging voters to take the opportunity to â hold westminster âs feet to the fire â
' you could end up with a labour government led by ed miliband â propped up by the snp â an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt britain and the people who want to break up britain
' and even today , ed miliband will not rule out a deal or backing from the snp
