at least one lab employee has tested positive for a deadly bacteria used to make bioweapons that mysteriously escaped a louisiana research center in november
three of the monkeys have already been euthanized after showing signs of burkholderia pseudomallei , which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500 - acre facility
the test results showed the employee was ' just at the threshold for a verified positive result ' and has not shown any symptoms of the diseases the bacteria can bring on , such as tuberculosis , according to nola.com
concerns : monkeys at the tulane national primate research center in louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened reach : worryingly , the center is close to a river ( top left ) , homes and a school
although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria , further tests are required the name of the employee has not been released
questions also remain over how far the bacteria , which is primarily found in southeast asia and northeast australia , has spread around the complex and surrounding areas
animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas
the monkeys , rhesus macaques , had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages , where around 4,000 macaques are kept
worryingly , the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes
infected : at least seven rhesus macaques ( file picture ) have shown signs of exposure and three have died potentially deadly : burkholderia pseudomallei the bacteria , burkholderia pseudomallei , can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis
the bacteria , which is primarily found in southeast asia and northeast australia , has never been found in nature in the u.s. last week , tests by the cdc determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria , bring the number of infected monkeys to seven
the u.s. department of agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners , veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed
