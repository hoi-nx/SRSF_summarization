alexandra walkden , 62 , was left virtually toothless after her dentist of 30 years failed to provide proper treatment for gum disease
as a result , she was forced to pay Â£ 24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants
now mrs alexandra walkden , a telesales worker from preston , lancashire , has won Â£ 35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist , dr musgrave , 57
she said : ' i had to have surgery to remove 13 teeth and eventually have implants fitted
' mrs alexandra walkden had been a patient of dr musgrave at the preston - based incisive dental practice for 30 years and attended dental appointments with him every six months
she said : ' during these years i did n't think anything was wrong
she added : ' as far as i know he did a routine check but he never told me i had gum disease
' the truth emerged during a holiday in 2013 with her partner when mrs alexandra walkden 's crown fell out and she went to see a local dentist
she said : ' when i went to see him the first thing he said was " when was the last time you went to the dentist ? "
' i went to another dentist close to home and they confirmed i was going to lose all my top set of teeth
' despite paying for regular private dental treatment for 30 years , mrs alexandra walkden was horrified to be told by another dentist that her teeth were rotting from the inside out - and the top row would need to be removed her grandchildren likened her appearance to nanny mcphee , the screen governess with magical powers played by emma thompson
mrs alexandra walkden , had to endure a number of deep cleaning treatments to treat the gum disease before all but four of her top set of teeth were removed
i have never experienced pain like that before as they clean beneath the gum line - it 's very high powered
i did n't want to be left with dentures for the rest of time
' mrs alexandra walkden eventually underwent implant surgery in april 2013 and had to go to the dentist every week
she said : ' i have spent hours at the dentists and thousands of pounds and i have only been left with around Â£ 11,000 for pain and suffering
' compensation is not a " pay out "
' the money i 've received will be used to cover the thousands of pounds i have paid out of my own pocket for all the necessary remedial and cosmetic work
' she added : ' this is all because this dentist did n't do proper checks
' i 've worked hard all my life to pay for extra things in life like private dental insurance and have never missed a dentist appointment
mrs alexandra walkden was forced to pay Â£ 24,000 to undergo painful surgery for dental implants
she has now won Â£ 35,000 damages in an out of court settlement after taking legal action against the dentist , dr musgrave she said : ' if i were n't fortunate enough to have been able to fund my treatments while the case was being fought , i do n't know what state my mouth would be in right now ' ' i thought i was taking good care of my teeth and assumed that my dental insurer would have taken steps to screen its members
' associate solicitor , heather owen at the dental law partnership which represented mrs alexandra walkden said : ' alexandra walkden 's case was one of long - term mistreatment , compounded by a string of failures by her dentist dr musgrave
' he routinely failed to check the health of her teeth , screen for gum disease , remove decay or even carry out appropriate preventative care
