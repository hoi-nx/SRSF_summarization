and one for one of the animals taking a long swig from a beer bottle was just what they needed to refresh themselves
the herd of camels were on a trek across the erg chebbi dunes in morocco , where one of the group was snapped having a refreshing drink
a camel takes a swig from a beer bottle on a short refreshment stop while trekking across the sahara desert tour guides filled the beer bottles with water for the camels to drink as temperatures reached as high as 40 degrees but rather than swigging down beer the bottles had actually been filled with water by the guides for the camels to drink
' they do n't usually drink too often and while we were there , i had n't seen any camel drinking
the pictures were snapped by photographer joao bolan , who spent time trekking across the erg chebbi dunes in morocco the 26 - year - old travelled with a guide and a friend and when they reached the dunes , they hired a total of six camels to help them explore the area
