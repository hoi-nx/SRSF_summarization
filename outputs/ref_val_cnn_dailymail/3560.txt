from peacocks to birds of paradise , male birds are well known for showing off their brightly coloured plumage as a way of attracting a mate
the findings challenge a key element of the evolutionary theory that was first proposed by charles darwin 156 years ago
male and female choco toucan 's ( pictured above ) both share the same brightly coloured plumage , suggesting another force other than sexual selection is driving the evolution of bright colours in feathers of some birds rather than the bright colours of male birds appearing because of sexual selection - where a trait evolves over time because it is seen as attractive or a signal of fitness by the opposite sex - other forces of natural selection are at work
the researchers say that the environment a species lives in , how it cares of its young and migratory behaviour appear to influence a species plumage
peacock tails may be hard to miss , but humans are unaware of the noise created by the bird 's pretty plumage
but the scienitsts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels , according to the study published in the journal animal behaviour
male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers , with males shrieking out in response
' the debate over the differences in colour between species of birds has raged ever since the time of charles darwin and wallace
while charles darwin based his theory of sexual selection on the idea that brightly coloured males were preferred by females , giving them a competitive advantage , wallace pointed out that in many species females are as brilliantly coloured as the male
in an attempt to test these ideas , professor dunn and his colleagues decided to analyse the plumage of 977 species of bird - around 10 per cent of all known species
using museum specimens , they measured the spectrum of light reflected from the plumage of both male and female birds
females have similar colours but are not as bright but in about 45 per cent of bird species both sexes had plumage that the same level of brightness
they found both sexes would have duller plumage when the birds tended have more sedentary behaviour or bred in the tropics or had young that needed more care , and in species where males played little role in caring for young
' overall , both natural and sexual selection have influenced the evolution of bird coloration , but in many respects , they have acted on two different axes : sexual selection on an axis of sexual differences and natural selection on an axis of color ( for example , dull or bright ) in both sexes
' thus , debate about the causes of variation in bird coloration may be resolved by recognizing that natural and sexual selection have generally acted on two different axes
