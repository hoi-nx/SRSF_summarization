in the small alaskan town of whittier , which sees up to 250 inches of snow annually , nearly all of the 218 residents live in one multi-story house
surrounded by only mountains and the sea , the remote town is so isolated that it 's only accessible by north america 's longest one way tunnel , which stretches for two and a half miles
filmmaker , mary katzke , a fellow alaskan from anchorage , was one of the first to take interest in the peculiar small town and its unusual daily realities
the building , the begich tower , houses the entire neighbourhood , including convenience stores and a school a filmmaker from anchorage , alaskan , has recently taken interest in developing a project about the town the building was first constructed by the army in the 1950s , but is now under civilian ownership it is only accessible by a two - and - a - half mile , one - way tunnel , which alternates directions during the day what makes the town so fascinating is that despite the geographical isolation , families have continual contact ' there is so much geographic isolation yet continual contact via this living set up
the creation of the 14 - story building began in 1953 by the army , but came into civilian ownership a few years later when the army left the town
