isis apparently claimed responsibility thursday for the deadly terrorist attack at a landmark museum in the heart of that country 's capital , a mass shooting that has shaken the birthplace of the arab spring and stirred questions about militants in the country
in an audio statement posted online thursday , isis identified two men -- abu zakariya al-tunisi and abu anas al-tunisi -- it said used " automatic weapons and hand grenades " to kill and injure what it called " crusaders and apostates " in the bardo museum in tunis
tunisian health minister aidi said 23 people are believed to have been killed , including at least one who died at a hospital overnight
and that bloodshed , the isis message warned , is " just the start
the current u.s. thinking is the attack may have been carried out by local " franchise " adherents to isis , rather than centrally directed by the islamist extremist group 's leadership , which is now thought to be in syria
the two attackers were carrying explosives , tunisian president beji caid essebsi said in an interview thursday with the french broadcaster tf1
he credited tunisian security forces for responding so quickly to the attack to avoid a larger tragedy because " terrible explosives were found on these ( attackers ) and they did n't have time to use them
" tunisian has been viewed as the lone democratic success story in the arab spring
authorities there have already arrested nine people in connection with wednesday 's attack , including four directly linked to the bloodshed , according to a statement from essebsi
it 's not clear if those two men were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces , or if it 's possible they 're the same people as those identified -- using new names -- in isis ' audio statement
the siege took place just days after a tunisian jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to al-baghdadi , the leader of isis , was coming soon , according to the site intelligence group , which monitors terrorist propaganda
in his message , the jihadist claimed to belong to jund al-khilafah in tunisian , a group that in december pledged allegiance to isis , even though that vow had n't seemed to have fully registered with the islamist extremist group
his post comes after an isis fighter in the extremist group 's stronghold of raqqa in syria recently appeared in a video questioning why militants in tunisian had not pledged fealty
" this raises the possibility that the museum attack could be isis ' debut on the tunisian stage , timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from tunisian jihadis for maximum impact , " cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank said
the attack may have been in and about tunisian , but the vast majority of the victims were foreigners
its prominent place in tunisian 's economy -- which banks heavily on tourism , with millions visiting the country each year -- also made it a logical target for terrorists
travelers warned of risks as tunisian reels from attack the economy and terrorism are linked in tunisian , in the sense that high youth unemployment and sparse opportunities are thought to have contributed to the large numbers becoming jihadists -- whether abroad or at home
and in february , the country 's interior ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of isis leader al-baghdadi
