finding a new flatmate is often a challenge , but for one sweden teenager only men as ' good looking as hell ' will do
alicia hansson had also demanded that potential cohabitors were ' charming ' and knew how to put a toilet seat down , in her advert on the flat - hunting facebook group page in gothenburg last week
alicia hansson was hit with a barrage of online abuse after she advertised for ' good looking as hell ' flatmate the 19 year - old decided to take the unusual approach as a ' cry for help searching for that non-existant , ideal man , ' she told the gothenburg post
ms alicia hansson , who wrote the post while preparing to return to sweden - where flat sharing is a rarity - after working as an au pair in spain
' are you good looking as hell , charming and know how to put down the toilet seat after you ? , ' she asked
love is absolutely no obligation ! ' within days ms alicia hansson had well over 1,000 responses to the advert , with some men even sending her romantic poems or half naked pictures ms alicia hansson said she had ' lost count ' of how many messages she had received but believed there had been well over 1,000 responses to the advert , with some men sending half naked pictures and others sending romantic poems
other found the advert amusing with siya mhlwatika commenting that the teenager was a ' hilarious lady this ! ' but the post was not a hit with everyone , after some accused the pretty teen of objectifying men
one post simply described the stunt as ' white trash ' while jonas bengtsson , another member of the same apartment rental group on facebook , asked : ' is this some kind of social experiment ? ' the 19 year - old posted the advert on a flat - hunting facebook group page in gothenburg last week ms alicia hansson had appealed for good - looking men who were ' charming ' and knew how to put the toilet seat down after use ms alicia hansson told mailonline : ' i 've lost count on how many messages i 've received , and am still receiving , and how many wonderful , handsome and charming men there are out there searching for company
