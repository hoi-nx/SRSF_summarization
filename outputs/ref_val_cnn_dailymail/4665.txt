in a genetic first , scientists have sequenced the largest ever set of human genomes from a single population
among several key finds , the data set suggests that the ' father of humanity ' - our most recent common male ancestor - lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago
because the population in icelandic has very little genetic diversity , scientists can find genetic variants that raise the chance of disease more easily
so far , the work has provided promising results helping identify 20 million genetic variants among the icelandic population
among these variations , scientists at reykjavik - based decode have already found genes that increase the risks of alzheimer 's disease , liver and thyroid problems
' stefansson 's team today published four papers online in nature genetics , all of which used the icelandic data
among several key finds , the data set suggests that the ' father of humanity ' would have lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago
this date range , based on a calculation of human mutation rates ( pictured ) , contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago they detail mutations in the abca7 gene that are associated with an increased risk of alzheimer 's disease
six of the eight mutations in abca7 were also found to be present in other populations of europe ancestry , including the us , indicating that the results are not specific to the icelandic population
they also identify a variant of the gene abcb4 that is significantly associated with the risk of developing liver disease
' large scale whole - genome sequencing of the icelandic population ' this study demonstrates how decode is able to use national genealogies to infer rare genetic mutations throughout the population
the study found nearly eight per cent of the 104,000 people studied having at least one gene that do n't work
this date range , based on a calculation of human mutation rates , contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago ' loss - of - function variants in abca7 confer risk of alzheimer 's disease ' this study details mutations in the abca7 gene that are associated with an increased risk of alzheimer 's disease
six of the eight mutations in abca7 were also found to be present in other populations of europe ancestry , including the us , indicating that the results are not specific to the icelandic population
a separate study reveals that 8,000 icelandic â around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that does n't function at all
the scientists now intend to recall those icelandic with knock - out genes as part of a new study to try to identify any physical differences or diseases that have caused the silenced genes
a separate study reveals that 8,000 icelandic â around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that does n't function at all
' but stefansson says that the results should still be representative of people in other areas because the icelandic population does n't meet any of the requirements for interbreeding
because the population in icelandic has very little genetic diversity , scientists can find genetic variants that raise the chance of disease more easily
