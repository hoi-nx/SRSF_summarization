a woman who discovered she was conceived by rape has been adopted by her birth mother more than 40 years after she was given away
rebecca always knew she was n't brought up by her biological parents , but it was not until she searched for her birth mother that she found out why
the 45 - year - old , from michigan , us , waited until she was 18 to track down met joann , who revealed she had considered aborting her daughter â and later told her that her biological father was a rapist
rebecca , pictured with met joann , 77 , had to wait until she was 18 to track down her biological mother , who confessed she would have aborted her daughter , who was conceived by rape after she was attacked met joann , now 77 , had been attacked while she was on her way to a shop at night , and dragged to a nearby field
rebecca said : ' mum told me she thought he was going to kill her
' the attacker was never caught but met joann discovered she was pregnant with his baby
rebecca explained : ' abortion was illegal in michigan
rebecca , pictured growing up , left and right , said she always knew she had been adopted but had no idea about her mother 's attack until it was confirmed by her adoption case worker reunited : met joann walked rebecca down the aisle during her wedding to robert in 1998 ' she said she thought about asking her cousin to adopt me but realised it would be too difficult for her to keep me in the family
' rebecca , who waited until she was 18 to find her biological mother , and lost her adoptive parents as a result , said she understood why her mother had that reaction
' rebecca had always known she was adopted from a young age
she said : ' kids at school picked on me for looking nothing like my short , dark - haired parents
' my adoptive parents were very strict and i was nothing like them
rebecca revealed she was desperate to find her birth mother , met joann , who was thrilled to see her after more than 40 years
she has now adopted rebecca , who says she finally feels like she ' belongs in the world ' ' my adoptive dad told me i had a half - brother and half - sister , so i wondered if i was the product of an affair or perhaps mum had been widowed
' rebecca 's adoption case worker confirmed the truth
after a change in law , rebecca could receive basic details about her birth parents
she said : ' when i turned 18 i would be able to request information like my birth parents ' eye colour or height , but nothing that would identify them
' her father 's description set rebecca 's alarm bells ringing
' my adoptive parents tried to comfort me but they did n't know how to console me
rebecca has said she has even told her own children how her mother was attacked she received a reply with her mother 's full name and rebecca 's name at birth - judy ann miracle
and when rebecca married husband robert kiessling in 1998 , met joann was the mother of the bride
' sadly rebecca 's relationship with her adoptive parents was not as strong and they severed contact
