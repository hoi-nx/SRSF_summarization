for oâneill , working under strachan in the english top flight was a bittersweet experience
in fact , at coventry , the midfielder found the experience of being an inferior player to a manager in his early 40s about as palatable as strachan âs famed longevity - fuelling concoction of porridge , bananas and seaweed
if oâneill âs injury - scarred spell at highfield road was not the most notable of an otherwise successful career , the northern ireland manager retains a high regard for his scotland counterpart and hopes the pair can soon share success in the international arena
northern ireland manager o'neill has been preparing his side to face strachan 's scotland strachan 's side will be hoping to go into their euro 2016 qualifier against gibraltar on the back of a win scotland have not qualified for a major tournament since france 98 , while northern ireland have not been seen at a finals since the days when brazil âs josimar rocketed one of the all - time great world cup goals past pat jennings
but on the road to france 2016 , scotland are third in group d , while northern ireland are second in group f. as the two nations face off in a friendly at hampden , oâneill hopes both men can lead their respective countries out of the international wilderness
â i played under strachan at coventry â it âs always a concern when the manager is a better player than you , â quipped the 45 - year - old former dundee united and hibs midfielder
it was a bit unfortunate that injuries thwarted my opportunity at coventry but it was evident back then what type of manager strachan was going to be
so it does nât surprise me how well he has done with scotland
he was a great appointment and exactly what scotland needed at that time
scotland national team boss strachan , pictured in 2001 , coached o'neill during his time as coventry manager â it âs pretty evident the improvement they have made under strachan
scotland have nât quite had that to deal with - but i âd love to see both countries do it
â oâneill still lives in edinburgh and remains an avid viewer of the scottish game , not just because it is home to several northern ireland internationals
â there are now potential internationals of the future getting their chance in first - teams in the premiership and championship and that can only be good for the scotland national team
â manchester united team - mates jonny evans and paddy mcnair are expected to start in defence for northern ireland captain davis , a return to hampden will bring back fond memories of his last appearance in mount florida
back in march 2011 , he scored the opening goal as rangers beat celtic 2 - 1 in extra time to lift the league cup final â the club âs last major trophy before administration then liquidation visited ibrox and leading players including davis quit
but the honesty of it is we could only try and make a decision based on what we thoughts was best at the time and you have to live by that
and the former rangers captain , who played in the 2008 uefa cup final with the ibrox side , hopes the hiring of nine - in - a - row idol stuart mccall can kick - starts a rangers revival back towards past glories
