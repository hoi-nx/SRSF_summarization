danish has slammed as " unacceptable " comments by russian 's envoy to danish that joining nato 's missile defense shield would make danish warships " targets for russian nuclear missiles
" in august last year , danish said that at least one of its frigates would be equipped with a radar that would allow it to contribute to nato 's missile defense shield
in an opinion article published in the danish newspaper jyllands posten on saturday , russian ambassador vanin said he did not think the danish fully understood the consequences of joining the missile shield
" if this happens , danish warships become targets for russian nuclear missiles , " he wrote
" tensions between russian and nato member countries have been mounting since russian 's annexation of crimea in 2014 and claims its military has been involved in the ongoing violence in eastern eastern ukraine
" on march 2 , nato deputy secretary general alexander vershbow told the alliance 's annual meeting on arms control : " russian 's illegal annexation of crimea and its continuing destabilization of eastern ukraine have put the european security system -- and all the rules and agreements that underpin it -- under severe strain
" nato has previously asked russian to participate in the system , but negotiations were deadlocked over russian 's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to moscow 's own systems .
