motorists may soon be able to direct the headlamps of their car with their eyes , according to car manufacturer vauxhall
the company has revealed it is developing eye - tracking technology that will automatically adjust the direction and intensity of headlights to match the driver 's gaze
the system uses an in - car camera that focuses on the drivers head with infrared sensors to detect movement and calculate the motorist 's line of sight
vauxhall 's new eye - tracking system will direct the car headlights in the direction that the motorist is looking
the system uses a central camera and peripheral infrared sensors that scan the driver 's eyes more than 50 times per second in dusk and night - time conditions vauxhall - which sells its vehicles under the brand opel in some countries and is owned by general motors - insists that the technology will automatically compensate should a driver be distracted or look away from the road
the company added it is still currently developing the system but hopes to introduce it to vehicles as its third - generation of intelligent lighting systems in the coming years
the system uses a central camera and peripheral infrared sensors that scan the driver 's eyes more than 50 times per second in dusk and night - time conditions
the headlights adjust to match the driver 's gaze both vertically and horizontally
this will be combined with sensors outside the car that will detect daylight levels , turning on the headlights automatically when the vehicle enters a tunnel
this allows the vehicle to automatically adjust the beam to preventing dazzling other users by reducing the intensity of the beam
a matrix of leds in the headlights additionally mean that parts of the headlight closest to oncoming traffic can be deactivated when passing other vehicles , while keeping the rest of the road illuminated

' vauxhall / opel 's international technical development centre has been developing the eye - tracking technology with the technical university of darmstadt in germany
' vauxhall says its new led matrix lighting will deactivate parts of the headlight beam to avoid dazzling other drivers , shown in the image on the left , while keeping the rest of the road fully illuminated
the image on the right shows how headlights without the system can dazzle a motorist travelling in the opposite direction vauxhall 's afl + adaptive front lighting technology uses a forward - facing camera to detect the road conditions ahead and adjust the shape and intensity of the beam , as shown in the diagram above vauxhall 's system uses an internal camera and infrared sensors track the driver 's gaze 50 times a second
