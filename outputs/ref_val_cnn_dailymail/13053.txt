things got testy on " cnn tonight " when conservative commentator ferguson charged that rappers like james are profiting off the n - word
" i 'll be honest with you , " ferguson told james on monday night
" i think you know that we should probably get rid of the n - word , but in reality , i think many rappers are afraid they will lose out on money and sales and street cred if they do n't stop using the word
" i 'm making money off of doing music and being creative , sir , " james responded
" i 'm not making money just because i use the n - word
" to which ferguson responded : " trinidad , you would n't be on this show tonight if it was n't for using the n - word in your rap music
