brain scans revealed neurons respond differently to real words compared to so - called ' nonsense ' words in what 's been dubbed ' visual dictionary ' the study , carried out at georgetown university medical centre , suggests brain is ' holistically tuned ' to recognise complete words , according to the researchers
' the small area in the brain called the visual word form area is found in the left side of the visual cortex , opposite the fusiform face area on the right side , which remembers how faces look
the study published in the journal of neuroscience looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words
for the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) , before and after participants learnt the new words
using the fmri - rapid adaptation , the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the nonsense words
the researchers said this shows the brain is ' holistically tuned ' to recognise complete words , and may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities

' in particular , the team found the visual word form area in the fusiform gyrus ( shown in purple ) changed as the participants learned the ' nonsense ' words
the neurons began by responding to the training words as if they were nonsense , but over time , these neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words following a previous study carried out by the team published in 2009 , the researchers were contacted by a number of people who had experienced reading difficulties and teachers helping people with reading difficulties , all saying that learning word as visual objects had helped a great deal
