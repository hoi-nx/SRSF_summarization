cheryl â pop starlet turned x factor judge â yesterday revealed she has had her image - defining mane of long extensions snipped off
however , if imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery , then cheryl must have a serious crush herself â on one victoria beckham
my fair ladies : cheryl ( left ) and her lighter locks , in july 2011 , mirror a golden victoria beckham in her spice girl reunion days in december 2007 side issue : a slick parting heralds a serious look for cheryl in may 2011 ( left ) , but a pouting victoria beckham had already got there in february 2009 centre stage : both girls went for the centre parting , dark bob early in their careers - cheryl ( left ) in 2002 , following victoria beckham in 1997 pin - ups : cheryl ( left ) unveils her messy up - do at a film premiere last year , while victoria beckham tried her version in september 2013 wag alert : with extensions and a big blow - dry , it 's cheryl ( left ) in 2006 , taking her lead from victoria beckham two years earlier for , it turns out , that where the former spice girl leads in the hairstyle stakes , so former girls aloud singer cheryl follows
whether it is a bob , a side - plait or a bun , it seems that cheryl likes to borrow , or revisit , looks from her style mentor
of course victoria beckham , now 40 , did it all first â from a career in a world - beating all - girl band to marriage to an england footballer
twisted sisters : cheryl steps out with a loose side - plait last summer - a style tried successfully by victoria beckham ( right ) in april 2012 who 's that curl ? a cascading mane for both ladies - cheryl ( left ) in 2012 and victoria beckham sporting the look a full decade earlier fun with a bun : cheryl at the 2012 capital fm summertime ball and victoria beckham ( right ) at the british fashion awards in 2009 my little pony : cheryl ( left ) pictured in july 2006 , has a blonde ponytail - just like victoria beckham in 2004 cap that ! cheryl dons a leather cap in 2002 ( left ) - a year after victoria beckham launched her solo career with the same look sources in both camps indicate that they have long since made up â certainly cheryl wore a victoria beckham dress in may 2012 to the premiere of the film what to expect when you âre expecting , and it was reported that the former spice girl had invited cheryl over for dinner later that year so they could properly let bygones be bygones
so what does cheryl âs new hair mean ? it seems to be a part of a complete make - under , embarked upon following her whirlwind second marriage to french restaurateur jean-bernard fernandez-versini in july last year , which has taken her from tanned , blonde wag to sophisticated fashionista â a path trodden by victoria beckham herself
cheryl has hired a new make - up artist and new stylist in order to embrace a more subtle , more high - fashion look
her new image was played to great effect during her much - heralded return as a judge on x factor last year , and sources close to the show indicate she will be asked to come back again this year â with a Â£ 1.5 million fee dangled as an incentive
but will she do so , though , with a baby on board ? some fans firmly believe cheryl is now pregnant , hence the less high - maintenance hair cut , and her relative lack of postings on twitter and instagram in recent weeks
