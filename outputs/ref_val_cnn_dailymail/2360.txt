johnson 's striking blue eyes water as bright sunlight floods into the royal box at newbury racecourse and he casts his mind back to a monday night in stratford almost 21 years ago
it was towards the end of the season and he âd already ridden 70 - odd winners and i had 10
but even before that i âd heard people saying â this mccoy rode a winner today , he was amazing â
â if ap mccoy had been a postman , a plumber or a professor , johnson would probably be talked about as the greatest jump jockey ever
he has been runner - up 15 of the 19 times mccoy has been champion jockey and that figure will probably be 16 come the end of the season

in 2009 he wrote : â having dickie as an adversary has , more than anyone else , spurred me on to ride more winners
â at this , johnson chuckles
but johnson claims there is no room for that in racing , where jockeys know the perils every time they line up at the start and on a more basic level , they have to live with each other day in , day out
it does nât matter how many winners you âve ridden , it âs how long you âve been riding
