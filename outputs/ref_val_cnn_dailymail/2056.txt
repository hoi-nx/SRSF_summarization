a protester has been banned from all qantas and jetstar flights after staging a protest to stop the deportation of a tamil asylum seeker on her flight
ms pilbrow boarded the plane objecting to the transfer and deportation of puvaneethan , a 25 - year - old refugee , who she believed would face persecution upon arriving back in sri lanka
upon boarding the flight ms pilbrow refused to take her seat until puvaneethan was taken off the plane and returned to the melbourne
pilbrow discovered she was banned from qantas flights after reading an article in the age standing by her convictions : ms pilbrow makes a speech during the international day of peace ' i tried to follow up on the ban but there was no number for me to call
when i called qantas headquarters they sent me to customer service who told me to fill out a form if i had a complaint about the ban , ' ms pilbrow said , adding that she is seeking legal advice
' ms pilbrow is not alone as two other passengers also received ban notices after deciding they would boycott the flight
paul leary , 51 , and his female colleague were not involved in the protest but said they felt ' uncomfortable ' upon learning of puvaneethan 's deportation
ms pilbrown , mr paul leary and his colleague have also been banned from flying with jetstar and qantas affiliates flyers were handed out at melbourne airport asking the public to save asylum seeker puvaneethan from torture it was n't until mr paul leary was returning from darwin four days later after catching a flight with a different airline that he attempted to return to melbourne with qantas and was told he was subject to a no - fly ban
paul leary was issued with this ' no fly notification ' after he walked off a flight from melbourne to darwin which was carrying an asylum seeker thought to have been taken for deportation while ms pilbrow was dissatisfied by the way qantas communicated the ban to her , she said it was not right for the other two passengers , who were not part of the protest , to also face a ban mr paul leary has since complained to the victorian civil and administrative tribunal 's human rights division saying the ban discriminates against him on the basis of his political belief
' ms pilbrow says it is unfair that the other two passengers , who were not part of the protest , also received bans
