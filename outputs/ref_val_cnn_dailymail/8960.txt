the internet watch foundation sounded the alarm that younger and younger children are now posting photographs and videos online from their bedrooms and bathrooms teachers are to be issued new guidance this week to help children cope with the â unimaginable â pressures of the modern digital age , including cyberbullying , sexting and â revenge porn â
children will also be taught about consensual sex to help vulnerable girls â spot , report and tackle abuse â
â mrs morgan highlighted research that showed two in three 11 to 16 - year - olds reported having friends who had been bullied online
she added : â the evidence base is still small but in a survey conducted last year , just eight police forces reported 150 allegations relating to revenge porn over a two - year period
â some 82.5 per cent of the images and videos examined featured children and young people aged 16 - 20 years old , while 17.5 per cent featured those aged 15 and under â if the revelations of recent weeks have shown us anything it âs that the stakes are too high to let our young people leave school without this knowledge
â mrs morgan said she was concerned that children were growing up in a world that places â huge value on style and arguably not always as much value on substance â
in research conducted at the start of this year , a third of 11 to 16 - year - olds said they felt the pressure to update their social media profiles with pictures or postings that make them look good
claire lilley , head of child online safety at the nspcc , said : ' the truly worrying problem is the number of very young children who are being coerced into providing material which is almost certainly finishing - up in the hands of sex offenders
' some older children may be willingly taking part in making sexually explicit videos because it might seem edgy or exciting
' jacqueline beauchere , chief online safety officer at microsoft , which sponsored the study , said : ' the data are disturbing and suggest increased attention needs to be brought to this issue
' for its part , microsoft will seek to create and deploy appropriate technology , raise awareness and help to educate the public , and continue to partner with organisations like the internet watch foundation to ensure strategies and proposed solutions are research - based
