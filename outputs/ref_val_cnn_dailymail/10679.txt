the japanese invented one of the world 's favourite foods , sushi , and are mad on their iphones
combine the two , thought one mad - cap japanese designer and businessman , and we 'll have the perfect item - the sushi phone
by crafting perfect imitations of japanese food to adorn iphone covers masatatsu kajikawa says he is helping iphone fans watch videos on their handsets with ease as the sushi doubles as a stand , while making a style statement
the fake sushi looks incredibly realistic , such as this giant piece clasped to a fan 's ear ( left ) and a fried shrimp sushi model on in iphone cover ( right ) this piece of sushi roll looks almost good enough to eat - but it 's actually made by fake food artisans you can certainly believe creator masatatsu kajikawa when he says : ' i love sushi so very , very much ' the food items such as chunky maguro tuna sushi help the iphone to stand upright and facilitate the phones use of as a mini monitor says masatatsu kajikawa , who also runs a kerosene heater factory near osaka when he 's not creating new start - ups
crafted in the fashion of customised mobile cases - a style japanese call decoden - the 33 - year - old designer wanted to celebrate 16 years since the birth of the mobile internet revolution in japanese and his love of sushi
' i love sushi so very , very much , so my passion for raw fish made me want to create these cases , for sushi lovers all over the world
mr masatatsu kajikawa 's case covers are made by the same fake food artisans who create the realistic displays of food outside some restaurants in japanese to entice customers inside
you can really stand out from the crowd with these accessories , like this copy of amaebi , or sweet shrimp customisation of phones , known as decoden , is big business in japanese - though sushi is n't always involved ' each iphone case is handmade so i wo n't be producing a lot of them , ' says mr. masatatsu kajikawa
' he has so far come up with a few sushi favourites as well as other japanese standards such as deep fried prawns and hamburger steaks
worth in the region of 10 billion yen a year decoden , a portmanteau of ' decoration ' and the japanese word for phone ' denwa , is crossing japanese 's borders into asia and inspiring smart phone personalisation elsewhere
japanese has a culture of charms and trinkets , known as omamori ' , which phones bring into the 21st century you can even get sushi - shaped earrings and a key - ring - all part of the bizarre japanese craze japanese has become so mad about its mobiles they have even slowed the national walking pace as the nation peers into their hand - helds to check their emails and surf the net
leaving the market for japanese mobile phone technology in the doldrums docomo was good at pulling it all together in japanese but when the operators and manufacturers exported their ideas they stumbled because they were n't very good at building relationships with foreign carriers , ' says mr brown on why japanese was unable to capitalise on its its head start with smartphones and mobile internet
