at least eight female students at brigham young university in utah were ' catfished ' by the same 24 - year - old woman - who pretended to be a man
the victims all believed they were involved in a relationship with a mormon man living in the same state - only to find out they were being duped by a woman in texas
at the same time , another victim , sara vanwagenen , believed she was in a relationship with a man called ' hyrum young '
the pair eventually realised the texts they were receiving were from the same number and it turned out they had both been duped by a woman called kayla , from texas
kayla later told the women she was coming out as gay and that that she was ' essentially practicing ' on the brigham young university students , fox13 reports
