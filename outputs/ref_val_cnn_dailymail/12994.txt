deep within the amazonian rainforest of ecuador live the huaorani
photographer trupal pandya traveled about 30 hours by air , water and land to reach this native community and take their portraits
the huaorani , which means " the people " or " human beings , " are believed to have inhabited the rainforest for thousands of years
trupal pandya said there is a contrast between the modernization of the younger generation , who travel to areas outside of their community , and the older generation , who make efforts to maintain their traditional ways of living
diverse changes have taken place within the community : the introduction of radios within many huaorani homes , the consumption of food from cities and the adoption of westernized clothing
for trupal pandya , these changes were a significant factor in his decision to photograph the huaorani
many huaorani , who for years have only communicated using a regional dialect , now speak the ecuador native language of spanish
prior to creating formal portraits using his professional camera equipment and lighting , trupal pandya took polaroid photos of the huaorani that they were then able to keep
for his formal portraits , trupal pandya placed his subjects in front of a solid white background in order to portray the huaorani in a very direct and concise manner , eliminating the presence of any distractions
trupal pandya 's decision to use a white background also proved effective in highlighting the coexistence between the huaorani and the different kinds of animals they encounter daily in their natural environment
creating portraits of the huaorani has been a " fascinating , challenging " experience for trupal pandya , who is studying photography in new york at the fashion institute of technology
after witnessing firsthand the simplicity in which the huaorani live in harmony with their environment , trupal pandya said he finds himself thinking about and reflecting upon what it truly means to be satisfied and content with life
