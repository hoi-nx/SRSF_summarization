watch # one2eleven every friday evening on the fantasy football club , sky sports 1 or catch up on demand
paul ince ( centre ) picks his best 11 he played with and included david beckham ( left ) and paul gascoigne goalkeeper : peter schmeichel has to be ' big pete
' what a fantastic goalkeeper , i played with david seaman and he was a very good goalkeeper but for me peter schmeichel was another level
just the fact that , one on one 's , normally when somebody goes through on the goalkeeper you just pray that they 're going to save it but you just knew peter schmeichel was going to save it , so we 'd always set up a counter-attack because we knew he would
he could also throw the ball as far as he could kick it and the amount of times we would get get corners against us , he 'd pluck it and release it to ryan giggs and kanchelskis and we 'd score goals
best goalkeeper in the world during his time
right back : javier zanetti he is a great player
zanetti joined inter the same time as me and he was just awesome
he was just a young kid but he just slotted into the way we played
the reason i put him in ahead of gary neville is because javier can play in different positions and i always want players who can be flexible and what ever position he played in - he was world class
in our england team we were all men , we were all big characters and big men but he was men - of - men
peter schmeichel was labelled as the best goalkeeper in the world by former team - mate paul ince gary pallister ( right ) played with paul ince at united and was picked in his fantasy football club squad central defender : gary pallister very unlucky to not play for england more
left back : roberto carlos when i first met him at inter , i thought wow
right wing : david beckham an easy decision
david beckham was the true professional , he was probably the best technical player i played with
paul ince described david beckham as the best technical player he played with during his footballing career midfielder : roy keane for a complete player , without a doubt keano
paul gascoigne was highly praised by paul ince and claims the former newcastle man was the best he played with left wing : ryan giggs he would play 20 games and be unplayable , he was that good
striker : alan shearer when i think about a complete striker and what i 'd want as a manager as my striker is alan shearer
eric cantona ( left ) and alan shearer are two of the best strikers the premier league has seen paul ince shows how his fantasy football club xi ( with nicknames ) would line up on the pitch
