residents living in a picturesque rural village with a population of just 613 have slammed plans to build a muslim cemetery on greenbelt land - for over 3,000 people
the proposed site in leafy catherine-de-barnes , near solihull , west midlands , will include a total of 3,333 graves for followers of islamic
this is despite muslim accounting for fewer than 3 per cent of the population of solihull and its surrounding areas
residents living in a picturesque rural village have hit out at controversial plans to build a muslim cemetery on rural land the proposed site of 3,000 graves ( edged in blue ) and the previous applications ( green and red ) that have been made for the sites near solihull , west midlands previous applications to build what would have been britain 's largest muslim - only cemetery put before solihull metropolitan borough have been unsuccessful
but cemetery development services have now submitted scaled down plans with fewer graves , which could be approved next month
it would mean the cemetery could eventually hold over five times as many people as catherine-de-barnes itself
the graveyard would be able to comply fully with sharia law which states muslim are traditionally buried in their own section of land , next to others of the same faith
locals are also objecting the plans for the cemetery based on concerns surrounding the impact it will have on traffic
' so plans to have a graveyard exclusively for muslim just seems a bit absurd to me
the proposal in catherine-de-barnes , near solihull , west midlands , would include a total of 3,333 graves for followers of islamic he said : ' this is simply not an appropriate place to site a cemetery
' there is no need for this extra site in solihull
' obviously people are concerned about the scale of the development and its threat to greenbelt land around catherine-de-barnes
he added : ' at this stage we see no obvious difference in this application to the earlier plans or for planning to draw a different conclusion
' in solihull we do n't have a huge muslim population ' when the first application was taken down local people were delighted that it had gone away , but it 's come back with very little adjustment
' the cemetery has received backing from the muslim community in solihull , who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces
the first application for planning permission for the cemetery was made in july 2014 and was for 4,000 burial plots , which was refused
' to preserve this centuries old tradition in this part of the world we acquired a plot of land in the catherine-de-barnes area of solihull after consulting and obtaining positive response from solihull metropolitan borough
the cemetery has received backing from the muslim community in solihull , who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces ' it is also an established fact that there is a shortage of burial places across the country
