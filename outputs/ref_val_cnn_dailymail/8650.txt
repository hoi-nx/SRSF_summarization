a woman who fled with her son while fighting to prevent his circumcision will face imprisonment if she does n't return and allow the surgery to proceed , a judge ruled friday
in a stinging rebuke of the mother , heather hironimus , circuit judge gillen said she had successfully dragged out a legal battle and was ' reprehensible ' for going missing with the boy and for conduct that has put the 4 - year - old in a public spotlight ' making him an object of curiosity and worse '
circuit judge gillen said on friday that heather hironimus could escape jail if she appears before him on tuesday with the child she will only avoid jail on the contempt charge , gillen said , if she signs paperwork necessary to schedule the procedure that she initially agreed to in a legal document
though heather hironimus gave her blessing to circumcision in the parenting plan she reached with the boy 's father , dennis nebus of boca raton , she later changed her mind , leading to a long court battle
the father has called circumcision ' just the normal thing to do
both nebus and the boy 's doctors have received death threats
' dennis nebus said he has not seen his son since feb. 19
protesters in december in florida , who are known as ' intactivists ' have made the four - year - old 's case their cause celebre and organized a series of protests
