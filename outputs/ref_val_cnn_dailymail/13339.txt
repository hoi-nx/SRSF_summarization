vigilante motorists in new zealand have taken to snatching the car keys of foreign drivers amid rising concern over dangerous driving by tourists
new zealand media have reported five cases this year of locals forcibly taking the keys of foreign motorists after witnessing driving that concerned them
the incidents occurred amid heightened public concern over tourist driving standards , with eight people killed in crashes involving foreign drivers in the space of a fortnight last month
penman told local media it was not the first time he had taken a tourist 's car keys
only 6 % of crashes in new zealand involve foreign drivers , according to the latest figures provided by the ministry of transport
but in some remote regions of the south island particularly popular with tourists for their scenery -- such as the mackenzie , southland , queenstown-lakes and kaikoura districts -- foreign drivers are involved in about a quarter of all crashes
in westland , on the south island 's rugged west coast , foreign drivers are involved in 37 % of road crashes resulting in death or injury
kokshoorn , mayor of the neighboring grey district , said tourist driving behavior was a major problem in the region and attributed the issue to tourists from countries that drive on the right
" a ministry of transport spokesperson said that while this was a factor , figures showed that australian and british drivers were involved in the most crashes overall , " so unfamiliarity with which side of the road to drive on is not the only factor
" he said the best approach was better education on local driving conditions for foreign drivers , particularly at the rental companies where they picked up their vehicles
anyone with a foreign drivers license or permit is able to drive in new zealand for up to a year
associate transport minister craig foss said the government recognized that " many people are concerned with poor driving behavior on challenging roads in and around popular tourist destinations " and had established a project in response
kokshoorn said it was important to " strike the right balance " in getting the message to foreign drivers to take care on the unfamiliar roads
