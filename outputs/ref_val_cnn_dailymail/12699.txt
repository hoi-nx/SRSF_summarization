what is surprising is that u.s. policy ignored all of this and proceeded on the premise that simply drone - bombing al qaeda terrorists could keep yemen intact and stable
indeed , last fall , when president barack obama pointed to u.s. policy in yemen as an example of a " success " and a model for the plans that would roll back the islamic state ( also known as isis ) , i shivered
this week , the houthis forces are closing in on yemen 's second major city , aden , on the south coast , and the u.s. - supported president , hadi , has reportedly fled the country
yemen does have value as a lesson -- this is what happens when you ignore the basic foundations of social stability
rather than working to secure these things , the u.s. administration has succumbed to the illusion that precision bombing or other surgical interventions to remove " dangerous elements " will sustain broader social and political stability
anyone could see that the conditions for collapse were progressing in yemen and that aerial attacks on al qaeda terrorists would have no effect on them
what we have now is an area with about 24 million people , more than twice the population now under the rule of the islamic state in eastern syria and western iraq , that is virtually ungoverned and up for grabs and is falling into the grips of an all - out civil war between iran - supported shi'as and al qaeda / isis - aligned sunnis
in other words , what has happened in yemen , although predictable , is about the worst outcome imaginable for u.s. policy
