the study compared the dna of current africans and european using more than 4,000 dna samples to reveal the genetic fingerprints of the slave trade and colonisation
it also highlighted previously unidentified ancestry , such as basque lineages in south america , along with a â surprising â degree of variation in the ancestry of modern - day americans
the study compared the genes of current africans and european using more than 4,000 dna samples to reveal the genetic fingerprints of the slave trade and colonisation
they included people in barbadians , columbia , the dominican republic , ecuador , mexico , puerto rico and african - americans in the usa
the study , led by oxford university , compared the ' donor ' africans and european dna with ' recipient ' american populations to see where their ancestors came from
professor capellii , who is italian , was particularly suprised to find evidence of the basque in colombia and the italian in puerto rico , as well as the fact that some part of spanish , but not others , contributed spanish dna to the south america he explained how his team first grouped subsets of people in africa and european who were genetically similar
in total , the group , which also included researchers from university college london and the universita ' del sacro cuore of rome , used dna sample from 64 different populations they included people in barbadians , columbia , the dominican republic , ecuador , mexico , puerto rico and african - americans in the usa
the study found that while spanish provide the majority of european ancestry in continental american hispanic / latino populations , the most common european genetic source in african - americans and barbadians comes from the uk
the basque , a distinct ethnic group spread across current - day spanish and french , provided a small but distinct genetic contribution to current - day american populations , including the maya in mexico
the basque ( light ) , a distinct ethnic group spread across current - day spanish and french , provided a small but distinct genetic contribution to current - day american populations , including the maya in mexico the oxford team first grouped subsets of people in africa and european who were genetically similar
they then compared the data with the genomes from 2,500 american people of mixed ancestry the ancestors of current - day yoruba people ( left ) from africa - which is one of the largest africans ethnic groups - provided the largest contribution of genes from africa to all current - day american populations
the most common european genetic source in african - americans and barbadians comes from the uk ( right ) - the most common european genetic source in african - americans and barbadians comes from the uk
- the basque , a distinct ethnic group spread across spanish and french , provided a small but distinct genetic contribution to current - day american populations
- compared to south americans , people from caribbean countries ( such as the barbadians ) had a larger genetic contribution from africa
- the ancestors of current - day yoruba people from africa provided the largest contribution of genes from africa to all current - day american populations
the ancestors of current - day yoruba people from africa - which is one of the largest africans ethnic groups - provided the largest contribution of genes from africa to all current - day american populations
' we can see the huge genetic impact that the slave trade had on american populations and our data match historical records ' , said study author dr garrett hellenthal from the ucl genetics institute , ' the majority of americans have ancestry similar to the yoruba people in africa , confirming that most african slaves came from this region
' researchers also found that the proportion of africans ancestry varied across the continent , from virtually zero in the maya people from mexico to 87 per cent in current - day barbadians
south italy and sicily also provided a significant european genetic contribution to colombia and puerto rico , in line with the known history of italian emigrants to the south america in the late 19th and early 20th century one of the americans groups from the usa had french ancestry , in agreement with historical french immigration into the colonial southern united states
