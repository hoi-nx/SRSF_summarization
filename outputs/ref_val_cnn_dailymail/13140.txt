hillary clinton is back in the middle of an unfolding controversy
the revelation that as secretary of state she maintained a private email account , and that she had a private computer server in her new york home , sent shock waves through the world of politics last week
questions arose about whether clinton conducted her official business on private email , possibly violating regulations that were written to ensure that the activities of government officials remain accessible to the public
when her husband , clinton , was president of the americans , she was one of the first targets of the earliest investigations into the administration -- " travel-gate , " " file-gate " and the whitewater affair
she stood by her husband 's side later in his presidency when white house gop moved to impeach him for having lied about his sexual relationship with monica lewinsky , a white house intern
although clinton enjoyed a bit of a break when serving in the senate , the controversies resumed once she became secretary of state under president obama
" based on her history , what can we expect from the clinton scandal playbook ? attack the accuser and the investigative process : nobody has done this better than hillary clinton
when her husband first confronted charges about his affair , clinton famously went on television and spoke about a " right - wing conspiracy " that she claimed was driving the scandal
she employed a similar strategy with the benghazi investigations , arguing that the inquiry was more a political tool used to rally the base than a serious investigation
as more republicans ca n't resist jumping on the issue , clinton will push back , focusing public attention less on the issue than on the idea that this is part of a political narrative to bring her down
people should not expect clinton to do anything drastic in the near future
while some democrats are champing at the bit to use this opportunity to push other members of their party ( elizabeth warren ! ) into the political fray , clinton is not going to give them any space to do this
democrats are tired of elected officials who roll over too easily when attacked by gop
this has been one of the major complaints from democrats about obama
even when many democrats were furious with the white house following the monica lewinsky revelation , the clintons appealed to partisan instincts and rallied the troops to fight for them as a way to push back against the gop
by 1998 , they had transformed the issue from being about clinton and perjury to a struggle to protect the democrats
clinton will do this again
given that democrats feel the stakes are enormously high to keep control of the white house so that the next president can protect obama 's programs from republican attack , clinton will appeal to that instinct to carry her through
but the clinton playbook is pretty clear and road - tested
if clinton 's critics and opponents expect her to just roll over , they really have n't been studying their history .
