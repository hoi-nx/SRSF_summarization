britain 's foreign aid budget is to be protected by law following a historic vote last night â but ministers still refused to protect funding for the armed forces
the house of lords voted to commit future governments to spending at least 0.7 per cent of national wealth â currently around Â£ 12billion a year â on overseas development
legislation forcing britain to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid is set to become law tonight last night tories lined up to lambast the move , saying it is wrong for aid spending to be protected when savage cuts to defence are expected after the election
by contrast , the aid budget has soared from Â£ 8.5billion in 2010 to Â£ 11.5billion in 2013 â the year that the 0.7 per cent of gross national income was reached for the first time
legislation to set the aid target in stone was passed by the house of lords despite opposition from tory grandees including former chancellor lord lawson , who has described the measure as â gesture politics â
sir gerald howarth , the former conservative defence minister , said aid spending should be cut to allow an increase in the defence budget â because russia is increasing spending on arms and the middle east is in flames
foreign aid spending rose to more than Â£ 11billion in 2013 as ministers moved to hit the 0.7 % target â this is a dangerous world , â he told bbc radio 4 âs world at one
â more than 300 tory backbenchers are expected to rebel on thursday by forcing a commons vote on enshrining the 2 per cent defence target in law
