british should ban major russian tycoons like abramovich from london , demanded putin 's most prominent foe , navalny ( pictured ) these russian moneymen are seen as close to strongman putin , but sanctions so far have not hit them directly
navalny , released from a short jail sentence in moscow this week , is seeking to inspire the russian opposition after the brutal murder of fellow putin foe nemtsov in the shadow of the kremlin
navalny believes that if tycoons such as abramovich ( pictured ) ca n't get to their london residences , it will put pressure on moscow to pull out of ukraine ' usmanov , abramovich , and their families - if they ca n't get to their residences in london or in switzerland , that will make a difference
russian oligarchs ' all hate him but they feel they ca n't but remain silent '
' with nemtsov now dead , navalny is seen as russian 's most effective and charismatic opposition campaigner .
