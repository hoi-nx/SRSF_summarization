liverpool manager brendan rodgers is confident fatigue will not hamper their bid for a top - four place despite an arduous season so far
european commitments and a run to the semi-final of the capital one cup , in addition to their continued involvement in the fa cup , means the reds have played 46 matches this season
that is already three more than in the whole of the previous campaign , which saw them fall agonisingly short of winning the premier league

however , with an eight - day break , during which the players were given some much - needed time off , brendan rodgers believes they will be firing on all cylinders on his return to former club swansea on monday
' we go into a run of games now , starting with swansea , and we feel we can go in and push on in terms of our level of performance again

they are now only seven points off second place but brendan rodgers knows with manchester united - whom they play next weekend - to catch and tottenham and southampton chasing them there is still plenty of work to do
