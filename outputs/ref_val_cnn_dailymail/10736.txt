gon na try work this out for sure ! ' kevin pietersen has made no secret of his desire to return to the england setup but it seems unlikey indications in the 24 hours since colin graves ' bbc interview appear to have been less encouraging for the exiled 34 - year - old batsman
the ecb issued a statement on sunday , insisting ' nothing has changed ' in his status and adding ' only players who are playing consistent high - quality county cricket and who are seen as a positive influence will be selected for england '
but bbc pundit geoff boycott has called for face - to - face discussions in which the governing body is ' fair ' to kevin pietersen and does not ' lead him on ' without a true intention to recall him as long as he plays well
colin graves stressed the pre-requisite of any conceivable progress must be a return to county cricket , something kevin pietersen 's summer twenty20 contracts in the indian and caribbean premier leagues will hardly help
new ecb chairman colin graves suggested over the weekend the door could still be open for kevin pietersen his involvement in english domestic cricket for surrey last summer was fleeting - exclusively in the natwest t20 blast - following his sacking by england
boycott has identified clear communication between kevin pietersen and colin graves as the starting point to ensure no new stumbling blocks are created
he told the bbc : ' it says to me that kevin pietersen needs to get a meeting with colin graves as soon as he can - and , preferably , with downton and whitaker there after he has spoken to the chairman - because he wants to be clear
new england and wales cricket board chairman colin graves wants kevin pietersen ( right ) to play county cricket ' it 's all right the chairman saying he has to play county cricket
' it needs to be put clear to him that if he plays well in county cricket then there 's going to be a genuine - and i mean the word genuine - change of heart and change of opinion that he is going to be open for selection and that they are going to put bygones to one side
he added : ' if whitaker and downton ca n't accept a change of plan or opinion from the chairman then they have to resign , do n't they ? former england captain geoff boycott has warned the ecb to not ' lead on ' kevin pietersen over a possible return ' it 's simple
' kevin pietersen , meanwhile , intends to seek an audience with colin graves - well aware he and his advisers must somehow try to resurrect a county career before they can think about any more glory days with england
