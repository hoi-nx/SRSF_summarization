doctors warned that taking the contraceptive pill triples the risk of developing an incurable disease of the digestive system taking the contraceptive pill triples the risk of developing an incurable disease of the digestive system , doctors warned last night
cases of crohn âs disease have exploded since the 1960s , and researchers now believe widespread use of the pill may be one of the main reasons behind the dramatic rise
they have found sex hormones in contraceptive pills can weaken the gut , creating the perfect conditions for crohn âs to develop
the doctors also fear that repeated use of the â morning - after pill â â which contains even higher doses of sex hormones than the daily tablet â might make women still more prone to it
at least two uk with crohn âs have travelled to switzerland to end their lives at the controversial dignitas clinic
dr khalili , a harvard gastroenterologist , said crohn âs cases had risen â two or three-fold â in the past 50 years , since widespread use of the pill began
exactly why the pill â taken by around 3.5 million women in uk , a third of those of childbearing age â seems to raise the risk of crohn âs remains unclear
but dr khalili said changing a woman âs natural sex hormone levels appeared to do three things that could put them at greater risk : it made the gut lining more permeable , reduced levels of â friendly â bacteria in the intestines and affected the immune system
he added he would expect the morning - after pill to increase the risk further , because it contained higher levels of hormones but said there was no hard data yet to back up that hypothesis
overall , adult women are only a little more likely to have crohn âs than adult men
but twice as many women as men suffer from one of the main forms of crohn âs , where the colon is affected
dr khalili , who practises at massachusetts general hospital in boston , stressed a woman was unlikely to get crohn âs simply by using the pill , and that genetics played a large role
he said : â what âs very clear is that crohn âs is not caused by oral contraceptive use by itself
â cases of crohn âs disease have exploded since the 1960s , and researchers now believe widespread use of the pill may be one of the main reasons behind the dramatic rise it was â not far - fetched â to imagine that women will soon be warned not to go on the pill if they carry certain high - risk genes , he said
dr khalili and his colleagues are now looking at this in a study of 1,500 women , a third of whom have crohn âs
dr simon anderson , a consultant gastroenterologist at london bridge hospital , said the pill appeared to act as a â trigger â to developing crohn âs
he cautioned : â if you have a family history of crohn âs , i would advise against starting on the pill
â crohn âs is not a particularly common disease
â crohn 's disease is a painful condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system
