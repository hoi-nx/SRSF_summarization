this week , google cfo patrick pichette made headlines when his resignation memo announcing his retirement surfaced in the media
" after nearly seven years as patrick pichette , " he began , " i will be retiring from google to spend more time with my family
" the letter , which he said he wrote in part because , " so many people struggle to strike the right balance between work and personal life , " has been held up as a manifesto for the " work / life balance " ideal that 's become something of the new americans dream
" but if patrick pichette 's work / life balance was achieved by quitting his job to go see the world , what message does it send to the rest of us seeking work / life balance ? what message does it send to those workers -- and in particular women -- who are constantly told they can " have it all , " or who can be at the top of their field and have a family ? what does it say to all those women to whom we say that , with a little " leaning in " or " playing big " they do n't have to choose between work and life ? successful women from sheryl sandberg to pepsico ceo indra nooyi have spoken out about the pressure to " have it all , " and how , perhaps , there 's really no such thing
and yet in recent years , " work / life balance " has been held up as a legitimately attainable ideal , one that you can achieve if only you give your personal life as much attention as your professional one
but if you look at those we tend to hold up as models of that ideal -- those who leave work earlier , silence their cellphones more , retire , as in the case of patrick pichette , at 52 -- are they really striking a balance ? which is why talking about work / life balance at all is a perilous business , an invitation to fail
patrick pichette , after all , did not practice work / life balance
this is a man who did n't achieve work / life balance as an executive
patrick pichette retires as google 's highest paid executive , with millions in stock incentives
only then will real work / life balance start to take shape
until then : " google cfo patrick pichette 's goodbye note will make you dream of quitting your job , " so reads a headline at abc news
patrick pichette can " carpe diem " and " find balance , " if that 's what he 's doing , at 52 , because he truly does have choices
but for most of the workers in americans , finding that sort of balance -- or choosing life over work -- will remain an impossible dream .
