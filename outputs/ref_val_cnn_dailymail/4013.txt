a couple have been left devastated after they spent ' every penny ' on a dream home which they found covered in animal urine and faeces on the day they moved in
campbell , 45 , was looking forward to moving into the house after viewing it on november 17 last year and putting in a Â£ 145,000 offer which was accepted the following day
but when she and her fiance david alonzi , 46 , received the keys and tried to move in last month , they were shocked at what they found
faeces were splattered up the walls and urine covered the floors to the point that the carpets and floorboards needed to be removed
horrified ms campbell and her fiance , david alonzi , 46 , believe the property in crossgates , dunfermline , fife , was used as a dog run in the months following their viewing and accepted offer
ms campbell said : ' when we got the brochure and viewed ( the house ) , it looked fantastic , beautifully presented
' after there were delays finalising some of the contract details - known in scottish as the missives - she received the keys on january 22 , just over 10 weeks after viewing the property
we opened the front door and it was cat p * * * i could smell
i went to have a smell and it nearly knocked me out
ms campbell and her fiance david alonzi believe the property in dunfermline , fife , was used as a dog run in the weeks before they moved in floorboards and carpet had to be pulled up as the couple tried their best to rid themselves of the smell ' we lifted the carpet up and the actual floorboard itself was wet
we then realised how extreme this was as urine had soaked all the way through to the joists
' she believes the former owner of the house , a prison officer , was leaving her animals unattended in the property during 12 - hours shifts
the former owner allegedly told her that the property was ' a wee bit dodgy ' but that she would make it ' immaculate ' for them to move in

' even after scrubbing the house for two weeks with enzyme cleaner and bleach , we could n't get rid of the terrible smell
