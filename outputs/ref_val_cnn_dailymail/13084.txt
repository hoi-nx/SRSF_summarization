he 's a rolls royce footballer who honed his game in his parents ' garage
and even at the age of 40 , former juventus star del piero is still purring along , showing no signs of running out of gas
the record - breaking striker is currently enjoying an indian summer to his football career , completing stints at sydney fc in australia and more recently at the delhi dynamos in the inaugural indian super league
inevitably , the time will come when he finally decides to hang up his boots but that does n't look like happening anytime soon -- not when he 's still enjoying himself so much
" about football , i love every single moment -- the life with teammates , the atmosphere before a game , the free kicks , the goals
the man dubbed " il pinturicchio " ( " the little artist " ) has enjoyed a glittering career for both country and club in italy
during 19 seasons at juventus he won 15 trophies including six serie a crowns and a european champions league title , as well as setting club records for appearances and goals
in all , del piero made 705 appearances for the juventus -- including a record 478 in serie a -- and scored 289 goals along the way
" del piero turned professional at the age of 17 , joining serie b side padova in 1991 before being snapped up by juventus for â¬ 2.6 million two years later
his longstanding relationship with the " juventus , " as juventus is affectionately known , got off on the right foot almost from the start
del piero scored five times in 11 appearances in his debut season before making his breakthrough the following year , becoming a first - team regular standing in for injured star striker baggio
while baggio will forever be remembered for missing a penalty kick that handed brazil victory in the 1994 world cup final , del piero has cause to reflect on happier times on football 's biggest stage
after being part of two unsuccessful campaigns in 1998 and 2002 , del piero and italy hit the jackpot in 2006 in germany , beating france on penalties in a final remembered primarily for zinedine zidane 's headbutt on italy defender marco materazzi
but the semifinal was the most exciting
" i ca n't hide that my greatest victory is the world cup
italy 's third world cup triumph came against a backdrop of turmoil in italy 's domestic league as juventus and other serie a teams were implicated in the " calciopoli " match - fixing scandal
the repercussions would see former juventus managing director luciano moggi banned for life by the italian football authorities while the club was stripped of two serie a titles won in 2005 and 2006 , relegated to serie b and docked nine points
but the ever - faithful del piero stayed put , helping juventus secure the serie b title and an immediate return to the top flight
" i think that staying with juventus in serie b , even before i knew how large the points penalty was going to be , was the best decision i could 've made , " del piero said last year
a open letter to juventus ' fans confirmed his exit the following july before signing a two - year deal to play for sydney fc in australia 's a-league in a deal worth aus $ 4 million ( $ 3 million )
