the debate over health care reform once again blooms in d.c. , but this time democrats and the president whose legacy rests on the aca are tending a garden challenged by some rather invasive species
the republicans has kicked off its season by pulling aca up by the roots in its proposed 2016 house budget
and so republicans are also preparing strategic plays if the supreme court rules in their favor this summer , or if a republicans wins the house next year backed by complementary majorities in the house and senate
either scenario would mortally wound aca
upending aca may poison the republicans 's standing with 16.4 million americans who will face adverse , even dire consequences without legislative patches to the law , or a swift switch to a solid alternative health care policy
this week , the conservative weekly the washington examiner aimed to mark aca 's fifth anniversary by asking a panel whether to " reform , replace or restart " the law
once they 've regrouped for their next panel , republicans should instead entertain a different r : revise
many of the republicans plans replace the subsidies that make exchange plans affordable for low - income americans with tax credits
these alternatives appear to be thinly veiled transitions away from the key aca principle of providing guaranteed access
republicans presidential front - runner jeb bush shares cruz 's preference to dismantle the " monstrosity " altogether , describing his preference for cheaper catastrophic insurance that helps people with massive bills but leaves poor americans to fend for themselves when it comes to needless perks -- like insulin and blood pressure pills
his budget proposal dismantles the federal medicaid program by slashing its funding and devolving it to the states , while asking seniors on medicare to try their luck with a voucher - discounted private insurance
the beating heart of aca is its mandate to purchase health insurance , which keeps costs down for everyone , makes it fiscally feasible to cover patients with pre-existing conditions , and makes government subsidies possible for those who ca n't afford any insurance without them
if republicans shift their focus to revising aca , there are an array of spots to trim and weeds to pull , and they can expect many democrats to join in the work
but after dealing with a withering onslaught of over 60 republicans attempts to kill the bill , democrats ca n't make even the most basic fixes for fear of losing everything
furthermore , aca is in part more expensive than it might be because it takes a gamble covering preventive testing for people with no sign of disease for " free , " yet makes patients with chronic conditions pay deductibles even when we know their care will save money in the long run
so , my advice to republicans is that they pick one or two specific aspects of aca they 'd like to improve , let 's have the policy debate , then introduce your legislative fix to the existing law , leaving its beating heart intact
2016 does n't have to be a hyperbolic , hyperventilating contest for the fate of 16.4 million americans .
