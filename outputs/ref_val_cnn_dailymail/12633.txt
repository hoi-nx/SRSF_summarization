hillary clinton worked hard last week to put the " dead end " sign on the state department email story by announcing there was nothing to find
but in her rush to control the narrative , clinton may have ( once again ) missed the bigger picture : in politics as much as in business , authenticity matters
and among consumers today , authenticity means more to success than at any other time in the history of brands
increasingly , people want to give their money to brands -- political as well as commercial -- that have a set of values they can also buy into
" a recent global study found that 63 % of consumers would buy a brand they perceive as authentic over its competitors , and more than 60 % would recommend an organization they perceive to be authentic
romney , the successful entrepreneur and moderate politician , struggled to seem ordinary and " severely conservative , " while gore was perceived as having such an overblown sense of himself that the claim of having invented the internet stuck to him like mud , even though he 'd never said it
the two shared what will likely also be clinton 's destiny : winning a party nomination by default as there were few compelling alternatives
for clinton , an uncontested rise to the democrats nomination could mislead her campaign into believing that she does n't have a problem with authenticity
to be fair , clinton 's appeal as potentially the first woman to reach the white house makes her seem virtually bulletproof among certain voting groups
a recent gallup poll shows " first female " status as the " best thing about a hillary clinton presidency , " leading the positives mentioned by 30 % of democrats and 17 % of independents
as one commenter on a mediapost article on millennials put it , " if brands ca n't be authentic millennials will call them on it
this trend of demanding more authenticity from brands they invest in , and rewarding brands for it , has been accelerating with consumers across the u.s. over the course of the very same seven years since clinton last ran for president
since consumers are also voters , it stands to reason that any political brand -- including hillary clinton -- should look even more seriously today at how to increase its value by focusing on perceptions of its authenticity .
