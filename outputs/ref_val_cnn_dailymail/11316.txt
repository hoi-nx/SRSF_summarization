an incredible finish produced two stoppage - time goals as norwich came from behind for a second time to rescue a point
no sooner had james vaughan put huddersfield 2 - 1 in front than norwich substitute jamar loza plundered a point with almost the last kick
jamar loza celebrates after scoring an equaliser six minutes into injury time for norwich earlier , a goal disallowed after it had been awarded - and an amazing miss - beset norwich in their top two challenge
the young striker fires home after dorrans ' original effort was saved by smithies huddersfield : smithies ; tommy smith , hudson ( c ) , lynch , scannell ; hogg , conor coady , jacob butterfield , jake carroll ( edgar-70 ) ; miller ( gobern - 78 ) , james vaughan subs not used : murphy , wallace , holmes , jake charles , majewski booked : lynch red card : james vaughan 95 goals : miller 54 , james vaughan 95 norwich : ruddy ; whittaker , martin ( c ) , bassong , olsson ; redmond , howson ( loza - 87 ) , dorrans , johnson ( wes hoolahan - 67 ) ; hooper ( andreu - 78 ) , jerome subs not used : rudd , cuellar , tettey , odjidja - ofoe booked : johnson , martin , jamar loza goals : wes hoolahan 67 , loza 96 in between times , norwich were stretched to stay on terms in a lively contest and eventually fell behind to ishmael miller after the break
but substitute wes hoolahan slipped home from close range within five minutes of leaving the bench to round off a fine move triggered by redmond
james vaughan , albeit a handful , failed with at least two chances to punish norwich for whom keeper ruddy also denied jacob butterfield
wes hoolahan ( left ) fires home the first equaliser just minutes after coming on as a substitute but miller struck with a smart turn on the edge of the box to smash home with ruddy caught out of position
chris powell 's team were fighting a rearguard action in the last 20 minutes as a more fluent norwich found their rhythm
