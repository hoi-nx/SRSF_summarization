the sierra leone sprinter claiming asylum in the uk because he says his family have died from ebola , has been branded an ' embarrassment ' by one of the country 's top sporting officials
thoronka , 20 , was found living rough on the streets of south london having not returned home after the conclusion last summer 's commonwealth games in glasgow
he claims all his family in his west african homeland have succumbed to ebola , including his adoptive mother jelikatu kargbo
but the runner 's story , which has prompted an outpouring of public support , has been contradicted by nyande , secretary general of sierra leone 's national olympics committee
thoronka , 20 , was found living rough on the streets of south london having not returned home since competing in the 4x100 - metre relay at last summer 's commonwealth games in glasgow ' it happened in the 2012 olympic games and when we went to glasgow
' months after disappearing having competed in the 4x100 - metre relay in glasgow , thoronka was found on the street having outstayed his visa , though he was not claiming benefits and was short of money and food
but abdul karim sesay , the vice-president of the national olympics committee in sierra leone and president of the country 's athletics association , told the guardian he backed thoronka 's story , saying ms jelikatu kargbo did indeed die of ebola in october
