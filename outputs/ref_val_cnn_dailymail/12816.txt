mom b means a lot to me
' " black ou alumnus : ' they are not my brothers ' davis , the first african-american - african-american member of the campus ' sae chapter , also defended " mom b. " " i would n't even hesitate for a split second to say that mom b. is undoubtedly not a racist , " davis said
