for three long years claire put her regular , excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high - flying career in sports marketing
â i was 30 when the migraines began , randomly at first , but then they came every month , â says claire , 35 , who lives in huddersfield , west yorkshire , with her husband brendan , 42 , a fitness centre owner
at work , i âd have to sit in a dark room and shut my eyes as the pain was all - consuming
claire ( pictured ) used to put her regular , excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high - flying career in sports marketing â despite being a virtual workaholic , there were times i was unable to function and would have to phone in sick , which left me feeling terribly guilty
â things got so bad that last year claire gave up her job to work part - time for her husband , helping to market his firm
but then claire had an epiphany when she began keeping a diary of her headaches â her migraines were linked to her menstrual cycle
â claire is not the only woman suffering from this commonly misdiagnosed side - effect of the menstrual cycle
claire ( pictured after a migraine ) gave up her job to work part - time for her husband last year when the migraines got really bad according to charity the national migraine centre , a staggering 50 per cent of women suffer menstrual migraines immediately before , during or just after their period
but , like claire , very many do nât make the connection between the two for years â and neither do their gps
online forums are awash with women discussing the â lightbulb moment â they finally realised their cycle was to blame
although migraines are an age - old problem , the diagnosis of specific menstrual migraines is a modern phenomenon , following extensive research over the past 25 years
professor anne macgregor , a leading specialist in headaches and women âs health , says : â the most common cause is a drop in oestrogen towards the end of the cycle
claire ( pictured ) has seen various gps and doctors about her severe migraines but none have been able to come up with a treatment that has worked completely â progesterone is released and prepares the womb lining for a fertilised egg
â claire âs work was not the only thing that suffered
â claire saw various doctors : her gp , another for a second opinion , plus a consultant â but none came up with a treatment that worked completely
â dr jud pearson , at the national migraine centre , advises patients who suspect their headaches may be menstruation - related to start keeping a diary like claire
â i think women have always suspected they have menstrual migraines but doctors have not always believed them until now
â marie brown 47 , a dental company sales consultant living in milton keynes , buckinghamshire , has had migraines for more than a decade , but only found out two years ago they were linked to her menstrual cycle , thanks to the migraine diary she was keeping
marie brown , 47 , ( pictured ) has also suffered from severe migraines for more than ten years but only discovered two years ago that they are related to her periods she reveals : â the first migraine i suffered was in my late 30s , and even going from bed to bathroom caused agonising pain in my head
â only when the migraines became a monthly occurrence , at age 44 , did marie brown made the connection
marie brown ( seen here age 27 ) uses medication to combat the headaches but still has to plan her social life and meetings around her periods â last new year âs eve i had to abandon dinner with my partner and go to bed at 10pm , when one came on
â for sarah , 31 , a special educational needs support assistant who lives in croydon , surrey , with partner paul , 33 , a sales manager , and their son jack , two , the severity of monthly menstrual migraines was so great last easter that her gp sent her to a&e fearing she had a bleed on the brain
it was so frightening , all i could think was my lovely little boy needs his mummy and what if something serious was happening to me ? â marie brown ( pictured ) suffered her first migraine in her late 30s , but they became a monthly occurrence when she reached 44 , at which point marie brown connected the pain to her menstrual cycle however , unlike many other women , sarah has suffered from menstrual migraines for all of the years of her adult life
â i first had the headaches at school but blamed exam stress for them
