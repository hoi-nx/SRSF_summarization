hung nguyen , a mechanic from south el monte , california with a 5 - month - old baby , was unable to claim his $ 1,098,624 prize last week because he had lost his ticket after purchasing it in september
what 's more , nguyen knew he had won the prize , as did california lottery officials who released footage of him purchasing his ticket in hopes he would come forward before the six months the winner has to claim the prize had lapsed , but powerball prizes can only be claimed if the individual has the physical ticket
nguyen then tried to come forward even though he did not have the ticket , but the winnings ultimately went to the california public school system
