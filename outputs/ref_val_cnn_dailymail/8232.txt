the first obama administration official to address desertion charges filed against army sgt. bergdahl said wednesday night that trading five high - value taliban leaders for his safe return was ' absolutely ' the right thing to do
' was it worth it ? absolutely , ' said psaki , the chief spokeswoman at the state department
' on thursday aboard air force , white house deputy press secretary eric schultz backed her up , saying that president obama ' will not allow a member of the united states armed forces to be left behind
' ' was it worth it ? absolutely , ' said state department spokeswoman psaki of the sgt. bergdahl prisoner swap bergdahl , shown before his handover to united states troops in may 2014 , was ransomed for five high - level taliban leaders in a white house maneuver that has drawn criticism from members of congress psaki spoke to fox news channel anchor megyn kelly
she is scheduled to take over the job of white house communications director next month from jen palmieri , who will transition to a role with hillary clinton 's presidential campaign
bringing bergdahl home at any cost ' was an important message for this president to deliver to the united states people , ' schultz added thursday , ' but also to people all around the world , that the united states and their commander - in - chief stands squarely behind our men and women in uniform â and with the commitment we have made to not leave them behind
' the obama administration 's ransom deal has come under new fire as bergdahl 's criminal charges under the uniform code of military justice were read yesterday at fort bragg in nc
house foreign affairs committee chairman ed royce , a california republican , said the charges of desertion and ' misbehavior before the enemy ' were ' the exclamation point on the bad deal the obama administration cut to free five terrorist killers in its rush to empty the prison at guantanamo bay
' ' taliban five ' : the terror leaders traded for bergdahl were ( top , from left ) : abdul haq wasiq , khirullah said wali khairkhwa , mohammad nabi omari ; and ( bottom from left ) : mohammad a fazl , mullah norullah noori texas republican rep. republican , who chairs the house homeland security committee , said president obama ' endangered our national security and broke the law when he chose to negotiate with terrorists and release hardened enemy combatants from guantanamo bay in exchange for sgt. bergdahl â who many believed at the time was a deserter
' and oklahoma republican sen. inhofe wrote in a scathing op - ed for time magazine asking : ' who will be held accountable for breaking the law regarding the release of prisoners from the detention facility at guantanamo bay , cuba ? bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the uniform code of military justice ' desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty ' : article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he ' quits his unit , organization , or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service
' obama himself has not addressed the bergdahl issue since his charges were read on wednesday
' i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents , ' the president said then , ' and that the united states people understand that this is somebody 's child and that we do n't condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back
' bergdahl was captured by the taliban after leaving his post in june 2009 and held by members of the haqqani network , an insurgent group tied to the taliban that operates both in pakistan and afghanistan
before disappearing , bergdahl had expressed misgivings about the united states role in the war â as well as his own
last may 31 , bergdahl was handed over to united states special forces in afghanistan as part of an exchange for five taliban commanders who were imprisoned at guantanamo bay , cuba
the exchange set off a debate over whether the united states should have released the five taliban members
bergdahl was charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy ; the first carries up to five years in prison , the latter up to life
but his case does raise the question of whether military prosecutors will lock away for life a man the united states gave up five imprisoned taliban commanders to bring home
president obama said less than a week after he traded fivetaliban fighters for bergdahl that he would make ' no apologies ' for the decision in fact , his defense attorney might successfully argue he deserves leniency after years as a prisoner
he said bergdahl should be stripped of his pay and benefits and be dishonorably discharged waddington , a military defense lawyer not involved with bergdahl 's case , said he expected a long prison sentence and wondered why the united states bothered to bring him back
' the administration traded a known taliban for this guy only to bring him back and put him in jail , ' waddington said
