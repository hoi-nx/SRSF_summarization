he has taken bournemouth to this point from league two and last night led an annihilation of a side not afraid to spend
brett pitman and matt ritchie shared four goals between them and steve cook scored a fifth but , truthfully , the rout could have been greater
â bournemouth defender tommy elphick is late to slide in as fulham frontman ross mccormack shoots bryan ruiz controls the ball and holds off the challenge of bournemouth midfielder harry arter for symons , the only consolation was that matt smith briefly brought the score back to 3 - 1

matt ritchie was teed up from the resulting free - kick and scored bournemouth âs fourth from the edge of the area
steve cook then rocketed bournemouth âs 74th goal of the season for good measure .
