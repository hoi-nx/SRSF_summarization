evans ' wife , helen , had to leap to the defence of the manchester united defender in a rather awkward phone - in conversation with celebrity arsenal fan pm
as she previewed manchester united 's fa cup sixth - round tie at home to arsenal , pm shifted the conversation on to her husband 's ' spitgate ' ( a term used by pm ) incident with newcastle striker cisse last week
helen evans has defended her husband , jonny , during a phone - in conversation with pm evans , a presenter on manchester united 's tv channel mutv , spoke to the celebrity arsenal fan on thursday evans ( left ) appears to launch spit in the direction of the newcastle 's cisse , who then retaliates evans and cisse clashed near the halfway line at st james ' park following the unpleasant exchange manchester united defender evans received a six - match ban from the fa cup after the ugly incident tempers threatened to boil over as team - mates from newcastle and manchester united gathered following the incident arsenal ( h ) march 9 , fa cup * ; tottenham ( h ) march 15 liverpool ( a ) march 22 aston villa ( h ) april 4 man city ( h ) april 12 chelsea ( a ) april 18 ( * possible replay or fa cup semi-final could mean he is available for the chelsea game ) a disciplinary panel ruled that evans and newcastle rival cisse had spat at each other in an incident missed by referee anthony taylor during the st james ' park clash
cisse was banned for seven games ( he was given an extra match as it was a second suspension of the season ) by the football association , while evans was handed a six - match ban - despite fiercely denying the charge
there is no right of appeal so evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three - man panel the couple started dating shortly after in 2011 and got married two years later at clough presbyterian church in county antrim , northern ireland
her husband 's ban , which starts against the gunners on monday , could see him miss the fa cup semi-final in april should manchester united overcome their north london rivals
' it 's my usual confident prediction 5 - 0 arsenal , [ olivier ] giroud hat - trick , ' he added on mutv
' i 'm also predicting at least three members of manchester united 's team to be sent off for spitting

' he : ' well we 're predicting 8 - 2 ! ' pm : ' i 'm also predicting at least three members of manchester united 's team to be sent off for spitting
