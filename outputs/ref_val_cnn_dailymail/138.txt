â it âs incredibly successful if people get stressed , â explained our host , although several people around me merely used the pause to check social media on their smartphones
welcome to the world of british âs wackiest political party , on display this weekend at its spring conference in liverpool
there is something mildly amusing about a party that insists on meditative breaks , has a keynote speaker identified as â a non-binary person from belarus â and chairwomen who say things like : â i would like to hear from someone who does not identify as a man
â and a party that uses such a contorted form of internal democracy it ends up with daft policies to ban most cars and seriously debates proposals to extend human rights to all animals
yet this is currently the country âs most successful political party , attracting 100 recruits a day from people dismayed by traditional party politics
bizarrely , the duffest interviews given by its bumbling leader natalie bennett only drive up membership
joining the hundreds of enthusiastic delegates â a mixture of grizzly bearded hippies , elderly ideologues , earnest young recruits and well - spoken women in charity shop chic â offered fresh insight into what is now the third biggest party in england and wales
yet much of the time it felt like i had stumbled into an bennett sketch filled with middle - class people munching on non-meat sandwiches as they debated how to save a world wrecked by austerity , bankers and conservatives
but it also means they might play an influential role in determining who runs the country after the next election
many of these new members â half of whom voted liberal democrat at the last election â are young people inspired by the idea of reshaping politics
presumably they were not the people targeted in a seminar explaining how to use email
yet for all these new recruits rushing around excitedly , there were also the same old stalls offering vegan recipes for raspberry cake , t - shirts emblazoned with â still hate thatcher â and angry leaflets denouncing the monarchy
bennett told her followers the greens had gone from 13,000 members a year ago to 55,000 members today on one , i found jon liebling , a friendly 47 - year - old dancer promoting the medicinal use of cannabis
the australian - born bennett promises a new style of politics â which many people might say she exemplifies with her stumbling interviews and inability to explain key policies
â she turned out to be a labour deserter
indeed , electoral mathematics mean it is possible the greens might not just impact on voting outcomes in may but even be in position to join a coalition led by ed miliband
this is a party that wants to ban the monarchy , house of lords , much of the armed forces , free schools , foie gras and fur â while freeing up drugs , borders , brothels and , said its leader , allowing people to join terror groups such as islamic state
the green party âs emphasis on ultra-democracy is admirable , giving all members a voice â but it means scores of strange ideas end up on its statute books since anything is possible with its alice in wonderland politics
leader natalie bennett is embraced by green mp caroline lucas i went to one meeting where 19 people were determining a ban on foie gras due to the force - feeding of geese
at the peace and defence group , software engineer burdess said they needed to review policies that were â unnecessarily inflammatory and aggressive â towards diplomats and members of the armed forces
