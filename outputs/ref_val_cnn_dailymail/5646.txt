f1 breathed a sigh of relief in the sunny early saturday morning at melbourne when sauber 's former dutchman driver garde abandoned his legal action against the team
he had been suing them for dropping him despite having a contract to race for them this season , starting with sunday 's australian grand prix
garde has decided to drop his case against former side sauber after settling out of court marcus ericsson ( left ) and nasr ( right ) will race for sauber in the absence of van der garde this brought about an impasse : sauber would be in contempt of court if they left him out
van der garde wrote on facebook : ' with respect to the interest of motorsport , and f1 in particular , i have decided to give up my legal rights to race this weekend at the melbourne grand prix
the 29 - year - old added : ' my management will continue talks with sauber early next week to find a mutually acceptable solution for the current situation that has now arisen
' van der garde dropped the case against sauber out of respect to ' motorsport , and f1 in particular ' marcus ericssson and nasr will race for them in his place
both were named on sauber 's race entry and took part in second practice on friday , having sat out of the first session while the lawyers argued
with three valid driver contracts and only two race seats available , sauber and monisha kaltenborn had found themselves mired in controversy
but with van der garde on contract , and despite also having paid up front - albeit a figure less than that of ericsson and nasr - the battle became legal
whatever the outcome , under - pressure team principal monisha kaltenborn , a trained lawyer , has emerged from the sorry mess in a poor light
sauber team principal monisha kaltenborn insists she will not resign from her role despite the recent saga at the circuit on friday , while unable to talk about the case as it remained ongoing , she did insist however she remained competent to carry on with her role as team boss
' monisha kaltenborn did concede , however , the past week had damaged morale given the team 's name had been dragged through the courts
