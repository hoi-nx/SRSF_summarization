a study found the children from wealthy families have bigger brains than their poorer counterparts
los angeles researchers say being wealthy boosts brainpower
their study found that money was important to a young mind
parental income was found to be more important than their education
interestingly , the study also revealed that money matters more than parental background when it comes to nourishing the young mind
in one of the first studies of its kind , the us researchers put more than 1,000 healthy children and teenagers through brain scanners and quizzed their parents on their background and income
the study also found people in their 50s live closest to their ageing parents , but later move farther away to be near their own children and grandchildren
analysis showed important brain areas to be bigger in children whose parents had been to university than those whose education had finished when they left school
however , parental income was even more important
however , parental income was even more important , perhaps because the children had better living conditions ( stock image shown ) she said that growing up in a household that is free of the stress of struggling to make ends meet is also likely to foster brain development
it is thought this is because a slight increase in income makes a bigger difference to living conditions to someone on a low wage than to someone who is already well provided for
researcher dr kimberley noble , of columbia university in new york , said that despite the clear impact of socio - economic status on the young mind , it would be wrong to think that the changes are fixed
