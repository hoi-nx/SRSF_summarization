atlanta a report on lab safety at the cdc put together by a committee of external experts calls the agency 's commitment to safety " inconsistent and insufficient
in the report , they say they are " very concerned that the cdc is on the way to losing credibility
" the agency created the advisory group to improve lab safety in july in the wake of two mishaps and other issues that were uncovered through procedural reviews
this followed a may incident in which avian influenza samples , thought to not be dangerous , were unintentionally mixed with the deadly h5n1 influenza virus and then shipped to a usda lab. then in december , with the advisory group already working to reduce lab safety risks and improve the culture of safety , employees in the ebola lab were potentially exposed to that virus when a technician mistakenly transported the wrong specimens from a high - level lab to a lower - level lab. internal investigations were done after each incident , and various changes were recommended such as cameras being added to some labs and certificates being required to transfer samples from some labs , following the ebola incident
the four - page report summarizes the groups findings and offers recommendations following visits to cdc labs , meetings with cdc staff and a survey about the laboratory safety culture at cdc
the report recommends all cdc labs go through an external review and accreditation process
in response to the recommendations , cdc chief operating officer sherri berger said in a statement , " it 's critical that we continue to solicit feedback on how we can improve our operations , especially functions as critical as lab safety
