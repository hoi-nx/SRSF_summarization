professor michael kelly , pictured , was one of 43 fellows of the royal society who wrote to the president to warn that it was in danger of violating its founding principle five years ago , i was one of 43 fellows of the royal society â the first and arguably still the most prestigious scientific organisation in the world â who wrote to our then - president about its approach to climate change
we warned that the royal society was in danger of violating its founding principle , summed up in its famous motto â nullius â â or â do nât take another âs word for it ; check it out for yourself â
the reason for our warning was a royal society document which stated breezily : â if you do nât believe in climate change you are using one of the following [ eight ] misleading arguments
â the implication was clear : the royal society seemed to be saying there was no longer room for meaningful debate about the claim that the world is warming dangerously because of human activity , because the science behind this was â settled â
but since then the royal society has become more , not less dogmatic â despite the fact that since we sent that letter , it has become evident that there is even more uncertainty than previously thought
human - sourced carbon dioxide is at best one of many factors in causing climate change , and humility in front of this complexity is the appropriate stance
yet the royal society continues to produce a stream of reports which reveal little sign of this
through these documents , the royal society has lent its name to claims â such as trends towards increasing extreme weather and climate casualties â that simply do not match real - world facts
but a report today by the academic council of the global warming policy foundation , which includes several society fellows and other eminent scientists , states the royal society has â left out â parts of the science , so the answers to many of the questions ought to be different
last year , at the request of the president , i produced a paper that urged the royal society âs council to distance itself from the levels of certainty being expressed about future warming
prof michael kelly said the royal society , pictured , was founded on the principle â nullius â â or â do nât take another âs word for it ; check it out for yourself ' professor michael kelly fears the royal society has become more dogmatic when considering climate change the great 20th century physicist , richard feynman , wrote in his autobiography : â details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given , if you know them
â this the royal society has failed to do
but the misleading lack of qualification in the statements made by the royal society and others is creating policy nonsense
we really are leading the world in climate change hypocrisy
the project to â solve the climate change problem â is a modern version of the biblical tower of babel
it is with the deepest regret that i must now state that this is the role which has been adopted by the royal society
