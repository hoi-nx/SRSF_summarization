evans has grudgingly accepted the six - match ban imposed on him by the fa for spitting at cisse
there is no right of appeal for the united defender and he begins his ban immediately by missing monday 's fa cup quarter - final with arsenal
though he maintains that he did not spit at the newcastle striker , the fa found evans guilty and confirmed in a statement : â mr evans denied the charge but it was found proven
â evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the newcastle striker , who then retaliates evans and cisse clash near the half - way line at st james â park following the unpleasant exchange united defender evans has received a six - match ban from the fa after the ugly incident cisse already served a three - match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing everton âs seamus coleman in december
as a result , the newcastle striker gets an additional one - match suspension after admitting his guilt , while evans gets six
â cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the fa on thursday tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from newcastle and united gather on the pitch arsenal ( h ) , monday ( fa cup quarter - final ) tottenham ( h ) , march 15 ( premier league ) liverpool ( a ) , march 22 ( premier league ) aston villa ( h ) , april 4 ( premier league ) manchester city ( h ) april 12 ( premier league ) chelsea ( a ) april 18 ( premier league ) the fa also looked at an incident where evans was alleged to have spat in the direction of emmanuel riviere during the game but that was dismissed
evans will potentially miss any fa cup semi-final should united progress plus their premier league games against tottenham , liverpool , aston villa and manchester city
united defender evans has received a six - match ban from the fa - one less than newcastle striker cisse there is no right of appeal so evans will not be able to contest the decision by the three - man panel 1
that would be a blow for united manager louis van gaal , who insisted ahead of the fa cup clash with arsenal at old trafford that the main priority for united this season must be to qualify for the champions league
