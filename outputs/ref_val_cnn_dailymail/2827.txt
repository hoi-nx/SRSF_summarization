a dangerous combination of people feeling distanced from the person they are abusing and having a vast platform on which to vent anger instantly encourages users to become more aggressive
just as normally calm drivers sometimes lash out when they get frustrated behind the wheel , so ordinary people can become uncharacteristically angry on social media , said dr richard sherry
the clinical director of psychological systems in central london said people using social media were less likely to feel empathy or compassion towards others
young people are particularly prone to internet road rage , with 26 per cent of the 18 to 24 year olds surveyed saying they are ' always ' worked up when using social media , compared with 18 per cent of 35 to 44 year olds and just 11 per cent of those in the over- 55 age group
