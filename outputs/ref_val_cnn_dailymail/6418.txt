facebook has removed the personal account of a 12 - year - old georgia boy who posted a viral video last week in support of rudy giuliani 's comments that president obama ' does n't love america '
fearing his video , which was watched by more than 1.4 million people , may have been the cause , pearson hit out at the social media giant , accusing them of quelling any dissent towards obama
indeed , it is explicitly stated in facebook 's terms and conditions that no one under the age of 13 can have an account
drawing attention to yourself : cj pearson , a 12 - year - old from georgia , posted a viral video backing former new york city mayor rudy giuliani 's comments criticizing president obama 's love for america in a statement , facebook said they were alerted to the fact that pearson is 12 by a member of the public and acted accordingly
' you have to be 13 to have a facebook account
' i would consider that complete malarkey , ' said pearson to fox dc. ' because in all honesty , there are many many people younger than me who have a facebook account
defense : rudy giuliani wrote an op - ed in the wall street journal saying that he did n't want to question obama 's motives or heart attacked : former new york city mayor rudy giuliani said that president obama did not love his country like a commander in chief should ' when a person decides to speak up , their voice should nât be hindered because of someone disagreeing
' last week , rudy giuliani may have come under fire for saying that president obama does not love america at a fundraising dinner for governor scott walker , but he found a backer in pearson
after the tide of criticism , middle school student cj pearson made a youtube video agreeing with rudy giuliani , in which he said that the commander in chief had a ' downright hate for the america values our country holds '
he said in his video that if obama really loved america he would call islamic state ' what it really is , an assault on christianity ' the student added that the president , who has ordered airstrikes on isis and asked for approval to send limited ground troops , was ' not willing to defend our country against the evil of terrorism domestic and abroad '
however , he wrote an op - ed in the wall street journal saying that he ' did nât intend to question president obama âs motives or the content of his heart ' .
