" we had a difficult season last year here , so definitely as a team , as a whole , we 're hoping for a better start , for both cars to succeed tomorrow , " the 30 - year - old said
" so we 're going to work as hard as we can to make sure we do that and lots of work to be done tonight for the race tomorrow , because that is going to be a huge challenge still and obviously a good fight , hopefully , with rosberg
" rosberg , runner - up in last year 's championship amid considerable tension between the two drivers , said his teammate " drove like a champ
" " hamilton was in impressive form today , he did an awesome job and nailed it all the time , " said the german , who had an engine cutout in the second session and then ran wide in q3
" hamilton was quick but i did n't get my laps together today so i 'm not too worried about pace -- i 'm not worried about pace at all
four - time world champion vettel played down ferrari 's big improvement on last season 's speed
" it 's a shame that third place escaped us , as that would have made us the first team behind mercedes , but it was n't by much
" last year vettel was upstaged by new teammate ricciardo , who qualified second and then finished runner - up in his home race only to be disqualified for a fuel - flow infringement
on sunday he will start in seventh place as red bull 's renault - powered car struggled to match the mercedes engines , while vettel 's replacement daniil kvyat was 13th after failing to reach q3
