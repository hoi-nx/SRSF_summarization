baghdad , iraqi joint iraqi forces now have control of tikrit military hospital as they continue their offensive to liberate the city from isis
the joint forces raised the iraqi flag from the hospital premises wednesday as they continued their offensive into the city from four sides , the hashd al-shaabi paramilitary force said
the predominantly shia militia has been working with iraqi troops as well as sunni fighters to try to regain tikrit from isis
tikrit , best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , fell in june to isis , which has captured large areas of iraqi and syrian for what it says is its islamic caliphate
on march 1 , iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi ordered iraqi forces to retake tikrit and salahuddin province
the sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near tikrit , preventing the joint iraqi forces from using it to cross the tigris river to approach the city from the east
nevertheless , forces have made progress , forcing isis fighters to retreat toward the city center from frontline positions , hashd al-shaabi 's media office said
while iraqi forces piled the pressure on isis in tikrit , the sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in iraqi 's western anbar province
isis launched a new offensive on the city of ramadi , west of baghdad , on wednesday morning , al-issawi , the deputy head of the anbar provincial council , said in a statement
this is " the fiercest attack by isis " seen on ramadi , al-issawi said
iraqi forces have imposed a curfew on the city
officials believe " this is an isis response to the tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north , " he added
he said there had been 10 casualties among iraqi forces in the area but did not specify how many were killed and how many injured
in the 24 hours from tuesday to wednesday morning , there were 13 airstrikes in iraqi and two in syrian , the u.s. - led coalition against isis said in a statement
there were none in the tikrit or ramadi areas
elsewhere in anbar province , iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of karma from isis , said al-karhout , the head of the anbar provincial council
isis is also battling in many places far from tikrit , including syrian , where the militant group is more on the offensive , according to the sohr ( sohr ) , a london - based nongovernmental organization
