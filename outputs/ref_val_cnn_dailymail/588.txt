former england captain moody says he does not think england will win the world cup this year
the former leicester and bath flanker , speaking at an awards ceremony for the prince 's trust in london , told the press association : ' i do n't think england are in the right place at the moment to win the world cup
former england captain moody does not think england are in a position to win the world cup moody knows what it takes to win the tournament having lifted the webb ellis cup in 2003 ' if they can get through the pool stages they 'll have a great , fighting chance
' moody , who can not see beyond new zealand as tournament winners , believes lancaster may be hoping his squad will peak for 2019
' however , he believes england can still win the six nations
lancaster oversee training as his side prepare to face scotland in the six nations on saturday how england and scotland will line up for saturday 's calcutta cup clash at twickenham moody said : ' it is disappointing that england have ended up in this position
' it should be a reasonably comfortable result against scotland , and then go on and beat france
' i think he 's done terribly well and i think all that now stuart is lacking is that win , that result that really says , ' look , what i 've been doing over the last four years has been about this , achieving this ' , and if we can take something out of the six nations , which will be tough now , then he 'll have that
' one bonus is that the six nations may well have ironed out england 's conundrum at fly - half and in the centres , moody suggested , with george ford and joseph cementing their places
moody thinks george ford has stepped up as england centre and should keep his place for the world cup ford offloads a pass during training as england prepare for saturday 's six nations match against scotland ' joseph has stepped in and filled a void i think we 've been nursing since will greenwood was playing , and that 's some time ago now
' moody was adamant ford 's rise had not consigned farrell 's days as england 's starting number 10 to history
