massachusetts - based fertility company , ovascience , says its technique involves rejuvenating an egg 's mitochondria , which are the tiny structures that create energy to run a cell studies suggest that 23 - 33 is the ideal time to conceive , as a healthy woman is still fertile and may be more psychologically prepared to have a baby
but fertility does begin to diminish slowly from the age of 25 as a woman 's eggs decrease
the technique , dubbed augment , takes energy - producing mitochondria from a patient 's own ' eggpc cells '
these are immature egg cells found in the protective ovarian lining , which are added to the patient 's mature eggs to supplement the existing mitochondria
' a key component of egg health is the number of functioning mitochondria in the egg since mitochondria are the source of energy that helps an egg develop , ' ovascience co-founder , michelle dipp , told dailymail.com the idea is that immature cells with their healthy mitochondria could rejuvenate ageing eggs
