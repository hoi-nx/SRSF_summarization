steve was in england âs euro 96 squad that reached the semi-finals
wolves â striker steve bull was in the england squad that only missed out on a world cup final in 1990 after another penalty shootout failure
england are looking strong and should have a good chance at the european championship next year roy hodgson has an exciting squad at his disposal and england should go deep into the tournament england players head out of the wembley tunnel for the second half of their euro 2016 qualifier with lithuania what it shows is that you do nât have to have 23 truly top class players in your squad to make an impact at a tournament
if one of john stones , phil jones or chris smalling â or maybe a centre half who might burst on to the scene next season â can show the quality and consistency needed to make himself a regular in the england team then that âs roy hodgson âs last problem solved
finding a partner for gary cahill in central defence is roy hodgson 's main concern ahead of the tournament phil jones played alongside gary cahill against lithuania but the place is far from nailed down goalkeeper joe hart has performed consistently well for club manchester city and country we have athletic young full backs who thrive in the modern game at club level ; gary cahill is still trusted by jose mourinho , and has another year of learning off john terry to come in midfield it âs now a shock if jordan henderson does n't start for club and country ; adam lallana is looking a class act after an injury - hit difficult start at liverpool
michael carrick is at last being trusted by an england manager and if roy hodgson keeps ignoring those who say he is n't quick enough ( his reading of the game more than makes up for that ) or does n't score enough goals ( the goal counters playing fifa have a lot to answer for ) he may well be rewarded
up front england have their best options since euro 96
jordan henderson has tied down his place in the centre of the england midfield michael carrick appears to have won the trust of manager roy hodgson at last raheem sterling was electric on friday and if he can replicate that at the euros , then he certainly is a player opponents will be scared of
wayne rooney is on the brink of becoming an england legend , his focus and ambition has been sharpened by the captaincy and by the reality that he âs running out of time to make a significant impact at a major tournament
and then i remember every other tournament we âve been in since euro 96 and we âve either not played very well , or not got very far
and england âs group may be comfortable , but arguably the best performance came in the toughest game since the world cup , away to switzerland , a team who got further at the world cup and who are above us in the world rankings
there is one thing roy hodgson has that so many previous england managers lacked
england imploded in south africa in 2010 when fabio capello picked the wrong players and then treated them appallingly at the tournament
unlike fabio capello in 2010 , roy hodgson has the complete trust of his squad roy hodgson resisted calls to replace the in - form welbeck with kane and was proved correct for the lithuania game on friday , roy hodgson ignored the calls to start kane and that was exactly the right thing to do
but as fans can we afford to be positive when we âve been let down so many times in the last 20 years ? i want england to win the european championship , but until it happens it will always be an unrealistic dream .
