married couples could get a bigger cut in income tax after the election , cameron has signalled as he admitted he must do more to win back disgruntled tories
the prime minister said he wanted to ' expand ' the marriage tax allowance , which begins next month and is worth Â£ 212 - a - year for some couples
he said some of his natural supporters had ' drifted ' to other parties , as he vowed to stick to his promise to cut net migration to the ' tens of thousands ' , despite the number soaring to almost 300,000
the Â£ 1,060 transferable tax allowance will particularly benefit couples where one parent does not work or only works part - time
however , if both people in a couple earn more than Â£ 10,600 they will not qualify and higher rate taxpayers earning more than Â£ 42,385 a year are also excluded
it will apply to spouses who do not use all of their personal allowance â either because they are at home looking after children , or work part - time and earn less than the threshold for income tax , Â£ 10,600 in april
they will now be able to transfer up to Â£ 1,060 of their unused personal tax - free allowance to a spouse or civil partner , as long as the recipient of the transfer pays the basic rate of income tax , levied on income up to Â£ 42,385
that will save the couple up to Â£ 212 a year on their tax bill
at the tory spring forum yesterday , mr cameron was heckled by party member mike howson who said the pm had ' betrayed this country on europe and immigration ' the tory will spend an extra gbp8 billion on the nhs if it wins the general election to fund a five year plan drawn up by its chief executive , hunt has promised
the health secretary said the government would fully fund the plan drawn up by nhs england boss simon stevens , which would see Â£ 2billion being pumped into the health service every year until 2019 - 20
the so - called ' simon stevens plan ' will see a total of Â£ 30 billion put into the nhs , with Â£ 22 billion found through efficiency savings and Â£ 8 billion in extra spending
asked by the sunday times if the tories would find the full Â£ 30billion , mr hunt said : ' yes
' we said to simon stevens , ' how much do you need for your plan next year , the first year of your five - year plan ? ' he said ' Â£ 1.7billion ' , and we actually found him Â£ 2billion
' however , the idea was mocked by lib dem deputy prime minister clegg who said the state should not lecture people on their private lives
' i accept i have a task in the next 41 days to win back people who are instinctively conservative , who have strong conservative values and some of them have drifted off to other parties
mr cameron has come under fire after promising ' no ifs , no buts ' to cut net migration to below 100,000
net long - term migration to the britain was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending september 2014 , a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier some senior tories urged mr cameron to ditch the pledge , but he has vowed to repeat it for the general election this year too
