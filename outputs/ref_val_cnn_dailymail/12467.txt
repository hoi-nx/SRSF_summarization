mythologies from across the globe have blamed them all for eating the sun. in reality , solar eclipses , like the one that can be seen across parts of the northern hemisphere today , are down to an amazing coincidence
the moon and sun are at just the right distance away from the earth that they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky even though the sun is about 400 times larger than the moon
on occasion , the sun , moon and earth are perfectly aligned so that when the moon passes in front of the sun it casts a shadow on the earth , blocking the light
" the area where the sun 's rays are only partially obscured is called the " penumbra
" today the moon 's shadow falls across parts of north africa , europe and the middle east
solar eclipses are relatively common -- partial eclipses are visible somewhere on earth most years -- but not necessarily in the same region
the moon follows an elliptical orbit around the earth which means it is sometimes closer to us -- at " perigee " -- and sometimes further away -- at " apogee
" at apogee , the moon does n't appear quite big enough to completely obscure the sun during a solar eclipse and an observer sees a ring of brilliant light around the moon
at perigee ( as now ) the sun will be completely blocked by the moon during totality
ahead of last year 's eclipse in the united states , nasa advised cnn readers : " even at maximum eclipse , a sliver of sun peeking out from behind the moon can still cause pain and eye damage
the moon is moving away from the earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters ( about 1.5 inches ) every year
there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun. but do n't worry , you still have to time to catch one -- nasa calculates this will take about 563 million years .
