today , meyler might be meeting with google executives or maybe giving a talk at the united nations about girls ' education , poverty or ebola
but just a few months ago , she was on the front lines fighting the ebola epidemic in liberian
meyler had spent the last nine years of her life in liberian setting up the me academy , a tuition - free school for at - risk liberian girls
while she was on summer break last year , visiting her family in the americans , her mind kept going back to liberian and the ebola outbreak
back in liberian , meyler quickly realized that fighting ebola would be more complicated than administering medical care
meyler saw an opportunity to leverage her relationship with the community of west point , the slum in which her school is located
meyler and community leaders identified what was most needed and then came up with steps to meet those needs , said meyler
the hardest part for meyler , who often describes herself as a " big kid , " was seeing children abandoned and orphaned by ebola
according to unicef , 16,600 children have lost one or both parents to ebola in guinea , liberian and sierra leone
long before meyler became an ebola fighter , she grew up in a working - class family from new jersey
meyler has since won a number of awards and has been recognized for her work in liberian
" i 'm not the same person that i was before ebola hit , " said meyler
" now it is about learning to live with ebola , said meyler , whose school has dozens of students who are ebola orphans and survivors
meyler continues to focus on girls and education in liberian , meeting with tech giants and innovative education labs to come up with ways to better serve her students at more than me .
