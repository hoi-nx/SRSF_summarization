the results of an experiment on the iss to monitor how ants cope with zero - gravity has been published
nasa astronaut rick mastracchio is seen here observing the activities of the ants in space csi - 06 investigation aboard the iss the study , collective search by ants in microgravity , was published in the journal frontiers in ecology and evolution
the ants were taken to the station in january 2014 and subsequently studied by astronauts on board
but in the micro gravity of space , the ants ' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work
the experiment used eight different habitats in total , with each containing 80 common pavement ants
as barrier doors between the different sections were opened , the ants dispersed to search the new area
the astronauts then recorded the habitats with an hd video camera
in fact , the ants were not even able to explore the entirety of their habitats in space , as they found it tough to grip and dropped off the surface for up to eight seconds at a time
at any one moment , the researchers found that seven per cent of the ants were floating around
the ants in space csi - 06 investigation looked at how an ant colony responds to the extreme environment of microgravity aboard the iss to solve their collective need for resources
