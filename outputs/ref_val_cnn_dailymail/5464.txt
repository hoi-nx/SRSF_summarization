and if you pride yourself on your friendliness and ability to stay calm in a crisis , you 're most likely to be scottish
this is according to experts at cambridge university , who have marked out a personality map of the whole of britain
revealed : the moody map of britain details the country 's most and least friendly inhabitants the profile revealed that inhabitants of the capital are the least welcoming of all
the scottish , however , can hold their heads high , as they are the friendliest and most emotionally stable people in britain
to find out what where we live says about us , psychologists asked almost 400,000 britain a series of questions designed to assess five key personality traits
they then looked to see how common each of the five characteristics â agreeableness , extraversion , openness , conscientiousness and neuroticism â was in each of the 380 council areas in england , scottish and welsh
meanwhile those who lived in the capital scored highly on extraversion ( right ) , as did the people of manchester mapped out : the scottish scored highest in agreeableness ( left ) , which covers friendliness , trust , co-operation and concern about others
the scottish also emerged as the least neurotic ( right ) and the most calm and contented
the colour red means a greater level of an attribute , while blue is for the opposite new experiences : inhabitants of the east midlands and the east of england were the least open â leading to them being labelled ' conventional , down to earth and traditional ' the result is a fascinating , and at times controversial , snapshot of the psychology of britain
the scottish scored highest in agreeableness
and at the other end of the scale are the residents of london , who were found to be the least friendly of all
londoners fared badly in the study - they were found to be among some of britain 's least friendly residents city - dwellers also did well on another trait , openness
this is a measure of curiosity , imagination and intellect , and was particularly high in london , oxford , cambridge university , brighton , bristol , manchester and glasgow
