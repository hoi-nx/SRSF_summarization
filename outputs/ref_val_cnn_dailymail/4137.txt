a u.s. coast guard ship was cutting ice on frozen - over st clair thursday morning when they came across a bizarre sight : a young man walking out on the ice alone in sub-freezing temperatures
when crew members brought the curious 25 - year - old man on board , he said he was trying to walk from detroit to toronto
detroit lies on the southwestern shore of st clair , and the unidentified ice - walker was found just half a mile from seaway island on the opposite shore
from there it 's a 201 - mile journey on land to reach the canada capital
detroit is on the southwestern shore of st clair , and the unidentified man was found just a half - mile from an island on the opposite shore all alone : coast guard say the man stood out since he was n't wearing the type of clothes used for snowmobiling or ice - fishing on the lake u.s. coast guard petty officer second class sjostrom first spotted the michigan man walking on the lake around 9:30am on thursday
the sight was especially odd considering how the man was dressed : in regular pedestrian clothes - not the heavy gear used for snowmobiling or ice fishing
it 's believed he had been walking for two to three days when the coast guard found him
