helplessly stuck in a patch of mud , this tiny zebra foal appeared doomed to a prolonged and agonising death
then along came the most unlikely of rescuers - a gigantic bull rhino who had been attracted by the creature 's desperate struggles and mewling cries
it is not clear whether this is the point that the foal was disembowelled by the bull 's clumsy rescue van muiden , a field guide and wildlife photographer , spotted the foal stuck in a deep and pitiless patch of mud while he was showing visitors around the madikwe game reserve in south african
nearby a bull rhino was chasing some females , then being chased away in return , but the foal 's mother and her herd were nowhere to be seen
the bull rhino , he went on , finally gave up on his futile advances
after a while the bull , growing impatient with his toy , sank his snout deep into the mire before quickly lifting the foal from the mud
apparently wanting to see the foal from another angle , he used his horn to move it into a different position , and disembowelled it
boredom : the bull rhino had earlier got nowhere with his advances towards a couple of nearby cows mr van muisen said many things went through his mind as he watched the tragedy unfold , but his foremost thought was to ' let nature be nature '
' mr van muisen added that the foal 's mother probably knew her child was caught in a hopeless situation
