osborne today refused to match labour 's pledge not to increase vat as a row erupted over how to balance the books after the election
the chancellor declined to give a ' cast - iron guarantee ' to match labour 's pledge not to increase vat over the five years of the next parliament
it came after labour 's shadow chancellor ed balls that conservatives had a history of raising vat after elections despite saying they had no plans to do so during the campaign
the headline rate of vat stands at 20 per cent after mr osborne increased it from 17.5 per cent in his emergency budget in 2010
mr ed balls claimed that another rise after the election on may was ' the only way the tories can make their sums add up '
launching a new labour poster , mr ed balls said : ' we will make our tax commitments in full in our manifesto
the next labour government will not raise vat
' in the houses of parliament today , mr osborne was repeatedly challenged to match the promise but refused to do so
labour mp mann asked the chancellor four times to give a ' cast - iron guarantee ' that he would not hike the tax
a second labour mp , mann , also twice pressed the chancellor over whether vat would have to rise
labour 's shadow chancellor unveiled a new poster warning ' the tories will raise vat ' to help balance the books in his responses , mr osborne said he did not intend to increase the tax but stopped short of an actual pledge to rule it out
' in a jibe at mr osborne 's former membership of an oxford university dining club , the labour mp retorted : ' your answers are more bullingdon than bassetlaw
' and reviving memories of mr osborne 's ' omnishambles budget ' of 2012 , he offered the chancellor a gregg 's pasty to give him the strength to respond more fully
mr ed balls claimed the tories ' have a secret plan to raise vat again ' but mr osborne stuck to his position : ' the policies we have do not involve a vat rise ... our proposals , our spending plans , our policies , do not involve tax rises
' mr ed balls , who believes gordon brown 's refusal to accept his calls for a pledge not to raise vat contributed to labour 's defeat in 2010 , said he would ' resign rather than break this promise '
speaking in birmingham - in front of a new poster featuring the letters vat as concrete blocks with the slogan ' do n't let the tories hit you with this ' - mr ed balls said the unannounced rise from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent after the 2010 election had cost families an average Â£ 1,800 over four years
it 's the same tories lie about vat : 1979 , 1992 , 2010 and now 2015
ed balls might be ruling out a rise in vat but he ca n't rule out a rise in national insurance and already plans to hike corporation tax
