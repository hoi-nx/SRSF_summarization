might it become part of all of england âs representatives exiting the champions league before the quarter - finals ? xavi ( left ) and lampard have been two legends of champions league football over the past decade lampard could be playing his final champions league game if he faces barcelona on wednesday lampard has been on the fringes of the city team since extending his loan spell the culture clash is slighter than usual given that city are self - acknowledged pretenders to the barcelona crown
however , the champions league is a wider tasting plate than that
and , sadly , two of the all - time european greats , xavi and lampard , face the prospect of arriving at the nou camp at about 7.30pm spanish time , not being listed in the starting xis ... then one of them leaving in the knowledge that that was their last ever night in the competition
xavi is a club legend at barcelona , but has also become increasingly a fringe player this season when he has played , xavi is still providing assists , and is a vital part of the set - up off the pitch too xavi , who barcelona âs managing director was trying to sell when i arrived in this city in 2002 , is the leading all - time appearance maker in the champions league
the 35 - year - old has three winner âs medals , two more than lampard , who is a year - and - a - half older
but in reality , xavi has played precisely an hour less in champions league finals
lampard was a different case
lampard is due to join mls club new york city at the end of the season , while xavi rejected the same move the chelsea legend has been a champions league mainstay for over a decade , but could bow out this week few pick it out now but not only was his performance for chelsea in the 2012 semi-final precisely what city require tonight from someone , his return pass to ramires to make it 2 - 1 was exquisite
javier mascherano âs thumping challenge sets lampard back a pace but holds it off and holds the ball
off - balance and facing the wrong way , he slots a delicious right - footed , slide - rule through xavi , carles puyol and sergio busquets for ramires to stride on to and lob victor valdã©s
i had the great fortune to interview lampard in the dressing room of the allianz arena in munich about an hour after chelsea beat bayern munich in that dramatic 120 - minute final
lampard celebrates with the champions league after the 2012 victory over bayern munich he was cradling the cup with the big ears and told me : â we âve been a group since the troubled times , since we beat barcelona
why stay at city , rather than begin the season properly with new york city if pellegrini is nât going to play him regularly ? it was city âs initiative , not lampard âs , to stay on beyond the initial few months which were agreed
his appearances since deciding to turn down moves to new york city , who admit they still want him to join david villa and lampard , or to qatar , have been limited
xavi , as captain , played a huge role in calming stormy waters between luis enrique and messi in early january when the former dropped the latter for the defeat at real sociedad and the argentine then , coincidentally , did nât come in to train the following day
xavi holds the record for most games played in the champions league , 38 games ahead of his nearest rival if cristiano ronaldo won the champions league this season and the two that follow , he 'd still be behind xavi i âve spoken to both lampard and xavi about the other
lampard once told me that england âs 2009 defeat to spain in seville , featuring him , xavi and andres iniesta , was the first real experience in his career where one midfield simply could nât get the ball off the other
it âs feasible that next season the two are in midfield together for new york city
but when xavi was asked to name his best â england â xi , it contained lampard â in a 3 - 5 - 2 of forster : ferdinand , campbell , terry ; giggs , scholes , gascoigne , lampard , gerrard ; walcott , rooney his rationale was : â he âs one of the very few midfielders who scores a striker âs number of goals â which is a mark of greatness â and he âs technically excellent
i think it âs changing : lampard , gerrard â¦ they are players who treat the ball [ well ]
