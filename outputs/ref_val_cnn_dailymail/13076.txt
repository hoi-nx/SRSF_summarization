if you believe greece has caused the crisis in europe because of its fiscal irresponsibility , then you are safely in the mainstream opinion about the matter
there is regularly talk of a lost generation in spain and greece
like greece , spain 's investment bubble burst when the financial crisis hit and it had to seek a bailout ( although a much smaller one ) to prevent its domestic banks from collapsing
spain 's economy also shrank during the crisis and its debt to gdp ratio has shot up dramatically
if greece and spain have such wildly different approaches to fiscal prudence , what can explain the crisis they both find themselves in ? the answer is not fiscal virtue
that something else , in large part , is the euro
joining the eurozone meant spain and greece gave up the power to create money , the power to devalue their currency to restore competitiveness , and the power to set interest rates
the inability to set interest rates in line with the economic conditions meant that in the early 2000s , spain and greece could n't raise interest rates to cool their over-heating economies
the european central bank set interest rates in line with economic conditions in germany and france that proved too low for spain and greece ( and ireland )
read : 25 people to blame for the financial crisis the over-heating of the greece and spain economies led to inflation and investment bubbles
the inability of spain and greece to print money meant they had to borrow from their partners in europe or default and be ignominiously tossed out of the eu
strict budget rules of eurozone membership also required spain and greece to impose austerity measures in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the great depression
austerity helped create a depression of historic magnitude in greece and a severe recession in spain
because spain and greece can not devalue the euro , the only way they can become competitive is through internal devaluation
this means greece and spain are in for years of high unemployment , reduced living standards , falling wages and deflation
" that may or may not be so , but it does n't mean that countries like greece and spain should stay in the euro forever
contrary to popular opinion , this crisis can not be explained away with a moral tale of greece fiscal irresponsibility
