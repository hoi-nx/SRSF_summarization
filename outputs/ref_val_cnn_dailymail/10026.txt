a young woman , who had no luck when she posted an ad on gumtree to find the father of her unborn son , is determined to keep searching after her baby almost died at birth
bianca fazey had a one - night stand with a man in perth , western australia on april 23 last year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome
the 25 - year - old frantically searched for the father for five months but had no success as she only knew his name was jeremy who was from the perth suburb of morley
as a last - ditch attempt she decided to post the ad which only created unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers
two months ago , logan was born , but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him but now the little fella is fighting fit and healthy
now that life has returned to normal after the trauma , the graphic design student has continued to look for logan 's father , a fly - in , fly - out worker in his 20s , who she met at the harlem wednesdays night at amplifier capitol
' i love this beautiful boy with all my heart and i am a fantastic mother , he is strong , smart , happy and very , very loved ! ' she then went onto express her gratitude for the ongoing support of her family and friends in the town of jurien bay - 260km north of perth
' i do n't know if this will be the end of this story , i will continue living my life and raising logan just as i have been , in no way is getting 15 minutes of fame a priority on my list
' bianca fazey posted a gumtree ad last year in an attempt to find her unborn son 's father bianca 's ad ( pictured ) received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers when bianca fell pregnant all she could think about was letting the pending father know the news
' this when bianca , who was so stressed that she was losing sleep , decided to post an ad on gumtree which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down
' unfortunately all i got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be jeremy
' sometimes i want to be like one of those people on maury povich screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they 're booing about ! ' bianca was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby bianca ( pictured before being pregnant ) never thought she could have children as she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome bianca was n't exactly shocked to be called names like a ' sl * * ' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying ' kill it '
' but bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and ca n't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months
' bianca has hit out at people saying she is a ' sl * * ' , a bad mother and has only told her story for money despite the fall - out from the ad - bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends
' bianca still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son 's life
' she still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of logan 's life
