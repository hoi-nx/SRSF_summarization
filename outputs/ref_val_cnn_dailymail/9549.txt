the latest twist in the alleged cover - up of former secretary of state hillary 's private emails involves a former senior diplomat who said state department officials conspired to prevent investigators from seeing documents related to the 2012 benghazi , libya terror attack
some of those documents may have been emails that went through the now - infamous private email server clinton kept at her chappaqua , ny home
if they still exist , they could shed light on clinton 's actions following the deadly benghazi raid by militants acting with ansar al-shariah , an islamist terror faction linked to al-qaeda
maxwell claimed he was scapegoated for objecting to the secret boiler - room operation , which he said was organized in order to keep damning documents from the prying eyes of an internal accountability review board
iconic or ironic ? the image of clinton working her blackberry while on a plane en route to tripoli , libya took on new significance with her admission that she never used a ' state.gov ' email account , one that would have automatically archived all her correspondence maxwell claimed state department higher - ups close to then - secretary hillary worked over a weekend to scrub boxes of documents , before giving the remainder to investigators a senior adviserto clinton 's office explained the operation to him
' she responded , " ray , those are our orders " , ' minutes later , he said , mills came into the room and demanded to know , ' who are you ? ' ultimate insider : mills has been part of the clinton inner circle since the 1990s , defending clinton against impeachment proceedings and even the ' bimbo eruptions ' that once threatened to derail the famous womanizer 's presidential ambitions a month after the deadly military - style assault , the accountability review board 's leaders demanded to see documents that could help explain what happened
those were the documents , maxwell told the daily signal , that were boxed up and put in the basement room where clinton insiders would later screen out the most damaging information before giving the accountability review board the rest
clinton conceded last week that she deleted more than 30,000 of those emails , calling them ' personal ' and not ' work - related
national review linked the maxwell episode with clinton 's ' email-gate ' on monday , noting that mills â along with clinton deputy chief of staff huma abedin â had email addresses on clinton 's private server
devil horns : hillary 's reputation has taken a hit over her handling of emails during her tenure as american 's top diplomat â leading to more chuckles than outrage at the inadvertent beelzebub treatment on a time magazine cover trey gowdy , a south caroline republican congressman at the helm of a special benghazi investigative committee , is outraged that clinton and her insiders took it upon themselves to decide which emails were turned over to the state department for archiving maxwell called the review board investigation ' at best a shoddily executed attempt at damage control , both in foggy bottom and on capitol hill
ultimately , state department 's review board cleared clinton of any wrongdoing , perhaps aided by the absence of incriminating emails â even though it never interviewed her
clinton â the democratic party 's front - runner in the 2016 presidential sweepstakes â and others at state department have been criticized for denying repeated requests from ambassador chris stevens for more security officers , including some that came after these events
' ' the benghazi cover - up was and is about protecting two presidential campaigns â obama âs 2012 reelection campaign and hillary âs nascent 2016 campaign , ' fitton said
' our ambassador and three other american personnel die in a terrorist attack and the number one concern at state is protecting hillary ! first we have the supposedly missing irs emails and now we may have missing benghazi documents ? ' in may 2013 the daily beast interviewed american foreign service association president susan johnson , who said disciplinary action meted out to diplomats like maxwell creates ' a feeling that foreign - service officers often end up as scapegoats when scandals rise to congressional or public attention
