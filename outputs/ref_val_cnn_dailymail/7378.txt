when mr conway and ms flo couper went away on holiday for a weekend they returned to find that the freemans had paid a building firm to relocate the pipe
soon afterwards mr conway said he became concerned that denise seemed to know a lot about his tax affairs , and informed the authorities
i was looking to see whether mr conway had declared a second job
' you would have to declare any change in circumstances to the tax credits office , to hmrc
mr conway said he went away on holiday for the weekend , but when he returned to his house ( pictured ) , he found the freemans had paid workmen to move the pipe without his permission ' i was specifically looking at the income page
