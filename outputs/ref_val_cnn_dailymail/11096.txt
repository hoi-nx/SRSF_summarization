chemical analysis from two bottled drinks found on a shipwreck in finland has revealed their similarities to modern - day lagers
this includes high levels of â green leaf â flavours , sweet apple and rose compounds and a proof of around 3 per cent
chemical analysis from two bottled drinks - known as a56 ( pictured ) and c49 - found on a shipwreck in finland has revealed their similarities to modern - day lagers
this includes high levels of â green leaf â flavours , sweet apple and rose compounds and a proof of around 3 per cent
the bottles date back to the 1840s the bottles were found in the summer of 2010 when the wreck of a schooner was discovered in the baltic sea
it was found at a depth of 165ft ( 50 metres ) just off the coast of the ãland islands , finland

initial taste tests said beers were â vinegary , goaty and tasted of sour milk â and this said to have been caused by bacteria that had grown in the bottles over the years
but when experts chemically analysed the samples they discerned specific flavours such as ' green leaf , sweet apple and rose

but when experts from the vtt technical research centre of finland and the technical university of munich tested the beers they pinpointed specific flavours
â a56 and c49 were similar brown glass bottles , â explained the researchers
â this analysis found green leaf flavours were high in c49
but 3 - ethyl hexanoate and ethyl decanoate - which are apple and sweet apple flavour compounds - are high in both the bottles were found in 2010 when the wreck of a schooner was discovered in the baltic sea

archaeologists said the schooner âs name , its destination , and its last port - of - call have not yet been identified compared to modern beers , the shipwrecked beers contain similar levels of potassium but significantly more sodium , which is believed to have come from seawater on board the shipwreck
ethanol contents are between 2.8 per cent and 3.2 per cent , comparable to typical weak modern lagers and ales
both beers are acidic , with ph only one unit below modern levels , and the colour strengths are in the range of modern ales and lagers , but much lower than those of porters or stouts
since the beers were found , a brewery in finland has recreated what they believe to be as close to the real thing as possible
from this analysis the experts found green leaf flavours are relatively high in c49 , as is 1 - propanol which gives it a stronger alcohol taste
but 3 - ethyl hexanoate and ethyl decanoate â which are apple and sweet apple flavour compounds - are high in both , with a56 having more sweet compounds than c49

they found the shipwreck beers contain similar levels of potassium
ethanol contents are between 2.8 % and 3.2 % and colour strengths were in the range of modern ales and lager a brewery in finland recently recreated what they believe to be as close to the real thing as possible
