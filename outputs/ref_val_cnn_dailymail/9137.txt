the problem for the script writers , if they were to copy the life and times of luiz , is that they would have no idea what luiz was going to do next , so what chance do the opposition â or his team - mates â have ? luiz jumps for joy after his bullet header forced the game in to extra-time on wednesday night luiz celebrates victory with team - mates thiago motta ( right ) and maxwell at the final whistle when you expect luiz to be heading it clear , he âs chasing the glory , when you expect him to be chasing the glory , he appears from nowhere to head it clear
even on wednesday night , with psg drawing 2 - 2 at chelsea with minutes remaining and set to go through with 10 men on away goals , he turned up on the right wing to collect the ball and retain possession
luiz looks on in disgust as germany celebrate one of their seven goals in last summer 's world cup semi-final he âs a defender who sees defending as a part - time job
so concerned was laurent blanc , a world cup - winning centre back with 97 caps , which suggests he knows a bit about defending , that he played luiz in midfield in the first leg , with two centre backs behind him for cover
who else could have got them through when their talisman , zlatan ibrahimovic , had been sent off ? luiz could have been sent off too for his feuding with diego costa , but instead he rose majestically in the land of the giants that is chelsea âs penalty area to send a thunderball of a header into the roof of the net
the defender stumble backwards after one of many confrontations with diego costa on wednesday night to get ahead of terry , cahill or his marker branislav ivanovic takes great skill , movement and courage but to meet the ball with such ferocity â¦ maybe there âs more to luiz than his sideshow bob nickname and carefree style
he said he would nât celebrate on his first return to stamford bridge , but who can blame him for loving the moment ? it was a goal worth celebrating
few can argue with that â terry , especially , has been magnificent as a defender this season but can he hit a dipping , swerving free kick , cristiano ronaldo style , from more than 30 yards , as luiz did on wednesday night ? mourinho has a word with luiz on the touchline as psg manager laurent blanc watches on luiz rises to beat branislav ivanovic to thiago motta 's corner and head home psg 's equaliser not everyone is a luiz fan â jamie redknapp wrote on this website that â whoever struck the deal to sell luiz for Â£ 50m deserves a knighthood â
he will raid upfield when he should be focussing on shutting the door , but he had a lot of fun at stamford bridge on wednesday night and he âs still in the champions league
