it has been , some say , a battle by activists among turkish 's kurdish minority for independence
whatever it has been to the parties involved , the leader of the militant group at the forefront of the kurdish insurgency in turkish says it is time now for it to be over
in a letter read to thousands gathered in the southeastern turkish city of diyarbakir to mark persian new year , ocalan called for " a new era " with kurds gathering as " a democratic society with the right to a democratic identity -- within turkish and on the constitutional citizenship basis
as recently as 2012 , the long - simmering war between the pkk and the turkish government had heated to the point that the international crisis group , a conflict resolution organization monitoring the conflict , counted more than 700 dead over 14 months
" we 're seeing the longest pitched battles between the ( turkish ) army and the pkk , we 're seeing a widespread campaign of kidnapping , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks by the pkk
perhaps vocally underscoring the cultural split between the turkish government and the country 's kurdish population , when ocalan 's letter was read to crowds march 21 , it was read in two languages -- kurdish first , then turkish
the letter was read by onder , deputy of turkish 's pro-kurdish people 's democratic party
about a fifth of turkish 's population is kurdish -- a minority long living under cultural oppression , most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of turkish
by 1998 -- 14 years after the insurgency began -- turkish counted up to 18,000 pkk guerrillas living in the mountains
the united states , the european union and turkish classify the pkk as a terrorist group
ocalan was sentenced by the turkish government to life in prison for treason , and for years , he was the sole prisoner of imrali
ocalan began the pkk in 1978 as a kurdish separatist group in turkish , part of a larger separatist movement by kurds scattered throughout the region
there are also millions of kurds in iran , where they make up about 10 % of the mostly persian nation 's population
violence flared in august 1984 when fighters from the pkk , which has a marxist-leninist philosophy , killed two turkish soldiers
since then , the turkish government has lifted language bans , released political prisoners and continued talks with ocalan despite opposition criticism
talks between the pkk and the turkish government continued , though
onder said , " despite the president 's opposing remarks , the turkish government took responsibility about its kurdish problem for the first time
