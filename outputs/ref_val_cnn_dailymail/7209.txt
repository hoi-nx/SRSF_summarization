a 21 - year - old woman has regular brushes with death and in one year was pronounced clinically dead 36 times
brautigam was four years ago diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome ( pots ) , a condition which makes her heart race while standing upright
she experiences rapid palpitations that regularly cause her heart to stop beating and her blood pressure to plummet to what doctors record as clinically dead
ms brautigam said that she has contacted other people with the same condition , but none of those people 's hearts have stopped ' they ca n't give me cpr because cpr tires the heart out for no reason so it is pointless
when the heart fills up with blood again is when it begins beating again
' the blood tends to pool in my legs and the doors need to help feed it back to the heart
ms brautigam , from doncaster , said each time her heart stops medics have to inflict pain on her to shock her into coming back to life
ms brautigam lies in a hospital bed after undergoing one of her regular episodes caused by her heart condition pots ( pots ) can be a life altering and debilitating chronic health condition
simply standing up can be a challenge for people with pots as their body is unable to adjust to gravity
' ms brautigam said that she has contacted people with pots , but none of those people 's hearts have stopped
the two combined resulted in her visiting a&e a staggering 64 times in one year
' but ms brautigam - who has canoed for great britain - says she is determined not to let the conditions hold her back and is now trying to make a life as a burlesque performer
she said : ' there are signs before it happens - i 'll feel dizzy or sick and really tired and then i feel as though i 'm falling asleep.i can hear everything around me and feel as though i 'm trying to shout but nothing is coming out
' i get asked it quite a lot , but there is definitely no bright light
