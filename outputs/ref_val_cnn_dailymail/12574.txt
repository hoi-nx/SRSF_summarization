not so fast , says the tsa
the tsa continues to use pseudo-scientific " behavior detection " techniques that have given rise to persistent allegations of racial and ethnic profiling at our nation 's airports
through a program called spot , or spot , the tsa employs thousands of " behavior detection officers " who scrutinize travelers to look for signs of " mal - intent " in airport screening areas
the officers typically spend less than 30 seconds scanning an average passenger for over 90 behaviors the tsa associates with stress , fear or deception
the spot program relies on theories about " micro-expressions , " involuntary facial expressions that supposedly appear for milliseconds despite one 's efforts to conceal them
if tsa 's behavior detection officers look for stress in a stressful environment , they 're going to find it , along with plenty of false positives
just about everyone outside the tsa who has reviewed the spot program has decided that it 's unscientific and a waste of money
an exhaustive review by the gao found the spot program lacked a scientific basis , that the behavioral indicators it relied on were subjective , and that the tsa had no effective means to test its effectiveness
an independent scientific advisory group that reviewed the spot program also concluded that " no scientific evidence exists to support the detection or inference of future behavior , including intent
" rep. michael mccaul of texas , the republican chairman of the house homeland security committee , stated , " i am concerned that tsa will continue to spin its wheels with this program instead of developing a more effective and efficient approach
" despite this withering criticism , spot remains in place and has cost taxpayers well over $ 1 billion ( that 's with a b ) since its inception in 2007
nor has tsa explained why -- despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary -- spot contributes meaningfully to aviation security
that 's why the aclu submitted an foia request to tsa seeking information on its use of behavior detection
it 's time for tsa to explain and justify the spot program
