churchill planned to tempt americans into joining world war two by offering the country a priceless copy of the magna carta
letters written in 1941 reveal churchill planned to gift the americans a copy of the magna carta to persuade them to join world war two , noting that americans desire ' tangible evidence of their europe background ' the magna carta , which was issued by king john in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects , is also seen as a precursor to the american constitution
in 1941 , when the letters were written , a copy of the document was stranded in americans following the outbreak of the war while it was on display at the new york world 's fair in 1939
according to the letters , which go on display at the british library from this friday , the americans saw the british as ' cold - blooded ' , ' calculating ' people who failed ' to say it with flowers ' the historic document ( pictured ) , which signed over righta king john 's people , is viewed as a precursor to the americans constitution , and so was viewed as a generous gift in an attempt to win them over , the british cabinet , supported by churchill , planned to gift them the copy of the magna carta , which belonged to lincoln cathedral
