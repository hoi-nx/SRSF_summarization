arsenal 's 18 - year - old german - born midfielder zelalem will go straight into the usa national team if fifa grant him eligibility , coach jurgen klinsmann told reporters on thursday
zelalem was born in berlin and played for germany at youth level and was also eligible to play for ethiopia through his parents
however the player has expressed a desire to play for the u.s. and gained u.s. citizenship in december , opening the door to a potential switch pending permission from the world governing body
although zelalem has yet to feature in a premier league game for arsenal he is seen as one of the most exciting prospects in the club 's youth ranks
u.s. head coach jurgen klinsmann hopes that fifa grants zelalem permission to play for his side jurgen klinsmann did not rule out the midfielder being given a slot in one of the u.s. youth teams at some stage but said he wanted to see him with the first team initially
zelalem , playing for the gunners during his debut last year against coventry , lived in the u.s. from 2006 - 13 fifa rules , designed to stop players from being granted citizenship for entirely football reasons , require players to live in a country for five years after their 18th birthday before they are eligible
