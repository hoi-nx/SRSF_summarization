dynel lane , a former nurse 's aide accused of stabbing a pregnant colorado woman , was charged friday with criminal attempt to commit first - degree murder , unlawful termination of pregnancy , and other crimes for allegedly cutting a fetus from the womb
boulder county district attorney garnett was unable to file a murder charge under state law , and he highlighted how the coroner found that the fetus did n't show any signs of life outside the womb , garnett said
the victim , wilkins , 26 , who was seven months ' pregnant , survived this month 's attack , which occurred when she went to a longmont home to buy baby clothes advertised for sale on craigslist
" now , i understand that many in the community -- and heaven knows i 've heard from a lot of them -- would like me to file homicide charges , " garnett told reporters
" however , that is not possible under colorado law without proof of live birth
dynel lane , 34 , appeared briefly in a holding room during an initial court appearance friday , but she did n't enter the courtroom
" she could get a long sentence and very well could die in prison , " the district attorney said about dynel lane , adding he could n't immediately calculate the maximum number of years she faces if convicted of all counts
dynel lane was also charged with two counts of crime of violence , two counts of first - degree assault , and two counts of second - degree assault , garnett said
dynel lane 's next court date , a preliminary hearing , is may 5
she is being held on a $ 2 million bond
the female fetus did n't exhibit " any signs of life outside of the womb , therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth , " coroner hall said in a statement
friday 's finding came a day after prosecutors indicated that dynel lane would n't face a murder charge in the march 18 assault
" at this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb , therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth
