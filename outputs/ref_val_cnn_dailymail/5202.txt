a 22 - year - old man bought a coin that he believes could date back more than 2,000 years for just Â£ 29
coin collector stephen creswell snapped up what he thinks is a half shekel from tyre - which dates back to 126bc - at an auction in wolverhampton , staffordshire
lost treasure ? the coin found by stephen creswell , 22 , which he believes to be half a shekel from tyre collector : mr stephen creswell , pictured , bought the coin for just Â£ 29 at an auction in wolverhampton , staffordshire but one expert claims the coin is unlikely to be an original and believes mr cresswell might have a ' mock up '
the battered coin weighs 7.7grams , half of a full shekel 's weight
shekels were used for temple tax in ancient jerusalem due to their relatively higher concentration of silver than other roman coins
mr stephen creswell , from dudley , west midlands said that he bought the coin as part of a selection but quickly realised he had ' something special '
' but after looking at images of the coin , one expert said he does not believe it to be a shekel as mr cresswell had hoped
payment : the coins are believed by biblical scholars to have been the same as those used to pay judas iscariot his 30 pieces of silver for betraying jesus , illustrated in this image above professional numismatist vosper told mailonline : ' i can confirm that this is not even a coin but either a contemporary forgery , although this is doubtful , or more like a modern mock up of a " coin " believed to be some kind of shekel
' mr vosper , who runs mike r vosper coins with his partner viv , said it was the fabric of the coin and the fact that it has half its surface missing that gives it away
without doubt , the half shekel is my favourite so far
