cameron reacted angrily to a conservatives minister 's warning against banning hate preachers cameron reacted with fury after a conservatives minister warned against banning radical preachers from universities during a fiery cabinet meeting , it has been revealed
the prime minister ' jumped on ' the universities minister clark after he spoke out against home office plans to force universities to ban non-violent ' extremists ' , sources said
mr cameron was backed up by the home secretary theresa may and communities secretary eric pickles
the extraordinary row comes after it emerged mrs may is at loggerheads with the lib dem business secretary vince cable over the issue
the home office wants all campuses to become no - go zones for all ' extremist ' speakers to prevent students becoming radicalised
but mr vince cable insists that the move could force debates ' underground ' , where extreme views will go unchallenged
last month 's cabinet row suggests the issue is dividing the conservatives as well as the coalition
the issue has come to the fore after the unmasking of mohammed emwazi â a university of westminster graduate thought to be the isis executioner known as jihadi john
westminster was named in a 2009 report as having invited three hate preachers to give a talk in 2006 , and just days before mohammed emwazi 's identity was revealed , thousands signed a petition to block an event where an anti-gay figure was due to speak
but mr vince cable , who is responsible for university policy , warns a blanket ban on radical preachers could backfire
vince cable does n't want to do what conservatives want to do which is that on campus we do n't want radical preachers saying things which incite violence which ultimately can lead to the radicalisation of young people
' i 'm afraid to say that conservatives just have a simple view that people in vince cable 's constituency of twickenham or around the country deserve that protection and that means we have to put proper , decent , tough rules in place which do n't ban free speech but do stop people from preaching death
