a while ago , i visited a hampshire nursery which raises more than four million orchids a year
it was like a slow - motion factory ; tissue - cultured plantlets came in at one end , flowering specimens trundled out of the other , each in a posh ceramic pot. orchids , particularly phalaenopsis ( moth orchids ) , have become britain 's favourite houseplant but most die within weeks
moth orchids are easier to nurture than indoor cyclamen or poinsettias and , with care , they can flourish for years
but it helps to know a little about this weird plant group and to understand its special needs
hardy beauty : moth orchids ( pictured ) need gentle treatment to produce glorious blossoms more than 22,000 species of orchids make up orchidaceae , the world 's largest flowering plant family
about 50 are native to britain , and the common spotted orchid grows in my own tiny flower meadow
with such a huge range of habitats , orchids ' needs differ widely
but once you learn the likes and dislikes of popular houseplant orchids , it 's not hard to keep them happy
know their needs phalaenopsis , like many cultivated orchids are epiphytes , meaning that they grow in bark crevices in forest trees
in a pot in your house , the orchid needs to think it is in a tropical forest
cram the roots into wet compost and it will die
repot your orchid only if it has become pot - bound or has been in the same compost for more than two years
