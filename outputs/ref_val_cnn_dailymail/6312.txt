an unmanned atlas 5 rocket blasted off from florida on thursday with a quartet of nasa science satellites designed to map explosions triggered by criss - crossing magnetic fields around the earth
perched atop the rocket were four identical satellites designed to fly in a pyramid formation high around earth
mission space : they will fly in pyramid formation to provide 3 - d views of magnetic reconnection on the smallest of scales new frontiers : magnetic reconnection is what happens when magnetic fields come together , break apart , then come together again , releasing vast energy nasa is spending about $ 1.1 billion on the project , known as magnetospheric multiscale , or mms , in an effort to understand how the energy is generated and released
the satellites will fly directly into reconnection zones 44,000 to 95,000 miles above earth and map what happens when magnetic field lines realign
" the mms mission will conduct a definitive experiment in space that will finally allow us to understand how magnetic reconnection works , " lead researcher jim burch , from the southwest research institute in san antonio , texas , told reporters at a pre-launch press conference
it also may help forecasters predict dangerous solar storms , which can knock out power grids on earth and disrupt radio , gps and satellite signals
