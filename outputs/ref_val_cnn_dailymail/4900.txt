armstrong welcomed an investigative report into the murky past of cycling 's governing body and said he hopes it can help the sport move on from an era that will always be remembered for the doping by himself and others
the report turned up no evidence to sustain previous allegations that armstrong paid the union cycliste internationale ( union cycliste internationale ) to cover up a positive doping test back in his heyday , yet it explains in great detail how the union cycliste internationale acted favorably toward armstrong - a rider dubbed ' cycling 's pop star
its report examined how the doping culture during armstrong 's era was allowed to fester under the previous union cycliste internationale leadership of former president mcquaid and predecessor verbruggen
a new report published on monday has found cycling leaders let doping flourish and broke their own rules so armstrong could cheat his way to become a superstar the sport badly needed ' i am grateful to circ for seeking the truth and allowing me to assist in that search
' armstrong is trying to overturn a life ban imposed by the u.s. anti-doping agency
he was stripped of his seven tour titles for doping on every one of his wins from 1999 - 2005
' in their affidavits provided to u.s. anti-doping agency - whose scathing report in 2012 exposed systematic doping by armstrong and others - former american postal teammates tyler hamilton and landis declared that armstrong had told them separately that he tested positive for the performance enhancer epo at the 2001 tour de suisse
three samples were tested for epo and they came back negative , although there was a ' strong suspicion ' that two of the ' a '' samples did contain traces of the banned blood booster , the circ report said â adding that it deemed inappropriate the fact that ' armstrong and his entourage were informed by the union cycliste internationale of these suspect test results
the report explains in great detail how the international cycling union acted favorably toward armstrong - a rider dubbed ' cycling 's pop star ' the collusion between armstrong and the union cycliste internationale 's leadership features strongly in the 227 - page report
the circ did not find ' any evidence to corroborate ' such allegations but said the union cycliste internationale acted improperly ' in soliciting and accepting donations from an athlete ' under increasing suspicion
armstrong , having retired after the 2005 tour , was also cleared by the union cycliste internationale to make his comeback at australia 's tour down under in 2009 â despite not being eligible because he had not been in the union cycliste internationale 's doping testing pool for a six - month period beforehand
in one email sent to mcquaid , written at the time of u.s. anti-doping agency 's impending investigation , a union cycliste internationale consultant refers to armstrong as ' cycling 's pop star ' and states clearly that for the sake of its image the ' union cycliste internationale has an interest that la is acquitted
