fancy footwork : kristina on strictly come dancing my husband is holding me in his arms , gazing fondly into my eyes and leading me across the floor in a series of sinuous moves that , quite frankly , i never imagined he could make
such a moment never seemed possible because , like many women , i have been made a wallflower by a ca nât - dance , wo nât - dance partner
however , with the help of strictly come dancing âs kristina , we are getting the chance to take to the floor together â and in the process improve our fitness and our general mood , and even make our marriage healthier
dressing up and taking your partner âs hand to dance Ã deux is catching on all over again , thanks to the huge success of the tv dance show
â learning dance steps allows couples to enjoy the closeness of each other and creates a sense of trust as well as intimacy , â says kristina , who has partnered celebrities from newscaster john sergeant to pop singer simon on the tv show
â some therapists suggest it as a form of marriage counselling
it allows men to lead and feel in charge again , and women to feel they are being taken care of by their partner
kristina is giving david and me a taste of the weekend workshops she âs running at champneys health spa over the next few months
â i feel like a robot , â grumbles david , who has zero ballroom experience but bucks up when kristina puts santana on the sound system
he is musical â playing guitar â but his sense of rhythm does not extend to his feet , which kristina says is surprisingly common
the strictly come dancing star says learning dance steps together creates a sense of trust as well as intimacy between couples a recent study in poland suggested that dancing can elicit an improvement in mood
another soon - to - be - published study shows that learning to dance improves leg muscle architecture in older women , while dementia patients were found to feel much better after taking a latin ballroom class for a 2013 study
kristina reassures us that we are no worse than any beginners , and half an hour later we âre congratulating ourselves on remembering all 18 steps of our sequence and even keeping time with the music
at least champneys will guarantee everyone who books kristina âs course someone to dance with
