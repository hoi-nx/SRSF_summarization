scotland rugby fans are not , as a rule , the kind of folk who fling mars bars at directors â boxes or strike up furious chants demanding a change of leadership
the actions of one poor demented soul at murrayfield on saturday evening offered a brief and revelatory glimpse , then , of how deeply the national mood has darkened at the end of an emotionally exhausting six nations , a campaign that moved from promising to properly poor without bothering to shift through the gears
scotland 's dismal six nations campaign ended with a 40 - 10 thrashing by ireland at murrayfield scotland 's huge loss on saturday was their fifth in the tournament and they finished bottom of the table scotland 's russell is tackled by conor murray and rory best during their six nations rugby match storming up the steps at the back of the main stand with about five minutes to go , angry from maryculter whistled sharply for the attention of vern cotter and his coaching team , safely ensconced behind reinforced glass in their secure box
none of the home fans among the 67,000 sell - out enjoyed seeing their team reduced to mere fodder â an absolute irrelevance â by an ireland side involved in a run chase , a mathematical exercise in points accumulation
considering the paucity of the scotland performance , devoid of spark and littered with the kind of basic errors that would move a mini-rugby coach to break down in tears , the sound of patience snapping all over the stadium could hardly have come as a surprise to anyone
o'brien of ireland scores the second try in the six nations match between scotland and ireland ireland players celebrate at the end of the match at murrayfield before being crowned six nations champions ireland 's o'brien and devin toner escape scotland 's jonny gray during the six nations match at murrayfield if everyone involved in the scotland set - up , from the kit man to self - styled comedy guru and full - time director of rugby scott johnson , did nât feel at least a little uncomfortable watching the irish party on saturday night , something is very wrong
given the situation , ireland â ranked third in the world and chasing a second successive six nations title â were never going to flinch from the task in hand
they ran in four tries , forced scotland to concede a dirty dozen penalties , won every contest that mattered â¦ and genuinely seemed capable of taking the ball back from scotland any time they damn well pleased
vern cotter ( centre ) has his position as scotland head coach under scrutiny after a winless six nations russell ( right ) touches down for a scotland try in the defeat against ireland on saturday scotland were outclassed by ireland at murrayfield as the visitors secured the six nations title take the passage of play leading up to ireland âs third try as perhaps the ideal snapshot of the entire afternoon
it all started with a brilliant tommy seymour take on a high ball plummeting to earth inside the irish half , the scotland winger collecting and driving forward
when greig laidlaw âs low pass in front of jonny gray was knocked on by the stooping big man , though , it handed ireland a scrum on halfway
errors like that , of which there were far too many to document on saturday , have left vern cotter banging on about the same problems that confronted him on day one of his reign
already he is looking forward to a long training camp ahead of the world cup , promising that working and drilling them , going back to basics and forcing them to confront their own shortcomings will bear dividends
we will duly skelp japan and beat the usa in our opening two world cup games , raising hopes just in time for the crucial group fixtures against south africa and samoa
vern cotter obviously hopes to achieve more than that in his time as scotland head coach
