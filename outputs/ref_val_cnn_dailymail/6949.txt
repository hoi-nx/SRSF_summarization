a london woman is embroiled in a fight for compensation with jet airways after toilets and sinks overflowed and smelly water seeped into the cabin during an eight - hour flight
passengers , including two families with infant children , were forced to endure the pungent smell for about six hours as they travelled from delhi to london
traveller jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows , and cabin crew scrambled to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor
photos show water trickling into the aisle ( left ) and newspapers that were used to soak up the mess ( right ) the 27 - year - old office worker told mailonline travel : â after two hours , myself and other passengers noticed water seeping out from under the two lavatories closest to our seats
â he then told us that the water was overflowing from the toilet and sink in both lavatories , so you can imagine the smell that we then had to endure for the remainder of the flight
â she added : â it was quite difficult to tell whether the liquid contained human waste , but it would not surprise me as â¦ the liquid overflowing from the lavatories definitely had a foul urine - like smell
passengers used articles of clothing to cover their mouths and noses as water flowed into the cabin in an attempt to cover the smell a flight attendant sprayed the wet patches with an air freshener
jaurre said : â this then led to complaints from a nearby passenger who suffered from asthma and could n't be near such a strong fragrance without risking an asthma attack
' jet airways investigated the incident and maintains the liquid leaking was coming from the sinks ms jaurre said : â ideally , i would like compensation from jet airways because i feel that their offer of frequent flyer miles is n't sufficient , given that i was already quite ill on the flight and it did n't help then having to sit in that unhygienic and filthy cabin
â i 'm unsure if any other passengers became ill but as the liquid continued to overflow and the smell became more evident , it gave me a very bad headache and made me nauseous which put me off my in - flight meal
