lib dem attempts to distance themselves from deep tories cuts descended into farce today when two thirds of nick clegg 's lib dem mps stayed away from the commons debate on their rival yellow budget
in an unprecedented move , lib dem treasury minister alexander used a statement from the government despatch box to spell out how he disagreed with conservative plans for spending cuts
but despite the extraordinary stunt - which signals the death of the coalition - being central to lib dem hopes of survival at the next election , only 17 mps , including mr alexander , bothered to turned up
behind mr chris leslie , an mp waves an ironic goodbye mr alexander later posed with a specially - made yellow budget box to promote his rival fiscal plan alexander set out the alternative lib dem budget , which includes : before mr alexander 's statement even got underway , commons speaker bercow cast doubt on the exercise , insisting statements ' have to be ministerial , delivered not in a personal or party capacity but on behalf of the government '
on the government frontbench , only deputy pm nick clegg , lib dem chief whip don foster , business secretary vince cable and deputy commons leader tom brake had turned up
asked why so few colleagues had found the time to support mr alexander , a party insider said organising lib dem mps was like ' herding cats '
mr nick clegg himself got up and walked out while mr alexander was under attack from his labour opponents
to much mockery from labour , mr alexander ploughed on , claiming he was setting out lib dem plans for those ' left cold ' by george osborne 's budget
labour 's shadow chief secretary to the treasury chris leslie blasted : do n't you realise how two - faced you look ? you [ the lib dem ] want to have your cake and eat it , to be in government but not in government
' despite confirming that the budget was agreed by the tories and the lib dem , mr alexander criticised the plans contained in it to cut government spending to 1964 levels - ' the era of cathy come home '
as he tried to set out his lib dem plan that ' borrows less than labour ' and ' cuts less than the conservatives ' , he was met with a volley of heckling from labour backbenchers
just 17 lib dem mps were in the commons to hear mr alexander 's statement , with 40 choosing to stay awa undeterred , mr alexander detailed the lib dem ' ' better economic plan for britain '
' mr alexander was repeatedly heckled and mocked by labour over his attempts to distance himself from the tories who he has shared power with for five years mr alexander said tories spending plans would take government consumption back to the levels seen in 1964 , adding : ' the era of cathy come home is not my vision for the future of britain ' labour frontbencher andrew gwynne reached across the table separating the despatch boxes with a copy of the red book and dropped it in front of mr alexander mr alexander went on : ' so to all those people left cold by yesterday 's exchanges , to all those asking themselves is there another way , today i say yes there is , there is a better way
' labour 's shadow chief secretary to the treasury chris leslie blasted : ' do n't you realise how two - faced you look ? mr bercow had said he would be put in a difficult position if mr alexander used ' the privilege accorded to ministers for purely party purposes ' but he took a back seat for much of the speech
