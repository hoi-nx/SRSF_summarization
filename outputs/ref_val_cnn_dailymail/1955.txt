the world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change , scientists have warned
this is according to new evidence which suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25 Â° c per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years

the arctic ( purple ) will be have the most dramatic increase , followed by north america ( brown ) , europe ( black ) and asia ( red ) the analysis , based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world , looked at the rate of change in 40 - year long time spans
' we focused on changes over 40 - year periods , which is similar to the lifetime of houses and human - built infrastructure such as buildings and roads , ' said lead scientist dr smith , from the pacific northwest national laboratory in washington

this was compared with temperature data for the past 2,000 years obtained by studying tree rings , corals and ice cores and predicted 40 - year rates of change between 1971 and 2020
over the 900 years preceding the 20th century , 40 - year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1 Â° c per decade , the study found
but by 2020 the rate was expected to have risen to an average of 0.25 Â° c per decade , give or take 0.05 Â° c. different scenarios of future emissions showed that even at the lower end of greenhouse gas generation climate change picked up speed in the next 40 years
' we need to better understand what the effects of this will be and how to prepare for them
