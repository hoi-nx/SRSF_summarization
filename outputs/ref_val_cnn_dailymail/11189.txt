when the first astronauts land on mars , they will not use a conventional parachute or heat shield that has been used before
this is the low density supersonic decelerator ( ldsd ) and , in june , nasa will perform the latest test of this groundbreaking technology - a vital next step in the journey to mars
scroll down for a video from last year 's test in june , the vehicle will be sent into near - space from the navy 's pacific missile range facility on kauai , hawaii , to test its re-entry capabilities into earth 's atmosphere tomorrow at 9am to 10am pdt ( 5pm to 6pm gmt ) , nasa will perform a spin test of the vehicle at the jet propulsion laboratory in california before transporting it to hawaii
the ldsd is unique in its design , using a donut - shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag
last june , to simulate the mars atmosphere on earth , the ldsd was lifted to a height of 23 miles ( 37km ) by a high - altitude balloon
â the ldsd crosscutting demonstration mission will test breakthrough technologies that will enable large payloads to be safely landed on the surface of mars , or other planetary bodies with atmospheres , including earth , â nasa said in a statement
â esessentially parachute , the ldsd is large - 15ft ( 4.6 metres ) wide and weighing 7,000lbs ( 3.200kg ) - in order to cope with the atmosphere of mars
the main structural body of the second flight test vehicle in nasa 's ldsd project is seen during its assembly in a cleanroom at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory.the flight test for this vehicle is planned in june of this year
it will eventually be used to take humans to the surface of mars a successful test took place in june 2014 , shown , when the ldsd successfully re-entered part of earth 's atmosphere
there will be four tests of the ldsd in total before mission managers decide whether to employ it on future mars missions
the balloon on the left was used to pull the 200lb ( 90kg ) parachute from its sturdy canister the ldsd , shown , is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than curiosity rover , such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves carried as payload during the shakeout flight were two technologies scheduled to be tested next year aboard this same type of test vehicle
' a good test is one where there are no surprises but a great test is one where you are able to learn new things , and that is certainly what we have in this case , ' said ian clark , principal investigator for ldsd at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory , after the test
