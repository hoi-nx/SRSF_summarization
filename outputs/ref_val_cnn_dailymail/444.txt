england have denied that their worst ever world cup has been the result of them being tied up in knots by an obsession with statistics and analysis
the lack of freedom in their batting and their apparent reluctant to think on their feet while bowling has been the biggest problem for england in a world cup where they have failed to live up to even the most modest of expectations
and peter moores appeared to sum up their whole constipated approach when he said in the aftermath of england âs humiliating defeat by bangladesh that he would have to â look at the data â to see what went wrong
paul farbrace speaks to the assembled media ahead of england 's dead rubber against afghanistan on friday ian bell is pictured arriving at sydney airport following england 's embarrassing defeat against bangladesh james taylor reacts after he loses his wicket en route to a humiliating defeat against bangladesh yet paul farbrace , the man who led sri lanka to the asia cup and the world twenty20 titles last year before throwing in his lot with england , says that whatever has led to england âs shortcomings here , it is not statistics
â there has been a lot said about stats and team meetings , â said assistant coach paul farbrace
â but when i was with sri lanka we had a lot more meetings and looked at stats a lot more than england do
â we had a team of six people working with sri lanka during the world twenty20 who provided us with data straight after a game and the next day
our preparation from fantastic statistics helped us win the final
â it âs tough on him but he accepts the criticism and knows it comes with the territory , â said paul farbrace
â the theory that england have been stifled by outdated plans has been given credence by the fact that captain eoin morgan , who was expected to be a free spirit here , has repeatedly brought up statistics in press conferences
i ca nât say why they said that , â said paul farbrace of peter moores and eoin morgan
bangladesh celebrate their shock victory over england in the world cup earlier this week eoin morgan was expected to be a free spirit at the world cup but has been bogged down by statistics â what we do is allow people to look at footage
â paul farbrace has created an excellent impression around the england team amid the wreckage of this tour and , with his experience of leading sri lanka to limited - overs success , it would not be a surprise if he takes greater responsibility for the â new era â of one - day cricket they have to produce
