suddenly the nightmare scenario of england not making it out of a world cup group which contains wales and australia becomes a real threat
danny cipriani is among england 's fringe players who must get a start in the remaining six nations games lancaster 's focus must shift to the world cup with two competitive matches left before it starts steffon armitage may be left out due to his choice to play for toulon but he 's really too good to ignore lancaster âs men have just five games before their campaign begins against fiji on september 18 ... six nations saturday , march 14 v scotland ( h ) saturday , march 21 v france ( h ) world cup warm - ups saturday august 15 v france ( h ) saturday august 22 v france ( a ) saturday september 5 v ireland ( h ) if wales defeat ireland at home this weekend , their year is back on track and they go into world cup camp in great shape
they know if they can put a scrum together to compete with england then twickenham holds no fears
with two games to go in the six nations , england âs momentum going into the world cup camp depends on their performances against scotland and france
since the end of last year âs six nations , england have lost six out of eight matches against top - tier teams
here âs my seven - point guide that england should follow ... england 's squad are put through their paces ahead of saturday 's six nations clash with scotland 1 pool practice 2015 is all about the world cup , nothing else
england can win the six nations title on points difference , but in a world cup year , once the grand slam is gone , the tournament is gone
england only have five games before their world cup opener in september , and three of those are friendlies , which are not games to judge anybody on
that leaves just two meaningful matches - scotland and france at home
england have to do everything they can to replicate the atmosphere they will encounter when they play those world cup games
2 three and easy there are three men lancaster still needs to see start - danny cipriani , steffon armitage and henry slade
lancaster can make it clear he âs not dropping george ford , but he needs to find out about danny cipriani in a significant game once and for all
lancaster needs to find out about danny cipriani in a significant game once and for all , so he should start henry slade - alongside joseph - is perhaps the most in - form centre in england and his left foot , at inside centre , would offer more kicking variations
england âs kicking game was poor against ireland and they have got to find players who can dictate a game
exeter 's henry slade is probably the most in - form centre in england at the moment so should be tested 3 rest robshaw i âm a big chris robshaw fan but he is in a very competitive position and must be in the team on merit , so we need to see his biggest rival play
also , if he gets injured in the first minute at the world cup , nobody knows who will replace him as captain
it âs time to see who else has the capacity to lead this team and i would give haskell a chance to see how he handles the task , which allows you to bring in steffon armitage at no 7
haskell is one of the few players who captains his club , so give the role to him on saturday
captain chris robshaw , here attempting a drop goal at training , should be rested to try out alternatives haskell captains wasps so would be an interesting replacement for chris robshaw should one be needed 4 need for speed the current back row of chris robshaw , haskell and vunipola is not quick enough at the very top level
we have a big powerful front five but we do not need the same in the back row , we need speed
the current back row of vunipola ( pictured ) , haskell and chris robshaw do n't have the speed required 5 get your kicks dave alred is one of the best coaches i âve ever worked with
it was nât just jonny wilkinson âs kicking that he helped - dave alred improved the whole team
dave alred ( right ) not only helped jonny wilkinson 's prodigious kicking but the all - round england game it would be a challenge persuading him to join because he is very much his own man , but he is the best person for the job by a long way
every player picked should be fit enough to play for 80 minutes if they 're worthy of the world cup 7 smarter subs assuming all your players can last 80 minutes , the first purpose of your bench should be for injury replacements , but england started against ireland with no specialist second - row substitute
