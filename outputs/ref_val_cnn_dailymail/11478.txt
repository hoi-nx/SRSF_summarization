listeriosis , a food - borne illness , linked to some blue bell ice cream products did not cause the deaths of three hospital patients , but it may have been a contributing factor , according to kansas health officials
the fda said five people , three women and two men , developed listeriosis in kansas after eating products from one production line at the blue bell creamery in brenham , texas
the deaths prompted the texas icon 's first product recall in its 108 - year history listeria bacteria were found in samples of blue bell chocolate chip country cookies , great divide bars , sour pop green apple bars , cotton candy bars , scoops , vanilla stick slices , almond bars and no sugar added mooo bars , said the fda ( above the blue bell products that had listeria bacteria found in them ) listeria bacteria were found in samples of blue bell chocolate chip country cookies , great divide bars , sour pop green apple bars , cotton candy bars , scoops , vanilla stick slices , almond bars and no sugar added mooo bars , said the fda
blue bell said its regular moo bars were untainted , as were its half gallons , quarts , pints , cups , three - gallon ice cream and take - home frozen snack novelties
according to a statement on friday from the cdc , all five of the people sickened were receiving treatment for unrelated health issues at the same kansas hospital before developing listeriosis , ' a finding that strongly suggests their infections ( with listeria bacteria ) were acquired in the hospital , ' the cdc said
blue bell said its regular moo bars were untainted , as were its half gallons , quarts , pints , cups , three - gallon ice cream and take - home frozen snack novelties ( above the no sugar added mooo bars that have been recalled ) there appeared to be some uncertainty as to where the patients acquired the listeria bacterial infection ( above the almond bars which have had traces of listeria bacteria found in them ) ' via christi was not aware of any listeria contamination in the blue bell ice cream products and immediately removed all blue bell products from all via christi locations once the potential contamination was discovered , ' maria loving said in a statement friday to the associated press
all four had consumed milkshakes made with a single - serving blue bell ice cream product called ' scoops ' while they were in the hospital , the cdc said
' scoops , ' as well as the other suspect blue bell items , are mostly food service items and not produced for retail , said kruse , ceo of the brenham creamery
the cdc said the listeria isolated from specimens taken from four of the five patients at the hospital matched strains isolated from blue bell products obtained this year in south carolina and texas
four patients in hospital had consumed milkshakes made with a single - serving blue bell ice cream product called ' scoops ' while they were in the hospital , the cdc said ( above the cotton candy bar that has also been recalled ) the five patients became ill with listeriosis during their hospitalizations for unrelated causes between december 2013 and january 2015 , said hospital spokeswoman maria loving ( listeria bacteria were also found in blue bell chocolate chip country cookies , above ) blue bell handles all of its own distribution and customer service , kruse said , so it moved to pull suspect products from shelves , most of them institutional , as soon as it was alerted to the south carolina contamination february 13
kruse did not suspect handling of those products after they left the texas creamery
that contamination has been traced to a machine that extrudes the ice cream into forms and onto cookies , and that machine remains off line , he said
however , ' contaminated ice cream products may still be in the freezers of consumers , institutions , and retailers , given that these products can have a shelf life of up to two years , ' the cdc statement said

kruse did not suspect handling of those products after they left the texas creamery ( above pictures from the blue bell factory in brenham , texas ) cdc recommends that consumers do not eat products that blue bell removed from the market , and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them ( above via christi st. francis hospital in wichita , kansas ) cincinnati - based supermarket chain kroger removed recalled blue bell products from 860 of its 2,625 stores and the company is alerting customers through its recall notification system , spokesman dailey said in an email
it is not unusual to see listeria outbreaks linked to dairy products , including ice cream , said marler , an attorney who represented victims of a 2011 listeria outbreak that killed 33 people and was traced to a colorado cantaloupe farm
in december , an ice cream company in snohomish , washington , recalled nearly a year 's worth of ice cream and related products because of possible listeria contamination that sickened two men
his only criticism was that blue bell did not mention the patients who were sickened or died in kansas in a statement on its online site , and instead mentioned it was the first re-call in 108 year - history
