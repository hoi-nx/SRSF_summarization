patrick had a tumour removed from his large intestine seven years ago , aged 30 the question , at first glance , seems fairly simple : would you want to know your chances of getting cancer ? in particular , whether you are carrying a faulty gene that could make cancerous cells or a malignant tumour more likely
but when the opportunity arose to have genetic screening to find out if my dna was flawed , this question merely triggered more : how would i cope if it turned out cancer was a near certainty ? though certain genetic tests are available on the nhs for people with a clear family history of a particular cancer â for example , if more than two members of your immediate family have had it â the private spire bushey hospital , in hertfordshire , has become the first to offer full screening for a range of cancers to people who may have had only one or two family members affected
some genes they test for , in particular the faulty brca1 and brca2 , have received a lot of publicity in recent years
they opted for double mastectomies and hysterectomies to avoid the 60 to 90 per cent chance of developing cancer
but this new service screens for dozens of different genes linked to prostate , bowel , breast and ovarian cancers , which are among the most common in britain , using â next generation â gene technology to provide a full range of results within 12 weeks
seven years ago , aged 30 , i was lying in a hospital bed , heavily sedated after a colonoscopy to find the cause of months of abdominal pain , when my gastroenterologist delivered the news : â we found an adenoma â a type of tumour â in your large intestine
though the tumour was benign , the doctor added : â the type means that it would likely have become malignant
had we not removed this , you could have been dead by 40
â because such growths are rare for someone so young , i was told i would need to have colonoscopies every three years to ( hopefully ) catch any further abnormalities
three years later , a scan found another polyp â smaller , benign , but still , more reason to worry
it was his prostate , a common cancer in older men ( he was 67 ) and one with pretty good prospects for survival
and my father âs tumour was one of the most aggressive kinds
could there be a faulty prostate cancer gene on my father âs side ? my mother was adopted and knows nothing of her family , so might there be bowel cancer genes on her side ? could there be two loaded guns waiting for me ? patrick ( pictured ) decided to have genetic screening for cancer to find out whether or not he is predisposed to particular strains of bowel and prostate cancer the final push to take the tests came down to the memory of a dear friend called beth
â it âs a genetic mistake that makes people more likely to get bowel cancer
with it comes an increased risk of prostate cancer
â ( a recent review of studies on aspirin by queen mary university of london concluded that a daily low dose for ten years can reduce the risk of colon cancer by 35 per cent
) â after the age of 40 we would also suggest regular psa tests for prostate cancer , â she said
i opted to have screening for every gene we so far know about that can trigger prostate or bowel cancer â 12 genes in total â and went to have the blood taken
â even if someone does have a family history of one type of cancer , and if they are sent to a genetic counsellor by the nhs , they still might not have the actual testing if the counsellor does nât think the chances are high enough
â but this screening gives people who might have only one parent or sibling the chance to test â and it âs one of the most common questions family members of cancer patients have : â will i get it , too ? â â in fact , the nhs might not offer testing because only a small percentage of cancers are caused by genetic problems , says shane mckee , a consultant clinical geneticist at the belfast health and social care trust
he also casts doubt on the screening you can pay for outside the nhs , as family history does not need to be as strong in order to get the tests , which makes analysing the results harder
patrick ( pictured ) was incredibly relieved to learn that his genetic screening came back normal although he says he will do everything he can to lower the risks of cancer cancer research uk also advises caution around genetic screening
but dr mckee is clear about the benefits of specific genetic cancer tests , particularly for bowel and breast cancers
i must remain vigilant â for me , for my family and for beth .
