paul murray admits the new rangers regime is still waiting to see whether ashley will send two of his men onto the board
the ibrox interim chairman confirmed the terms of the initial Â£ 5million loan taken from sports direct by the previous hierarchy means ashley retains the right to appoint directors
paul murray insists rangers now have no need for any further money from the newcastle owner , having this week instead secured a Â£ 1.5m loan from the three bears consortium to cover short - term needs
newcastle owner ashley holds an eight per cent stake in rangers and loaned the club Â£ 5m however , he hopes to have talks with ashley once a wider review of existing commercial deals with sports direct â who own 75 per cent of the club âs retail subsidiary â is complete
â we âve had no discussions with ashley or sports direct so far but , as we have said before , we are happy to engage with them and feel we should do , â paul murray told rangers tv
â ashley does have the right to nominate two board members
interim chairman paul murray ( left ) will have discussions with ashley about his involvement at ibrox â i think , as dave king was saying , one of the big information - gathering exercises was to look at the whole relationship between sports direct and the club
i think once we have done that we will sit down , hopefully with sports direct and ashley , and try and agree a way forward
