american explorer morde claimed to have found the lost city in 1940 the headline in the new york times was tantalisingly mysterious : â city of the monkey god is believed located : expedition reports success in honduran exploration â
the date was july 12 , 1940 , and american explorer morde had just emerged from the darkest jungles of central america with an incredible story about what he âd found there
morde , a real - life indiana jones who later became a wartime american spy , had been recruited by the founder of new york âs prestigious museum of the american indian to try to find a mythical lost â city of the monkey god â dripping in gold that had been founded by a mysterious civilisation as great as the aztecs and the mayans
adventurers had been searching for city of the monkey god for centuries , ever since spanish conquistador and explorer hernando cortes conquered central america in the early 16th century and heard rumours of its riches
but it remained hidden for hundreds of years until morde insisted he had found it deep in the rain forests of mosquitia , more than 32,000 square miles of hellishly inhospitable wilderness in honduran and nicaragua
he described how , armed only with a revolver and a machete , he and a companion named lawrence brown had spent four months hacking their way through â almost inaccessible â jungle , swamps , rivers and mountains before coming upon a hidden valley that contained the remains of a white - stoned , walled city
morde said that on his own brief visit he had himself seen a disturbing rite in which local natives ritually slaughtered and ate monkeys in a twisted hangover from the cult
to back his astonishing claims , morde â who was only 29 but had already sailed around the world five times â brought back several thousand artefacts to central america such as stone utensils and tiny carved monkey masks
a team of american and honduran archaeologists have announced that they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the city of the monkey god , in a crater - shaped rainforest valley he never revealed the precise location of the ruined city for fear it would be looted before he could go back
generations of adventurers plunged into the jungle to search for the city , and experts dismissed morde âs discovery as a self - promoting fantasy
a team of american and honduran archaeologists have just returned from mosquitia
they have announced that â like morde â they have discovered the remains of what they believe to be the city of the monkey god , in a crater - shaped rainforest valley encircled by steep mountains
the team also discovered a breathtaking collection of stone sculptures that had lain untouched since the city was abandoned
but the honduran monkey monkey god is more menacing it showed ruins that stretched for more than a mile along a river through the valley
the remote , rugged area is a major cocaine smuggling route and the scientists , who were ferried to the site by helicopter , were accompanied by honduran special forces and former members of britain âs sas
the ancient culture that created the city , say the scientists , is so little known that it does nât even have a proper name â although morde called its people the chorotegans
he was just one of many men to search for the ruins after the aviator charles lindbergh reportedly claimed that he saw the expansive white remains of an â amazing ancient metropolis â when he flew over the region in 1927
he found nothing except dark rumours that the natives were â devil worshippers â who spoke of a lost â city of the monkey god â
morde was the leader of mr heye âs third expedition and , as he explained later , after months of starvation , sickness and exhaustion , they were about to give up when he saw something from the top of a small cliff
the jungle - choked city walls originally would have risen , he estimated , to 30ft and on almost everything he found , said morde , was carved the likeness of a monkey
locals believed apes from the jungle had stolen virgins from their villages to produce mongrel offspring as to what had been sacrificed , morde and ethnologists he consulted were convinced the people had practised a barbaric tradition that was later adopted by the warlike aztecs to the north in mexico
one night morde watched a group of natives perform a morbid ritual dance in which each of them brandished a spear on which were impaled three spider monkeys
adventurers had been searching for city of the monkey god for centuries , ever since spanish conquistador and explorer hernando cortes conquered central america in the early 16th century and heard rumours of it to his fingertips he had fixed the fangs of huge alligators
and if the city of the monkey god really is cursed , as the natives had warned morde , he may have belatedly paid the price
