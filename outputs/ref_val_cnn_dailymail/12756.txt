moscow four days after he was gunned down by an unknown assailant in the heart of moscow , former russia deputy prime minister and outspoken kremlin critic nemtsov was laid to rest tuesday in a ceremony attended by hundreds of mourners
his coffin was lowered into the ground at the troyekurovskoe cemetery before family , friends and dignitaries , after being carried in procession through moscow
earlier , a stream of people took part in a somber memorial service at the sakharov center in moscow
mikhail kasyanov , a former prime minister under president putin who is now a leading opposition figure and worked closely with nemtsov , was among the mourners to speak at the service
he said he believed nemtsov , known for his outspoken views , was killed out of revenge for his politics
though politically marginalized in recent years , nemtsov was one of putin 's most vocal critics , and many suspect the kremlin of either direct or indirect involvement
no one has yet been arrested and authorities have put forward a number of theories , including that the murder was an act of " provocation " intended to destabilize russia , that it was connected to the conflict in ukraine , that islamist extremists were involved or that it was linked to nemtsov 's international business affairs
the investigative committee said in a statement on its website tuesday that " all scenarios " are being considered and that it is taking all necessary steps
the memorial service was hosted by pavel sheremet , a russia journalist known for leaving a russia state tv channel in protest at the kremlin 's current policies on ukraine
russia economist yevgeny yasin , who served as economy minister between 1994 and 1997 and is now an academic , said : " nemtsov always said everything that others were afraid to say
" evgeniya albats , editor - in - chief of the new times magazine , described nemtsov in a speech as an amazing friend and a fearless politician
" foreign dignitaries included u.s. ambassador to russia john tefft , who said nemtsov would be remembered as a russia patriot , and former uk prime minister major
major told cnn : " it 's clearly a very sad day for russia , it 's a very sad day for nemtsov ' family , and i 'm personally extremely saddened by what has happened
duritskaya -- the only known witness to the shooting -- left moscow for kiev late on monday
she had been staying at the apartment of an aide to nemtsov under constant police guard
her mother , inna duritskaya , told cnn on monday that her daughter faces constant psychological pressure from moscow authorities and fears she will be implicated in his death
the investigative committee said duritskaya was not detained while in moscow and that she was offered witness protection , which she turned down
" lucas , a senior editor for the economist and a senior vice president at the center for european policy analysis , told cnn that the manner of nemtsov 's death was highly suspicious
" if it was some random , ragtag extremist militia from eastern ukraine killing him , i doubt they would 've been able to do it with such precision in the heart of moscow
some of nemtsov 's supporters accuse the kremlin , if not of direct involvement , of creating an atmosphere of hatred which fostered the killing
not everyone who hoped to attend nemtsov 's funeral has been able to do so
thousands of nemtsov supporters gathered sunday in moscow to mourn the death of the 55 - year - old , who was deputy prime minister during president boris yeltsin 's administration in the 1990s
the event took place the same day nemtsov was supposed to lead a rally in moscow decrying russia 's policies on ukraine
