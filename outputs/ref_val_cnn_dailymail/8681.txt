then , shortly after the midterm elections , she , president obama and michelle obama had clinton in for a meeting and reportedly told her in no uncertain words that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president
jarrett has reportedly been speaking to martin oâmalley ( above ) , the former governor of maryland , about running in 2016 she has also reportedly reached out to senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts about entering the primary klein , the author of blood feud : the clintons vs. the obamas , also spoke to a friend of the clintons , who told him that bill said ; ' my contacts and friends in newspapers and tv tell me that they âve been contacted by the white house and offered all kinds of negative stories about us
