earlier this month , molaverdi , iran 's vice president for women and family affairs , led an official delegation to the united nations in new york to attend the 59th session of the commission on the status of women
" molaverdi described the significant progress iran women have made in education and science , citing unilateral economic sanctions and violence against women as factors that have impeded the full realization of women 's rights
on the day she delivered her speech , amnesty released a report raising concerns about the possible passage of two bills before iran 's parliament that would further restrict women 's rights
the proposed passage of more restrictive legislation in the name of protecting the family is just the latest step in the rollback on women 's rights in recent years
activists and journalists rightly responded by highlighting the many violations of women 's rights in iran , and called out molaverdi for failing to present an accurate and complete picture of the challenges that iran women face
yet there was little acknowledgment by critics of the behind - the - scenes struggle that molaverdi , who is often an outspoken critic of regressive measures restricting women 's rights at home , and many others are waging every day as they try to carve out much - needed space for iran 's beleaguered rights activists
just two days before the united nations session , iran 's conservative kayhan daily , thought to be close to the office of supreme leader ayatollah khamenei , published an article that showed just what iran 's women 's rights activists are up against
what 's striking about kayhan 's attack is that iran 's powerful security and intelligence apparatus has for years acted to repress independent groups , including women 's rights activists
but those hostile to women 's rights in iran remain unrelenting
yet kayhan 's attack also reflects the resilience and adaptability of women 's groups in iran as they continue to challenge the state 's monopoly on the women 's rights narrative
