wisconsin gov. walker tops likely republicans voters ' 2016 lists for second week in row
a handful of flubs and a flip - flop that were heavily covered by the media do n't seem to have slowed down the second - term governor 's momentum in the invisible presidential primary , and in a national quinnipiac poll released on thursday walker came in first with 18 percent
former florida gov. jeb bush , previously considered the republicans front - runner , was right behind him at 16 percent

walker did n't win the cpac straw poll , but he has topped national 2016 polls for the last two weeks just two weeks ago it was jeb bush who was leading walker by an average of two points in early primary states
retired neurosurgeon carson , who earlier this week became the first republicans to launch a presidential exploratory committee , made a surprise second showing in that poll , taking 18 percent of the vote , as jeb bush slipped to third place
this week jeb bush was back on walker 's heels , though , as the wisconsin governor took flak over comments he made about president obama 's patriotism and religion , protesters in his state and illegal immigration
as pollsters for quinnipiac began their survey , walker was asked by the the associated press if believes that obama loves his country
jeb bush , previously considered the republicans front - runner , was right behind walker in this week 's presidential survey , taking 16 percent to walker 's 18 percent from there , his week did n't get much better
' still , other republicans whose names were tested by quinnipiac attracted less than half as much support as walker did in the recent poll
carson took 7 percent of the mock vote , and a trio of senators who are expected to run - paul of kentucky , ted cruz of texas and marco rubio of florida - received between five and six percent of republicans ' support
paul 's showings in surveys throughout the last month have n't been as strong as some of his likely competitors ' , walker and jeb bush included , but at cpac it was the freshman lawmaker who claimed victory as his team showed off its organizing prowess and secured him his third straw poll win in three years
