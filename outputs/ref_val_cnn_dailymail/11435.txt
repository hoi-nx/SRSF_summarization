drilling has begun beneath a german city by a team of indiana jones pensioners who believe they are on the trail of the fabled amber room of the tsars
the oaps treasure hunters are digging beneath the streets of the old industrial city of wuppertal
the amber room - valued at around Â£ 250million in today 's money - was looted from the palace of peter the great in russia by invading germany troops in 1941
it is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from second world war never to be found and has captivated treasure hunters ever since it was first plundered
but karl-heinz , 68 , and his bowling club pals , say they have proof it was entombed by the nazis beneath the streets of wuppertal
it is here , said karl-heinz , that he has received information that the crates arrived from koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden
he said : ' erich koch , the germany gauleiter of prussian who died in a polish prison in 1986 , came from wuppertal
' as the red army closed in on koenigsberg , he ordered the treasure to be packed up and brought back to his hometown
' in search of lost treasure : a group of bowling club friends say they have proof the amber room was entombed by the nazis beneath wuppertal following the scent : the group claim to have received information that the crates arrived from koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden in the german city of wuppertal opulent : a complete restoration of the amber room in the catherine palace of tsarskoye selo near st petersburg , the original of which was plundered by the nazis in second world war , but has since disappeared the Â£ 250million room , consisting of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin , took ten years to complete
plundered : the remains of the amber room after it was seized by the nazis , who packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to germany , where they vanished never to be seen again stripped bare : some say the panels were destroyed by russia artillery fire on the prussian city of koenigsberg , while others claim they were dumped in an alpine lake by the ss in the closing days of the war destroyed : peter the great received the room as a gift from the king of prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital , st petersburg
here it is seen before restoriation the amber room consists of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin , took ten years to complete and is valued at some Â£ 250million in today 's money
peter the great received the room as a gift from the king of prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital , st petersburg
in 1941 , the approaching germany army surrounded the city , then known by its russia name of st petersburg
they packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to germany , where they vanished
norman scott , the founder of global explorations , said he had a witness who he says specifically counted 27 crates going to the waters of the lake in april 1945 , one month before the capitulation of germany
paperwork from the reich main security office - the reich main security office of the ss in wartime - shows the amber room was packed into precisely 27 crates before it was taken away by the german from russia
but the lake has yielded little since second world war , except for forged Â£ 5 notes which were printed by the nazis and intended to cause chaos for the british economy
in 2011 , a book published in germany claimed the room lies hidden in old mine workings in a forest in east germany
' the puzzle of poppen wood ' by ulbrich unleashed a fresh wave of treasure hunters who arrived at weekends with shovels , metals detectors and vast reserves of optimism to scour for the artwork
casualties of war : inhabitants of st petersburg ( now st petersburg ) flee after a german bomb attack in the winter of 1941 when the nazis seized the amber room during their assault on the city the catherine palace in st petersburg ( as seen in 2010 ) where the amber room is housed ulbrich interviewed foresters , policemen , miners and old nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near zwickau
then he found details of a clandestine shipment from the city of koenigsberg - now kaliningrad and part of russia but in 1945 the main city of germany 's province of prussian - which was the last known storage place of the amber room before it fell to the red army
' like no other place in germany this wild canyon has ignited the fantasies of an international league of conspiracy theorists and treasure hunters , ' wrote der spiegel , germany 's top news magazine
at weekends authorities play cat - and - mouse with the treasure hunters who enter the sealed - off area illegally in ones and twos - and sometimes in mini-bus groups - armed with metal detectors and a belief in the stories
