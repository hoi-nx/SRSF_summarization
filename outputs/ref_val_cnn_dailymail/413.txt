in the second half at murrayfield , vern cotter âs men lost the plot rather than doing the basics right and there did not seem to be anyone giving direction in the last 20 minutes
it is an inexperienced side and we saw that naivety in spades on saturday
scotland 's dismal six nations campaign ended with a 40 - 10 thrashing by ireland at murrayfield scotland should not concede 40 points at home and lose by a margin of 30 points to ireland
a championship that promised so much has , ultimately , delivered very little and scotland âs dismal run in the six nations continues
scotland 's huge loss on saturday was their fifth in the tournament and they finished bottom of the table i thought wales would rack up a load of points against italy but they only did this in a devastating second - half display
as that game was drawing to a close , with wales 28 points better off than ireland and looking like scoring again , it appeared that it was game over and wales would win the six nations
how wrong i was ! i felt it was a perfect day for scotland to really show what they were all about because there was no pressure on them whatsoever and they could just go out and play with total freedom
ireland were crowned six nations winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge england and wales both england and ireland had targets they knew they had to win by to have a chance of lifting the six nations trophy
england did adopt this approach and it ultimately cost them but ireland were able to operate a normal game plan , mainly because of how scotland were playing
it was an exciting first half where ireland dominated the early stages but scotland hung in and eventually played some really good rugby that led to finn russell âs try
england beat france 55 - 35 at twickenham but it was n't enough to overhaul ireland wales had earlier moved into pole position when they beat italy 61 - 20 in rome with that thumping victory , ireland set england a target of 26 points that they had to win by to snatch the trophy
when the dust settled , ireland were crowned six nations champions but huge credit goes to england , wales and france for their contribution to an incredible day
