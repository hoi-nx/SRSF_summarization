this was just one example of the many types of goal sinclair is capable of and a small glimpse into the buzz around a 18 - year - old coaches at anfield believe can become the next raheem sterling
sinclair already holds the distinction of being the youngest player to turn out for liverpool , making his senior debut with a nine - minute cameo in a league cup tie at west brom in september 2012
although that remains sinclair 's one and only senior outing , he has been making great strides at youth team and under 21 level

at 5ft 8in , sinclair wo n't win a great deal in their air but he has tricky feet and good acceleration too , so he fits in with the fluid passing game the liverpool academy try to foster
and the signs look promising that sinclair will be the next bright youngster to come through liverpool 's academy ranks .
