tennessee prosecutors have made sterilization of women part of plea negotiations so many times in the past five years that the district attorney has banned his staff from offering that as an option
prosecutors in nashville have used the invasive surgery as a bargaining chip at least four times in the past five years
davidson county district attorney glenn funk , a former defense attorney who took over the office in september , has ordered lawyers in his office not to seek sterilization by defendants
' it is now policy that sterilization will never be a condition of deal - making in the district attorney 's office
' the bottom line is the government ca n't be ordering a forced sterilization
her defense attorney said the prosecutor assigned to the case would n't go forward with a plea deal to keep the woman out of prison unless she had the surgery
defense attorneys say there have been at least three similar cases in the past five years
103,892 adults in davidson county with mental illness from 2010 - 12
nearly 20 per cent of the about 1,700 jail inmates have a mental health issue , according to the davidson county 's sheriff 's office
forced sterilization came up in a different way in california last year , when governor jerry brown signed a bill that banned state prisons from forcing female inmates to be sterilized
the most recent nashville case involved jasmine randers , 36 , who had been under court supervision for mental illness when she left her home state of minnesota
she gave birth in west memphis , arkansas , then fled a homeless shelter to come to nashville , said her attorney , assistant public defender harcombe
the assistant district attorney who worked the case , holmgren , was once a senior attorney with the national center for prosecution of child abuse and serves on the international advisory board of the national center for shaken baby syndrome
when holmgren insisted randers undergo sterilization to avoid prison , harcombe complained
the district attorney took over the case , and jasmine randers was not sterilized
her defense attorney said the prosecutor would n't go forward with a plea deal unless she was sterilized harcombe said holmgren previously asked that another client agree to be sterilized in order to get a plea deal
nashville defense attorney searcy said holmgren asked that two of her clients who gave birth to children who tested positive for drugs undergo sterilization
assistant public defender joan lawson said she also had been involved in cases in which a prosecutor had put sterilization on the table
