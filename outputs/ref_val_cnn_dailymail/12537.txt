six months ago this week omar received a panicked phone call from his friend and fellow student
his friend is one of 43 students who were subjected to enforced disappearance in september of 2014
as the days and weeks passed , the mexican authorities stalled and obfuscated
despite worldwide attention on the issue , they have , for months , failed to properly investigate all lines of the case , especially the worrying allegations of complicity by armed forces
there , in the college hall , surrounded by murals of mexican 's revolutionary leaders , i met the families of the disappeared students
for the past six months , mothers , fathers , sisters and brothers , as well as other relatives and community members , have been campaigning relentlessly , demanding answers from the authorities about what happened to their loved ones
mothers and fathers spoke of counting the seconds since they last saw their sons , and expressed frustration at how they and their boys have been portrayed as troublemakers by the authorities and the media
the past months have been a roller - coaster for these families , and all of us who support and accompany their struggles
but a constant factor has been the mexican government 's failure to respond effectively and address these grave human rights violations
a prime example of this is how , on november 7 , 2014 , the authorities announced that human remains had been uncovered in a rubbish dump and a nearby river in cocula , and the then - attorney general jesãºs murillo karam announced weeks later that he was prepared to close the case
however , only one of the missing students has been identified through dna tests
these 43 mothers and fathers have decided they can not accept the silence or half - answers they have been given by the government , instead they are demanding the truth
the tragic reality is that these 43 students were only the most recent we have heard of in a long line of the disappeared
according to official figures , 24,748 people have disappeared or gone missing in mexican since 2007 , and almost half of them during the current administration of president peã±a nieto
in february , the u.n. ' committee on enforced disappearances produced recommendations on how to deal with disappearances in mexican
just hours after the u.n. committee published its conclusions and recommendations , the mexican government disregarded them
on march 3 , mexican appointed arely gã³mez gonzã¡lez as the new federal attorney general
however , her recent statements -- that the disappearance of the 43 students is an " isolated case " and that there is no confirmation of grave human rights violations in this case -- are shocking
