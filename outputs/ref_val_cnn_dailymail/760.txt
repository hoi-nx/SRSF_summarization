a mexican mafia hit man convicted of beating and strangling a san antonio woman because she did n't pay the gang 's 10 per cent tax on her illegal drug sales was executed wednesday evening
the injection of vasquez with a lethal dose of pentobarbital leaves texas with enough of the powerful sedative to carry out only one more execution
vasquez was the fourth texas inmate put to death this year , and at least six are scheduled for execution in the coming weeks
texas prison officials , like those in other death penalty states , have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use
vasquez , in a final statement , told his family and friends he loved them and thanked ' the lord for his kind mercy , faithfulness and unconditional love
' ' in jesus ' name i pray , ' he said , then told the warden : ' i 'm ready
' he took three deep breaths , then began snoring loudly
vasquez 's lawyers filed no late appeals to delay his execution for the 1998 slaying of 51 - year - old ybarra
evidence at vasquez 's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51 - year - old ybarra for ignoring the mexican mafia 's 10 per cent street tax on drugs â known as a ' dime
' ' i 'm sure she was told if you 're selling , you 've got to pay the tax , ' said mary green , an assistant bexar county district attorney who prosecuted vasquez
' after a night of drinking and drugs at a run - down san antonio motel , vasquez and two companions put on bandannas on their facesbarged into the nearby room of ybarra and her boyfriend , bazan , early on march 19 , 1998 , according to evidence presented at his trial
bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw ybarra being beaten , heard vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle ybarra
one of them , johnny joe cruz , took a plea deal that carried a seven - year sentence and testified against vasquez
the third man charged , oligario lujan , is serving a 35 - year prison term
court records show the three were carrying out orders from mexican mafia boss rene munoz , who spent years on the texas department of public safety 's 10 most wanted list until his arrest in 2012
the lethal injection of vasquez on wednesday evening at huntsville prison in texas would leave t officials in the nation 's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply ' i recall he was an extremely violent individual
