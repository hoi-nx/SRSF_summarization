but photographer lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out - of - date bread and cheese in a different way
using macroscopic photography techniques , he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread
using macroscopic photography , russian photographer lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach - churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread ( grab shown ) the multicellular filaments slowly spread across the petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet
he has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance
mr lariontsev , a photographer based in russian who posted the video on youtube , said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film
the fungi cladosporium , which usually grows on dead plant material , are also shown growing their brown and black branches , and the soil - based fungi trichoderma fungi from the group of cladosporium , which usually grows on dead plant material , are also shown growing their brown and black branches , along with the soil - based fungi trichoderma
mr lariontsev set up the petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days
the result is a rather stomach - churning but strangely captivating four - minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before
' many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow
mr lariontsev set up the petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days it sounds more like the recipe for a good pasta sauce , but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf - life of cheese from seafood , rosemary and oregano
