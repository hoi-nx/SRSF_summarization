the rfu 's chief executive , ritchie , has ignited a storm of debate in this country and attracted global attention â for saying england 's inability to win the six nations is ' unacceptable '
after a fourth consecutive second place in the championship , the man in charge of the union â and national coach stuart lancaster 's boss â delivered a forthright verdict about the need to aim higher
among those objecting to his views was sir clive woodward , who argued passionately in these pages that the timing was wrong and that ritchie had scored a ' massive own goal '

imagine if ritchie had declared that he found the outcome â another campaign without silverware â to be perfectly acceptable
instead , he made it plain that he and the rfu are not about to settle for title near - misses

earlier this season , ritchie authorised the agreement of new six - year contracts for lancaster and his three assistants , andy farrell , graham rowntree and mike catt

should his young coaching team and their squad fall short of the country 's expectations , the chief executive 's head will be above the parapet , so it is only right that he can voice his hopes and fears from time to time
ritchie does n't need reminding that the rfu are the richest union in the world and england have the greatest depths of playing reserves
with that in mind , to have won just one six nations title since the world cup triumph of 2003 is absolutely unacceptable
ireland , meanwhile , are heading to the world cup with back - to - back six nations titles so it is not arrogance for the english to bemoan a paucity of championship successes
in 2012 , scottish rugby chief executive mark dodson outlined a strategic plan which included the target of winning a grand slam by 2016 â and also the world cup
ritchie is not guilty of arrogance for demanding that england win trophies
