a lesbian couple have spent Â£ 13,000 having danish semen and fertility treatment shipped to their british home so their child will look like a viking
kelly and anna , both 34 , have chosen to buy sperm from danish because they want their child to have blonde hair and blue eyes and because british sperm ' does n't cut the mustard '
the married couple , from camberley , surrey , used kelly 's eggs for the insemination after receiving Â£ 300 - a - time vials of danish sperm in the post and later successfully conceived via ivf
anna and kelly cooke ( right ) , from surrey , have chosen to buy sperm from danish because they want their child to have blonde hair and blue eyes just like them and because british sperm ' does n't cut the mustard ' the married couple used kelly 's eggs for the insemination after receiving Â£ 300 - a - time vials of danish sperm in the post
' british sperm is more than double the price and just does n't cut the mustard
' the pair , who got legally married in february , ordered their danish semen from cryos international - the world 's largest sperm bank which has a motto of : â congratulations , it âs a viking â
however , after inseminating anna with four vials of danish sperm , she had still not fallen pregnant so they forked out Â£ 5,000 for a round of ivf treatment
the pair are delighted with the results of ivf anna shows of her baby bump ( left ) while partner kelly ( centre ) and a friend look on
they said they are ' so pleased ' they finally have a baby on the way that worked but she miscarried , so they spent another Â£ 5,000 on ivf and have so far bought ten vials of dutch sperm
anna , a chef , who dyes her hair brown , said : ' we are just so pleased that after spending Â£ 13,000 we finally have a little one on the way
' the couple are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their little one , but have chosen to keep the sex a secret for now kelly and anna are among thousands of british women who are flocking to danish to buy foreign sperm danish sperm now accounts for a third of the total used by british fertility clinics
according to dr pacey , a fertility expert at the university of sheffield , people prefer going abroad because of a lack of british sperm donors
laura witjens , ceo of the national gamete donation trust , said : ' it 's much easier for a british clinic to order sperm from danish which is fed - exed the next day than to try and recruit their own donors and all the hassle that goes with them
' choice : danish 's sperm banks , among them cryos , deploy excellent customer service to help boost sales dr pacey added : ' danish is geographically close to the british
with a british sperm donor , you get a number and choice of hair colour , while danish sperm donors offer detail you can imagine including family background , job description , education and pictures of the man as a baby or child
but a viking baby does n't come cheap , with danish sperm bought over the internet and delivered to an address in british costing Â£ 460 .
