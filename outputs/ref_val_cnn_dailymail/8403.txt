the budget has failed to provide a conservative bounce â but if the economy stays on track until the election , cameron ( pictured ) could still win a total of 13 per cent of labour supporters opted for cameron , but only 2 per cent of tories choose miliband
but the poll suggests that his strategy , which relies on a late pro-tory swing by voters worried that labour will wreck the recovery , could yet work
labour is four points ahead of the conservatives , but would be out of sight by now if the party had a better leader than miliband , the poll shows a total of 16 per cent of non-tory voters say they could still change their mind and vote conservative if the economy stays on track
