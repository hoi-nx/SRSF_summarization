a member of the penn state fraternity has defended the disturbing facebook posts of unconscious female students that led to the fraternity 's suspension for a year
in an interview , the anonymous member of kappa delta rho described the group as ' satirical ' and accused the media of trying to ruin his fellow frat brothers ' lives and reputations
this came the same day that screenshots emerged of some of the facebook comments under posts made to a private group run by members of kappa delta rho , that included nude images of women , some of whom had passed out drunk
the screenshots show members of the group had commented referring to the women as ' sloots ' , saying ' i banged her lol ' , and then : ' lol delete those or we will be on cnn in a week '
there were 144 members of the invite - only facebook page
he attempted to justify the existence of the group as ' satire ' , that ' everyone ' does it , and laid a lot of blame on the media , while calling for a return to ' higher standards of morality ' and referring to the incident as ' minor '
in his statement he accused the media of attempting to ' ruin people 's lives and unjustly ruin reputations ' and was challenged in the interview that posting pictures of nude , unconscious women or intimate messages could ruin their lives or their reputations
' how would it do so when it 's kept within the entirely , well , it 's supposed to be an entirely private group of 144 people ? ' he responded
asked if that puts a lot of trust in 144 people when any one of them could repost a picture publicly , he said : ' but nobody except the one kid who snitched out this group did that â¦ it just does n't work that way
' he likened the group to totalfratmove.com and ' raunchy ' snapchats that ' people send all the time '
members of penn state 's kappa delta rho fraternity ( pictured ) posted photos to a facebook page that showed unconscious nude female students asked why the group was relaunched , the group member said that its primary use was for communication within the fraternity about community service and social events
police learned of the page when a former member of kappa delta rho , but still a member of the facebook group , came to them and began acting as an informant
the informant provided multiple print outs to police and said when asked about one of the pictures : ' this is the type of stuff that happens at kappa delta rho
' police are working with the office of student conduct and penn state 's inter-fraternity council , in their investigation
possible charges include invasion of privacy and harassment , though police are not ruling out other options
