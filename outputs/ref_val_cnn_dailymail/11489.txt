resplendent in a shimmering silk gown by bruce oldfield and her trademark pearl choker , the duchess of cornwall cut a glamorous figure as she arrived on the arm of prince charles
charles and camilla are now on the third day of a four - day state visit that has been described as ' your grandfather 's royal visit ' by the local washington post
new name : the royal couple have been re-christened ' chacam ' by the local media warm welcome : both charles and camilla have enjoyed a rapturous reception from local people in a piece headlined , ' camilla and charles do nât get the willkat [ william and kate ] treatment , but it âs still royal ' , the paper went on to contrast the ' high - volume excitement worthy of boy - band ' that greeted the duke of cambridge with the quieter one offered to his father
looking around : charles and camilla spent their first full day touring washington d.c. star of the show : camilla , who is clearly been enjoying the tour , has enjoyed a particularly warm welcome smile ! yesterday , the duchess of cornwall obligingly posed for a selfie outside the lincoln memorial cheering for charles : local teenagers wait for the royal couple to emerge from the lincoln memorial ' their trip to washington d.c. and kentucky will showcase the best of the transatlantic relationship - promoting democratic values , combating climate change , preserving the natural environment , creating opportunities for the next generation - and provide yet another reminder of the essential role the royal family play in keeping that relationship special
today 's schedule , which , if yesterday is any indication , will also be covered rather breathlessly by the local press , will see ' chacam ' visit president lincoln 's cottage in washington d.c. later , the royal couple will be whisked to the white house where they will meet president obama in the oval office for the second time since he took office
president obama is the sixth american president to entertain charles , who has visited the united states on 23 separate occasions , during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last
