the christian couple behind a mobile phone app which censors swear words from ebooks have removed all titles from their online catalogue following backlash from authors
clean reader replaces certain words that might be deemed r - rated with more friendly alternatives , but authors accused it of ' suppression ' and selling ' vandalised ' books
a statement from the firm this week said it was removing the titles after finding that ' many authors do not want their books being sold in connection with clean reader '
after downloading the app , users are able to browse a variety of books , and when opened , can switch between â clean â , â cleaner â or â squeaky clean â settings
the lowest setting only blocks â major swear words , â according to clean reader , which includes â the f - word â
â the â cleaner â setting blocks slightly more words , while the highest setting â is the most restrictive setting and will block the most profanity from a book including some hurtful racial terms
â in the books , deleted words are covered up with a grey box , removing them from view
a statement from the society of authors , published yesterday , reads : ' authors have expressed confusion on social media as they have not been consulted on their works ' inclusion in clean reader 's library , and there appears to be no easy way to opt - out
' chocolat author , joanne harris led the opposition to clean reader , writing a blog post entitled : ' why i âm saying â f * * * you â to clean reader '
writing in a subsequent post after it was announced the titles were being removed from the app , she added : ' though i âm delighted that clean reader are no longer selling vandalized books , they are still distributing the app , and although this is certainly a victory for books , i would nât start cheering just yet
' in the books , deleted words are covered up with a grey box , removing them from view.if users click a green dot in the middle of the box , the app will suggest alternative words that the can be used instead users can pick between ' clean ' , ' cleaner ' and ' squeaky clean '
my book , my rules , and that includes my words
' a common theme in all of it is that many authors do not want their books being sold in connection with clean reader
