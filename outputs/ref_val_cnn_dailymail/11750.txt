beyond the tall , white walls of los angeles 's most historic hotel - built in the twenties - is the murmur of hollywood , where on sunday eddie redmayne 's oscars dreams came true
in the hotel restaurant , my fish comes with a sprinkling of hollywood glamour - eva longoria and richard gere are dining
glamour at every turn : tourists can gain a close glimpse of the hollywood sign with via a ranch ride no one bats an eyelid , except me
running into the odd a-lister - or desperate housewife - is business as usual in hollywood , particularly in awards season

the following evening , i dodge the paparazzi waiting for jessica alba outside craig 's restaurant in hollywood
the next morning , while crowds gather at a glossy shopping complex for a mediocre view of the hollywood sign , i venture deep into the surrounding hills to get the ultimate glimpse
marilyn is saddled up and waiting at sunset ranch ahead of a morning 's horse riding in the hollywood hills

not just as the birthplace of the oscars - the first ceremony took place in the blossom ballroom in 1929 - but for the showbiz royalty that have stayed and played here
