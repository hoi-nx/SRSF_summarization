the world is finally in the grip of a long - awaited el niã±o event that could alter global weather patterns - but the phenomenon is far weaker than expected
scientists have announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central pacific ocean and have started to alter wind patterns
the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance el niã±o will continue through the summer
the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration and atmosopheric administration has detected warmer than average water surface temperatures around the equator of the pacific ocean ( shown above ) which indicates the arrival of el niã±o however , they say that the el niã±o conditions are currently ' extremely weak ' and come at a time of the year when the influence of el niã±o on weather patterns usually declines
this means that while el niã±o conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer , it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring
el niã±o is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the pacific ocean around the equator
however , in an el niã±o , the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east
but as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents , this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer , meaning the el niã±o grows
some meteorologists , however , have warned that this el niã±o could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the pacific ocean called the pdo ( pdo )
the pdo reached record levels in december last year and january this year , and should it stay strong , it may combine with el niã±o to increase global temperatures
mike halpert , deputy director of us national oceanic and atmospheric administration 's climate prediction centre , said : ' based on the persistent observations of above - average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial pacific ocean and consistent pattern of sea level pressure , we can now say that el niã±o is here
' the arrival of this el niã±o is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year , but the conditions failed to materialise
it is the result of the el niã±o , which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the pacific ocean
when the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months , the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration officially classes it as el niã±o conditions
the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration said that last week the sea temperature across much of the equatorial pacific ocean has been above average
the above diagram shows the impacts of a typical el niã±o on seasonal temperatures around the world the above diagram shows how a typical el niã±o is expected to change seasonal rainfall around the world in a blog post on the onset of el niã±o , the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration said : ' at this time , these are extremely weak el niã±o conditions , during a time of year when the influence of el niã±o on weather patterns in north america or other locations outside of the tropics is weakening
' still , after months of hovering under the threshold , we can now say that el niã±o conditions have arrived
