but you can hardly blame pietersen for wanting to throw his lot in with surrey and score some first - class runs
now it âs up to pietersen to use it
pietersen has agreed to rejoin surrey as he looks to make an unlikely england comeback with graves and harrison coming in as ecb chairman and chief executive respectively , it âs reasonable to work on the basis that everyone starts with a clean slate
that âs how it works in other sports , so why not in cricket ? pietersen will have a great chance to excel in division two at an excellent club
the 35 - year - old will focus on the longer form of the game in a bid to force his way into ashes reckoning pietersen still wants to add to his 23 test centuries despite being axed by england last year people are worried about his book , but the main targets in those pages â andy flower and matt prior â are no longer in the england set - up
but if pietersen scores so many runs for surrey that graves and harrison think he âs irresistible , then everyone will just have to sit down and talk things through
yes , it would become tricky for downton and peter moores , who pietersen did nât rate highly in his first stint as england coach
the batsman , pictured playing in australia 's big bash , may change his indian premier league contract peter moores did n't see eye to eye with pietersen during his first spell as england head coach pietersen is the best batsman i âve seen for england and if he can get his mojo back playing for surrey then at least he âll have fulfilled the criterion that graves laid down
test cricket is what gets pietersen âs juices flowing
