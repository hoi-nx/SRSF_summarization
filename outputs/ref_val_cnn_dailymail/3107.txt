as the preparation of both horses has not been smooth â despite their trainers issuing upbeat bulletins â it might be worth opposing them with champagne fever ( cheltenham festival , 3.20 )
champagne fever , ridden by ruby walsh ( right ) wins the william hill supreme novices hurdle in 2013 racemail tipsters got off to a stunning start on the opening day
but for an agonising defeat in the arkle chase 12 months ago at this meeting , the eight - year - old would have an undefeated record in three starts at the cheltenham festival after successes in the bumper and supreme novices â hurdle
arabian revolution ( right ) ridden by jockey tony mccoy wins at sandown in january 2015 earlier on the card , don poli ( cheltenham festival , 2.05 ) has looked awesome in his two chase starts to date and is strongly fancied to lift the rsa chase
apache stronghold has gone on to boost that form with an accomplished defeat of valseur lido , and don poli has a great opportunity to follow up his triumph in a handicap hurdle at last year âs meeting
arabian revolution ( cheltenham festival , nap , 4.40 ) is a sporting selection to win one of the season âs fiercest handicaps as he looks to have plenty in his favour in the fred winter handicap hurdle
