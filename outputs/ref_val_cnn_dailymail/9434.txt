inhaling deeply , the bbc âs ex-royal correspondent tries cannabis as part of a tv experiment examining the effects of types of the drug on the brain
in another scene jennie bond , 64 , is seen giggling and talking about how much she loves eating grapes after experimenting with hash
the programme sees 22 volunteers including miss bond , presenter jon snow and former tory mp matthew parris take two sorts of cannabis â hash and high - strength skunk â plus a placebo
professor nutt , 63 , who was sacked as the government âs drugs tsar in 2009 for saying cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and nicotine , will appear as an expert , with university professor val curran
professor nutt âs charity drugscience contributed funding towards the channel 4 trial
she could be seen giggling with researchers at university where the six - month trial took place mary brett , chairman of campaign group cannabis skunk sense , said : â skunk is a dreadful drug and it is very irresponsible to have a show with such biased experts
â jon snow , 67 , who was given a brain scan after trying the drug , said : â i âve worked in war zones , but i âve never been as overwhelmingly frightened as i was when i was in the mri scanner after taking skunk
â the scientific experiment , which has been approved by the home office , is being documented to try and demonstrate the effects potent ' skunk ' cannabis has on the brain
ms jennie bond said the drug made her feel ' floaty ' in the footage , ms jennie bond can be seen discussing her love of red grapes after inhaling the potent cannabis but critics were concerned the programme would not show the long - term impact of cannabis use
fay watson , secretary general of europe against drugs , said : â placing someone into a mri scanner when they are under the influence may be useful to assess the immediate impacts of cannabis , but it âs not going to demonstrate the long - term harms people are most concerned about
â cannabis use is associated with a wide range of negative side - effects such as anxiety , psychotic episodes , depression , cancer , stroke , as well as iq decline in young people
â cannabis , the most widely used illegal drug in british , has been linked to long - term mental health problems including schizophrenia , and is known to cause anxiety and paranoia
skunk is a potent form of cannabis that now dominates 80 per cent of the british market
some believe it is far more addictive than other forms of cannabis and can provoke paranoid episodes , psychotic symptoms and memory loss
ms jennie bond ( pictured with camilla , duchess of cornwall ) worked as the bbc 's royal correspondent for 14 years broadcaster jon snow ( pictured ) also took part in the scientific experiment which was government - approved channel 4 said professor nutt , a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at imperial college london , and professor curran â are two of the world âs leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain â
a spokesman said the pair had â collaborated on this ethically approved six - month cannabis trial at university
â [ they ] will describe the chemicals in cannabis that are responsible for the effects seen in the brain
they will explain how they differ between the two forms of the drug , as well as looking at the risks and the potentially positive effects of cannabis
â the spokesman added : ' it is absolutely not the case that the programme or scientific trial encourage people to take cannabis or glamorise it â they are giving people the facts
' anyone seeing the video of jon snow taking " skunk " in the trial will understand the potentially negative effects of the drug
' mr jon snow said that smoking the more potent cannabis ' outstripped anything ' he had previously experienced jennie bond ( pictured ) took part in the experiment for c4 programme drugs live : cannabis on trial i 've been asked to do some pretty strange things in my time
but i 'm always up for a challenge , so when i was asked to take part in a drugs trial for channel 4 , i decided it would be both interesting and informative
the purpose of the trial was to show how skunk - the most common form of cannabis now sold on the streets - affects the brain and behaviour compared to weaker forms of cannabis
i was to be one of a number of volunteers to undergo the trial at university under the guidance of one of the world 's leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain , professor val curran
i smoked a bit of cannabis as a student at university
so the idea of taking skunk did n't frighten me and i was intrigued to see how it differed from the weaker cannabis i used to smoke
so was i stoned or just stupid ? i still do n't know - but i fear the latter ! the second trial , a week , later , followed the same pattern
when i arrived for my final trial , i was convinced i 'd had the placebo and the cannabis ... so this time it would be skunk
