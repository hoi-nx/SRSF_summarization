a new technique that involves folding the stomach into pleats is being tested as a potentially less risky form of weight - loss surgery
it involves no incisions , the entire procedure can be done via a tube passed down the throat and the patient can go home the same day
weight - loss surgery , also called bariatric surgery , is available on the nhs to those who are morbidly obese with a body mass index ( bmi ) of over 40 â or to those who have a bmi of 35 to 40 , but whose weight is causing a serious , obesity - related health complaint , such as type 2 diabetes
currently , the procedures most often performed involve using a gastric band that reduces the stomach size , so less food is needed to make you feel full , or a gastric bypass
this involves re-routing the stomach to join a lower section of the intestines , reducing the size of the stomach and bypassing part of the small intestine , cutting the amount of calories and nutrients absorbed
the new technique , called primary obesity surgery endolumenal , is less invasive and , researchers say , causes less post-operative pain , has reduced risk of infection and leaves no external scars
the surgeon works through a tube or endoscope , which goes down the throat into the stomach
the process is repeated , making several folds to shrink the stomach and prevent it expanding to accommodate food
most returned to work without bandages or signs of surgery within two to three days , unlike traditional bariatric surgery , where it can take weeks or months to resume normal activities
in a spanish study , most of the patients returned to work without bandages or any signs of having had the surgery within two to three days ( file image ) around 300 people are now taking part in a new trial to further test its efficacy at a number of centres in the u.s. â the treatment is already approved for uk use
