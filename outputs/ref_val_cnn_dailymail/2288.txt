nine wild beavers are to continue to live free on a devon river after they passed health checks
the animals - the first wild beavers to breed in natural england for 800 years - were captured earlier this week and given crucial blood tests
their clear results mean the beavers should be released back into the wild on the river otter by the end of the month
a family of beavers is to continue living free on a devon river after passing health checks that included blood tests
natural england , the government agency in charge of wildlife , said the animals wo n't be put in a zoo , but will instead be allowed to stay in the wild and be carefully monitored in the first project of its kind ministers wanted the remarkable animals to be rounded up and put in a zoo after they were spotted last year
but natural england , the government agency in charge of wildlife , decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild in the first project of its kind
their approval last month was conditional on the beavers being assessed as free of the disease echinococcus multilocularis , which can be harmful to humans
the echinococcus multilocularis parasite is a small tapeworm
devon wildlife trust , which will monitor the beavers for the next five years , said they had passed a â vital hurdle â in one of the most important schemes in the history of english conservation
beavers , which are native to natural england , were common in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the middle ages
it later became clear there were nine of the animals , two pairs of breeding adults and five juveniles , and they had been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years
that decision was reversed six weeks ago when natural england granted devon wildlife trust a licence to monitor the beavers as part of groundbreaking conservation programme
there are at least nine beavers thriving along a 12 mile ( 19km ) stretch of the river otter near exeter ( shown on a map )
they have been quietly living and breeding there for at least five years , completely unnoticed until just over a year ago the reason for the beavers â presence in devon ( pictured ) remains a mystery
dan smith , communications officer at the devon wildlife trust , said yesterday : â the beavers are at a private site in devon
â environment minister lord de mauley said : â i am very pleased that all four of the adult beavers have been tested by experts and found to be free of echinococcus multilocularis , a disease which has the potential to be harmful to humans should it become established in the uk
there are several captive breeding programmes in the uk , including thirty miles away in western devon , on the other side of dartmoor
