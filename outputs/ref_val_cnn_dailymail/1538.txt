scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans
a study of fossils of homo erectus , an extinct human ancestor , shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully
the above skeletons of homo erectus were reconstructed from fossils that the researchers used in their study this would have enabled homo erectus to become a proficient hunter , able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey
dr roach , an anthropologist at the george washington university in washington , said : ' the combination of inferiorly rotated , human - like shoulders with a tall , mobile waist and low humeral torsion , support homo erectus as the first known hominin possessing the full anatomical complex associated with proficient throwing
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across europe and asia 200,000 years ago - homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in africa 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach europe ' while direct evidence of early throwing behavior remains elusive , evidence for the intensification of hominin carnivory and hunting behavior dating back two million years is increasing
' in the study , which is published in the journal of human evolution , compared the shoulder and collar bone sizes with modern humans and other species
they also examined the throwing ability of boys and men from the daasanach tribes living around lake rukrana in north west kenya and south western ethiopia
daasanach boys use bent throwing sticks called ' shar ' to hunt small game and herd lifestock while adults will also hunt with spears
the researchers asked 27 daasanach to hurl throwing sticks as far as they could , measuring the speed with radar guns and the distance
they compared their throwing ability to the dimensions of their collarbones and the humerous bone
the researchers found that the daasanch were able to throw at speeds of up to 80mph ( 128km/h ) - comparable to skilled athletes
they were able to hurl their sticks more than 328ft ( 100 metres ) in many cases , with none throwing less than 196ft ( 60 metres )
by comparing the results to fossils of homo erectus , they conclude that this species of early human would have had similar throwing abilities
homo erectus , shown in the reconstruction on the left and the skull on the right , is an extinct ancestor of modern humans that may have shared may of our abilities to throw and hunt , according to the latest research it suggests that the ability to throw spears and other objects for hunting evolved long before our own species , homo sapiens , appeared on the planet
homo erectus could have been able to throw further than many modern athletes , according to the research tucking into meat for dinner helped early humans spread more quickly across the world and had a profound effect on human evolution , scientists say
the research compared 67 species of mammals , including humans , apes , mice and killer whales , and found a clear correlation between eating meat and earlier weaning
