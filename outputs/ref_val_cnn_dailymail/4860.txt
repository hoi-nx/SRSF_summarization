stepping into a different dining room for each decade , the robshaws - dad brandon and children miranda , 17 ; rosalind , 15 and fred 10 - lived through how menus have changed
writing in the independent , brandon said the family 's normal , 21st century diet was a ' fusion of the functional and the foodie ' with easy - to - cook recipes dominating week days and more ' ambitious ' dishes being tried at the weekend
bread and dripping for breakfast , cow - heel pie for dinner ... the robshaw family took on a brave culinary challenge to eat as a family would have in every decade from the 1950s to the 1990s

so , what was their reaction when they were plunged into the immediate post-war period , when rationing dominated the diets of the early 1950s ? brandon says the family felt ' hungry ' all of the time with ten - year - old fred finding it particularly hard to sate his sweet tooth without the biscuits and snacks that are readily available today
faced with an ' of - the - time ' dining room for each decade ; the 1960s kitchen had ' luminous sky - blue walls ' and ' radioactive yellow walls ' , while the 1970s saw a move towards open - plan dining , something which made the kitchen much more of a social hub for families

the rise of the tv dinner : the robshaw family , pictured above in their 1980s - style kitchen found the decade to be all about convenience , with gadgets aplenty helping them to make meals the arrival of multiple television sets per household in the eighties stifled mealtime communication however , with tv dinners - effectively a meal on a tray in front of the box - becoming commonplace
the family said there were highs and lows to each decade with particularly dismal offerings including the ' national loaf ' that was rationed out to families after world war ii the bread was filled out with potato starch and , according to brandon , was a one - way ticket to indigestion
highs included a vegan bean casserole , fresh from the seventies which was ' lipsmackingly good ' and a trip to famed restaurateur anton mosimann 's london eatery , where very eighties nouvelle cuisine and lashings of champagne were served
stepping back in time for a mary masterclass : baking supremo mary berry teaches the robshaws how to make a cake as it would have been done in the 1950s the fifties easily the starkest decade for dining in the last sixty years , the fall - out from world war ii meant that families were still using ration books for almost half of the 1950s
how a family might have started the day in the early 1950s , with bread - often the rationed ' national loaf ' - and left - over roasted meat fat aka ' dripping ' snacks that modern - day children take for granted were nowhere to be seen and hunger was an all - too - familar feeling
bread and dripping ( often left - over fat from the sunday roast ) , now largely consigned to the history books , was a reality at breakfast time
with no fridges except in the most west - heeled family homes , food was largely eaten fresh and shopping was a daily occurrence
gastronomically , the country began to breathe easier with rationing a distant memory and plenty of new - fangled ideas hitting the kitchen cupboards
the breakfast cereal , now an essential item on most britons families ' dining table in the mornings made their first appearance back in the 1960s curry but not as we 'd recognise it now : families began to get a taste for spicier food and vesta introduced an early ready meal in the shape of a beef curry the beginning of a tomato - based love affair : spaghetti bolognese arrived in the britons from our italians friends ... and has n't left britons dining tables since fridges became more commonplace , introducing the weekly shop to households
on the downside , families began to get their first taste of processed food as sugar , salt and preservatives began to enter the equation
a freezer added further longevity to food in the family home
a more healthier backlash was on its way though ... on the dinnerplate : takeaway pizza just like mama used to make : britons in the 1990s began to try their hand at making pasta at home ... cue lots of families buying pasta machines the nineties health concerns for the first time began to make people think twice when supermarket shopping
a trend towards ditching processed food in favour of organic produce saw people conscious of their ' five - a - day ' for the first time
compared to the stark rationing of the fifties , shopping was now all about variety with 10 types of apple , 20 types of bread laid before us
although lots of food still clocked up plenty of air miles to get to our kitchen table , there was an awareness that eating locally was important
