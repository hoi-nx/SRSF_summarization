at last , greaves has made it into tottenham âs hall of fame
it only took 11 years and 41 others - including steffen freund and paul allen - to come before the club âs greatest ever goalscorer , with 266 goals in 379 appearances , was rewarded
depending who you speak to , the long wait is down to greaves declining the offers , or the club not forthcoming with them
greaves ( left ) is the highest ever scorer for tottenham with 266 goals in 379 appearances greaves ( centre ) joined tottenham in 1961 and won the fa cup twice and the european cup winners cup greaves ( second right ) holds the european cup winners cup aloft after tottenham 's 1963 triumph greaves was signed for tottenham from ac milan by nicholson for Â£ 99,999 the truth lies somewhere in between , with greaves understood to have turned down informal invitations in the past but accepting , according to sources close to the former striker , their first formal request last week
despite claims to the contrary , greaves has been back to white hart lane on many occasions since he left the club in 1970
wherever he goes , he is constantly asked by tottenham fans why he is not recognised as one of their greatest by the club
â for all the fans who have asked me when i will be in the tottenham hotspur hall of fame , i am delighted that we now have a date , â greaves said upon the announcement on monday
â greaves , now 75 , joined tottenham in 1961 , signed by nicholson for Â£ 99,999 from ac milan to alleviate the burden of being the first Â£ 100,000 english player
greaves just likes watching games on the telly
â greaves ( right ) played for tottenham for nine years and is to be inducted into the hall of fame on may 13 greaves is also england 's fourth - highest scorer , netting 44 goals in 57 games for his country now 75 , greaves chooses not to attend football matches , preferring instead to enjoy them at home greaves also loved playing , and is still england âs fourth - highest scorer with 44 in 57 appearances , but he has not shunned tottenham matches , or those of any other club , with any malicious intent
â regardless of the rows or the disagreements or how he got there , when greaves is inducted on may 13 , he will finally be in tottenham âs hall of fame
