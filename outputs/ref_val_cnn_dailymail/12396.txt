but a year since the annexation of crimea , what does that mean for the west 's ability to deal with him regarding ukraine ? in february 2014 , " little green men " -- the ukraine term for professional soldiers wearing russia combat fatigues but no identifying insignia -- seized key installations and checkpoints around crimea
the russia president 's website reported the following exchange at a march 4 , 2014 , news conference : question : " the people who were blocking the ukraine army units in crimea were wearing uniforms that strongly resembled the russia army uniform
were those russia soldiers , russia military ? " putin : " why do n't you take a look at the post-soviet states ? there are many uniforms there that are similar
" question : " but were they russia soldiers or not ? " putin : " those were local self - defense units
" within weeks , putin admitted they were russia troops
at the same news conference , putin said he saw no possibility of crimea joining russia and said moscow would do nothing to " provoke " that
two weeks later , he presided as the russia parliament passed legislation annexing crimea
in a documentary shown on russia television last sunday , putin said he gave the order to take crimea on february 23 , 2014
take the 2010 new strategic arms reduction treaty , which limits united states and russia strategic forces to no more than 1,550 deployed strategic warheads on 700 deployed missiles and bombers
the russia might be able to cheat a little , but not in a way that would give them a militarily significant edge without the united states having time to react
russia effectively did nothing to implement the first minsk ceasefire , which was agreed to last september
the minsk ceasefire reached in february fared little better at the outset
russia forces backed those of the separatists attacking the ukraine town of debaltseve in the first days after the ceasefire supposedly had begun
( putin 's continual denials that russia troops are in eastern ukraine have zero credibility after the crimea case
what can the west do to stabilize the ceasefire ? an assault on mariupol ( or elsewhere in eastern ukraine ) would probably trigger severe costs in the form of a new round of western economic sanctions on russia and the provision to ukraine of greater military assistance , including defensive arms
