astronomers may have finally found evidence of the elusive dark matter that permeates the universe
its presence has potentially been spotted in a dwarf matter orbiting the milky way which is radiating gamma rays - the most powerful form of radioactive waves known in the universe
how these mysterious waves are made , and where exactly they come from have baffled scientists for years , but scientists believe they are a sign for dark matter
bright areas indicate a strong gamma ray signal coming from the direction of the galaxy , according to the researchers â search algorithm dark matter is the missing substance that makes up to 80 per cent of the universe 's mass. it has been described as ' the most important unsolved problems in modern physics
at 98,000 light - years from earth , reticulum 2 is one of the nearest dwarf galaxies yet detected according to physicists at cmu , brown university and cambridge universities , gamma rays coming from the direction of the galaxy are in excess of what would be expected from normal background
' something in the direction of this dwarf galaxy is emitting gamma rays , ' said alex geringer-sameth , a postdoctoral research associate at cmu
' there 's no conventional reason this galaxy should be giving off gamma rays , so it 's potentially a signal for dark matter , ' said alex geringer-sameth , a postdoctoral research associate in cmu 's department of physics and the paper 's lead author
' in the search for dark matter , gamma rays from a dwarf galaxy have long been considered a very strong signature , ' added brown university 's koushiappas , an assistant professor of physics
they are thought to lack other gamma - ray - producing sources , so a gamma ray flux from a dwarf galaxy would make a very strong case for dark matter

further study of this dwarf galaxy 's attributes could reveal hidden sources that may be emitting gamma rays , but the researchers are cautiously optimistic
' the fact that there are gamma rays and also a clump of dark matter in the same direction makes it quite interesting , ' professor walker said .
