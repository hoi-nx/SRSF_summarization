for a generation of moviegoers in the early 1990s , " pretty woman " was a cultural touchstone
the breezy comedy had all the key elements of romantic fantasy : a plucky , down - on - her - luck heroine , a rich , dashing prince and a cinderella love story with a fairy - tale ending
most of all it had a lesser - known actress named roberts , whose radiant smile and coltish charm lit up the screen
the movie , which celebrates its 25th anniversary on monday , grossed $ 463 million worldwide and made her the biggest female star in hollywood
some critics complain the garry marshall film , whose female lead is an unrefined prostitute rescued from the streets by richard gere 's elegant millionaire , degrades women and glorifies materialism
here are some of the leading pro-and - con arguments about the movie
first , the cons : it whitewashes the realities of prostitution the movie glosses over the less - than - glamorous motivations that can lead women into sex work , says hail-jares , a board member of the sex workers outreach project ( swop usa )
on one hand roberts ' character , vivian , is a compelling protagonist who dispels the stereotype of the drug - addicted " crack whore " with little ambition , hail-jares said
on the other hand , the movie implies that by virtue of her beauty , drive and apparent drug - free lifestyle , roberts is the exceptional sex worker who -- unlike her pal kit , for example -- deserves a better life
" vivian 's exit from sex work thanks to richard gere 's character is also troubling , she says
" ' pretty woman ' may be a fantasy but it 's a deeply sexist , consumerist fantasy , " wrote rachael johnson last year for bitch flicks , a feminist movie site
" it celebrates greed although he is dutifully appearing on tv this month to promote " pretty woman 's " anniversary , richard gere in the past has publicly dismissed the movie for glorifying wall street corporate raiders like his ruthless edward character , who dismantles struggling companies
the movie also depicts vivian 's evolution from streetwalker to beverly hills socialite through an orgiastic shopping spree during which richard gere promises to spend " an obscene amount of money " on her
" ideologically , ' pretty woman ' is a love song to consumerism and capitalism , " said bitch flicks ' johnson
" ' pretty woman ' depicts a world where everyone is either a card - carrying member of the corporate caste or an obliging subordinate ... it is obsessed with things ( hotel suites , private jets , fancy clothes ) and encourages the audience to share its obsession with things
" and now the pros : no , it actually empowers women despite her lowly profession , vivian is no pushover
" its shopping scenes are revenge - fantasy bliss ask some " pretty woman " fans to name their favorite scene and they do n't mention vivian 's swoony moments with edward
for all its modern trappings ( and r rating ) it 's also deeply old - fashioned : take out the sex and prostitution and it could be a disney movie
but richard gere and roberts , despite their 18 - year age difference , have genuine chemistry
and roberts ' charisma carries the movie through its weaker spots
