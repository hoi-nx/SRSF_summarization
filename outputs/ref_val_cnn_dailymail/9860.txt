this is the moment a pair of skydivers dramatically set fire to their petrol - soaked parachute canopies sending them plummeting to earth at 120 miles per hour
alex aimard and his friend petter jonsson leapt from a plane over eloy in arizona armed with a parachute doused in kerosene , a flare gun and a go pro camera
and after deploying their parachutes , the pair then pull out the guns during their descent to set fire to their canopies
alex aimard aims his flare gun at his petrol - soaked parachute after jumping out of a plane over the arizona the fire from the gun causes the parachute to ignite and causes a blaze in the mr alex aimard 's canopy with just seconds to react and release the now flaming parachutes before the fire travelled down cords to their bodies , the pair free themselves
but luckily they also have an emergency parachute , meaning they then glide safely to the ground
' the fire then takes hold and starts to travel down the cords to their bodies meaning mr alex aimard has to quickly free themselves after being freed , mr alex aimard then deploys his emergency parachute so he can glide safely back to the ground while mr alex aimard , from france , added : ' petter jonsson jumped first so when i exited the plane i saw something that i will never forget - a big cloud of smoke made by the explosion of his chute
petter jonsson then attempts the stunt and shoots the kerosene soaked parachute with the flare gun with the parachute in flames , mr petter jonsson then starts plummeting to earth at more than 120mph but despite the dangerous stunt mr petter jonsson makes it safely back down to the ground thanks to his emergency parachute ' skydiving itself is not without danger and flying in a plane with two big buckets full of gas and two flare guns does n't decrease the risk
