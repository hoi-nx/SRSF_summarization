lausanne , switzerland nuclear talks intensified sunday between world powers and iranian , but key sticking points remained unresolved as the countries tried to reach a deal to curb tehran 's nuclear program ahead of a tuesday deadline
as the negotiations entered their fourth day , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned the agreement coming together is worse than israeli 's deepest fears
the talks had hit a snag on saturday , with diplomats describing iranian as refusing to budge , but as the french , german and chinese foreign ministers arrived , the mood seemed more optimistic
two core issues are still unresolved : 1 ) limits on iranian research and development on advanced nuclear technology in the end years of the deal ; and 2 ) the pace of lifting u.n. sanctions
the speed of which u.n. sanctions could be lifted remains in dispute
iranian wants them lifted immediately after the deal goes into effect
while diplomats say iranian could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade , oil and banking , sanctions adopted by the u.n. are more complicated
many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the u.n. nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , that iranian 's nuclear program does not have a military dimension
on saturday , iranian foreign minister mohammad zarif made clear the issue of sanctions remains a stumbling block , saying he believes the world powers " have realized that sanctions , pressure and an agreement will not go together
" u.s. officials said that all sides , including iranian , agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as iranian confirms its compliance to the deal
iranian also wants the ability to continue to research and develop more advanced centrifuges while the deal is in effect
u.s. and european officials worry that could enable iranian to quickly produce enough uranium for a nuclear weapon
" we are not asking them to do nothing , but they want to do more than we want them to do " referring to how much research the iranian want to be able to still undertake
" a senior iranian diplomat told cnn on sunday : " it 's not fair to characterize the state of affairs as iranian resistance on those issues
" diplomats said iranian has agreed to a cap of fewer than 6,000 centrifuges that it can operate to enrich uranium , a process that can lead to weapons - grade material
u.s. officials maintain the number is abstract , because there will be other restrictions on the levels of enrichment and type of centrifuges iranian can operate , which they believe will extend the time iranian would need to have enough fissile material produce a nuclear weapon -- known as the " break - out time " -- to at least a year
benjamin netanyahu voiced alarm at the emerging deal
that could prompt iranian to withdraw from the talks and scuttle the chances of a deal altogether
