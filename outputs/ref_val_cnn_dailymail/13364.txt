lausanne , switzerland talks to reach a deal on a framework agreement on iran 's nuclear program will be extended an extra day , u.s. officials said tuesday
" diplomats and negotiators worked late as an initial deadline approached , but more time appeared necessary to reach a framework deal
french foreign minister laurent fabius informed the iran that he will return to paris at dawn wednesday in an apparent effort to force the iran ' hand , western diplomatic sources told cnn
ba'idinejad from iran 's foreign ministry said earlier tuesday there are no " artificial " deadlines and a deal will be reached , when each issue has been resolved
diplomats told cnn that there has been progress , but gaps remain
for iran , that means there 's a light at the end of the tunnel for crippling sanctions
for the west , it means real hope that it 's possible to loosen up on tehran while still being confident that it wo n't develop nuclear weapons
so are the international dynamics anytime you 're talking about iran and the west , with mutual distrust and contempt a shared sentiment for years
that 's why it 's taken so long to even get to this point , and why what 's happening in lausanne matters
what happens if wednesday passes and there 's no framework agreement ? in the short term , it appears , not much
iran 's power rises , with or without deal the real deadline is n't for three months , after all
as for the march 31 date , there 's nothing to stop the parties from continuing to talk -- though an iran official told state - run press tv that no one had raised the idea of an extension as of late monday
after working through the previous night , representatives from the key players -- most of them foreign ministers -- met all day tuesday to try to resolve differences in what chinese foreign minister wang yi described as " the final stage " of " these marathon - like negotiations
russia foreign minister lavrov is among the optimists
" 21 questions on iran nuclear talks iran has been under intense international pressure and has faced crippling sanctions over its nuclear program for years
the sides began moving away from stalemate with iran ' 2013 election of president rouhani , who has insisted that iran wants a peaceful nuclear energy program but not weapons
viewed as a moderate -- especially compared with other powerful figures in iran , including the country 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei -- rouhani campaigned on a platform that he 'd work to help iran 's economy by reducing its rifts with the outside world
there 's been discussion on what to do with iran 's existing fissile material -- which is important because , as long as it 's still around , that will make it easier to produce a nuclear weapon more quickly
" more important are three points that have dominated the talks in lausanne : how quickly or slowly iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15 - year agreement
" the export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program , " iran deputy foreign minister abbas araghchi said , " and we do not intend to send them abroad
that 's been raised as a possibility in the u.s. , even though a washington post-abc news poll conducted in the past few days found that 59 % of respondents support a deal in iran that would restrict its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions
one person leading the charge against a possible deal , even though he 'll have no direct part in shaping it , is israeli prime minister netanyahu
reiterating points he made earlier this month to the u.s. congress , netanyahu said tuesday " the greatest threat to our security and safety and our future is iran ' attempt to become nuclear
" " and the agreement that is being formed in lausanne , " the israeli leader said , " is paving the road to that result
