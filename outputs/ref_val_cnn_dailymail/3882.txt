the hottest chip ever created by the brand was launched in australia on monday and will hit supermarket shelves next week
most of the chips in each packet are doritos â classic cheese supreme flavour , but hidden in every handful is one very hot chip
australia will be only the third country in the world to try out the new taste sensation after canada and south africa , even beating the us to the crunch
the move has actually caused a huge reaction in the us who are desperate to be the next country to get in on the act , even sparking an online petition to have the new type of chips there
they may look like doritos â classic cheese supreme flavour chips but do n't be fooled it 's no good putting a brave face on it , once you bite into the spicy hidden chip there 's nowhere to hide i surrender : another challenger ca n't take anymore and fails the roulette challenge known as â anxiety in a bag â many unsuspecting victims did nât know what hit them
this puts them higher on the scientific scale of spicy food than jalapeno and chipotle chilies
