a british company has invented the world 's first lifeguard drone - which could soon replace the human lifesavers on a beach near you
the drones , carrying cameras and rubber rings , can be sent out by lifeguards from the shore , and can allegedly rescue drowning holiday makers quicker than humans , who 'd have to battle through the waves
complete with lights and thermal cameras for night rescues , the drones could appear on holiday beaches in time for summer , even aiding with rescues of ships and yachts in trouble
' at the moment many people talk about bad drones and drones that are spying and killing people but i think everything has a good side and a bad side , ' said rigi
' the drones can reach people stranded at sea far quicker than lifeguards and can deploy three buoyancy aids in one flight
the drones can reach people far quicker than lifeguards and can deploy three buoyancy aids in one flight ' this is the future of lifeguards i believe , ' rigi said
eventually the drones may be stationed on floating platforms where they can be charged from solar energy ' a rescue team could take 10 to 12 minutes where a drone could take one minute
in one of the british 's main holiday hotspots , cornwall and devon , more than 8,500 people were caught up in beach and sea rescue dramas last year
research showed that a lifeguard could perform a rescue in 90 seconds while the drone took just 20 seconds the inventors are hoping to decrease the number of people that drown by up to 60 per cent perranporth alone had 1,000 incidents , according to the rnli
the company hopes to deploy their invention at beaches in the british as well as around the world ' we 're using human intelligence on one side and the abilities of this technology to save lives quicker and more efficiently
