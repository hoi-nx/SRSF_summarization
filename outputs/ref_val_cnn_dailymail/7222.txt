mary-ann wood , 53 , has one leg which weighs two stone more than the other after cancer treatment a grandmother has spoken of the agony of living with a medical condition that means she has one leg two stone heavier than another
mary-ann wood 's left leg began to swell after treatment for cervical cancer 17 years ago , but it is now so huge that her calf has a circumference of almost 3ft
the 53 - year - old suffers from lymphoedema , a condition where the body 's plumbing goes haywire
mrs mary-ann wood is now unable to bend her leg , is barely able to walk , and doctors have said she will be completely immobile in less than a decade
despite this , she has been denied nhs funding for a liposuction operation to drain the fluid from her leg
she made the bid through her doctor , who agreed she would benefit from the treatment , which would cost the nhs Â£ 11,000
but after her case was assessed by a panel at her local clinical commissioning group ( clinical commissioning group ) , her application was denied as the clinical commissioning group said the evidence for the procedure 's effectiveness was ' poor '
mrs mary-ann wood , of midhurst , west sussex , has been forced to give up her job working with special needs children while she continues to battle the nhs for the treatment
mrs mary-ann wood said : ' my leg is huge and the surgeon told me the only option is to have the operation
she added : ' i was told that my best bet of getting the operation is to move to an area where the nhs provides it - it 's a postcode lottery
' mrs mary-ann wood 's condition developed because she had lymph nodes removed along with her cervix as part of a hysterectomy
her lymphatic system is no longer strong enough to drain her leg of the fluid causing the build - up
however , if the lymphatic system is faulty - such as after cancer treatment - the fluid it would normally drain away accumulates in the tissue and the area swells up
mrs wood doctors calculated that her left leg was two stone heavier than her right leg using computer modelling
the liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again
mrs mary-ann wood 's left leg has swollen so much her calf now has a circumference of almost three feet
doctors have said she will be immobile within a decade she suffers from lymphoedema , a condition in which the body 's lymphatic system does n't drain fluid properly from the leg , causing fluid to accumulate in the tissue and the leg to swell up it would cost the nhs Â£ 11 , 000 , with a continuing cost of around Â£ 300 a year to remeasure her leg and create a new compression garment if there is a change in size
the liposuction would not cure the condition but it would drain the excess fluid from her leg allowing her to walk normally again
her husband of 26 years alan wood , a 48 - year - old removal man , must assist her in her daily chores
a spokesperson at nhs coastal west sussex clinical commissioning group , said : ' we are very sorry to hear mrs mary-ann wood 's concerns , and we do understand the difficult situation that patients are in when they come to us for individual funding
the clinical commissioning group spokesperson continued : ' the clinical commissioning group 's panel fully considered mrs mary-ann wood 's case , but found that the evidence of clinical effectiveness of the proposed treatment was poor
' now , mrs mary-ann wood is trying to raise Â£ 2,500 to get a machine to massage her leg but has so far raised just Â£ 220
