it is a pioneer of ' affordable luxury '
but the expected price tag on one of apple 's new watches is far from wallet - friendly
at $ 10,000 , the 18 - carat gold , sapphire and crystal apple watch edition being launched on monday would be the firm 's most expensive product since the $ 10,000 lisa computer in 1983 , developed by steve jobs , which was poorly received
analysts have branded the move a clear attempt to segway into asia 's booming luxury goods market - and suggest it could be the start of an entirely new market
this is unprecedented , ' dawson , chief technology analyst for jackdaw research , told dailymail.com
the move into this market comes months after apple poached burberry 's ceo angela ahrendts to be the new senior vice president of retail and sales - and lend a fashionable eye
alongside yves saint laurent 's paul deneve , as a ' special projects ' vice president , and designer marc newson , as a part - time consultant , the team has masterminded the firm 's unprecedented move

the popularity of the iphone 6 drove the firm 's market share in china to a record high , reaching 25.4 per cent by january 2015 - clouding out samsung as the country 's second - largest seller
however , xiaomi - widely dubbed ' the apple of china ' - remains firm with 27.6 per cent of the market
