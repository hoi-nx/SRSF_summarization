admit it , you 've been secretly itching for a new cause since last year 's ice bucket challenge for als left your teeth chattering and raised $ 115 million
this one 's goofier and tastier , and wo n't leave you needing a change of clothes
it 's the # twizzlerchallenge
so what 's this challenge all about ? think of the spaghetti scene from " lady and the tramp , " except substitute a twizzlers for the noodle
a tweet from sportscaster fred katz challenged the " today " show 's geist and uzo aduba , who plays suzanne " crazy eyes " warren on " orange is the new black , " to share a " lady and the tramp " licorice
next thing you knew , geist was repeating the stunt with vieira and the # twizzlerchallenge was on
just search the hashtag # twizzlerchallenge
since 2006 , " night of too many stars " has raised over $ 22 million
if this challenge is even half as successful as the ice bucket challenge , that number will triple
