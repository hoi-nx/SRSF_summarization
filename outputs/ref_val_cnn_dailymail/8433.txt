a fort worth , texas elementary school has come under fire from parents who claim certain teachers and administrators have cultivated a ' toxic ' environment for their children
at a monday board meeting , parents turned out to support glaser , the former vice principal at comanche springs elementary school in the eagle mountain-saginaw isd , who was placed on administrative leave after she experienced heavy vaginal bleeding that the school claims was caused by ' severe anxiety
' glaser , 31 , and her doctors , have firmly stated the bleeding , which occurred during a district training session and required glaser to seek immediate medical attention , was the result of an intrauterine device being lodged in her uterine wall
this was just the beginning of the parents complaints as well , as they also voiced their concern over ' staff drinking , ' the ' use of disparaging nicknames for teachers , parents and even children , ' and a principal who has been reassigned after her ' bullying tactics
at this point , some parents at the school became aware of the situation , and seemed to place the blame on maurer , the principal of the school
the situation then became even further complicated when just last week maurer filed a police report claiming she was being harassed by an employee at the school and her husband
the employee also reportedly referred to maurer as an ' idiot , ' while the employee 's husband is accused in the report of stalking maurer , coming to the school unannounced , following her to restaurants , and showing up at her home
â smith then said of maurer ; ' she was hired against the recommendation of the committee , and i felt like i was working with a person in the seventh grade
' parents brought up glaser 's situation at a meeting monday ( above ) , along with staff drinking on campus and the use of disparaging nicknames for students the district said it is investigating the leadership and these incidents at the school ( above ) pta member jennifer jordan said that maurer tries to exercise too much control over how decisions are made at the school , claiming she ' has tried to remove pta leaders , and has said she only wants people she likes on the board
