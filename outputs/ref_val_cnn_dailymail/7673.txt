after being knocked out of the champions league , chelsea have just 11 games left this campaign with all eyes geared towards the premier league title
although five points clear , some chinks in mourinho 's side 's armour were bared for the world to see on wednesday
rediscover the attacking flow anyone watching the limp defensive display against psg would find it hard to remember , but for the first half of the season , chelsea were breathtaking
chelsea need to rediscover the attacking form that saw eden hazard as the league 's best creative force diego costa nets chelsea 's third in a demolition at swansea that showcased the side 's attacking brilliance take the departed andre schurrle âs goal at burnley in the season opener , fabregas âs strike at crystal palace , any of the five netted at swansea â¦ it seemed the blues had finally meshed typical mourinho steel with the beautiful attacking craved by roman abramovich

for now , however , mourinho must reinstall petr cech as undisputed no 1

fabregas , battling marco verratti , has not been firing on all cylinders since christmas particularly in upcoming fixtures against manchester united , liverpool and arsenal , mourinho could do with the frenetic presence of ramires , a repositioned kurt zouma or even the young nathan ake to add more physical and defensive presence in midfield
