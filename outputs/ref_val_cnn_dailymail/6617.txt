dennis , the mclaren chairman , has apologised for the confusion over alonso âs condition , and predicted that the spaniard would race again in malaysia a fortnight on sunday
at a dinner in melbourne ahead of the opening grand prix in australian this weekend , dennis set the record straight after saying erroneously that alonso was not concussed in an accident in testing in barcelona on february 22
dennis apologised for saying alonso was n't concussed when he crashed in testing last month italian alonso had an accident during in testing for mclaren in barcelona on february 22 â i failed
â alonso , here being wheeled away from the crash site , says he wants to race in the malaysia grand prix mclaren boss dennis relayed alonso 's desire to race a fortnight from sunday and says it 's the driver 's choice meanwhile formula one âs penchant for chaos was never better demonstrated than in a bizarre court case unfolding just down the road from the albert park track that will host sunday âs race
at issue is whether a dutch driver called giedo van der garde should drive for sauber
subject to an appeal in melbourne on thursday , he will win that right - a decision that could even mark the end of sauber âs participation in the sport after 22 years
this pickle came about after sauber seemingly reneged on a contract that said van der giedo van der garde would race for them this season
they instead hired two drivers , brazilian felipe nasr and sweden âs marcus ericsson , who between them bring Â£ 20million to the team
dutch driver giedo van der garde has taken sauber to court claiming his right to drive for the team they found in his favour , a ruling that was upheld by the supreme court of victoria here on wednesday
even if they need to make some late changes , why is it less safe to let van der giedo van der garde drive than merhi , who was only named as manor âs driver on tuesday ? merhi has never driven the manor car
sauber 's marcus ericsson ( left ) and filipe nasr wait to se if they will drive in melbourne this weekend and van der garde , 29 , was even sauber âs test driver last year
no , sauber can not afford to drop felipe nasr , who is backed by banco do brasil , or ericsson , who brings in a sponsorship package worth Â£ 10million
however , even this is illogical because without sauber âs two high - paying drivers the whole team could be forced into administration , meaning therefore , he would have nobody to drive for .
