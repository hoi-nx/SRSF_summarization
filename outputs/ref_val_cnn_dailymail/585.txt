a silicon valley venture capital firm has emerged victorious from a three - year high profile case accusing executives of gender discrimination
reddit interim ceo ellen pao , 45 , sued her former employer kleiner perkins for four counts of discrimination after she was fired
in a case that prompted a broad discussion about gender bias in the tech industry , pao painted the firm as sexist , crude , and quarrelsome
the reddit ceo claimed her career crumbled at kleiner after ending an affair with a partner a jury of six men and six women rejected all of pao 's claims in san francisco superior court on friday over the course of three years , pao told the court her career at the silicon valley firm crumbled after she ended a brief affair with partner nazre , and was fired in 2012 when she complained
pao 's first claim , tabled in 2007 , also accused senior partner randy komisar of giving her a leonard cohen book , book of longing , filled with sexually explicit drawings and poems
the case played out as silicon valley saw a steady decline in the number of female venture capitalists
recent figures collected by babson college show six per cent of the venture capital is female , down from 10 per cent in 1999
one of pao 's mentors testified that subpar performance meant she was not promoted , rather than gender the firm disputed those charges , presenting evidence that kleiner went out of its way to hire women
' specifically , pao alleged that : the jury ruled against pao on the first three claims but was sent back to deliberate the fourth due to an apparent miscount
two hours later , they emerged in favor of kleiner perkins
but initially , the verdict stated that four jurors supported pao 's view that she was fired because she sued for gender discrimination
on the pivotal claim that pao was fired for being female , ten jurors ruled gender was not a substantial factor
following the verdict on friday , pao released a statement via twitter
' because of social media and live reports , the problem of gender discrimination in venture capital has received attention around the globe ' while today âs outcome is a disappointment , i take consolation in knowing that people really listened ' if we do not share our stories and shine a light on inequities , things will not change ' hopefully my case will inspire the venture capital industry to level the playing field for everyone , including women and minorities ' to support the entrepreneurs of tomorrow , we need to show leadership today
