zebb quinn , who has not been seen since the night of january 2 that year , was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with owens at a convenience store after he got off work at walmart at 9pm
but they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a mitsubishi for sale that zebb quinn was interested in buying , police told fox carolina
owens later told police that a short while later , zebb quinn flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over
zebb quinn then went off to return a page , before returning in a ' frantic ' state , owens said
cancelling the pair 's plans to see the mitsubishi , zebb quinn reportedly told owens he needed to leave and drove off , bumping into his friend 's truck on his way
on january 3 , zebb quinn 's mother , vlahakis , filed a missing person 's report
