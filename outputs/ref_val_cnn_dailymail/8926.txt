' using material possessions to express love or reward children for their achievements can backfire , ' wrote the authors in the paper called material parenting
' loving and supportive parents can unintentionally foster materialism in their children despite their best efforts to steer them away from relying on material possessions to find happiness or to judge others
they were asked to describe their current life situation and values , and also reported on a variety of childhood circumstances , their relationship with their parents , and the rewards and punishments they received during three critical ages of childhood results showed adults who had received more material rewards and punishments as children were more likely than others to use possessions to define and express who they are
