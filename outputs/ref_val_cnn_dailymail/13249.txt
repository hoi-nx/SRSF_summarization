three teen uk girls suspected of traveling to syria to join isis appeared on surveillance video in turkey before they went to their destination
authorities have said they have no reason to believe the girls are still in turkey and believe they have crossed into neighboring syria , parts of which have been taken over by islamist terror group isis
a uk counterterrorism officer said police had tried to reach out to the girls using the turkey media and social media to persuade them to return home
the girls ' parents have also publicly begged for them to come home
days before they left for turkey , at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman , aqsa mahmood , who left her home in scotland to travel to syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media
but with the rise of the ultra-violent islamist group isis in syria , the turkey government increasingly came under criticism at home and abroad for not doing enough to stop jihadists from going through turkey to get into syria
historically , the turkey - syria border , which runs more than 800 kilometers ( 500 miles ) , has been notoriously difficult for turkey security forces to control
before the syria civil war , both smugglers and kurdish separatist guerrillas were known to operate illegally between the two countries
