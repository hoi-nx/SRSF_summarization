it is the moment mother caines feared she would never experience â the â lion âs roar â of her baby âs vital first cry
after she had lost two babies because they were born prematurely , doctors went to extraordinary lengths to ensure baby lennox would survive
one year earlier , she had delivered her tiny daughter adelaide at 24 weeks , a baby who tragically lived for just one hour
despite her overwhelming grief , mrs caines allowed a photograph showing adelaide struggling for life to be published , because she felt so strongly that abortions should not be carried out on babies of a similar age
other babies born so prematurely have survived , which she believed made â a mockery â of the law allowing abortions until the start of the 24th week of pregnancy
before 24 weeks , they are not legally considered â viable â â despite recent advances in neonatal care
the tragedy : this was the image that broke our hearts ... of baby girl adelaide who died at 24 weeks the triumph : this is baby boy lennox , born to the same mother ... who lived at 32 weeks doctors had told mrs caines that , due to physiological reasons , any child she conceived was unlikely to survive
her cervix was so short that it would be a miracle if her womb could hold on to the baby long enough â meaning it would probably die after another extremely premature birth
but now mrs caines , 26 , has realised her â impossible â dream of becoming a mother , giving birth to lennox at 32 weeks last december , with her husband alastair beside her
lennox âs birth came not only after the heartache of losing adelaide , but also their first baby isabelle , who was born at 23 weeks in 2011
describing the moment lennox erupted into life , mrs caines said : â isabelle never cried and adelaide âs cry was very weak but lennox âs was like a lion âs roar
â thriving : lennox with mother caines , who now feels ' totally blessed ' she said : â there were so many times when i thought , â i âm never going to be a mum , ever
â mrs caines and alastair , a 29 - year - old security guard , subsequently started ivf in march and she was implanted with the embryo in april
hero : professor draycott holds tiny lennox shortly after his birth crucially , her obstetrician professor draycott used medical techniques designed to â trick â her body into avoiding an early labour
and in a highly unusual move , mrs caines also spent over a month in hospital when she reached 23 weeks , so medical staff could do everything possible to stop the baby arriving early
before the birth , mrs caines was injected with steroids to boost lennox âs lungs to help him breathe independently after birth , which had been a major concern
mr and mrs caines married on september 8th 2012 in a villa in portugal
this day was the anniversary of mrs caines ' first daughter isabella 's birth and death five days after the birth , lennox was transferred from southmead âs specialist neonatal department to yeovil hospital , and he was discharged at three weeks
but his mother admitted : â even now , i feel like lennox is on loan because it feels too good to be true , that he is actually here
looking back on her two earlier births , mrs caines said she could not understand how isabelle could have been legally aborted
i am not opposed to late abortions on medical grounds â if there is something seriously wrong with the baby , or if the mother âs life is at risk
we live in an age where the technology is available to keep a baby alive who is born at 23 or 24 weeks
i saw adelaide and lennox when they were embryos , because they were both conceived through ivf , and to me they were already babies at that very early stage
â survival rates among babies born in england at 24 weeks have jumped in recent decades
but only a quarter of those who survive birth before 24 weeks escape major health problems
caines and alastair caines fell in love in the agonising weeks after she lost her first daughter isabelle more recent research has found higher survival rates among those born in highly specialist units like southmead
of those , 2,500 are carried out after 20 weeks but before 24 weeks
mrs caines said her newborn son bore such a strong resemblance to adelaide at birth that she felt he had brought part of her with him
