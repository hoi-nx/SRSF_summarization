tory mps have criticised the government for being â blind â to the soaring threats britain faces and accused it of freeloading off the americans
former british army captain john baron said yesterday that the britain was â ignoring the lessons of history at our peril â by refusing to commit to spend 2 per cent of national income on defence
tory mp john baron , left , urged prime minister david cameron to commit at least two per cent of the budget to defence spending as americans general raymond odierno warned over ' unthinkable ' cuts to the british army the basildon and billericay mp said â misguided military interventions â in the last decade , including iraq and afghanistan , had distracted the britain from the â greater danger of state on state â threats from countries such as russia
â he called on the government to spend 3 to 4 per cent of national income on defence , saying it was â nonsense â that on current projections britain will be spending the same on defence as on foreign aid in 15 years
a total of 37 mps , the majority of whom are tories , backed a motion in parliament yesterday to set the defence budget at 2 per cent of national income in law , in a significant challenge to david cameron just weeks ahead of the election
mr john baron warned that britain faced a significant threat from countries such as russia he said that if the britain was serious about defence , the government would need to look at ballistic missiles , upgrading elite units and protecting soldiers against chemical weapons with special suits
a study by the impartial house of commons library released this week revealed that current plans suggest defence spending will represent only 1.87 per cent of national income next year
tory mp simon reevell described the prime minister âs suggestion that intelligence service spending could count towards the 2 per cent target as â kindergarten economics â
