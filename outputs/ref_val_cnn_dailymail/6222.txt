quinn has warned the republic of ireland not to be fooled into believing they only have to shackle lethal striker robert lewandowski to get the better of poland
the republic of ireland entertain the group d leaders at the aviva stadium on sunday evening looking for a victory which would take them level with the poles and get their campaign back on track after november 's 1 - 0 defeat in scots
however , martin o'neill has left his players in little doubt that preventing robert lewandowski from doing what he does best is only one of the missions in which they must succeed if they are to prosper , with milik and sebastian mila also representing significant threats
quinn ( left ) believes the republic of ireland mus n't concentrate solely on robert lewandowski quinn said : ' i do n't think we need to say too much about robert lewandowski because we know exactly how much of a threat he is
robert lewandowski has four goals to his name in as many games during the euro 2016 qualfying campaign to date ' we ca n't dwell on how good they are , we have got to look at our own qualities and try to apply them in the game on sunday and get those three points that we really want
' robert lewandowski has four goals to his name in as many games during the campaign to date , although they all came in poland 's 7 - 0 drubbing of minnows gibraltar in faro in september , and it was milik and mila who were on target to defeat world champions germany in warsaw the following month
that left the republic of ireland , the scots and joachim low 's men locked together on seven points , three adrift of poland , although quinn is confident there will be no hangover from the disappointment at celtic park

' poland appear in 34th place in fifa 's latest rankings list with republic of ireland in 66th , and it has been to ireland 's detriment that they have not been able to see off teams ranked above them in their most recent campaigns
roi manager martin o'neill will lead his side out against poland at the aviva stadium on sunday that is a situation which will have to change if they are to finish in the top two , and the significance of that will not be lost on a bumper crowd at the aviva stadium , the site of the former lansdowne road stage on which jason mcateer captured the imagination of a nation by dumping holland out of the world cup back in 2001
