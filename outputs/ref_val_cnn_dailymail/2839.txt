killer co-pilot andreas lubitz was able to hide his psychological problems from airline bosses because of a ' gaping hole ' in the system for assessing pilot health , an air safety expert has claimed
andreas lubitz had torn up a sick note declaring him unfit to fly on the day he crashed a germanwings plane into a rocky ravine in the alps , killing himself and everyone on board
the 27 - year - old is believed to have consulted medics about severe psychological and visual disorders and been told he was too ill to fly by two doctors before the crash
but due to confidentiality rules , this information was not passed onto gemanwings operator lufthansa and he was able to fly the doomed airbus a320 that day
the onus of reporting any health issues rests solely on the ' honesty ' of pilots
newton , a british pilot who has flown airbus a320s for 20 years and who also works as a civil aviation authority examiner , said that the system ' has to change '
it would happen in the british as well , ' he said
nobody checks that you communicate your health problems to the airline
' pilots have a yearly medical examination , which includes a chat about how we 've been feeling psychologically , but it 's fairly low - key
' and if i see the doctor for something that may affect my ability to perform my duties , he is prevented from communicating that to the airline because of medical confidentiality
' andreas lubitz had visited dusseldorf university hospital in february and more recently on march 10 and is believed to have been concerned about vision problems
an ex-girlfriend claimed he had always dreamed of flying larger planes but had recently recognised his ambition could not come true because of his mental health problems
but it appears that because of confidentiality laws governing gps , lufthansa would not have been informed about andreas lubitz 's struggles unless he told them himself
french gendarmes have been at the crash site , recovering clues and body parts from the wreckage dozens of search workers have been deployed by helicopter because the crash site is so inaccessible officials confirmed that andreas lubitz 's remains have already been found , and not a single body had been recovered mr newton added : ' i 'd like to see a more robust mechanism
most pilots do n't go around intentionally exploiting it , but the door is open for someone who has serious mental problems to hide it from the aviation examiner
' it also leaves the door open for mistakes
german newspaper bild am sonntag reported investigators had found evidence to suggest andreas lubitz was concerned he was losing his eyesight , possibly because of a detached retina
andreas lubitz is believed to have locked pilot sonderheimer out of the cockpit when he left to go to the toilet before he put the plane into a descent
black box recordings revealed that sonderheimer hammered on the door asking to be allowed in , but andreas lubitz failed to answer
committed and ambitious , his former girlfriend maria told german newspaper bild that andreas lubitz had hoped to fly larger planes , such as the boeing 747 jumbo jet
