we traveled along narrow roads winding among snow - capped mountains , eventually arriving at birkhall -- the scottish home to charles and his wife , camilla , camilla
i had pitched for interviews with the couple several times over the years and finally prince charles accepted
the couple 's first tour as newlyweds was also to the united states , so it felt like an appropriate moment to take stock
the camilla appeared from around the corner , keen to welcome the crew
prince charles opens up about love and life she is not what you might expect when you meet her
she 's more charismatic , which is something i hope comes across in the cnn special , " spotlight : charles and camilla
" unfortunately she had declined our request to be interviewed
the camilla had however allowed our cameras to get close enough to pick up sound during some of her public appearances
when prince charles arrived , he also insisted on meeting the crew , which was great but was also eating into our interview time
the camilla joined us on the way and was worried i would be cold without a coat , but the coat was inaccessible and i did n't want to hold things up
you ca n't tell an awful lot about someone by spending just a morning with them , particularly as a journalist , but my impression was that they are close , connected and have fun
