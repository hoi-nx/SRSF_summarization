controversial : hertz installed the cameras as part of the in - car neverlost app in 2014 car rental company hertz has been slammed by customers for putting cameras inside their vehicles
the controversial device was installed as part of the in - car navigation system and guide , neverlost 6 app , which was introduced in 2014
drivers fear the lens is a breach of their privacy , but the firm insist they do not work and have no plans to turn them on
they also state they do not have the bandwidth capabilities to support video streaming
the cameras were added so drivers could interact with a member of the customer services team during an emergency or when stationary
to start a conversation , the motorist or a passenger would have been able to turn on the camera themselves - but because of technical difficulties the feature has n't been integrated into the system
broome , a spokesman for hertz , told the daily mail online it would have been completely customer activated and could not have been turned on remotely
breach of privacy ? some drivers have expressed their concern at the presence of the device , but the hire car firm said there is ' nothing behind the lens ' and the camera simply does n't work ' i find this to be completely unacceptable in fact , if i get another car from hertz with a camera in it , i will move our business from hertz completely
' the company told a twitter user who criticized the use of the lens : ' the camera in the neverlost device was never activated as we do not have adequate bandwidth capabilities to the car to support streaming video at this time
it is not the first time in - car recording technology has caused a stir
