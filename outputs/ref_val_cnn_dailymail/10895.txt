but rather than roaming the seven seas , this 34 - stone leatherback sea turtle is undergoing treatment in a us aquarium after it swallowed a floating plastic bag
the leatherback , nicknamed nicknamed yawkey , was found dangerously ill on a remote beach in south carolina
eating plastic could cause a build - up of gas in the digestive tract , making the turtle buoyant and washing it to shore
the aquarium hopes to release nicknamed yawkey soon because leatherbacks do not cope well in captivity wildlife experts rescued the rare leatherback from a beach on saturday
thorvalson , a turtle expert at the south carolina aquarium sea turtle hospital in charleston , said it took five people to haul the giant beast from the beach

nicknamed yawkey has responded well to antibiotics and other treatment , and the aquarium hopes to release it in the next few days .
