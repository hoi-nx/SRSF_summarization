waking up one morning , leesa barrell was alarmed to find that everything seemed very different
â i called out to my husband lee and when he replied i could only hear his voice in my left ear
â leesa barrell ( pictured ) woke up one morning unable to hear out of her right ear initially , leesa barrell , 45 , who lives in norwich with lee , 49 , a school caretaker , and their son ashlee , 12 , thought the problem was probably caused by a wax blockage and would correct itself within a few days
but when it did nât , a week after her first symptoms she went to see her gp and was referred to an ear , nose and throat consultant
the specialist dropped a bombshell â she had lost the hearing in her right ear , possibly for good
leesa barrell , a finance assistant , was even more overwhelmed when doctors could not explain why it had happened
leesa barrell is one of up to 6,000 adults a year estimated to develop idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss , or unexplained hearing loss , that usually develops suddenly , or within three days , usually in one ear
often , sudden hearing loss can be attributed to infections , certain medications , head injuries and meningitis , because these can all affect the inner ear
but in some cases , such as leesa barrell âs , there is no clear explanation
the hearing organ , the cochlea , is found deep in the inner ear
sensorineural hearing loss is down to problems in the inner ear or with the auditory nerve
â eighty - five per cent of the time no one ever knows why sudden sensorineural hearing loss occurs because we ca nât get to the inner ear to examine it without risking damaging it , or damaging the brain , â says phillips , the consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon at norfolk and norwich university hospital foundation trust who treated leesa barrell
a benign tumour on an inner ear nerve may also cause sudden hearing loss â but this is rare
â hearing loss usually occurs in one ear so people get scared it will happen in the other ear , too
leesa barrell ( pictured ) initially assumed that the problem was caused by a wax blockage and that it would correct itself within a few days â losing balance function on one side can make someone feel disorientated before the brain eventually adapts
waking up one morning having suddenly lost your hearing is considered a medical emergency and , if this happens , you should see a doctor that day , advises mr phillips
thankfully , leesa barrell âs hearing has partially returned â which is likely to be down to her seeking medical help quickly
when she saw mr phillips , a week after her symptoms appeared , he prescribed a three - week course of steroid tablets
â on the fifth day of the course i started to hear a muffled , squeaky noise through my right ear , â she says
â a couple of weeks after finishing the course she regained 50 per cent of her hearing in her right ear , but nonetheless needed to have a hearing aid fitted
leesa barrell ( pictured ) was given a three week course of steroid tablets and she eventually regained 50 per cent of the hearing in her right ear although she still needed to have a hearing aid fitted this has helped â a lot â , she says , though she admits : â i feel much too young for one
â a nasty consequence of her hearing loss has been severe tinnitus ( in which a phantom ringing or buzzing is heard ) in her right ear
â because the brain is nât receiving sound from the ear it tries to strain to hear more and so picks up sounds that do nât have a genuine source
as for leesa barrell , she has learned to live with her hearing loss
