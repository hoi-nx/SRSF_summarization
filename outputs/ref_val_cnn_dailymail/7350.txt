a beautiful snowy owl was captured gliding inches above a snow - covered field in ottawa , canada , in the hunt for food , with her bright yellow eyes just visible above the wing the 57 - year - old said : ' she had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill
' as the owl came over the top of a ledge she pulled her wings back so she could soar across the field the stunning set of images was captured by photographer rick dobson who said : ' she had in fact spotted her prey and was coming in silently for the kill ' the owl flew silently just millimetres above the snow - covered floor , keeping her bright eyes on the prey to get close enough to the owls , mr rick dobson had to make sure he approached slowly and did not walk directly towards the birds
snowy owls will usually fly a short distance before landing to eat snowy owls often approach their prey from a low angle to ensure a shadow does not give the game away ' some owls are much more approachable than others
' they are very large birds but fly silently and gracefully and can endure the harshest of habitats
happy with its work : mr rick dobson added : ' snowy owls are one of the most magnificent creatures on earth '
' snowy owls fly silently when they hunt and often approach their prey from a low angle
