spacewalking astronauts who ventured out for the third time in just over a week on sunday have completed an extensive , tricky cable job at the international space station
while it had functioned perfectly during the first two spacewalks , on sunday morning , a pressure sensor briefly malfunctioned before he floated out
meanwhile , nasa said a small amount of water got into american astronaut terry virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurized on wednesday
they were forced to spend two days analyzing his suit after the water leak occurred at the end of an outing earlier this week
terry virts was never in danger , according to nasa , so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks , friday , to install cable
duties : nasa said another main part of the astronauts task was to route 400 feet ( 121 meters ) of cable leak : in this file image made from video provided by nasa , astronaut terry virts points to his helmet as he sits inside the international space station on wednesday , feb. 25 , 2015 , during an inspection for water in his suit
virts reported the water while he waited in the air lock for wednesday 's spacewalk to formally conclude spacewalk : nasa on friday cleared virts ' spacesuit , pictured , for the last of three spacewalks to install cable italian astronaut , luca parmitano , barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk
the water escaped from his suit 's cooling system and nasa spent months investigating the mishap , before clearing the way for more spacewalks
cable : american astronauts terry virts and wilmore had 400 more feet of power and data cable , as well as two antennas which they installed sunday astronaut : terry virts is seen during the third spacewalk outside the international space station sunday during the six hour , 45 minute outing , they plan to set up antennas and communications equipment nasa : astronaut terry virts , left , and wilmore began the spacewalk at 6:52 am ( 1152 gmt ) when completed the work will allow future crews launching from florida on american commercial spacecraft to be able to park at the space station the advance work , involving nearly 800 feet of cable over three spacewalks was carried out to create new crew capsules commissioned by nasa
the work done by american astronauts virts and wilmore meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed , as well as two antennas installed on sunday
nasa has n't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days , and the amount of cable work is unprecedented
