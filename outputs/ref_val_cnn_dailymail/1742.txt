he revolutionised how we clean our homes but now sir dyson is hoping to boost the battery life of our smartphones , cars and - of course - our vacuum cleaners
the 67 - year - old inventor and entrepreneur has invested $ 15 million ( Â£ 10 million ) in michigan - based battery experts sakti3
the company has developed a range of ' solid - state ' batteries ( ssbs ) that store 50 per cent more energy than current models and will make our favourite gadgets smaller and safer
the firm has developed a solid - state battery capable of storing double the amount of power as traditional lithium - ion models
the batteries could feature in dyson 's cordless cleaners as well as phones and other gadgets it is the first investment sir dyson has made outside of his bagless vacuum business
the majority of batteries found in phones , electric cars and sir dyson ' range of cordless vacuums use lithium - ion ( li-ion batteries ) battery technology
lithium - ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte and because lithium is a highly - reactive element it stores a large amount of energy
lithium - ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte but this liquid electrolyte is flammable
sakti3 's ssbs are based on the same li - ion technology but replace the liquid electrolyte with a coating of non-flammable metal
