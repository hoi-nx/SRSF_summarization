at some clubs , the association with a former manager or player is so strong , so deep , that they can never really move on
west ham manager sam allardyce could be on his way out of upton park when the season finishes sam allardyce had diafra sakho to thank for a return to winning ways at the weekend this last - gasp goal from diafra sakho was enough to see off sunderland and take the three points they got their wish in the end when he returned to the club in the summer of 2013
at upton park there is a similar dilemma , with the boardroom once again tempted to turn to slaven bilic at the end of the season
every so often the momentum for slaven bilic builds at upton park and it is heading that way again because of the annual uncertainty over the future of sam allardyce
although slaven bilic only spent a season as a player at west ham , his profile has increased over the years by dint of his tussles with england during his successful coaching career with croatia
slaven bilic , seen here staring down a pitch invader last week as besiktas crashed out of the europa league , is continually linked with a return to west ham as manager , having played for the club in the 1990s slaven bilic ( left ) joined west ham in 1996 and spent a year there before moving to premier league rivals everton hajduk split - 2001 - 02 played 17 won 11 drawn 4 lost 2 win % - 64.71 croatia u21s - 2004 - 06 played 18 won 10 drawn 2 lost 6 win % - 55.56 croatia - 2006 - 12 played 65 won 42 drawn 15 lost 8 win % - 64.62 lokomotiv moscow - 2012 - 13 played 31 won 12 drawn 7 lost 12 win % - 38.71 besiktas 2013 - played 81 won 44 drawn 19 lost 18 win % - 54.32 total played 212 won 119 drawn 47 lost 46 win % - 56.13 he is currently coaching besiktas , second in the super lig going in to the international break after they were beaten by rivals fenerbahce
slaven bilic âs target now is win the title , to regain control of the super lig and finish above the leaders galatasaray at the end of the season
slaven bilic belongs in that category
he wants english football , the chance to return to upton park as the club âs manager after spells with lokomotiv moscow and besiktas
west ham âs ownership structure , comprising sullivan , david gold and karren brady , along with some influential voices on the fringes of the boardroom , have a decision to make at the end of the season
alan shearer ( right ) did n't have much to celebrate when he took over newcastle after starring as a player howard kendall ( left ) , celebrating with paul bracewell after everton sealed the first division title in 1985 , was in charge from 1981 until 1987 and returned to goodison park in 1990 and again in 1997 jose mourinho always said he would come roaring back to chelsea after leaving in 2007 they finished the season in 13th , a respectable position for a team that had only just been promoted from the championship under sam allardyce âs leadership
but his contract is up in the summer and there has been little to suggest that he will stay beyond the end of the campaign
west ham old boy jermain defoe was kept quiet by sam allardyce 's men at upton park sam allardyce was able to change his tactics at short notice to get the better of sunderland boss dick advocaat by the end of the game they had crossed the ball 42 times , winning for the first time in nine when diafra sakho scored in the 89th minute
