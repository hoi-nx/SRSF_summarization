many parents are afflicted by ' weight - blindness ' , unable to recognise their child is overweight unless they are extremely obese , new research has found
the research discovered that just under a third ( 31 per cent ) of the parents underestimated where their child 's body mass index ( bmi ) was on obesity scale
the scale classifies children as very overweight ( or obese ) , overweight , a healthy weight , or underweight
many parents are afflicted by ' weight blindness ' , and are unable to recognise their child is overweight unless they are extremely obese , according to new research ( file picture ) just four parents described their child as being very overweight despite 369 children being officially identified as such ( 1 per cent ) and fewer than 1 per cent overestimated their child 's weight status
the team estimated that for a child with a bmi at the 98th centile there was an 80 per cent chance that the parent would classify their child as a healthy weight
tam fry , spokesperson for the national obesity forum and chair of the child growth forum said : â because there are so many overweight and obese children around , the parents are in denial
' however , they recognised that parents became more likely to classify their child as overweight when the child had a bmi above the 99.7th centile
the study found that parents were more likely to underestimate their child 's weight if they were black or south asian , from more deprived backgrounds , or if the child was male
parents might underestimate their children 's weight due to be fear of being judged , unwillingness to label a child as overweight , and shifting perceptions of normal weight because of increases in body weight in general
they said evidence suggests that parents who recognise their child 's weight on the bmi chart are more likely to perceive potential health risks
senior author dr sanjay kinra , of the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine , said : ' if parents are unable to accurately classify their own child 's weight , they may not be willing or motivated to enact the changes to the child 's environment that promote healthy weight maintenance
' co-author professor russell viner , of the ucl institute of child health , said : ' measures that decrease the gap between parental perceptions of child weight status and obesity scales used by medical professionals may now be needed in order to help parents better understand the health risks associated with overweight and increase uptake of healthier lifestyles
â we know that obesity is linked to a range of health risks later in life â including increased cancer risk â so it âs vital that parents are aware of their child âs bmi ( bmi ) , and can spot if their youngster is starting to become overweight
parents who are able to recognise whether their child is overweight are more likely to perceive potential health risks and change their lifestyles , researchers said
