that 's according to an annual splc report that says the number of hate groups in the u.s. remains on the decline for the second year in a row
in the " intelligence report " released tuesday , the splc says the number of hate groups operating in the u.s. declined 17 % between 2013 and 2014
in just the last year , the number of patriot groups declined by 20 % , from 1,096 groups to 874 , " the report said
more than half of the decline in hate groups was of kkk chapters , and many of those have apparently gone underground , ending public communications , rather than disbanding
california and florida have the largest number of hate groups , with more than 50 each
alaska and hawaii are the only states with no hate groups , according to the splc
the report tracks the number of chapters or groups , not individual members , so while the number of groups is on the decline , it 's possible that some of the groups that remain have increased membership
the kkk experienced the largest decline of all hate groups , according to the report , losing more than 50 % of its chapters
one of the oldest and most infamous hate groups in the u.s. , the kkk took its foothold after the civil war , terrorizing the african-american - african-american population with intimidation and violent actions , including lynching
in 1990 , the splc started to keep track of the number of kkk chapters , which reached a high of 221 in 2010 , in response to president obama 's election , according to the report
the splc now reports 72 chapters , down from 163 a year ago
under obama , 4 in 10 say race relations worsened the reason for the decline of the kkk is not totally clear , though the report even suggests the groups may be going deeper underground
the overall number of hate groups peaked in 2011 and has been on the decline since
looking towards next year , splc is " expecting a real wave of islamophobia " because of the proliferation of isis and the heavy media coverage of the extremist group , potok told reporters .
