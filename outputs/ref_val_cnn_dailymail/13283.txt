the misuse of outer protective garments may have led to the exposure of a potentially deadly strain of bacteria at the tulane near new orleans , the cdc said friday
the employee is not sick , and jason mcdonald , a cdc spokesman , said the bacteria probably are n't a threat to the general population
inspectors from the cdc and the u.s. aphis said the misuse of outer garments " could have led to the bacteria clinging to inner garments and getting carried out of the select agent lab where research was being conducted with the bacteria on mice , " a news release said
" additionally , cdc and aphis inspectors determined that tulane primate center staff frequently entered the select agent lab without appropriate protective clothing , which would increase the risk of bringing the bacteria out of the lab or becoming infected themselves
all research with the agent at the facility was suspended on february 11 and will remain suspended until it can be shown that there are no more risks and that proper procedures are being followed , the cdc said
the cdc says the primate facility can resume that research when tulane officials show inspectors that : entity - wide procedures exist to ensure animals accidentally exposed in the future are managed appropriately ; all personal protective equipment procedures are thoroughly reviewed and revised appropriately to lessen the risk of future breaches ; all tulane primate center personnel are trained on any new or revised protective clothing procedures ; and improved entry and exit procedures to the outside enclosures housing non-human primates are in place to stop any further transmission among the animals
