russian president putin is ready to unleash a supersonic bomber towards uk which can outrun the raf âs fastest fighter jets
the introduction of the blackjack follows sorties by other russian aircraft near cornwall last month which disrupted commercial flights and sparked major security fears
on that occasion , raf pilots flying typhoon jets easily caught up with two propeller - driven bear bombers and directed their crews away from uk airspace
but the blackjack ( tu-160m ) is three times faster than the bear and can fly four times further than the fighters that make up uk âs quick reaction alert ( quick reaction alert ) squadrons , according to experts
russian president putin ( pictured ) has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the west , according to experts but while the russian aircraft has a range of 7,600 miles without refuelling , the typhoon âs limit is 1,800 miles , meaning the blackjack could maintain its maximum speed for much longer than its uk counterpart without air - to - air refuelling
they are being prepared for possible action at air bases in russian that are within easy striking distance of uk
dr sutyagin added that the blackjacks â revamp was part of a plan by president putin to boost both russian âs arsenal of military hardware and its troop numbers
it comes at a time of heightened tension between russian and the west , and while uk âs armed forces are shrinking due to spending cuts
â president putin has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the west , â said dr sutyagin
trained to the same level as uk âs sas ( sas ) , they were used in chechnya and , most recently , in eastern ukraine where they are understood to have organised a guerilla campaign by russian separatists
experts also believe putin could send the spetsnaz to the baltic states of latvia and lithuania , both nato members , to organise resistance among ethnic russian
but while the typhoon can not match the blackjack âs range , raf sources insist it is a superior aircraft overall given its set of air - to - air weapons and its agility
' raf typhoon fighters will continue to routinely intercept , identify and escort russian aircraft that travel through international airspace within the uk âs area of interest
