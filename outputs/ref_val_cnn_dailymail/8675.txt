the new finance minister for greece has been accused of making an offensive gesture to germany during a speech
varoufakis is continuing to negotiate for a reduction in greece 's debt from the eu and has been doing a whistlestop tour of european in a bid to get support for his proposals
but the new finance minister has been hit by an allegation recently that he held up his middle finger when giving a speech about greece 's finances and germany in 2013
the minister claims the footage has been doctored
a video of the speech appears to capture the offensive gesture
as he raises his finger , varoufakis says : ' my proposal was that greece should simply announce that it is defaulting , just like argentina did , within the euro , in january 2010 , and stick the finger to germany and say well , you can now solve this problem by yourself
' the claims are likely to make a tense situation even more tricky for varoufakis who has been trying to negotiate favourable terms for greece to pay back its debt to the eu since the election of the radical left - wing party syriza in january
alexis tsipras , leader of the radical left - wing party heading the new coalition , immediately demanded a renegotiation of greece ' Â£ 179 billion international bailout deal
varoufakis has been under increasing pressure to secure a better loan repayment deal for greece the party has continued to describe itself as ' anti-austerity
' the call catapulted varoufakis onto the european stage
greece was likely to run out of money by march if a deal was not reached before the end of february and a four month extension to the bailout programme for greece was agreed on a conditional basis
april 23 2010 â papandreou , greece âs prime minister formally requested an international bailout
january 2015 - alexis tsipras of syriza becomes prime minister and launches attempt to persuade eu and international monetary fund to ease terms of bail - outs
it was confirmed today that greece had handed over 580m euros to the international monetary fund - clearing its debt for this month
