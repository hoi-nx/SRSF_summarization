a study shows that a couple is more likely to divorce if the wife falls ill and researchers said their results indicate that some men simply can not cope with a poorly spouse after tracking 2,700 couples in the us from 1992 to 2010 , the us team found that divorce levels were roughly the same between healthy couples and those in which the husband suffered sickness
