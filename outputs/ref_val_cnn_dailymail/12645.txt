from the community of montoursville , pa. , u.s.a. , to the community of haltern am see , germany : we offer our heartfelt condolences for the pain you must be feeling at this time after the loss of 16 students and two teachers in the horrendous crash of germanwings flight 9525
almost 19 years ago our community lost 16 high school french club students , along with five chaperones , in the crash of twa flight 800 off the coast of long island , new york
students , former students , teachers and other community members began to fill the hallways of the high school building because they did n't know where else to go to find consolation
local pastors , priests , teachers and counselors were also gathering at the school to offer whatever comfort could be offered in such a moment
within hours , phone calls began pouring in from former students and teachers who were now living outside the area , offering condolences and prayers for all
positive identification of each individual lost took even longer , which only added to the anguish
school was not in session during the summer months , so students and school staff members were able to express their sense of loss as they felt necessary at any time
a community prayer service was arranged and held in the high school gymnasium to provide a place to weep together , and to share each other 's pain
local pastors and priests provided ongoing support to the families who had lost family members , and this continued for several months
because we are a community of about 5,000 with just one high school , almost everyone opened their arms of support to those in deepest need by providing meals , baby - sitting , housecleaning and laundry services
funeral services were held one at a time , some in the high school and others in local churches
this helped for some , but families that experienced direct loss still had a long and painful journey ahead of them
this is the beginning of a very long journey for all those willing to serve those in such great pain at this time
