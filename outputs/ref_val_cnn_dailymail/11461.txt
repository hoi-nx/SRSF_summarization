the moment he read the quotes of his colleague sbragia on young harper
to the uninitiated , harper is scottish football âs new wonderkid
wotte â mcclair âs predecessor â dubbed the real youth player scotland âs answer to robin van persie
real youngster harper in action against ludogorets in the uefa youth league match scotland under - 19s manager sbragia has left harper out of his squad for the upcoming games he did so because , by all accounts , harper does not fit the typical scottish mould
he is a creative type who scores goals under the watchful eye of real coach zinedine zidane
so far this season he has scored three goals for real in the uefa youth league and is midway through a five - year deal signed in 2012
and spain âs under - 19 coach luis de la fuente has used his birth certificate to try to recruit him
sbragia âs under - 19 squad are currently preparing for uefa european championships elite round with games against austria , italy and croatia this week
in a throwback to the old school thinking which preceded the sfa âs high - profile 2020 performance strategy , sbragia explains his absence by saying : â our concentration is on the opening game with austria and we âve deliberately got more height in our squad
that âs one of the reasons why harper is nât in
â it âs purely tactical and there certainly has nât been a lack of enthusiasm from harper about playing for scotland
most of all when harper learns that young oliver mcburnie , an 18 - year - old striker who plays for bradford city is in the squad
regarded as a progressive , forward thinking and intelligent coach within the corridors of hampden , sbragia âs quotes on harper hint at something else
for mcclair , a cerebral former manchester united colleague of sbragia âs , the harper conundrum represents an early test of his diplomatic skills
â harper is currently midway through a five - year deal with real and is tipped to have a big future pointing out that most of the country has never seen harper play , strachan added : â i âve seen a few people at chelsea who never get a game anywhere
â we have to match these teams physically , â said sbragia of the challenge facing his under - 19 side
the worry is that when the sfa host uefa european championships games at hampden in 2020 , the nation will finally get the chance to see the prodigious talent of harper
