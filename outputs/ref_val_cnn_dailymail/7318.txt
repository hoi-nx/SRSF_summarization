the case of the ' gone girl ' physiotherapist and her boyfriend who were accused of staging her kidnapping has taken another strange twist â a group who are claiming to be the kidnappers have demanded an apology from the police
now the san francisco chronicle has received a string of anonymous emails from the apparent kidnappers in which they compare themselves to the cast of ocean 's 11 and claim they will strike again
' the letter to the san francisco chronicle says authorities have until noon on tuesday to apologize
it also demands that the police make clear that neither huskins or her boyfriend quinn - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges
' they then compare themselves to the cast of ocean 's 11 , the famous caper film that starred members of the rat pack when it premiered in 1960 and brad pitt , matt damon and george clooney in the 2001 remake
it is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either , also reaching out to them on march 24 with an audio file of huskins to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in mare island
they claim they drilled holes in the window of huskins and quinn 's home to gain entry , and then used squirt guns with ' strobe flashlights and laser pointers ' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms
the group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of huskins and quinn 's home ( above ) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take huskins the kidnapping , which has been called an ' orchestrated event ' by authorities , has drawn comparisons to the film gone girl ( above ) in the end however , they claim it was a case of mistaken identity , and they did not mean to take huskins , thinking that someone else would be in the house
' attorneys for both quinn and huskins claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email , and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth
