' ' we will continue to build to fortify jerusalem so its division will not be possible and it will remain united forever , ' he said on a tour of har homa , a settlement neighbourhood of annexed east jerusalem
netanyahu , who is seeking a third consecutive term , vowed he would never allow the palestinians to establish a capital in the city 's eastern sector and pledged to build ' thousands ' of settler homes

throughout his campaign , netanyahu has repeatedly accused zionist union leaders herzog and former peace negotiator tzipi livni of being ready to abandon israeli 's claim to jerusalem as its indivisible capital
but netanyahu 's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing nrg website if it was true that there would be no palestinians state established if he was reelected
