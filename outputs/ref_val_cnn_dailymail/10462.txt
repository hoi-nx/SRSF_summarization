for what could be his last appearance at the dispatch box today as prime minister , cameron will have been coached for hours by his officials
but for his fateful â at home â bbc interview , broadcast on monday , in which he dropped the bombshell that he did not intend to run for a third term as pm , cameron does nât seem to have bothered to do his homework properly at all
he had at least watched a recording , on the downing street tv , of ed miliband âs own domestic disaster last week with bbc deputy political editor landale , after which the labour leader was mocked for having two kitchens
but cameron , a former political apparatchik - turned - pr man , never bothered to rehearse questions that might come up
the camerons prepared lunch while being interviewed the interview , when it was fixed months ago , was due to be conducted with the bbc âs political editor robinson
it was clear on screen that cameron felt instinctively at ease with landale , a fellow old etonian
the bbc programme , which was designed to show a softer , more homely side of cameron , had been going to plan , with footage of the pm on the touchline at his son arthur elwen âs football match
the bbc , who had already spent 30 minutes with cameron , were given an hour in the kitchen in witney , where cameron visibly relaxed
but so confident was downing street that the interview would go off without a hitch that craig oliver , the no 10 communications secretary â himself an ex-bbc man â did nât even bother to make the trip to oxfordshire
the agreement which was thrashed out with the bbc before the interview concentrated on dress code , of all things
samantha was also , as agreed with the bbc , a frequent presence in the kitchen , looking suitably fragrant and glamorous
crucially landale , who has been with the bbc for 12 years after a decade at the times , was not asked for a list of questions he might ask , or even subject areas in advance of the interview
remember his unguarded comments in america about the queen â purring â down the telephone to him over the nationalists failing to win the scottish referendum ? perhaps the bbc man sensed that the kitchen would be the most fertile place to ask tricky questions , while the pm was surrounded by his family
yet the question over whether cameron intended to serve a third term was hardly a bombshell : cameron could have easily dismissed it
earlier this week , cameron announced he would not bid for a third term if he is successful in may 's general election
he has since insisted he is taking ' nothing for granted ' and his focus is on beating ' ed miliband ' â but by answering my question , he has potentially opened a pandora âs box
â cameron âs supporters know that for some time he has been trying to squash speculation that if the tories win , he will stand down as pm after the planned 2017 eu referendum
