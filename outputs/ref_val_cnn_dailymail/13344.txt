to help shrink the gap , schnakenberg and his los angeles neighbor , koehn , started a business with a goal of lowering the barrier to " made in american " fashion
buck mason has been up and running since late 2013 , offering a focused collection of american - made garments

how do they keep costs down ? by focusing on just a few items and cutting out the middleman so they can sell directly to customers through their website and storefront in venice , california , they say
with the help of the internet and social media , they have been able to build their brand and find an audience without the help of chains or department stores
" brands selling directly to customers is nothing new in retail , and it 's still a big gamble for most
by selling directly to consumers , brands increase their margins , control inventory based on their own projections and do n't have to worry about returns from retail store customers
they also have complete control over pricing and may be able to offer lower prices to consumers , said plunkett , ceo of market research company plunkett research

unlike noble , which is sold in a few stores , victor will be sold directly to consumers through the company 's website and its brick and mortar store in cincinnati
that 's how they heard from people who said they could not afford to support the " made in american " movement even though they wanted to
through victor , whose products range from $ 25 for a tee to $ 85 for a hooded sweatshirt , the suttons hope to rehab american - made style 's reputation as exclusively high - end and inaccessible , she said
" there are people who value the idea of american - made but have never taken the step , " she said
