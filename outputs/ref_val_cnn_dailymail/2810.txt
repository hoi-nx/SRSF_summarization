a political operative has sued presidential campaign adviser axelrod over axelrod 's claim that he came up with the attack strategy that saved an embattled philadelphia mayor in 2003
philadelphia campaign consultant keel said it was his idea to blame republican for an fbi listening device found in democratic mayor john street 's office
keel considers the decision to attack then - president george w. bush 's republican administration ' a defining moment ' of his career , according to his lawsuit
in his book ' believer : my forty years in politics , ' axelrod takes credit for the plan to accuse president george w. bush 's justice department of trying to sink the street 's re-election bid
axelrod , obama 's senior campaign strategist in 2012 , is under fire on at least two fronts for claims he made in his new political memoir whose idea was it ? philadelphia mayor john street ( right ) swept to a re-election victory in 2003 after his campaign aides hatched a plot to blame republican for alistening device the fbi planted in his office the fbi bugged the street 's office as part of a ' pay - to - play ' probe that led to the indictments of a city treasurer , a top street fundraiser and 10 others
mitt romney 's personal assistant garrett ( right ) saw and heard everything the republican candidate said and did during the last presidential race , and he said axelrod lied about the 2012 election night concession call to make the republican look like a race - obsessed sore loser in addition to the the street campaign , axelrod later managed the re-election campaign of harold washington , chicago 's first black mayor , he later worked for then - senator john edwards ' 2004 presidential campaign and latched on to obama 's 2008 effort
' believer : my forty years in politics ' came out in mid-february and has already brought complaints from two people who say axelrod lied in the memoir this year he 's consulting with britain 's labour party in advance of may 7 elections
labour party has said axelrod is being paid a ' six - figure salary ' for his advice , and that he is working with douglas alexander , labour party âs shadow foreign secretary â largely via telephone conference calls
the personal aide of one - time republican presidential nominee mitt romney blasted him last month for writing that mitt romney had claimed president obama 's 2012 election victory was the product of an aggressive get - out - the - vote operation tageting blacks
garrett told cbs news that axelrod told a ' ridiculous ... lie ' about a phone call between obama and mitt romney on election night
the republican nominee , according to axelrod 's account , angered obama when he called to concede the race â saying , ' you really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like cleveland and milwaukee
' that 's how obama remembers it , axelrod wrote
