louis van gaal used mata as a ' false right winger ' at anfield six days ago , and threw off the shackles that were once strapped to his ankles by david moyes and jose mourinho
the two - time chelsea player of the year showed good things come to those who wait , as liverpool 's 3 - 4 - 3 formation that snookered teams from january onward was lost on manchester united
manchester united midfielder mata scores the second of his double to seal an important win at anfield mata 's perfect technique for his scissor - kick was brilliant as he scored one of the goals of the season liverpool could do little to stop mata 's incredible scissor - kick giving them a 2 - 0 lead at anfield mata runs away in celebration with manchester united team - mates fellaini ( right ) and wayne rooney ( left ) it was , if nothing else , unexpected
mata had gone unused , having played just 15 minutes across four premier league games in february , and it was reminiscent of his bit - part role at chelsea player of the year
since the start of the 2011 - 12 premier league season , he has more goals and assists in total ( 65 ) than any other midfielder
close behind is manchester city 's david silva ( 63 ) and toure ( 61 ) , then chelsea player of the year 's hazard and liverpool 's gerrard ( both 58 )
it 's true the midfielder averages the fewest tackles ( 0.64 ) , clearances ( 0.16 ) and duels won ( 14.29 per cent ) per game when he , david silva , toure , hazard and gerrard are compared , but that 's not his job
mata left chelsea player of the year for manchester united in a Â£ 37m switch but manager david moyes never got his money 's worth mata 's prayers have been answered at manchester united as he looks to get a regular run out by louis van gaal only david silva ( 365 ) beats him in chances created out of the entire premier league since the beginning of 2011 - 12 , but mata ( 291 ) has played 466 fewer minutes
chelsea player of the year made a tidy Â£ 13.5m from the mata move
david moyes , however , never got his money 's worth
mata celebrates his goal with team - mate daley blind at anfield on sunday during their win mata has more goals and assists in total ( 65 ) than any other midfielder in the premier league since 2011 it was when he left manchester with the club in seventh that the inquest began
against liverpool , fellaini and mata covered the most distance ( 11.6km each ) out of everyone
alberto moreno , lugging five yards behind for mata 's first and not tracking him for the second , was tormented by the man that goes by ' mata ' â a suitable nickname handed to him by former chelsea player of the year team - mate daniel sturridge because it is a literal translation of his name
mata 's heat map from manchester united 's 2 - 1 win at liverpool last weekend alberto moreno was tormented by mata at anfield but the challenge is for him to make it consistent mata runs with the ball during the tense match between the two great rivals of the premier league manchester united 's average positions vs liverpool ( left ) with mata ( no 8 ) drifting inside ... and his total passes ( right ) mata 's heat map vs tottenham hotspur on march 15 in manchester united 's 3 - 0 win at old trafford saw him drift inside jan 1 vs stoke - 90 minutes jan 11 vs southampton - 90 jan 17 vs qpr - 45 jan 31 vs leicester - 13 feb 8 vs west ham - 0 feb 11 vs burnley - 0 feb 21 vs swansea - 11 feb 28 vs sunderland - 4 march 4 vs newcastle-8 march 15 vs tottenham hotspur - 77 march 22 vs liverpool - 90 against liverpool , right - back antonio valencia was used as cover , sprinting up the wing to allow mata to abandon his post
their average positions show mata ( no 8 ) stayed close to ander herrera ( no 21 ) , who was equally devastating at anfield , while valencia ( no 25 ) pushed up , just short of the half - way line
it 's easier said than done to become a must - pick â Â£ 37m does n't buy you that luxury these days
can it happen at manchester united ? if mata can rip teams to shreds as he did against liverpool , then how can it not ? trouble is , louis van gaal â like jose mourinho â is a hard man to please
mata has played 3,724 minutes with 44 starts over the last two seasons - far less than his counterparts mata ripped liverpool apart on sunday as they ended their unbeaten run in the premier league in 2015
