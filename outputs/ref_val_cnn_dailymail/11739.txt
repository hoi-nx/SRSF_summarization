barcelona may never have been here today
not the club who have won four european cups and so many domestic trophies they require a small cave rather than a mere cabinet to hold them
irishman patrick ' o'connell is credited with rescuing barcelona from extinction the awesome trio of neymar , lionel messi and luis suarez may not have been assembled if not for o'connell not luis enrique 's side who are aiming to knock city out of the last 16 of the champions league
all of that is unlikely to have existed were it not for irishman patrick ' o'connell , who as a player captained the red side of manchester during five years at united from 1914 but has inadvertently played a crucial role in setting up city 's two - legged fixture with barcelona a century later
o'connell is credited with rescuing barcelona from extinction during his time in charge between 1935 and 1940
barcelona have enjoyed great success in recent years but it was o'connell that saved the club in spain , he became known as ' don patricio ' - a title reserved for royalty or noblemen - for his successes after moving over aged 35 and first leading racing de santander to five regional titles before becoming one of the founding members of la liga
he took charge at real oviedo and then won the spain title at real betis , but his greatest legacy was shaped when barcelona came calling
after just one season at the catalan club , the spanish civil war broke out in july 1936 and the country was in chaos
o'connell ( back row , far right ) pictured for ireland against wales in 1914/1915 on the streets of barcelona , anarchy was escalating
la liga was suspended and , despite playing in and winning the mediterranean league , cash was running out fast
the club were facing financial ruin
o'connell orchestrated himself and the players taking a huge wage cut - reducing his salary by a third from $ 1,500 to $ 1,000 - but barcelona were still heading out of business , until the wily irishman had a bright idea
barcelona celebrate with the champions league trophy following victory over united in 2009 former barcelona captain and defender puyol holds the champions league trophy in rome he took the team on a tour of mexico and america , playing 14 games and raising $ 5,000 - the equivalent of $ 83,000 today
why then would this barcelona legend come to die alone and penniless in london 20 years later ? while o'connell is remembered so fondly in those sunnier climes , on our own shores an entirely different character is recalled by those he should have loved dearest
former barcelona man cesc fabregas holds the uefa super cup after beating porto at louis ii stadium bob pursell was banned after rigging a game to win money when liverpool faced united liverpool 's jackie sheldon was one of those players banned indefinitely by the fa liverpool 's thomas fairfoul was also banned for his part in the corrupt game between the rival teams o'connell struck a penalty well wide with the score at 2 - 0 , but somehow avoided punishment
it was the last time o'connell would see her and he married again in spain , another irishwoman called ellen
johan cruyff has also supported the plea to get o'connell a more fitting memorial following his death but for all his heroics in spain , when o'connell returned to england in 1958 he faded into destitution before he died in london a year later where he remains in an unmarked grave
there , he will always be remembered as the man who saved the club
