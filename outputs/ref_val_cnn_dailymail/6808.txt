hidden patterns of climate change have been revealed by scientists using a method more normally used to diagnose heart disease
the scientists used multiscale entropy analysis to measure the ' pulse of the planet ' in an attempt to look for subtle changes in temperature on earth
the graph above shows how the entropy - or predictability - of european air temperatures have become less predictable over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months
the black lines shows the temperature predictability between 1850 to 1960 while the red lines shows the entropy between 1961 and 2014 researchers at the university of leicester , however , have used it to look at the variability in the temperature in europe
they found that the climate appears to have become less regular recently when temperatures are examined on times - scales of longer than 12 months
the chances of heatwaves in europe have dramatically increased in the past decade as a result of warming temperatures , experts have said
professor balzter , a climate scientist at the university of leicester who led the study , said : ' i had the idea to apply a new method to the climate data
' it has been applied a lot to diagnose heart disease , because it is good at detecting regularity and randomness in time - series data
' multiscale entropy analysis works by searching data for small patterns of information that appear repeatedly
they found that air temperatures between 1961 and 2014 have become less predictable than between 1850 and 1960 over time scales of between 12 months and 70 months
heatwaves , like the one above hitting brighton beach , have become harder to predict because temperatures patterns across europe have become more irregular , according to the new research by climate scientists this map of central europe shows where entropy has increased ( blue ) and where it has decreased ( red ) this map of central europe shows where the temperature data had the greatest change in entropy , as shown by the colours where yellow is the greatest change and hardest to predict while white is an entropy change of zero ' a large number of extreme weather events such as prolonged cold spells , heatwaves , droughts and floods have been recorded around the world in the past 10 years
