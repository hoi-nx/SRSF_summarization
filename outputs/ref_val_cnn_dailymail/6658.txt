miliband has accused cameron of running away from the leaders debates after he refused to take part in any during the election campaign cameron tonight flatly refused to appear in televised leaders debates during the election campaign - despite uk 's biggest broadcasters threatening to go ahead without him
number 10 said the prime minister 's position was ' clear ' â reiterating that he was willing to do one seven - way debate at the end of march but no more
they said they would stick to their plan for three debates during april - including a head - to - head showdown between mr cameron and miliband - and urged mr cameron to ' reconsider ' his refusal to take part in these shows
downing street had written to the broadcasters on wednesday saying the pm 's ' final offer ' was a single 90 - minute debate featuring at least seven leaders before march 30
but in a joint statement , the broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven - way debate involving mr cameron , labour 's miliband , clegg of the lib dems and the leaders of the greens , ukip , snp and plaid cymru on itv on april 2
in a letter to mr oliver , the broadcasters made clear they were ready to go ahead with the debates even if mr cameron decides not to take part - effectively ' empty - chairing ' the prime minister
' however , in the end all we can do - as impartial public service broadcasters - is to provide a fair forum for debates to take place
' mr clegg called on the prime minister to join the debates in a message on twitter : ' come on , cameron , you have n't got your own way so accept it and take part
' labour leader miliband said the prime minister 's was running scared of taking him on in leaders debates the deputy prime minister clegg said the prime minister should accept the broadcasters ' decision scotland 's first minister nicola sturgeon said the bbc , itv , sky and channel 4 had called mr cameron 's bluff but number 10 immediately hit back at the broadcasters tonight
oliver , downing street 's director of communications , replied to the broadcasters : ' i made the prime minister 's final position clear in my last letter â he is willing to do a seven - way debate in the week beginning march 23rd
in their statement , the broadcasters said : ' today the bbc , itv , channel 4 and sky confirm they will continue with the series of televised leaders ' debates as planned in the general election campaign
' however , the group believes there needs to be two seven - way debates of a minimum of two hours each , within the election campaign , allowing time to properly represent the views of all parties , covering a broad range of subjects
' the broadcasters also believe that a head - to - head debate between the two individuals who could become prime minister - cameron and miliband - is important - something the prime minister has publicly supported
' following stormy exchanges on the debates at prime minister 's questions in the commons on wednesday , sky news and channel 4 said they were ready to move the two - header debate to another date if mr cameron and mr miliband could agree on a preferred day
' nigel farage has claimed the prime minister has set out from the start to ruin the leaders debates in a sign that they will keep the door open for mr cameron to perform a last - minute u-turn , they said : ' the debates will go ahead and we anticipate millions of viewers will find them valuable as they did in 2010
' ukip leader nigel farage said he would ' accept the challenge ' of taking part , even though he preferred the broadcasters ' earlier proposal for a four - way debate featuring himself , mr cameron , mr miliband and mr clegg
