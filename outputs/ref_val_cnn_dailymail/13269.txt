a decade ago al qaeda would meet potential recruits face to face ; now isis engages in one - to - one dialogue while sat 2,000 miles away
with what it says is a $ 2 billion budget , the group produces slick videos in which sexy bearded jihadists are paraded as potential husbands and burka - clad jihadi brides carry kalashnikovs while extolling the virtues of the utopian caliphate and a " guaranteed ticket to paradise
instead of going to classes , she travelled to syria ; last february she married a jihadi fighter , and since then she has become a notorious poster girl for isis
" it is easy enough to dismiss the words of wannabe radical jihadists as little more than the posturing of nihilistic adolescents , but the steady stream of recruits to isis can not be ignored
several years ago al qaeda recruitment propaganda included videos of men with long beards ranting in arabic in front of a black flag , followed by grainy footage of a truck blowing up as it drove towards americans
today isis runs a powerful , slick , modern social media machine distributing messages daily across many different platforms
their propaganda contains the same violent , distorted interpretation of islam but it is more advanced than anything al qaeda ever produced , and the authorities can not police it or compete with it
for many , the greatest shock has been young girls like aqsa wanting to leave behind their west comforts and freedoms to join isis , but why should it be a surprise that young muslims women are as angry as their male counterparts ? there is no single road map to recruitment , but for a teenager becoming a jihadi bride or fighter is much more appealing than becoming a suicide bomber , however distorted that logic may seem to us
full of adolescent frustration , young muslims are being lured into a romanticized and glamorous world which bears no relation to the misery actually inflicted by isis
it does n't matter if the narrative is false , because isis is winning the propaganda war : the inability of the mainstream to deal with the anger felt by the muslims community provides cannon fodder for the hatemongers
isis is left unchallenged on double standards of foreign policy , israel , rendition , torture , or assad 's reign , which has left 200,000 dead , because there is nothing that west governments can say without being accused of duplicity and double standards
aqsa 's family describe her as a " bedroom radical " of the type the british government has been desperate to combat by trying to shut down websites and social media
" a concentration on social media avoids the real world social relationships which help create terrorists
most parents would n't know if their teenagers were drinking or having sex , let alone being groomed by isis ; many young muslims -- already adept at living a double life -- will hide their digital footprint in exactly the same way
