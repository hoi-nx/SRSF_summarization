kerik had promised his daughter that they could see her godfather during their annual holiday - time stay in new york city and when giuliani did n't return his calls , kerik ' did n't have the hard to tell celine '

before he was jailed , kerik held positions as the corrections commissioner of new york city , new york city police commissioner and interim iraqi minister of the interior
