â tom ince has played 18 times for the under 21s and really enjoyed it and found it beneficial â so this is not a snub , that âs rubbish , â said ince , who was england â s first black skipper
he went to hull last summer and has then been on loan at forest and derby county , where he âs doing well now

it is the pinnacle of a player âs career to represent your country , â ince added
if tom ince is playing regularly next year for hull and scoring goals like he is for derby county , then he would love to get an england call - up
