it is is the most common tick - borne infectious disease in the uk , europe and north america
england estimates there are 2,000 to 3,000 cases of lyme disease in england and wales each year , and that about 15 per cent of cases occur while people are abroad
cases of lyme disease have been reported throughout the uk , but areas known to have a particularly high population of ticks include exmoor , the new forest in hampshire , the south downs and parts of wiltshire and berkshire
she said : ' i tried to hide the pain from my kids as i did n't want to worry them , but it was getting harder to put on a brave face ' ' i had to quit my job as a cleaner as i just could n't work , i was in that much pain
' just days later , ms claire dean woke to find she 'd lost feeling in both of her cheeks
but six months on , ms claire dean 's face was showing few signs of improvement
' i was horrified that my face was paralysed , but even more so when my doctor told me that there 's no cure , ' ms claire dean said

cases of lyme disease have been reported throughout the uk , but there are certain areas which are know to be tick hotspots
six months on , ms claire dean is starting to see some improvements , although she is still in pain they are also found in parts of surrey and west sussex , thetford forest in norfolk , the lake district , the north york moors and the scottish highlands
if left untreated , lyme disease can spread causing arthritis , heart problems , muscle pain and neurological symptoms such as paralysis
