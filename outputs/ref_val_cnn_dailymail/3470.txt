mount everest towers over nepal and although many people dream of scaling its summit , there are beautifully remote villages , farms and monasteries nestled within its huge shadow that are also worth a visit
last year google took its street view cameras on a 10 - day trek around the khumbu region - also known as the everest region - to explore these quaint landmarks and locations
during the trek the cameras captured the small sherpa village of thame , the thakiri chholing gomba monastery and khumjung inside the sagarmatha national park
during the trek the cameras captured the small sherpa village of thame , the thakiri chholing gomba monastery and khumjung inside the sagarmatha national park the trek was led by apa sherpa , a 55 - year - old sherpa mountaineer who holds the world record for reaching the summit of mount everest 21 times - more than any other person
in 2009 , apa sherpa founded the non-profit apa sherpa foundation to help the local community of young people in the khumbu region
the street view images were captured in march 2014 when apa sherpa took members of google earth outreach , and the nepal nonprofit story cycle through the region
mount everest is the earth 's highest mountain , with a peak at 8,848 metres above sea level
' now you can find thame on the map and explore other communities nestled at the base of mount everest , like khumjung and phortse
' thame , and neighbouring upper thame are small sherpa villages in the solukhumbu district of nepal
tenzing norgay , one of the first people to climb mount everest with sir edmund hillary grew up in the region and the thame monastery is one of the oldest in khumbu
another village captured by the street view trekkers was khumjung
it sits 13,000ft ( 3,970 metres ) above sea level near mount khumbila
google also captured parts of the phortse farming village in the khumbu valley including the thakiri chholing gomba , or small monastery
paintings inside the monastery began in 2008 by buddhist artists and were completed by the end of 2009 using funding from the greater himalayas foundation
