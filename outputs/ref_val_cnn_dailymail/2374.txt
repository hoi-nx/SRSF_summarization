a texas man who 's finally no longer required to pay child support after 13 years of bank - breaking wage garnishment still owes the state $ 21,000 in back payments
carson says he suffered for years as he struggled to make monthly payments and now that it 's been proven he ca n't possibly be father to the girl , who he 's also never even met , he may still be forced to pay up
expensive mistake : carson of houston , texas has had his wages garnished for some 13 years because he was erroneously included on a girl 's birth certificate according to texas state law , he 's required to pay any outstanding payments owed , as well as any accrued interest
all this , despite dna tests proving unequivocally carson is not the father and all because he was initially named on the birth certificate by the mother
however , the order does not eliminate any child support obligations before that date or any interest that has accrued
the man is still responsible for arrears that accrued up to the termination date , as well as for interest that accrues after the termination date
so , the woes of people like carson who 've already had trouble paying child support will continue as they struggle to keep up with mounting interest on back payments
he owed back child support amounting to $ 50,000 , $ 13,000 of which was interest
you are not the father : carson and his ex are both totally positive he is n't the 13 - year - old girl 's father , but the law in this situation does not look backward -- what 's done is done and carson 's debts , at least for now , must still be fulfilled the girl 's mother has written to authorities to say carson should not be forced to pay support and they agreed
however , state law requires he pay the back payments plus accrued interest
