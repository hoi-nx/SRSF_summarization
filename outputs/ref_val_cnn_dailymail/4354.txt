new research funded by farmers aims to breed a wheat variety for people who ca n't eat the grain , an endeavor that comes as wider consumer interest in gluten - free foods is booming
the kansas wheat commission is spending $ 200,000 for the first two years of the project , which is meant to identify everything in wheat 's dna sequences that can trigger a reaction in people suffering from celiac disease
the disease is an autoimmune disorder in which eating even tiny amounts of gluten - made up of numerous , complex proteins that gives dough its elasticity and some flavor to baked goods - can damage the small intestine
miller , senior director of research for engrain , a kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry , said funding research to breed gluten - free wheat is ' the right thing to do ' the only known treatment known is a gluten - free diet , which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat , rye and barley
sales of gluten - free snacks , crackers , pasta , bread and other products reached $ 973million in the u.s. in 2014 , up from $ 810million the previous year , according to a january report by consumer research firm packaged facts
the research analyzed the sales of hundreds of explicitly labeled and marketed gluten - free products and brands at supermarkets , drugstores , and mass merchandisers
the only known treatment for celiac desiseas is a gluten - free diet , which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat , rye and barley the research for gluten - free wheat began in july at the wheat innovation center in manhattan , kansas
gluten - free foods are a niche product , and in the broader context of the world 's wheat markets , it is not a driving factor , according to dan o'brien , extension grain market specialist at kansas state university
researchers hope to use these varieties and traditional breeding methods to develop a gluten - free wheat alaedini , after looking at miller 's plan online , said the project may end up with a less toxic wheat product that is n't completely safe for all celiac disease patients
' after all this effort , this product that is coming out ... is unlikely to be superior in terms of nutritional value or baking properties and taste to the gluten - free products that are already on the market , ' alaedini said
' sales of gluten - free products in the u.s. increaed last year , reaching $ 973million in 2014 , up from $ 810million in 2013
