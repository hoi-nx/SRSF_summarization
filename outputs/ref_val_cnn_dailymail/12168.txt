the attack on mark lippert , the u.s. ambassador to south korea , allegedly by a knife - wielding south korea progressive activist at a breakfast meeting in seoul , was a rare and shocking reminder of the ongoing conflict that continues to divide the korean peninsula
but on thursday morning local time , the alleged assailant , who has been tied to south korea nationalist and anti- u.s. protests , reportedly shouted his opposition to annual u.s. - south korea joint military exercises and called for south korea reunification as he cut the ambassador on the face and hand with a 10 - inch knife
this breakfast meeting with mark lippert was taking place at a building directly across the street from the u.s. embassy in seoul
in part this is because direct confrontations between south korea citizens and u.s. government representatives in south korea have been rare , and violent political attacks are unusual
true , there have been periodic group protests against the u.s. military presence in south korea or against u.s. policy
but these protests have generally been conducted peacefully , a far cry from the environment of the 1980s , when pro-democracy protesters against a then - authoritarian south korea government attacked and burned u.s. government facilities
yet although downtown seoul has been relatively safe and public security has often been lax , violent attacks on public figures in south korea are in fact not unprecedented
all this said , the overwhelming initial south korea public response to the attack on mark lippert has been one of outrage , condemnation and sympathy
