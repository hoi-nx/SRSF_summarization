cameron was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell - by date on his premiership yesterday as senior tories accused him of trying to anoint george osborne as his successor
friends dismissed rumours that mr cameron âs wife , samantha , had asked him to make clear he would not seek a third term if re-elected , while mr cameron insisted he had simply given a â straight answer to a straight question â and that most people would think that was a â sensible â thing to do
â my entire focus is on the next 44 days and the general election that will decide which team runs the country for the next five years , â mr cameron said
it came as mr cameron was reminded of his comments to blair when the former premier announced he was handing over the reins to then - chancellor gordon brown mid-term
â one former shadow minister said that by indicating he will depart in the next parliament , mr cameron appeared to be seeking to head off moves to oust him on may 8 if he falls short of a commons majority and tries to lead another coalition or a minority government

â there was particular consternation that mr cameron effectively fired the starting gun on a leadership contest by naming three potential successors : home secretary theresa may , london mayor boris johnson and mr george osborne , the chancellor
mrs may and mr boris johnson have long been seen the leading rivals to be the next tory leader , but mr cameron sparked frenzied speculation at westminster by including his name of mr george osborne , his closest ally
since his unpopular budget of 2012 , mr george osborne âs leadership prospects have been discounted by many
boris johnson boris johnson is the favourite among voters to succeed cameron , a poll reveals today
but in a comres survey for the daily mail , mr boris johnson was backed by 31 per cent of voters , ahead of theresa may on 17 per cent and mr george osborne on 12 per cent
mr boris johnson âs strongest backing was among ukip supporters , at 44 per cent â suggesting he would do the best job of regaining support from the eurosceptic party
but in an lbc radio interview yesterday , mr boris johnson dodged questions about his ambitions more than a dozen times
he is bidding to return as an mp in may in the safe seat of uxbridge , but claimed mr cameron âs intervention was â no big deal â
â asked repeatedly if he would go for the party leadership , mr boris johnson said : â i ca nât possibly answer that because it âs a long way off
â mr george osborne praised mr cameron for giving â a direct answer â
â cameron has propelled george osborne into the top three , quite deliberately , â said one senior mp
â mps also questioned how mr cameron could promise to serve a â full second term â when a new leader would need at least six months to establish themselves before the 2020 election
former tory minister michael portillo described mr cameron âs announcement as â bizarre â
â if he had said exactly the opposite â that he wanted to go on and on and he was nât prepared to answer the question when he was likely to finish â you âd have accused him , quite rightly , of arrogance and wanting term after term
â a snap poll by comres for the daily mail found voters are divided over mr cameron âs announcement
some 70 per cent believe mr cameron was â just being honest â , while 80 per cent say ten years is long enough for any prime minister to achieve their plans
