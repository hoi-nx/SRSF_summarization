the animal was born in december say cheese : alika reclines in her mother 's arm as she smiles for the camera
she is the only baby in the enclosure â this , along with alika getting her first teeth , is an exciting milestone for us , as it signals that she will soon be crawling and taking her first steps
â alika was born in december after spending eight and a half months in mother mjukuu 's womb
baby gorillas typically spend around two months on their mother 's body before they begin to move around on their own and eat solid food
