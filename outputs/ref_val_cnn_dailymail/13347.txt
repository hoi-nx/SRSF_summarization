just when you did n't think republican could top themselves in finding ways to disrespect the president of the united states , on monday , 47 republican senators -- that is , all but seven -- sent a letter to iran that appeared aimed at scuttling president obama 's diplomatic efforts to prevent tehran developing nuclear weapons capacity
now , it appears the iran letter was carefully drafted by sen. tom cotton , a smart constitutional lawyer , to come as close as possible to the line of legality without crossing it , specifically by not explicitly taking a position against the iran negotiations
but it 's something else entirely to undermine the authority of the white house by sending a partisan letter to a foreign government ( something democrats did n't do with russia )
sadly , this is only the most recent and extreme example of dishonor and disrespect
in the washington post , columnist capehart recently outlines what he sees as the top six instances of disrespect toward president obama
" also on capehart 's list are the time a reporter from the conservative daily caller website interrupted the president during remarks at the white house about immigration reform in 2012 , and the time south carolina congressman wilson , a republican , heckled the president during his speech to a joint session of congress about health care reform
and there are plenty more examples of republican slights against president obama
" and there was the republican women 's group that created an image of " food stamp dollars " with obama 's face on them ( as well as a bucket of kfc and watermelon )
there was also republican presidential candidate and former speaker of the house newt gingrich decrying obama 's " kenyan , anti-colonial behavior
but more than this , it seems to reflect an anti-obama fever that has gripped the republican -- one that the letter to iran suggests shows no signs of breaking , and is a sure sign of sickness in the republican
indeed , even former secretary of state colin powell , a republican , noted what he described as a " dark vein " of intolerance in the party and parts of the country in general
whatever republican ' gripes about president obama 's vision and leadership , the party and its followers are too often expressing their critiques in an ugly way
