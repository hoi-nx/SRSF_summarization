lausanne , switzerland as nuclear talks with iran neared the endgame , u.s. secretary of state john kerry shied away from predicting success
difficult issues remain on the table as the world 's most powerful diplomats meet in switzerland with iran nuclear negotiators , john kerry told cnn on monday
we are working with a view to get something done , " he said
world powers are seeking the outlines of an agreement they say would stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years
in exchange , iran would get out from punishing sanctions that have crippled its economy
john kerry 's comments to cnn came after uncomfortable rumblings about the talks in lausanne , switzerland , made headlines
the assertion : iran backpedaled the day before on an important detail of a possible deal to prevent it from developing a nuclear bomb
on sunday , an iran negotiator told journalists that tehran would not send fissile material to russia , which diplomats had earlier told journalists was part of the plan to put potential bomb - making materials out of reach
... there is no question of sending the stocks abroad , " iran deputy foreign minister araghchi said
negotiators had not yet decided any specifics about the disposal of fissile material , and iran has made the comments many times before , the official said , citing a list of previous examples of such statements in press reports
china foreign minister wang yi sounded optimistic as he briefed reporters on the talks ' progress earlier monday , saying that the diplomats were " narrowing down " their differences and working out ways to resolve sticking points
" these marathon - like negotiations have reached the final stage , " he said
things have been tense in lausanne as the deadline for an agreement looms , with talks snagged on three important points : how quickly or slowly iran will be allowed to advance its nuclear technology in the last five years of the 15 - year agreement
how quickly crushing u.n. sanctions will go away
whether sanctions will snap back into place if iran violates the deal
iran wants them gone for good
but international negotiators want merely to suspend them , so they can reapply them as leverage if iran does not keep the bargain
iran would like sanctions lifted as soon as a deal is signed
iran could see unilateral sanctions relief in the areas of trade , oil and banking , but sanctions adopted by the u.n. are more complicated
many are related to proliferation and transfer of missile technology and are tied to certification by the u.n. nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency , that iran 's nuclear program does not have a military dimension
on saturday , iran foreign minister javad zarif showed some optimism about finding a path through the deadlock
" u.s. officials said that all sides , including iran , agree that sanctions would be lifted in phases over time as iran confirms its compliance to the deal
u.s. and european officials worry that could enable iran quickly to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon
even if a pact is reached tuesday , it 's unclear what form it would take , and the u.s. and iran have varying needs
the u.s. would prefer a written accord , but iran has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached
u.s. officials say they will need to quantify iran 's commitments before submitting the agreement to congress
but u.s. and western diplomats say that iran is looking simply for an " understanding " of what has been agreed to before a formal accord is reached
