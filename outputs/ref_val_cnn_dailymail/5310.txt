google play apps will now be scrutinised by google reviewers and come with age - based content ratings , the company has revealed
the announcement is a move away from the firm 's strategy to differentiate itself from apple by allowing developers to immediately publish their mobile apps
but google added that it will not be adopting apple 's practice of only approving apps that meet its stringent quality standards
google is tightening supervision of its freewheeling play store , forming a special team to screen new apps for malware and sexually explicit material , and strengthening its age - based rating system the change underscores the growing importance of apps in the success of the companies ' rival mobile gadgets
google and apple each manage online hubs with more than one million apps ranging from calendars to video games
google said in its official blog today that its expert team will screen each app submitted by developers to spot earlier anything that runs afoul of its rules
the new age - rating system will see android developers filling in a questionnaire about their app or game instead of simply choosing a rating google had only used automated technology for screening at the time of submission
the new process will not create bottlenecks , google said , promising that approved apps will become available on google play within ' a matter of hours ' after submission
developers must answer special questionnaires about their apps to help independent ratings organisations assign age - based ratings , google said
the apps were discovered after prague - based antivirus provider , avast , received a user complaint
