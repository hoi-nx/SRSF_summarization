militants fighting for the islamic state in syria and iraq have issued a new set of rules jihadis must live by - including restrictions on when to utter curses and a ban on women slapping their thighs
among the more unusual commands are orders that men must refrain from swearing while playing billiards or table football , and information on exactly when it is permitted for women dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs
militants : a fighter calling himself abu ' umar al-masri , who claims to be based in the terrorists ' capital raqqa ( pictured ) , tweeted photographs of flyers containing fatwas imposed on local residents in recent weeks dictats : each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group 's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by isis each of the 32 paper fatwas seen in abu ' umar al-masri 's tweets last month are numbered and dated , and are written in arabic
oppressed : among the more unusual legal explantions is information on exactly when it is permitted for women living under isis to dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs horror : at times the fatwas make harrowing reading , such as the rule justifying jihadis burning ' unbelievers ' to death because the muhammad ordered his enemies ' eyes to be gouged out with hot iron the fatwas issued by the islamic state are highly bureaucratic , demanding fighters hand over one fifth of all money and items looted to the terror group 's officials , insisting fighters can not leave territory under isis control under any circumstances , and banning women from showing their eyes
at times they make for harrowing reading , such as the rule justifying jihadis burning ' unbelievers ' to death because the muhammad ordered his enemies ' eyes to be gouged out with hot irons
the bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters , such as when citizens are due compensation , how women should ensure they are dressed , and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor
despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months , they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of islamic state passports is banned as they enable citizens to ' travel to the lands of disbelief ' - something expressly forbidden in an earlier dictat
on a lighter note , both billiards and table football are allowed - albeit under strict conditions and with a warning that god does not look particularity favourably on such trivial pursuits
gambling on matches is , predictably , banned , but so is using table football characters shaped like humans , as the creation of anything imitating humans or animals is banned under isis ' exceptionally strict interpretation of islamic law
fatwa 41 : december 17 , 2014 women can carry weapons such as ak-47s rifles under their robes providing they do not add definition to her body , luring men into temptation
fatwa 42 : december 17 , 2014 female nurses must not work in an office with a male doctor unless they have a male guardian
if a female doctor can not be found , then it is permissible to see a male doctor , but on the condition that he not be alone with her
fatwa 45 : december 17 , 2014 a woman must travel with a male guardian at all times fatwa 46 : december 17 , 2014 women whose husbands have been killed must be punished if they try to leave isis - held territory for the lands of the unbelievers
fatwa 48 : december 20 , 2014 you must not sell islamic state passports to allow citizens to travel to the land of unbelievers
fatwa 49 : december 28 , 2014 it is permissible to play billiards providing the game does not allow gambling , encourage cursing , or inhibit the worshiping or god fatwah 50 : december 28 , 2014 it is permissible to play foosball [ table football ] providing the game does not allow gambling , encourage cursing , feature characters in human or animal form , or inhibit the worshiping or god
brutal : the bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters , such as how women should dress and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor fatwa : despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months , they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of islamic state passports is banned as they enable citizens to ' travel to the lands of disbelief ' one chilling fatwa appears to confirm reports that isis operates an organ harvesting scheme
' it is permissible to transplant the healthy organs of the body of an apostate to the body of a muslim , in order to save the latter 's life or improve his condition if he has lost organs , ' the letter states ' the jurists of the shafi'i and hanbali schools of islamic law , among others , permitted killing belligerent unbelievers or apostates and eating their flesh as a life - saving measure
ak-47s assault rifles , one fatwa insists , are perfectly acceptable to be carried beneath a women 's clothes , providing it does n't add definition to her body that could be deemed tempting to men
it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in iraq and syria , where isis has proclaimed what it calls a ' caliphate ' , ruled by its often brutal version of islamic law
