wrapped up in a long brightly - colored scarf , which does little to contain her free - flowing curly hair , nneka sits back quietly as she tries to bring to mind her very first memory of music
" i was a kid , " the nigerian singer finally says , her thoughts traveling back to warri , the niger delta city where she grew up
" funny wise , like 25 years later i was in lagos and i heard the same melody -- it was amazing ! " nneka 's first musical recollection might be firmly rooted in her birthplace , but the award - winning singer 's career was destined to begin thousands of miles away from home -- the daughter of a nigerian father and a german mother , nneka moved to hamburg at the age of 19 to study anthropology
and now , the soulful singer is back with a brand new , self - released album -- " my fairy tales " is a formidable collection of rich afrobeat grooves , reggae - tinged beats and uplifting rhythms that reaffirm her place as one of the continent 's most exciting -- and relevant -- artists
cnn 's african voices caught up with nneka in london to talk about music , memories and the current situation in nigerian -- as well as present her with the questions you sent via the # asknneka and # cnnafrica hashtags
cnn : in the past , you 've dealt with issues ranging from the environment and politics , to religion and love -- what are the themes that you 're emphasizing at this moment ? nneka : what is happening in africans at present concerns me a lot
we as nigerian , we 're not united , that has always been the issue ... that 's our problem , tribalism , and what belongs to whom
he [ goodluck jonathan ] says he wants to tackle boko haram , obviously every nigerian is asking why now , he could had done it a long time ago ... but i 'm not good at the whole blaming game , i do n't want to blame anybody but i pray that he comes up with a good idea for us if he is an honest and genuine guy
cnn : what is the power of music and how can it influence things to bring positive change ? nneka : music is very powerful , music is big ; music is even more powerful than politics at present
beyonce would definitely draw more crowd than [ nigerian president ] goodluck jonathan if she was going to hold a speech -- if beyonce is going to talk about boko haram , many people are going to listen , and if she had something to tell nigerian about love or whatever , many people are going to listen
cnn : how do you see the political and security situation now in nigerian ? nneka : all i can say is that we do need proper leadership
your questions nneka : my personal life always inspires me , in the first place , and then i try to expand it to the world
