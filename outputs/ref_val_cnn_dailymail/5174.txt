a drinking game popular in mexico city takes shock - factor to the extreme as friends affirm their macho status by competing over who can handle the most electricity , and they connect themselves to a live current
known as ' toques ' - spanish for ' touches ' - the game has seen a recent surge in popularity through the city , and has seen players ' nights - out cut short by urgent visits to the emergency room
' the drunker people get , the more voltage they can generally handle , ' says javier , who has worked the lively condesa neighbourhood of mexico city for the past 35 years
' it gives you a jolt and you feel good afterwards , ' he told the mailonline , who watched as he withstood 85 volts of electricity passing up his left arm and then down his right
' javier walks a circuit of the bars and restaurants in the trendy party district from 3pm until the early hours of the morning , clicking together the metal handles that players hold onto to complete the electric circuit , which can reach up to 120 volts
' i 've been hired to offer the game at private events : weddings , funerals , sweet 16 birthday parties , town fairs , political dinners , pretty much everything
' ' fun ' : despite pictures suggesting the contrary , some people claim they enjoy the sensation device : the two handles send volts of electricity through the player 's body , starting off at just 20 volts secret cure : it is also claimed a game of toques can make your hangover less severe in the morning each round costs Â£ 1.50 , and javier can expect to make more than Â£ 300 on a lively weekend in condesa , one of mexico city 's most popular nightlife districts
' the mailonline tried its hand at toques , and can report difficulty in typing up the experience the following day
a tingling sensation is apparent at around twenty volts , which increases in intensity and reach , as the dial is turned up towards the 120 - volt maximum
it 's little wonder javier says players rarely surpass 85 volts
the mailonline 's reporter reached 80 and the pain was excruciating
guinea pig : mailonline 's alasdair decided to test his pain threshold against the electricity challenge : according to javier , foreigners are not very good at toques ' excrutiating ' : alasdair can confirm , having reached 80 volts , the game is exceedingly painful low cost : the ' shock box ' only requires eight aa batteries , which last about three weeks although the shocks may be painful , it would take more than 10 times the highest amount to even get close to killing a human being
electric shocks above 2,700 volts can be fatal to human beings - with shocks above 11,000 volts considered ' usually fatal '
for burns to occur , there would need to be somewhere between 500 and 1,000 volts of electricity - although defibrillators can use up to 1,000 volts to get a heart beating once more
more than 2.5million people in the uk suffer a mains voltage electric shock per year , according to statistics from electrical safety first
a voltage of approximately 1,000 volts was applied for two minutes in order to kill him
' the average score is from 70 to 85 volts , ' says javier , who recommends that his more zealous clients undergo regular two - minute 40 - volt sessions in the belief that the electricity helps an individual 's blood pressure and stress levels - although whether the current helps to increase or decrease he does not mention
team sport ? : people can play alone , or in groups like this one - sending electricity through each other not just for the drinkers : ' you 'd be surprised how many people simply enjoy the sensation and will have a go at the end of their lunch hour , without having touched a drop of alcohol that day , ' javier told mailonline ' if you get to the upper limits of the voltage you actually start to feel tingling in your brain , ' said ignacio alonso , a mexico city native who reached 90 volts before screaming for mercy , a trial sandwiched by shots of the rudimentary and potent mescal , a spirit similar to tequila
the maximum of 120 volts is not enough to damage human tissue , although players with heart pacemakers should not take on the challenge .
