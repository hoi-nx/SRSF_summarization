a thousand year - old potion made out of onions , garlic , wine and bile from a cow 's stomach can kill hospital superbugs , scientists claim
the potent 10th century brew - used by anglo saxons to treat a stye ( an abscess on the eyelid ) destroyed 90 per cent of the bacteria on scraps of skin taken from mice with mrsa
the garlic - based ' potion ' , listed in a thousand - year - old anglo-saxon manuscript , has been found to kill off the mrsa superbug university of nottingham microbiologists dr freya harrison and dr steve diggle with the garlic - based ' potion ' the ancient remedy , called bald 's eyesalve , originates from a manuscript in bald 's leechbook - an anglo-saxon leatherbound volume in the british library
after using the solution on lab animals with mrsa - one of the most antibiotic - resistant bugs costing modern health services billions - the researchers described their results as ' astonishing
a strain of the hospital superbug mrsa can be carried by pets and livestock , say scientists who have found evidence the infection can pass from animals to humans
it describes a very specific method of making the solution , including the use of a brass vessel to brew it in , a strainer to purify it and an instruction to leave the mixture for nine days before use
she enlisted the help of microbiologists who believe the potion 's bacteria - killing effect is not due to a single ingredient but the combination used , brewing methods and container material
but researchers found all the ingredients together created the best result the scientists made four separate batches of the remedy using fresh ingredients each time as well as a control treatment using the same quantity of distilled water and brass sheet to mimic the brewing container but without the vegetable compounds
the remedy was tested on cultures of the commonly found - and hard to treat - bacteria staphylococcus aureus in both synthetic wounds and in infected wounds in mice
none of the individual ingredients alone had any measurable effect , but when combined according to the recipe , the mrsa ( mrsa ) populations of bacteria , were almost totally obliterated
microbiologist dr freya harrison , also of the university of nottingham , said : ' we thought bald 's eyesalve might show a small amount of antibiotic activity because each of the ingredients has been shown by other researchers to have some effect on bacteria in the lab. copper and bile salts can kill bacteria and the garlic family of plants make chemicals that interfere with the bacteria 's ability to damage infected tissues
' but unlike many modern antibiotics , bald 's eye salve has the power to breach these defences
