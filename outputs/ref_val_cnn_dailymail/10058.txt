cher has petitioned a court to allow a 96 - year - old woman to return to her home in northern virginia
hill was taken away from her new 95 - year - old husband last year after a court accepted she did not have the mental capacity to enter into a marriage
however , the 68 - year - old singer was so moved by the story of mrs hill and harrison that she has pledged to help mrs hill return home
cher was moved to act after she saw a documentary on hill and her husband harrison a court ruled that hill , left should be removed from her home and transferred to florida
her husband harrison remained at home in virginia but later died a couple of weeks after they were split apart unfortunately mr harrison died several weeks after his wife was taken away
mr harrison died in december , just weeks after hill was taken away to florida on the recommendation of a court - appointed guardian , but a custody dispute continued over who should care for hill and where she should live
cher said she will help pay for needed upgrades to hill 's family home in alexandria
mrs hill 's daughter wright said : ' mom 's coming home ! ' mrs hill was in favour of her mother 's marriage to mr harrison
in december , the court ruled that mrs hill should be moved to florida and later that same month , mr harrison died
the singer said she would pay for any repairs inside the alexandria home and ensure it was suitable for a 96 - year - old woman
