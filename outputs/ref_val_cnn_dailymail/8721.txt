lancashire police chiefs found â no evidence â that attempts to bring smith to justice were blocked a police force accused of covering up smith âs crimes faced claims of a â whitewash â last night after it cleared itself of blame
lancashire police chiefs declared they found â absolutely no evidence â that attempts to bring the paedophile liberal mp to justice were blocked
the internal inquiry contradicts claims by retired detectives that key evidence was â locked away â and they were silenced
labour mp danczuk , whose book about smith âs sordid double life sparked the investigation , last night accused the force of a whitewash
he said there is a â mountain of evidence â that smith was a paedophile and serious failings had allowed him to â get away with his crimes for years â
â it is very disappointing that lancashire lancashire police are unable to accept this and are now trying to rubbish the claims of their own former officers , â mr danczuk added
police suspect smith âs activities as a paedophile could be key to unlocking claims of an establishment child sex ring
jack tasker , a former lancashire detective , who led one of three investigations into smith , said it was stopped because it could have led to the â fall of the government â
home secretary theresa may ( pictured ) insisted spies and police will not face prosecution under the official secrets act if they give evidence to the police or the home office âs abuse inquiry he claims his 1969 inquiry into abuse at cambridge house care home was stalled by special branch officers who confiscated his notes and ordered him to forget the matter
â another ex-officer , tony robinson , said he had advised lancashire police to look at the case file he found locked in a special branch safe in the 1970s
