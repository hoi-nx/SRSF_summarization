california will run out of water in 12 months , according to a nasa scientist
the state only has one year of supply left in its reservoirs due to persistent drought and is also running out of backup groundwater , jay famiglietti , senior water scientist at the nasa jet propulsion laboratory , wrote
the drought means that total water storage in california , which has been in decline since 2002 , has been sapped by the need to use the resource for farming , he said in the los angeles times
jay famiglietti suggested immediate water - rationing measures , which are being considered in southern california , across the state
he also urged the acceleration of task forces and programs meant to ensure that california will have enough water in the future , which are currently slated to ' achieve sustainability ' in 2042
snowpacks in california mountains like the sierra nevadas , which the state relies to melt into water , have been near record lows this year
jay famiglietti said that ' the public remains detached from discussions and decisions ' about conserving water and urged them to take ownership of the crisis .
