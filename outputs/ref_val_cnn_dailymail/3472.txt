walt disney world resort is a real life magic kingdom for millions yet not even the grandest of shows or white knuckle rides will match the atmosphere in the creaking , cavernous citrus bowl on sunday afternoon
a sell - out crowd of 62,000 will make their way downtown to witness orlando city , led out by brazilian legend kaka , in their inaugural mls match against another fellow newcomer in the shape of new york city fc
david villa is expected to make his mls debut against orlando city fc on sunday for new york city brazilian star kaka will also play in the match on sunday , for the new mls franchise orlando city the match will take place at florida 's citrus bowl , which was a venue at the 1994 usa world cup it âs an opening day fixture to get the marketing men salivating
yet while the newfangled new york city franchise have literally started from scratch , this match , shown live on sky sports in the uk , marks the culmination of four years of hard work and realised dreams
former everton midfielder heath has guided orlando city to mls after four years of hard work heath 's appointment came after a chance meeting with rawlins ( right ) , who was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes out of work after not having a caretaker stint at coventry city turn into a permanent role , the 54 year - old had already witnessed what effect the beautiful game was having in the us during a pre-season tour which took him to the fanatical footballing hotbed of portland
at this point , leaving the usl pro , the third tier of the south american soccer scene , and joining mls was more than a pipedream
so rawlins upped sticks and relocated everyone to florida
orlando city tweeted this about how lampard wo n't be at the game and wrote : ' sorry , frank - we 're sold out ' a first championship was secured in their inaugural season and , impressively , a fan base in a state which has enjoyed its fair share of disappointments following the folding of mls side fusion in 2002 ( fusion were based in fort lauderdale , a good 200 miles away ) , the orlando natives got straight behind the lions
unlike new york city , there is a strong feeling of continuity allied with a natural connection to the city
new york city fc manager jason kreis will lead his team out for their first ever mls match on sunday new york city fc will begin in front of a 62,000 sell - out crowd against orlando city at citrus bowl in florida yet not everything came easily

naturally , his wealth and business expertise have ensured orlando city âs dream has become a striking reality
so where better to start an anglo-american - brazilian franchise ? an impressive 20,000 were at a championship match against charlotte
mls could n't deny them again
new york city have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase flavio augusto da silva ( left ) has been key to the progress of orlando city since his arrival in february 2013 unlike in miami when it comes to david beckham , they are right behind his plans , so much so that , after agreeing a public and private partnership plan , a brand spanking new 19,500 stadium could be ready for the start of next season
oh , and he is friends with kaka
kaka is the man heath is building his team and vision around
da silva and rawlins â business plan has been ticking all the boxes so it will be fascinating to see how heath adapts to mls and the injection of quality he will encounter week in , week out
kaka - orlando city the brazilian won the ballon dâor back in 2007 , so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new mls franchise orlando city
