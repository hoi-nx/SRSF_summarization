england proposals for men âs team gb football at the rio olympics have already been kicked into the long grass by the other home nations â and the women âs hopes are going in the same direction

nothing sums up sepp blatter âs presidential election trickery more than the decision to have a special meeting in zurich to decide future numbers of world cup places â the day after the uefa congress vote in may
