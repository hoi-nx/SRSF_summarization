ed miliband is so unimpressive that mums would rather hear about politics from phillip schofield , a new poll shows today

the survey suggests that mums are more interested in the political views of this morning hosts phillip schofield and holly willoughby some 15 per cent of mums were impressed by cameron and nigel farage , followed by 10 per cent who said snp leader nicola sturgeon
only 4 per cent were impressed by lib dem nick clegg some 10 per cent were interested in sugar star sugar 's political opinions , another 10 per cent said janet street porter
the survey suggests that 80 per cent of so - called asda mums are planning to vote , equivalent to 8.4million women
and two thirds have still not made up their mind about who to back on polling day
hayley tatum , from asda , said : ' with 80 of mums planning to turn up and cast their vote on polling day , asda mums are an incredibly powerful force and most of them have n't made up their minds on which they 'll vote so it 's still all to play for
' mums want politicians to be honest , passionate and straight - talking , to have real - world experience , ideally gained in jobs outside of politics , and to do what 's right for them and the country â it 's definitely substance over style that matters most to mums
