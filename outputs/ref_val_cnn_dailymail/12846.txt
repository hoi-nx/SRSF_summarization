hong kong " go back home ! " " locusts ! you 're not welcome here ! " these were just some of the insults hurled at chinese shoppers sunday as hundreds of hong kongers surged through through the old neighborhood of yuen long , an area close to the city 's border with chinese
it was the latest in a series of angry protests that have seen brawls erupt in humdrum shopping malls , with demonstrators singling out the " parallel traders " who crowd into hong kong to purchase tax - free products and then resell them for a profit back in chinese
" i 've grown up here , and ever since a lot of the chinese started coming into hong kong , things have changed , " said suen , a law student who only gave her surname
local residents say the traders are not only disturbing the peace , but are driving up the price of food , rent , and gutting local neighborhoods of their character - the city has become a blur of jewelers , pharmacies and other businesses that cater primarily to chinese shoppers
" tensions have long been simmering between hong kong and the motherland , and parallel trading is just one of the thorny issues brought about by the influx of mainland chinese to the city
a series of food scandals -- most notably in 2008 when melamine - tainted milk powder caused infant deaths across chinese -- led to shortages of baby milk formula in hong kong as chinese flocked to buy up the city 's supplies
last year , 31 million chinese visitors traveled to hong kong , accounting for 78 % of all tourists , according to the government
there are the day - trippers , wheeling suitcases and carting boxes of goods and supplies across the border , but there is also an increasing number of wealthy mainland chinese who are buying up luxury properties , and visit the city on a regular basis
both the chinese and hong kong government have encouraged mainland tourists to visit the city and boost the local economy
relaxed restrictions have made it easy for chinese residents to get a hold of individual multiple - entry permits -- some mainlanders enter hundreds of times a year on a single pass
in a speech last tuesday , the city 's pro-beijing leader c.y. leung announced that his government would examine restricting mainland visitors , acknowledging the pressure the crowds have had on the everyday lives of hong kong residents
according to a recent survey by the chinese university of hong kong , the number of hong kong residents identifying primarily as " chinese " has dipped to an all - time low since the former british colony was returned to chinese control in 1997
" earlier in 2012 , plans to add chinese civic education into the hong kong public school curriculum caused an uproar , resulting in a city - wide protest with locals claiming it would " brainwash " school children with pro-mainland propaganda
hong kong , ruled under chinese 's principle of " one country , two systems , " means the city is a officially part of chinese , but is allowed rights and freedoms unseen in other chinese cities
that 's why people in hong kong feel an increasing sense of resentment and helplessness when it comes to solving the complex , growing rift between their city and mainland chinese
a small but growing minority of disgruntled activists go as far as to say hong kong should not belong to chinese at all
" many mainland chinese are bewildered by the anger directed at them
