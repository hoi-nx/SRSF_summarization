dame maggie smith , whose tart - tongued lady violet crawley has most of the best lines on " downton , " caused a fuss this week when she implied that her beloved character wo n't be around much longer
" i mean , ( my character ) certainly ca n't keep going , " maggie smith told the times

maggie smith even hinted during her interview with the times that the next season of the hit show would be its last
" they say this is the last one , and i ca n't see how it could go on , " maggie smith let drop
