a new report from the office of the director of national intelligence shows inmates released from the u.s. military detention center at guantanamo bay , cuba are still returning to the battlefield and fighting against the u.s. and other western nations
since releases began under president bush , 116 men held in the facility famous for interrogations and orange jumpsuits have been ' confirmed of reengaging ' in hostilities , according to odni
of those , 23 are back in custody and 25 are dead â including some killed by u.s. drone strikes and other military operations
but 68 are at large , including 5 released by president obama since his 2008 campaign pledge to close ' gitmo ' forever
clapper , the u.s. director of national intelligence , testified in a feb. 26 senate hearing that 2014 will go down as the deadliest year for terrorism since records were first kept gtmo , cuba is a political flashpoint with republicans wanting to keep terrorists outof harm 's way and democrats believing the facility 's continued operation inflames hostilities against u.s. obama 's batting average looks far better than bush 's on paper
more than 20 per cent of the guantanamo bay detainees released by order of the former president are once again considered enemy combatants in the war on terror
among obama 's releases , that number barely hits 5 per cent
but a retired u.s. military intelligence officer told daily mail online that the numbers are misleading
' are there more bush transfers back at it than obama transfers ? probably not , ' he said
' but the intelligence community has had more than six years to track bush 's
six years from now obama 's numbers will look pretty much the same
' ' these guys do n't rejoin al-qaeda overnight
' it can take some time for us to identify ( former detainees ) on the field of battle , ' said the spokesman , brian rogers , ' and it would make sense that some recent releases may not yet have been identified or engaged
' director of national intelligence clapper concludes his report by predicting that the problem of guantanamo bay recidivism is n't going away
obama sent six of them in 2009 , according to data compiled by the new york times and npr
' the obama administration has clear guidelines about what qualifies as terrorist recidivism
lockup , extended stay : president obama pledged to close the prison by early 2010 but has struggled to transfer , try or release the remaining detainees from the facility new concerns about stocking islamist terror armies with new recruits via guantanamo bay releases come as terrorism incidences and casualties are on the rise
the sprawling guantanamo bay prison complex on the island of cuba is still home to 122 detainees , a number that the white house wants to see dip below 100 in order to make the facility 's eventual closure seem inevitable
time out : republican want to pass a 2 - year moratorium on new guantanamo bay prisoner releases but the last month a quartet of republican senators led by kelly ayotte of new hampshire introduced a bill that would make it harder to send anyone home from guantanamo bay
the congressional time - out would last for two years , essentially tying obama 's hands unti lthe end of his term in office
