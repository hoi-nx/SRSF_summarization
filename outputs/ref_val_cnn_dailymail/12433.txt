they 're the backbone of public transport in ugandan and the fastest way to get around the capital city , kampala
the boda boda motorbike taxi is a staple used by all sectors of society
but now , a new local startup are bringing this classic mode of transport into the technological age by providing the ability to hail a boda boda at the click of a smartphone
" bodas are the main thing getting people from a to b , " says sussock , co-founder of safeboda , " and we 're trying to professionalize this transportation in the city
" the motorbike taxis have their greatest popularity globally in ugandan , with over 80,000 riding the streets of kampala , according to sussex who wants to seize upon the country 's burgeoning young population
ugandan has more than 24 % of the population aged between 10 and 19 years old , according to unicef -- and sussock wants them to get on their bikes
for now , the uber - like startup operates mainly in the northern districts of kampala , where a click on the safeboda app -- in addition to the traditional method of hailing them on the street -- will bring you a safeboda bike , complete with a uniformed driver in a bright orange jacket , helmet and fully trained in road safety
safety has long been a concern for those riding boda bodas as the bikes are a leading cause of death and head injury in kampala
a study conducted at mulago national referral hospital in kampala , by researchers at makerere university , identified approximately 40 % of trauma cases at the hospital to be due to boda - boda accidents
i request a safeboda to take me to meet the team in the upmarket area of kisementi , in kampala 's central district
lalunga has been a boda driver for four years and joined safeboda four months ago to learn more about road safety
this makes many fearful of catching a two - wheeled ride but the team at safeboda are trying to lure people back on board
driver training is provided in partnership with the ugandan red cross and takes place for up to three weeks to cover road safety and bike maintenance -- and it seems to be working
