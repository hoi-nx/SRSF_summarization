texas sen. ted cruz will announce monday that he is launching his campaign to become the 2016 gop nominee for president
ted cruz has been positioning for this nomination almost since he entered the upper chamber in 2012
ted cruz is going to run from the right
" during a recent visit to new hampshire , where he vowed to eliminate the department of education and the internal revenue service , ted cruz said that " i 'm pretty sure , here in new hampshire , y'all define gun control like we do in texas : gun control is when you hit at what you aim at
" fifty years ago , another gop senator ran this kind of campaign , arizona 's barry goldwater , who took on president johnson
ted cruz will test the conventional wisdom that barry goldwater 's strategy was and remains a failure
when republicans voted to nominate him in 1964 , barry goldwater told the delegates that " extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice
" when the icon of moderate gop , new york gov. nelson rockefeller , spoke to the convention , the delegates hissed and booed
the outcome was far from great for the gop
although barry goldwater was clearly wrong when he ran in 1964 , ted cruz thinks that the times have changed
even as the gop has shifted to the right in recent decades , gop candidates who have obtained the nomination , and those who have also won the presidency , always developed campaign themes that allowed them to appeal to broader coalitions than voters on the extremes
notwithstanding the conventional wisdom , even in primaries it seems that gop voters understand the importance of finding someone who has the potential to win in november
the gop has been dragged down by the kind of politics that voters have observed in washington
many voters who like conservatism and the gop do n't love what their representatives are doing on capitol hill
when barry goldwater squared off against johnson in 1964 , the president predicted that there would be a " frontlash " of gop and independent voters who would move way from the gop just because barry goldwater was at the top of the ticket
" the electorate is not as likely to experience any dramatic swings like we saw in midwestern states in 1964 , where solidly gop areas went democrats because they were scared off by barry goldwater , but a ted cruz campaign could be exactly what democrats need to cement victories in the swing states where the outcome is still uncertain
