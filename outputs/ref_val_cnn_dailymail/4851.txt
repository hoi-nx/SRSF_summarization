their championship promotion rivals derby , norwich , sheffield wednesday and nottingham forest have also registered an interest in blackburn âs record Â£ 8m signing who still has four - and - a - half years left on his contract at ewood
but having rejected a Â£ 12m offer from hull city last summer , blackburn âs owners venky âs are reluctant to sell while their club still have an outside chance of reaching the playoffs following this win , as well as the prospect of a fa cup quarter - final replay with liverpool next month

â i ca nât answer on behalf of middlesbrough but jordan rhodes has just scored the winner and he will be starting at charlton on saturday
substitute craig davies wasted bolton âs best chance when he raced clear only to shoot straight at jason steele , and jordan rhodes should have scored with a 79th - minute header from close - range before making amends at the death
