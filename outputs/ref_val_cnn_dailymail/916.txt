it 's a key question to consider when making a hotel booking - do you want a lot of everything or the best of a few things ? as hotels launched its first venue in piccadilly , london last week , it was clear that this kind of question provides the thinking behind its brand
to find out what guests really want , london - based hotel group glh conducted research over the last two years , most recently asking 4,000 adults globally what matters most when staying in a hotel
each room at hotels ' new location in piccadilly boasts a hypnos bed and a complimentary mini-bar top three were a great night 's sleep ( 86 per cent ) , no hidden extras ( 81 per cent ) and fast and efficient check - in ( 67 per cent )
the piccadilly venture is the first to open in london , with sites in hyde park , leicester square and bloomsbury next on the agenda
every hotels has opened its first london location in piccadilly , with three others planned mailonline travel stayed the night to see whether they 'd got the balance just right
piccadilly offers modern , well - equipped rooms with hypnos beds , nespresso machines , complimentary mini-bar , free wifi , a great location , hosts genuinely knowledgeable about the local area and the opportunity to choose your room before you arrive
what strikes me is that senior executives involved with the project are very realistic ; in the sense that they recognise there are many restaurants and bars to choose from in central london , that tourists will spend most of their time walking around , and that most businessmen will have office meetings in offices
the complimentary mini-bar is a nice touch
richard sofer , ceo hotels , said : ' what came out loud and clear was that guests wanted a great room with great tech , in a great location
' so , not only is our wifi complimentary , but so are our mini-bars , nespresso machines , printing facilities and in room entertainment
