the university of mary washington has suspended activities for its men 's rugby team after officials there said an audio recording captured some team members chanting a song with lyrics that seemed to condone abuse toward women and even necrophilia
in an email to the university community on march 19 , president hurley said the school imposed sanctions because the team 's actions violated its code of conduct for club sports
according to the school , the recording featured several team members at an off - campus party at the end of the fall semester
( she was right and dead ! ) well god d * * * son of a b * * * * we 're gon na get it in ! ( god d * * * son of a b * * * * we 're gon na get it in ! ) finally got it in ( finally got it in ! ) wiggle it all about ( wiggle it all about ! ) god d * * * son of a b * * * * i could n't get it out ( god d * * * son of a b * * * * we could n't get it out ! ) finally got it out ( finally got it out ! ) it was red and sore ( it was red and sore ! ) moral of the story is never f * * * a wh * * * ! source ' finally found a whore , ' begins the call and response song
in the months thereafter , the school 's chapter of feminists united got involved , with their president mckinsey writing an opinion piece in the school paper when the club decided initial sanctions against the team were n't enough
' as soon as feminists united started affecting change on campus , we were faced with aggression and hatred , ' mckinsey wrote , saying the group was attacked anonymously through the app yik yak
they were targeted by members of the student body , who attacked them through the anonymous app yik yak at an off - campus party at the close of the fall 2014 semester , several members of theumw men 's rugby club engaged in a chant that contained sexually explicit , derogatory , and violent language
understanding that the offensive chant is antithetical to university of mary washington values , and will not be tolerated , the university of mary washington pursued action against the men 's rugby club
at the beginning of the current semester , sanctions were imposed on the rugby club for willful violations of university of mary washington 's code of conduct for club sports
after an appeal by the accused , the disciplinary process concluded on march 18 with this ruling : all rugby club activities have been suspended indefinitely
further , each member of the men 's rugby club is required to participate in education and training sessions regarding sexual assault and violence
it not only violates our community values , it is not how members of this collegial campus live , and it is not reflective of the university of mary washington we all know and love
in addition , the team must participate in sensitivity training and education sessions
censured : the school administration doubled down on an earlier censure of the rugby club by suspending their activities indefinitely and requiring them to attend sexual assault education courses
