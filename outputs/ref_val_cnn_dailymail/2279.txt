speaking on itv âs this morning , dr chris steele explained what each shade of pee â from clear to red to green and blue â tells us about the body
his first piece of advice is to look at the colour of urine while peeing , rather than when it has hit the toilet bowl
however , it could be due to blood in the urine , signalling an infection , or tumours or kidney stones he told presenters phillip schofield and amanda holden : ' you should look at the colour in the stream that you âre passing , not when it âs in the toilet bowl , because it gets diluted in two litres of water
clear urine could be a sign of a â good hydrated person â , dr chris steele said
if it is darker , it suggests the person is dehydrated he added : â they might be drinking diuretic - type drinks , such as coffee and alcohol
a deep yellow coloured urine means the person is more dehydrated
if a person 's urine is brown , it could be a sign of liver disease
if it is red , it could contain blood orange urine is normally a sign of dehydration , but could be a liver or bile duct disorder
blue or green urine is normally due to food dye or medication â deep yellow urine could be a sign of liver problems which cause jaundice of the skin , eyes , and the urine to become more yellow
if a person has red - coloured urine , it could be because they ate certain foods the night before
dr chris steele said : â beetroot , blackberries , blackcurrants even rhubarb [ are all common culprits ]
it could also be due to a tumour , or kidney stones
â but the commonest reasons for red urine is cystitis - or urinary tract infections , â dr chris steele said
â a person with dark red urine is deeply dehydrated , he warned
â we âre talking about patients with liver disease , ' he explained
