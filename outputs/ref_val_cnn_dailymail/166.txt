the labour has been accused of using the x-ray of a victim of child abuse in an attack advert
medical experts claim the image of a broken leg depicts injuries consistent with a history of violence on a child aged three to five
the advert was launched by ed miliband 's party last week accusing the tories of wanting to cut the nhs ' to the bone ' , despite tory assurances that the health budget would be protected
labour launched the poster last week claiming the conservative party would not protect the health service from cuts the controversial image was unveiled on friday by shadow chancellor balls and shadow health secretary burnham as labour 's ' first poster of the 2015 general election campaign '
it showed the x-ray of a broken leg bone , under the headline : next time , they 'll cut to the bone
' it also featured the tagline : ' the nhs ca n't afford the tory cuts plan
but experts said it appeared to be ' very likely non-accidental injury ' , suggesting the broken bone could have been inflicted intentionally
prof christopher colton , emeritus consultant in orthopaedic and accident surgery , nottingham university hospital , told the telegraph : ' if that x-ray presented itself at a hospital , all the alarm bells would ring for possible non-accidental injury
