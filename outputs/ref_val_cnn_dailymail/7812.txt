gibson is sitting in a restaurant in wimbledon , recalling the 12 absurd and wonderful chapters of his life that were spent in this part of town
â in time , gibson will come back to the sore point of how the wimbledon side of the eighties was represented in a recent documentary
gibson laughs whilst recalling his eventful spell playing for wimbledon 's crazy gang he will address the myth that the crazy gang was ruled by the bullying of fashanu and vinnie jones , even if there is a memory of the former stripped to his underpants and covered in baby oil ahead of a dressing - room fight
but , for now , gibson wants to laugh rather than seethe
the little striker , who won the fa cup , once told alex where to go and pocketed Â£ 200 for scouting zabaleta , wants to present a fuller picture of life at plough lane
â just after we won the fa cup in 1988 players were getting sold and he was desperate for gould to give him a big move
just another day at wimbledon
â the wimbledon players celebrate having won the 1988 fa cup at wembley against favourites liverpool gibson poses for the camera when speaking to sportsmail 's riath al-samarrai about his career gibson laughs
â gibson adds : â my first day at the club , i saw wisey pinching the volkswagen badge off vinnie jones âs dad âs truck
â fashanu , in action during his wimbledon playing days , was certainly a character in the crazy gang gibson , like most associated with the programme , the crazy gang , has taken exception to claims from fashanu that he was â the leader â and ruled by fear
â the truth is we tolerated fash , â says gibson , who spent six years at the club
but there was so much more to how wimbledon achieved what we did
stitches , etc. gibson was former team - mate sanchez 's assistant at wycombe , northern ireland and fulham â the lad was robbie and , as i remember it , fash strips to his pants and covers himself in baby oil
â a deeper perspective is found in gibson âs new book , giant killer
the book charts his rise from spurs , to coventry , to united and on to the high points at wimbledon , before gibson became sanchez âs assistant at northern ireland , fulham and wycombe
the 52 - year - old , in action for wimbledon ( right ) works for sky sports , commenting on spanish football â the game changed a bit in those three decades , â he says
â it was at coventry that gibson played alongside sam and pearce
â we went to bisham abbey once , â gibson says
wimbledon players in training during the crazy gang era with fashanu ( centre ) and vinnie jones â next thing there is a huge crash
â after three good years at coventry , gibson joined united for a difficult 18 months , in which he repeatedly felt â belittled â by atkinson
â you could see the glow of his sunbed from the training pitch , â gibson says
â at one point , gibson pulled out of a move to watford because he correctly anticipated atkinson would be sacked and a fresh start might await
â alex was always honest with me â a good man , â gibson says
gibson endured a difficult 18 months at united ( left ) and was brought to wimbledon in 1987 â the next morning i went to apologise and he said he admired my spirit
â gould brought gibson to wimbledon in 1987 â the manager allegedly ate 12 sheep testicles to get sam hammam to sanction the move â and his playing career re-started
â i could have done a book on wimbledon alone , â he says
there was also a Â£ 200 - a - week scouting position for manchester city in spanish that saw him recommend zabaleta
these days the 52 - year - old commentates on spanish football for sky sports and is happy to be out of the thick of it
