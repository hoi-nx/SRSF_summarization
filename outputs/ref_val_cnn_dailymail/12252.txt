isis militants kidnapped 20 foreigners working at a libya hospital , then released them -- under the condition , if they want to live , that they stay put so they can treat members of the islamist extremist group , a hospital official said
about 30 gunmen tied to the group calling itself the islamic state stormed ibn sina hospital in sirte on monday while a bus was waiting to take the workers to tripoli , libya 's capital
the medical workers were later released and sent back to their homes near the medical facility , a hospital official said tuesday
but they ca n't go far , with isis militants ordering them not to leave sirte , according to the official
one of those kidnapped , a doctor from uzbekistan , was told he is safe as long as he did n't leave , and he treated any militants who were wounded , the hospital official said
in the years since , sirte has become a home to isis
" like the egypt , the medical workers kidnapped monday are foreigners , having come to sirte to work
the ibn sina hospital official believes the extremist group went after the workers -- who 'd been trying to flee sirte 's precarious security situation -- because they make up the only medical team there and might be needed to treat isis militants
isis branched out into libya last year , with cnn reporting in november that fighters loyal to the group had complete control of derna , a city of about 100,000 near the egypt border
militants who 've pledged allegiance to isis also have made their mark in points westward , forming chapters in cities including sirte , benghazi and tripoli , according to noman benotman , a former libya jihadist now involved in counterterrorism as head of the quilliam foundation
