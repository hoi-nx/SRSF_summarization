after a game millwall just had to win in order to retain any hope of survival , the supporters warmly applauded as they trudged off
the fans realise what dreadful circumstances interim manager neil harris has pitched up in
the lions looked every bit a side to have scored just three goals in their previous eight games ; plenty of huff , but very little puff
had brighton âs bennett not crashed the bar from 25 yards and later blazed wildly over , it might âve been worse
millwall now look consigned to relegation and upbeat neil harris will treat the remaining eight fixtures as an audition for when the club make a permanent decision on holloway âs successor in the summer
