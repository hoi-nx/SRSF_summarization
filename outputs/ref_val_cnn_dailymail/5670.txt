women taking hrt could cut their risk of heart disease and an early death â as long as they start in their 50s , according to researchers
data from 40,000 patients found that those taking the drugs from this age were less likely to die prematurely from any cause and the threat of a heart attack was halved
there was , however , a slightly raised risk of blood clots
an estimated one million women in uk take hormone replacement therapy to control symptoms of the menopause and experts believe taking it in your 50s could help cut the risk of early death and heart attacks hrt is given to control symptoms of the menopause and is usually taken by women in their early 50s
when evidence from those across a wider age range was examined , it showed oral hrt did not protect against heart disease and may increase stroke risk
â when we looked at the results according to the age of women , or by how long since their menopause that they started treatment , we found that if 1,000 women under 60 started therapy we would expect six fewer deaths , eight fewer cases of heart disease and five extra blood clots over about seven years , compared to a 1,000 similar women who did not start
â an estimated one million women in the uk take hrt for symptoms like hot flushes and mood changes although it also protects bones

in women under 60 or who started hrt within ten years of the menopause , there was a 30 per cent drop in deaths from any cause and a 48 per cent lower risk of coronary heart disease
