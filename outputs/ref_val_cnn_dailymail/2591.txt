labor âs penny sharpe , who is looking to become a member of the legislative assembly , and sydney state independent mp greenwich are both using the app in a bid to get as many votes as possible
the two gay politicians are following up on the example set by greens candidate hibbins who won a seat in prahran in november âs victorian state election
labor âs penny sharpe ( left ) and sydney state independent mp greenwich ( right ) are using the grindr app to reach out to the electorate hibbins was one of australia âs first politicians to use hook - up apps as a method to reach voters successfully
he used the grindr app to send political messages to members of melbourne âs prahran electorate , living in the suburbs of prahran , windsor , south yarra and st kilda east , as the candidate campaigns ahead of the election
grindr is a smartphone app to facilitate casual sex for gay men however , it was mr hibbins who was the original trailblazer
â this election we 're using grindr to reach voters in prahran , ' mr hibbins wrote on his facebook page before the victorian state election last november
hibbins used grindr to send targeted messages to the homosexual community in his electorate in prahan ahead of last november 's state election in victorian dutch and irish politicians were the first to use grindr to connect with voters
he did not use pop up messages like mr hibbins however , rather transforming his own pre-existing grindr account , changing his profile description to : â let âs have a date on march 19 â to promote a political event about gay issues
