micro-pigs assuming the identities of race horses have been pitted against each other to help predict the winners of the cheltenham feature races
the micro-pigs also dress in accordance with their counterpart and compete against each other on a specially designed miniature course
the brainchild of coral bookmakers , the micro-competition is part of their cheltenham where horse racing fans are able to compete for free bets
the micro-pigs each wear the colours of their counterpart horse and are paraded in the paddock before the start of the race the commentator then takes the action down to the paddocks and begins introducing the race âs competitors
a member of the crowd wears a ladies day - style hat while watching the micro-pig race the micro-pig called kitten trot makes its way over the famous hill and is the eventual winner of the race while not an exact science , considering that faugheen was the winner of the actual champion hurdle race , the competition is certainly a bit of fun
â we ca nât wait to see if any of our micro-pig races successfully predict the winner of the actual races at the cheltenham â we âre hoping they bring home the bacon for our punters
