a university of oklahoma fraternity has been shut down after members were caught chanting the n - word and glorifying lynching in a sickening video - on the same day that president obama spoke at the 50th anniversary of the selma march
the footage , uploaded to youtube sunday , shows members of a sigma alpha epsilon chapter singing that there ' will never be a n * * * * * ' in their fraternity
the footage is believed to have been filmed on saturday - when the rest of the nation was focused on selma , alabama , where the president said the civil rights movement has not yet completed its long march
during the sickening clip the students are clearly heard singing : ' there will never be a n * * * * * sigma alpha epsilon , there will never be a n * * * * * sigma alpha epsilon
' you can hang him from a tree , but he 'll never sign with me , there will never be a n * * * * * sigma alpha epsilon
' a female voice in the background can also be heard asking a friend : ' you 've never heard it before ? ' the footage shows the group on a bus , apparently headed to a party
in the wake of the video , the national leadership of sigma alpha epsilon , which has branches across the country , said the university of oklahoma chapter would be punished
the national organization has some undergraduate 15,000 members brad cohen , the eminent supreme archon of the organization , confirmed that the video was authentic
brad cohen also said the song , which the video participants seemed to know well , was not part of any sigma alpha epsilon traditions
a statement from sigma alpha epsilon said : ' sigma alpha epsilon 's national headquarters has closed its oklahoma kappa chapter at the university of oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video
investigation : university of oklahoma president david boren released a statement via twitter saying the ' behavior will not be tolerated ' ' reprehensible ' : the university 's president , david boren , said investigations were underway and warned this behavior would not be tolerated shut down : national president of sigma alpha epsilon , brad cohen , took to twitter to say the fraternity chapter had been closed and called on the university to expel the students involved ' in addition , all of the members have been suspended , and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently
' timing : while the sigma alpha epsilon members were chanting , president obama was addressing crowds in selma , alabama , on the 50th anniversary of the civil rights marches there anniversary : the sickening chant was made exactly 50 years after the march for civil rights led by dr martin luther king , center above , from selma to montgomery , alabama sigma alpha epsilon has more than 200 chapters across the country , 15,000 undergraduate members and around 200,000 alumni
sigma alpha epsilon âs national headquarters has closed its oklahoma kappa chapter at the university of oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video
we have more than 15,000 collegiate members across the nation , and this incident should not reflect on other brothers because this type of hateful action is not what sigma alpha epsilon stands for
we are hopeful that we can re-establish the oklahoma kappa chapter at some point in the future with a group of men who exemplify our beliefs and who serve as leaders on campus and in the community .
