joy veron , 30 , texas schoolteacher , was on vacation with her family in the colorado mountains
her three small children , then aged between two and seven , ran ahead and got into the family suv , which had its engine running and was parked next to a cliff leading down to a deep canyon
she survived the accident and battled for years to regain her ability to walk , before eventually being forced to accept that she would never walk again happiness : joy veron and her three children , l - r : chloe , 7 , elliot , 2 , annie , 5 , in 1999 , before the tragic accident that left joy veron unable to walk
she threw herself underneath the wheels of a runaway suv to stop it rolling over a cliff with her children inside struggle : after the accident , joy veron travelled to portugal to undergo intensive rehabilitation
she had a stem cell transplant and surgery in an effort to walk again
tragically , she eventually had to accept that she would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life ' i just saw complete fear , ' she told the oprah show
' without thinking , she rushed over and threw herself between the vehicle and the canyon , refusing to let her children die
she continued to struggle with the car even as she found herself being dragged under the wheels
' i just was throwing myself in front of it just to put something in its path , ' she said
i was 30 - years - old and the whole life i knew was gone
deadly : the family suv
it had been left parked with its engine running on the edge of a cliff over a canyon , while the family got ready to drive home to texas from colorado
disaster struck when the three children jumped into the car and it slipped into gear , rolling towards the cliff however , joy veron was so severely injured that everybody thought she was going to die
her children stood around her crying as the emergency services were called
' the back tire basically went this way , and just crushed everything , my lungs , my ribs , my clavicle , ' she recalled , speaking to pbs
' i had my head tilted , and they said that 's what saved my life as the tire went this way
my father put his hand on the brake before it went over the canyon and said , " joy veron , joy veron , i got it ! " and then i remember hearing my mother scream , and then they ran to the back of the car and found me
' this took place in 1999 - she first spoke to oprah in 2004 - and since then much has changed
her children , chloe , 22 , annie , 20 , and elliot , 17 , are thriving ; chloe has just graduated from harvard , and elliot says that his mother is his ' inspiration '
but joy herself , now 46 , will never walk again
' after the show i went to portugal because i 'd really been searching for a cure , ' she told operah winfrey this week , 11 years after the accident , on oprah : where are they now ? ( sundays , 9 p.m. et on own )
i had a stem cell transplant and i went through surgery ... but it did n't make me walk again
maybe not walk in the physical sense , but walk in life ' proud : joy veron with her daughters chloe , 22 ( left ) , and annie , 20 ( right )
when she was going through rehabilitation , joy veron recalled , a doctor told her that 99.2 per cent of marriages ' do not make it ' after the woman suffers a serious injury
after 23 years of marriage , joy veron and her husband also become two more victims of this statistic
recalling their recent divorce was the only moment that joy veron broke down in tears during the interview
' then again , her heroic act of 11 years ago shows that she was full of guts already
