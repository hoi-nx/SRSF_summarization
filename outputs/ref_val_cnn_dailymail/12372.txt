modern women are suffering from an energy crisis
welcome to the increasingly altered states of american
american are about 5 % of the world 's population , yet we take half its pills , and 80 % of its painkillers.this over-medication has led to record numbers of opiate overdoses and also to a growing number of women taking antidepressants -- one out of four and counting , according to a report issued by the pharmacy benefit manager , medco
this is creating a " new normal , " bringing closer the tipping point for when other women will seek chemical assistance
the overuse of psychiatric medication is called cosmetic psychopharmacology , and it 's like cosmetic surgery : as more women get breast implants , the rest of us feel flat chested
but the new normal is n't normal at all
certain antidepressants called ssris ( selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) create artificially stable and elevated levels of serotonin , the brain chemical that helps regulate mood , which can dampen empathy and emotional reactivity , while higher doses can engender apathy
our moods change , and this emotional fluidity helps us to be adaptable and resilient
moodiness -- being sensitive , caring deeply and occasionally being acutely dissatisfied -- is actually a natural source of power
women 's emotionality is a sign of health , not disease , and it is our single biggest psychological asset
nine out of 10 pharmaceutical companies spend less on research and development than marketing.steady doses of antidepressant advertising aimed at women advance the question from " should i take an antidepressant ? " to " which one should i take ? " these medications can have more far - reaching effects than most people realize , blunting empathy , passion , and sensitivity
ssris dampen sexual desire and response , making it difficult to climax and interfering with the evaluation of potential romantic partners
tears , and the emotions beneath them , can offer a profound lesson in how people 's behavior affects others
and yet , women apologize for their tears , especially in the workplace , where we 've been socialized to shut down expressed emotion ; it interferes with our typical agenda of forward - momentum , and it makes people uncomfortable
the problem with shutting it down is that we 're stifling a piece that we need , that our partners and families need , and that society needs , particularly as women continue to ascend to the upper reaches of business and government
the shame that for centuries has been used by our culture to separate men from their true feelings is now spreading to women , who , by their biology , are the last and much needed connection to this natural place
as we embrace new technologies , we need to be careful that we do n't go too far away from nature and what 's natural for us as social primates
