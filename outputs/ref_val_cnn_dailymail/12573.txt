but the frustrated 38 - year - old swede said he " could not see the point " of being put on the clock
" when someone is sitting there with a stopwatch it affects you a little bit , " he explained , accusing officials of " influencing , potentially , the outcome of this tournament towards the end
" " i did n't really have much time to look at my putt [ on the 15th ] and rushed that one a little bit , the first one , and three - putted , " the pga tour website quoted him as saying
" morgan hoffman got a bad time on his second shot on 16 , and again i kind of rushed my putting on 16 and three - putted that one
stenson told reporters that " it 's hard when you do n't feel like you can take the time you want , " adding that he was " disappointed with the rules official for pushing us up late in the round for no obvious reason
