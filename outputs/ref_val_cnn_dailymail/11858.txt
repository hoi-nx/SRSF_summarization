the clinic has denied giving mr brodie smith ibogaine , saying the backpacker from mandurah , australia , injected himself with an overdose of â illegal narcotics â
thailand 's ministry of health took no action over the death - but mr brodie smith 's mother diane tucker has called on the australian government to push for a proper inquiry
she has also identified miller as bea - the glamorous female assistant to the retreat 's principal operators , mike picone and cracknell , both from buffalo , ny
mr cracknell is believed to be the father of miller âs baby boy , who was born two months ago on the island of samui

â another island : ko phangan island was where the unregistered clinic operated by cracknell and picone , both from buffalo , ny , was operating when brodie smith died
a third woman there , bea , has been identified by the dead man 's mother as miller , who was on the run from alabama miller struck and killed donald goodwin while driving drunk on interstate 459 near her home in hoover , just south of birmingham , in september 2004

business : mike picone , of buffalo , ny , was the other business partner in the ibogaine thailand clinic where brodie smith went for treatment before he died
