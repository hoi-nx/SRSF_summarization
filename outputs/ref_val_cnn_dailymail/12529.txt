uk military advisers are training ukraine troops in ukraine , the uk said thursday , as part of efforts to support the government in kiev as it combats pro-russian separatists in the east
prime minister david cameron announced last month that uk would send military advisers to ukraine and provide an additional 15 million pounds ( $ 22.3 million ) in humanitarian aid
in what kremlin observers may see as another sign of defiance , russia signed a treaty wednesday with georgia 's breakaway territory of south ossetia
russia sent its tanks into georgia in 2008 and subsequently encouraged separatists in its south ossetia and abkhazia regions to declare independence from tbilisi
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg condemned the " so - called treaty on alliance and integration " in a statement wednesday , and repeated nato 's call for russia to reverse its recognition of the territories as independent states and to withdraw its forces from georgia soil
" this so - called treaty is yet another move by the russia that hampers ongoing efforts by the international community to strengthen security and stability in the region , " he said
" it violates georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and blatantly contradicts the principles of international law , osce principles and russia 's international commitments
