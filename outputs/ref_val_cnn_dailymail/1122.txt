gonzales , 17 , borrowed the horse from a friend 's ranch and galloped right on up to catalina hernandez 's first period class , holding a sign that said ' will you ride with me to prom ? ' gonzales , 17 , got a little help from a horse named romeo to ask catalina hernandez to the prom the milpitas high school got the idea from the school 's spirit day theme , which was ' salad dressing day '
the milpitas high school senior was suspended for his grand gesture , as the school deemed the horse was a ' potential threat ' to other students walking in the same path
but gonzales will still be able to attend the prom ' but on my way i heard the principal screaming ... i kind of knew i was going to get into trouble
district superintendent cheryl jordan said gonzales was suspended because the horse was a ' potential threat ' to other students who where ' walking in the same path
