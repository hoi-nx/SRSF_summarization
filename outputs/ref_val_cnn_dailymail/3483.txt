the event , which take place in the grounds of craufurdland castle in fenwick , scotland , was first held in 2012 and has quickly gained a reputation as one of the most gruelling races in the cross country calendar
racers must first cross fields and make their way through dense woodland after which they ford several streams before plunging waist deep through dark gooey ditches and dragging the , selves towards the finish line
conditions are so bad that before they set off , runners are advised to tape their shoes to their feet with industrial - strength gaffer tape to stop them getting stuck and coming off in the mud
