tory frontbencher matt hancock said the former prime minister brown was in danger of losing ' heads and hearts ' by likening the uk outside the eu to kim jong un 's pariah state the former pm had earlier claimed leaving europe would leave the uk ' out in the cold with few friends ' and ' no influence ' like north korea
