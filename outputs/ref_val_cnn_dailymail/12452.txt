a group of medical students -- including an u.s. , seven uk and a canada -- may be the latest westerners to join isis
last month , three teenage uk girls suspected of wanting to join isis may have gone to syria , authorities said
an estimated 3,400 westerners have gone to join isis in its bloody quest to establish an islamist state in iraq and syria , said rasmussen , director of the national counterterrorism center
analysts and u.s. officials agree : isis is skilled at luring westerners , attracting far greater numbers than al qaeda
how is it doing this ? isis recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark
" fawaz gerges , professor of middle east studies at the london school of economics , put it more bluntly : " isis provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip
" many recruits come from educated , well - to - do backgrounds , like 25 - year - old abu anwar of uk
he said he had no problem leaving a comfortable lifestyle to join isis
" the names : who has been recruited to isis from the west some are lured by the possibility of dying as a martyr so they can enjoy a sumptuous afterlife
isis loyalists are told they will receive gifts from allah , wrote aqsa mahmood , a young uk woman who left scotland to join isis and now is an isis recruiter
isis ' slick propaganda videos resemble trailers for hollywood action movies
isis now has the most sophisticated propaganda machine of any terrorist organization , said matthew olsen , former director of the national counterterrorism center
even the u.s. state department admits isis ' propaganda prowess " is something we have not seen before
isis " has proven far more adept than core al qaeda -- or any of al qaeda 's affiliates -- at using new media tools to reach a broader audience , " rasmussen said
recruits are also being lured by isis ' success in its endeavor to create an islamic state , analysts say
the intelligence community determined that isis ' battlefield successes gave it " some recruitment success , " white house spokesman josh earnest said in september
" militant groups across the islamic world see the success isis has had so far in syria and iraq and opt to join it -- often leaving behind organizations plagued by infighting , " cnn national security analyst peter bergen wrote in a cnn column
" that type of brainwashing is what turned canada clairmont into an isis militant , said his mother , christianne boudreau
while isis ' recruiting success gets a lot of attention , it is hardly drawing a huge percentage of young westerners
about 130 canada citizens have traveled to the middle east to join isis , canada 's intelligence agency estimated last year
about 1,200 france fighters have joined isis as well
roughly 600 uk nationals are believed to have gone to iraq and syria , according to research groups , along with another 600 from germany
but it 's unclear how many of those were attempting to join isis
once foreigners go to iraq or syria to join isis , their odds of going back to their families can be slim
the u.s. government is trying to step up its efforts to counter isis propaganda by beefing up a small u.s. state department agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants ' messaging
