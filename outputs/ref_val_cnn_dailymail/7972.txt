microsoft is working on an advanced version of its competitor to apple 's siri , using research from an artificial intelligence project called ' einstein
' microsoft has been running its ' personal assistant ' cortana on its windows phones for a year , and will put the new version on the desktop with the arrival of windows 10 this autumn
it has now been revealed cortana will be available as a standalone app , usable on phones and tablets powered by apple 's ios and google 's android , people familiar with the project said
cortana could tell a mobile phone user when to leave for the airport , days after it read an email and realized the user was planning a flight
' this kind of technology , which can read and understand email , will play a central role in the next roll out of cortana , which we are working on now for the fall time frame , ' said horvitz , managing director of microsoft research and a part of the einstein project , in an interview at the company 's redmond , washington , headquarters
the plan to put cortana on machines running software from rivals such as apple and google , as well as the einstein project , have not been reported
cortana is the name of an artificial intelligence character in the video game series ' halo
the concept of ' artificial intelligence ' is broad , and mobile phones and computers already show dexterity with spoken language and sifting through emails for data , for instance
google 's mobile app , which does n't have a name like siri or cortana , already offers some limited predictive information ' cards ' based on what it thinks the user wants to know
none of the individual steps are a breakthrough , but creating an artificial intelligence that can stitch together the processes marks a breakthrough in usefulness , microsoft says
apple is also pushing siri , which uses microsoft 's bingsearch engine in the background , into new areas with its homekit platforms , as well as the recently unveiled applewatch

the key to cortana 's success will be knowing where a user is , what time it is , and what they are trying to do
