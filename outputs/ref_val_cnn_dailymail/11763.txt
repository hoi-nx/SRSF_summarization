in an extraordinary move , which was condemned by ministers , the unite general - secretary said he was seeking to change the giant union âs constitution to authorise illegal action
mr mccluskey , whose union has given ed miliband more than Â£ 14 million , said union members could not be expected to obey â oppressive â laws that restrict the right to strike
unite general - secretary mccluskey said he was seeking to change the giant union âs constitution to authorise illegal action the conservatives have said they will change the law to require unions to get the support of at least 40 per cent of their members before calling a strike
mr mccluskey said the right to strike was already â hanging by a thread â as a result of union reforms carried out by the coalition
in a move that suggests he has little confidence in a labour party victory , mr mccluskey said unite members would now be asked to vote to remove the words â so far as may be lawful â from the rules governing the union 's actions
in a speech to lawyers , mr cluskey said : â these words will go not because we are anarchists , not because we are suddenly planning a bank robbery - but because we have to ask ourselves the question , can we any longer make that commitment to , under any and all circumstances , stick within the law as it stands ? mr mccluskey , whose union has given ed miliband more than Â£ 14 million â it is no exaggeration to say that the right to strike in this - the first country of free trade unionism - was and is hanging by a thread
â tory mp raab said it was â shocking â for a union leader to call for illegal action â and called on mr ed miliband to disown the move
â unite activists will decide on the change of wording to the union 's rules at a conference later in the year
