whether it was a druid temple , an astronomical calendar or a centre for healing , the mystery of stonehenge has sparked endless debate over the centuries
he says the stones were pillars used to support a raised platform during ceremonies
as shown in this illustration , steps or a ramp would have led to the top of the platform , where figures of importance would have stood , perhaps addressing a crowd below julian spalding , former director of some of the uk 's leading museums , argues that the stones were foundations for a vast platform , long since lost - ' a great altar ' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers
we 've been looking at stonehenge the wrong way , from the earth , which is very much a 20th - century viewpoint
' in early times , no spiritual ceremonies would have been performed on the ground , ' said mr julian spalding
no - one is exactly sure why - and how - stonehenge was built more than 4,000 years ago
some people think the stones have healing powers , while others think they have musical properties when struck with a stone
what is clear , is that the stones were aligned with phases of the sun. people were buried there and skeletal evidence shows that people travelled hundreds of miles to visit stonehenge - for whatever reason
experts think that the route was a busy one and that stonehenge could be viewed differently from different positions
we 've been looking at stonehenge from a modern , earth - bound perspective
' all the great raised altars of the past suggest that the people who built stonehenge would never have performed celestial ceremonies on the lowly earth â¦ that would have been unimaginably insulting to the immortal beings , for it would have brought them down from heaven to bite the dust and tread in the dung
' however , he says the wood that would have been used for the platform has long since rotted away , leaving only the stone pillars that support it behind
mr julian spalding 's museum directorships include glasgow , which boasts world - class archaeological collections within a complex of institutions that exceed the british museum in size
shown is an illustration of a druid ceremony at stonehenge more than 4,000 years ago
this depiction does not take the new wooden platform theory into account stonehenge , built in stages between 3000 and 2000 bc , is england 's most famous prehistoric monument , a unesco world heritage site on salisbury plain in wiltshire that draws more than one million annual visitors
dolerite has a bluish tinge and is dappled with white spots that look like stars , according to mr julian spalding
' these megaliths , weighing between two and four tons each , were transported 250 miles [ 400km ] , an extraordinary achievement in those times , which indicates that building stonehenge was a massive communal enterprise , ' he said
sacred circle : julian spalding , former director of some of the uk 's leading museums , argues that the stones ( aerial view shown ) were foundations for a vast platform , long since lost - ' a great altar ' raised up high towards the heavens and able to take the weight of hundreds of worshippers mystery : previously it had been thought the arrangement of the stones was solely to align with the sun ( shown ) , but mr julian spalding 's new theory suggests they had another purpose as well he believes that ancient worshippers would have reached the giant altar by climbing curved wooden ramps or staircases , moving in the direction of the slowly circulating stars for ceremonies dedicated to , for example , a dead king 's soul or midsummer and solstice celebrations
only a fraction of the site has been excavated , and the purpose of its t - shaped pillars is a mystery , julian spalding said : ' these must have supported some sort of raised platform
' sir barry cunliffe , a prehistorian and emeritus professor of european archaeology , oxford university , said : ' he could be right , but i know of no evidence to support it â¦ there are a large number of stone circles around the country which clearly did n't have a platform on top
' mr julian spalding also points to the nazca lines in peru ( ' hands ' design shown ) , vast drawings apparently etched into earth 's surface more than 2,000 years ago on to a high natural plateau above the villages where they lived , as being similar in purpose to stonehenge mr julian spalding is fully expecting resistance from fellow academics
