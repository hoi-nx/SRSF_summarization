a 13 - year - old boy , whose mystery illness bound him to a wheelchair with a feeding tube , has made a miraculous recovery after years of suffering thanks to his determined mother who scoured the internet for answers as to why he was in excruciating pain
according to the today show , bobby , from marco island , florida , was originally diagnosed with dysautonomia , a malfunction in the autonomic nervous system , and ehlers-danlos syndrome , a tissue disorder - but the conditions did n't account for all of his ailments , which included stomach afflictions , loss of vision and agonizing neck pain
refusing to accept her son âs initial diagnosis , bobby 's mom , leithauser , began researching his symptoms online , and came across the work of dr. harold rekate , a neurosurgeon at the cohen children 's medical center in new york , who soon discovered her son had a chiari malformation , a treatable , yet rare condition that affects the cerebellum , the part of the brain that controls balance
three months later , bobby recalled the days after his surgery , saying he ' could n't believe ' his unbearable pain was gone after years of suffering
the teen 's health problems seemingly came out of nowhere when he was only nine years old , when the once - active child began to experience crippling stomach pain , prompting his parents to start limiting his food to the point that he was only consuming blueberries and chicken
difficult prognosis : bobby , who was active as a boy , found himself bound to a wheelchair after his condition worsened ' it was really horrendous pain and i could n't hold my head up for more than 10 minutes at a time , ' bobby explained
as his condition worsened , his worried mom began doing research on the internet and contacted other parents whose children had similar issues
' the whole time we were looking at stomach pain , never imagining that the problem could be in another part of his body , like the brain , ' he said
