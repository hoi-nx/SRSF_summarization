only once did ince pause for breath in dublin 8 on thursday
no. the only question which caused him to puff his cheeks and buy time , was a simple one : are liverpool a better team with steven gerrard , or without ? ince is pictured in dublin on thursday as he spoke about liverpool vs manchester united with manchester united docking at anfield on sunday , and steven gerrard â or steven gerrard as ince called him - available after injury , the query was relevant
' i think any liverpool team with steven gerrard is going to be better , not just from a footballing point of view but a leadership point of view , ' he said
' steven gerrard is like a comfort blanket
when he is in your team you feel comfortable , you think ' oh good , steven gerrard is there
' ' when steven gerrard is not in the liverpool team , players worry
' ' they 've won without him , done well , but sunday is one of those games where you need your men , your warriors , and that 's what steven gerrard is
' whether liverpool manager brendan rodgers feels the same remains to be seen but ince is adamant steven gerrard should play
with or without steven gerrard , ince feels liverpool have a slight edge
steven gerrard ( right ) puts in a tackle on swansea 's bafetimbi gomis at the liberty on monday night ' if you 'd asked me a couple of weeks ago i 'd have said a comfortable win for liverpool , now , i think there 's a bit more to it as manchester united were more like the old manchester united against tottenham
' the only way liverpool will overtake manchester united is to start winning titles again , ' acknowledged ince
ince is out of management since blackpool showed him the door 14 months ago , but 45 minutes in his company left the impression he could do a decent job for any number of clubs
open , engaging , informative , ince covered almost as much ground as he did in a distinguished playing career which spanned 20 seasons , eight of which he spent at manchester united , where he won plenty , and liverpool , where he won nothing
at that time , ince reckoned everyone wanted to play for those two clubs , but now they ' ai n't the big giants anymore
' ince feels that liverpool are a better team with steven gerrard as he looked ahead to sunday 's match at anfield ' if chelsea were playing man city the same day we 'd be talking about those two giants instead
' ' you ca n't just throw him into manchester united , one of the biggest clubs in the world and say ' there ya go ryan giggs
' manchester united assistant manager ryan giggs ( left ) speaks with wayne rooney during the fa cup sixth round match against arsenal last week ince took that route , starting off at macclesfield and working his way to the premier league in just two years at blackburn , where he became the first black manager in the top flight
' ince retains the coltish enthusiasm of the tearaway teenager who broke through at west ham under john lyall in the late 80s where he played beside liam â for so long ireland 's comfort blanket
