havana , cuba so what has u.s. state department subcontractor gross been up to since he was released from a cuba prison exactly three months ago ? it turns out a lot more than most of the rest of us
gross , 65 , has started to make up for the five years he spent imprisoned in cuba by traveling abroad , attending the state of the union address as a guest of the obamas and last week meeting pope francis at the vatican to personally thank him for his role in helping to win gross ' freedom
after five years of being disconnected from the outside world , gross now frequently posts on social media , writing of family reunions , eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in cuba
" i ca n't get away from cuba , " gross wrote after hearing a cuba song playing in an airport on his travels
gross said he was merely helping the island 's small jewish community get online , but cuba officials accused of him being part of a u.s. government plot to destabilize the island 's single - party communist government
on december 17 , 2014 , gross was freed , along with three cuba intelligence agents and a cuba man convicted of spying for the u.s.
it was part of a deal between the cuba and u.s. governments to reestablish diplomatic relations after five decades of cold war animosity
rep. van hollen , the democrat representing the maryland district gross hails from , called it " incredibly moving " that a man who spent five years in a cuba prison has since sat next to first lady michelle obama and met the pope
" gross did not ask for this special role in history , " van hollen said , " but he 's become a catalyst for this new chapter in u.s. and cuba relations
" the photos that gross posted online show a smiling man , slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison , no longer the gaunt - faced , hollow - eyed prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in cuba
