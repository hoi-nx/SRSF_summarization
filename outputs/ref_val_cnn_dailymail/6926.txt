ed woodward and the glazers love an eye - catching signing at manchester united but for manager louis van gaal the enforced absence of Â£ 59.7million winger angel di maria against tottenham on sunday might be the best news he âs had this season
di maria flickered brightly when he first arrived from real madrid but the last six months have signalled a steady decline due to injury , loss of form , an unfortunate burglary and most recently a stupid red card for pulling referee oliver against arsenal on monday night

yet di maria âs absence also gives van gaal an opportunity
by his own admission , the manchester united manager likes to kill off opponents by applying pressure through extended spells of possession
without di maria against tottenham , themselves pushing for a top - four place , van gaal has greater options

â manchester united have invested too much in di maria to jettison him at the first sign of trouble , particularly if no other club is willing to financially compensate a great deal of their outlay
but should manchester united convincingly overcome a tottenham side brimming with youthful energy in the form of harry kane , nabil bentaleb and ryan mason , questions will be asked if they are a better unit without their most expensive acquisition

in the build - up to sunday 's showdown , the manchester united manager tried to address all sides
in shorthand it âs unlikely manchester united would beat off any suitors who waved Â£ 50m at them to sign di maria this summer
