this stunning weather map shows how those in the west of the country enjoyed one of the warmest february 's on record , while those in the east endured heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures
the extreme contrast in temperatures has been put down to global warming and the melting sea ice in the arctic by some experts , according to nasa 's earth observatory
the satellite image produced by nasa records the land surface temperature
the places that experience below average conditions are coloured blue , normal appear white and those in red were warmer than average the map has been produced using data from nasa 's terra satellite satellite and shows how temperatures this february compared with those over the last ten years
. the satellite recorded the land surface temperature and the map shows a clear divide right down the middle of the country
the mercury soared some 10 degrees approve than average in the western half and those in the east saw temperatures 10 degrees below average
statewide data showed that no state experienced record cold temperatures in february , but many cities broke their own records , according to live science
ice - encrusted : lower manhattan as seen from the staten island ferry on february 25 , 2015 as the new york harbor is filled with large chunks of ice as the east river and hudson freeze over the dry bed of the stevens creek reservoir in california : a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during california'sthree - year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years researchers were reportedly exploring a number of possible causes behind the contrasting weather patterns seen across the us last
nasa 's earth observatory said : ' most meteorologists attribute the sharply contrasting temperatures to the combination of a persistent ridge of high pressure â nicknamed the â ridiculously resilient ridge â â over the northeastern pacific , and an equally persistent trough that has funneled chilly air from the arctic into central north america
' still others think changes in the arctic have little to do with mid-latitude weather extremes ; instead they see periods with an anomalously sharp gradient in sea surface temperature in the far western pacific as the key factor
