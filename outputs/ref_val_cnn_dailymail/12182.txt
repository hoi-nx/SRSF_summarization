isis militants in northern syrian released 19 assyrian christian hostages sunday , an activist group said
the syrian observatory had said previously that a self - proclaimed isis court ordered the release of 29 assyrian christian hostages , citing an assyrians commander
the " court " told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped assyrians has yet to be decided by isis sharia jurists
of the rest , 95 were fighters from the al qaeda - affiliated rebel group al-nusra front , the syrian observatory said , and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces
isis also executed 125 of its own members for " exceeding the limits in religion , " the syrian observatory said
" we in sohr believe that the real number of people that had been killed by ( isis ) is higher than the number documented by sohr because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the ( isis ) jails , loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-shaitaat tribe , ( and ) dozens of kurds who have still been missing " since isis attacked the syrian town of kobani in september
