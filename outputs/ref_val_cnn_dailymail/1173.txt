in the months before john was tragically gunned down outside dakota in new york on december 8 , 1980 , by deranged killer mark david chapman , life for the ex beatles and his bride yoko was full of ' unclouded happiness '
and those moments , during the creation of what would be their last album together , are captured in the collection of photographs of the couple , published for the first time in the book , double fantasy
the photographs were taken by kishin shinoyama , who has now written about them in a book by him and yoko , published by taschen books in multiple international editions
' john could n't go out anywhere while he was in the uk because of his fame , ' writes yoko
' coming to new york gave him freedom
' ironically , john was killed in front of the new york apartments building behind the couple , where they lived john and yoko leave their apartment at dakota and head to central park across the street the beatles had broken up a decade before
the double fantasy album was going to be john 's comeback at age forty , reflecting his personal growth in music and self that he attributed to yoko , now 82 , the first woman who told him that his previous lifestyle of wantonly pursuing women , alcohol and drugs was meaningless
mccartney was one of three people that yoko called when she returned home from the hospital that fateful night to say that john had not survived the five hollow - point bullets mark david chapman fired at the singer just outside their apartment at dakota , across the street from central park
' beautiful boy : john relaxing with son sean lennon at their dakota apartment hanging out : the couple , in the new york living room , loved living in the city at work : the couple worked intensely for over a month , recording 28 songs - 14 of john 's and 14 of yoko 's the concept of double fantasy was a back - and - forth dialogue , a kind of musical conversation between them george harrison was deeply shocked by his bandmate 's murder but had had little contact with him in the years prior to the murder
broken up emotionally , ringo and his wife , barbara bach , immediately flew to new york to offer comfort to yoko
yoko remembers the last time the couple went into the studio together in 1978 , the the hit factory in new york
kishin shinoyama remembers that last recording session : ' i checked in at the hotel lexington , and by early afternoon i was down the street at the door of the hit factory on west 48th street , the recording studio where john and yoko were working on the final parts of the record , inserting choruses and other additional layers of sounds
' the two had been working intensely for over a month , recording 28 songs â 14 of john 's and 14 of yoko 's
yoko greeted me and immediatelyintroduced me to john
chill : john was trying to clear away those feelings - of fame , of the past - in order to become a new person , says the photographer ' throughout the sessions , i noticed that john always spoke with the staff and the studio musicians in a quiet , clear manner , remaining calm and focused , despite the seemingly endless days and nights of work
while dining later at mr chow 's , kishin shinoyama learned that he and john were both 40 years old.john revealed ' he was at a turning point , that he wanted to forget everything that had come before and start again ' , kishin shinoyama writes
' he explained to me that without yoko , he would n't be there now - that the first part of his life he had been obsessed with alcohol and women and drugs , and that yoko had been the first woman to tell him that what he was obsessed with was meaningless
a month after kishin shinoyama returned to japan , john was shot and killed
' i look back at these photos , so many years later , and i feel that i captured john and yoko at their happiest moment
' it was such a lucky time for me to be there , a moment of unclouded happiness for john and yoko
