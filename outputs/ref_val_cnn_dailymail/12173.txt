the poll will test the strength of an electoral process that has been marred by violence and flawed results throughout the country 's short democratic history
the conduct of the elections will have long lasting repercussions on both nigeria and the u.s. - nigeria relationship
what many u.s. may not recognize is how important the relationship with nigeria is for the u.s.
we have economic and security interests that are at stake in this election , especially as nigeria has been one of our strongest allies in the region since military rule there ended
in the last decade , the u.s. has trained and equipped thousands of nigeria soldiers who have participated in peacekeeping missions in mali , cote d'ivoire and liberia , helping bring a measure of peace and stability to nations in the africa region
ultimately , a stable nigeria will mean real economic opportunities for u.s. -- a win - win proposition
the reality is that endemic corruption remains an obstacle to more cooperation , especially when you consider the nigeria military 's poor performance fighting boko haram , despite security spending reportedly being around $ 6 billion last year -- clearly , much of the money meant for the military is not being spent on salaries , equipment or materiel
similarly , weak governance remains an impediment to nigeria 's progress and enhanced ties with the u.s.
but it is not just about the leadership -- this election offers the chance for all nigeria to choose their future , and decide which policies will shape the next four years
but more importantly , they will determine the future for nigeria 's people
the world is watching nigeria 's historic choice with great expectation and even greater hope .
