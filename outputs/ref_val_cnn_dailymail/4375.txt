at the weekend , italy 's equaliser against bulgaria was scored by a brazil , eder , who first arrived in italy when he was 16
an argentina - born striker , franco vasquez , is also in antonio conte 's squad
eder , who was born in brazil , celebrates his goal for italy in their euro 2016 qualifier with bulgaria eder , who moved to italy when he was 16 , has admitted that he does n't know the national anthem argentina - born franco vasquez is also part of antonio conte 's italy squad italy 's italian strikers are either too old ( luca toni , antonio di natale ) or out of form ( ciro immobile , mario balotelli , graziano pelle ) , hence the foreign call - ups
an italian player deserves to play for the national team , while someone who was n't born in italy , even if they have relatives , i do n't think they deserve to
he moved to italy at the ripe old age of 23 , did n't sing the national anthem , spoke in spanish after the game when he dedicated the victory in the final in berlin to the people back in his neighbourhood on the outskirts of buenos aires â roughly 7,000 miles from rome
italy won the world cup in 2006 with the argentine camoranesi in their squad mancini , the former manchester city manager , said the italian national team should be italian only italy 's casual approach to ' italianness ' when it comes to football stretches back nearly 100 years : midfielder luis monti played in a world cup final for argentina in 1930 , and then won the 1934 tournament with italy
spain called up brazil diego costa , and england have done it too : raheem sterling was born in jamaica , but there is a difference
the truth is that raheem sterling is proud of his jamaica roots , but feels england
diego costa is another high - profile player who was born somewhere other than the country he plays for raheem sterling was born in jamaica but has lived in england since the age of five there are plenty of england - born players who feel irish because of their family history â a father from ireland perhaps
the bournemouth star admitted he had not even been to scotland before his call - up and debut last week
no rules were broken because his dad was born in edinburgh , but how scottish can matt ritchie feel if at the age of 25 he had failed to make the effort to even visit the country of his father 's birth ? good luck to him , but the whole mess raises questions about the nature and future of international football
matt ritchie of bournemouth had never been to scotland before making his debut for them last week matt ritchie 's father was born in edinburgh , making him eligible to play for scotland when one country faces another country on a football pitch , should n't the main purpose of that match be to see how 11 players from one nation fares against 11 players from a different nation ? is n't that a fundamental premise and prerequisite of international football ? if it is n't , and the international game has become a free for all involving bending the rules so that it no longer matters where you were born and which nationality makes your heart beat stronger , then what is the point of it
when i go to see england play against italy i want to see the best england players play against the best italian players
but a brazil playing for spain , an argentine for italy and several englishmen playing for scotland dilutes the passion of the occasion
