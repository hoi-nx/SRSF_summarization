a sydney pastor has spoken about the incredible moment bali nine ringleader chan offered a vital piece of himself in a bid to save the man 's life
feebrey , a men 's mental health ambassador , had been diagnosed with terminal liver disease in 2010 , when the death row inmate , with whom he had formed a close friendship , offered his own liver up for transplant
here i am waiting for a donor , i 'm dying in front of my wife and kids and here he is going " my liver 's ok , you can have mine " , ' mr feebrey told the sydney morning herald
chan reportedly began making enquiries about whether the organ donation could go ahead , determined to save mr feebrey , who shared his christian faith and had been a regular visitor since his incarceration in 2005
while mr feebrey received a liver from another organ donor , he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his ' incredible ' friend
chan and fellow bali nine member sukumaran are currently being held on nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency
mr feebrey said that when chan heard the news that his appeal for clemency from indonesia president widodo , he was more concerned with the health of a fellow inmate who was in the jail 's clinic than himself
chan took it on the chin and with courage and then he just walked off to go to the clinic to go and see this guy , ' mr feebrey said while mr feebrey received a liver from another organ donor , he said that the gesture was unforgettable and was characteristic of his ' incredible ' friend the pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two australian chan and fellow bali nine member sukumaran are currently being held on nusakambangan island where they await execution and the outcome of their final appeals for clemency mr feebrey has continued to be in regular contact with chan , and is an outspoken advocate for the ' i stand for mercy campaign '
the pastor uses his social media accounts to campaign against the executions of the two australian , and posted on his instagram account after the chan heard of his rejected clemency appeal
' just spent the last half an hour with my friend chan , when the australian consulate staff notified him that his final appeal against [ the ] death sentence was rejected , ' mr feebrey posted
in february , the pastor posted a ' message of hope ' to supporters of chan on his instagram account the men 's mental health ambassador said it would be tragic for chan and sukumaran , who have worked tirelessly to mentor other prisoners , to be executed
' chan is the idyllic , dream guy to mentor and rehabilitate and a great seed like him â they want to put to death ? , ' mr feebrey asked
both chan and sukumaran have been involved in running education and drug rehabilitation programs inside kerobokan since 2009
the pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals sukumaran , left , and chan , right , will be put through an ' assimilation ' process as they prepare to face the firing squad ' but i do think the death penalty is too excessive
this could delay the pair 's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out
the australian government , alongside several notable public figures , have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of mr chan and mr sukumaran
