taking a stance : openly - gay apple ceo tim cook criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate apple ceo tim cook has spoken out against two new laws in indiana and arkansas which critics say will allow business owners to refuse service to homosexual customers based on ' religious liberty '
tim cook condemned the laws , saying they were ' very dangerous ' , went against the founding principles of u.s. , and would take the country back to the days of ' whites only ' signs in shop doorways
he added that , as a baptist , he supports religious freedom , but said : ' i was never taught , nor do i believe , that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate
' tim cook , 54 , who came out as gay in october last year , made the comments in an op - ed for the washington post
' he said such bills ' rationalize injustice ' by ' pretending to defend ' religious freedom , which actually eroding the freedoms of others
he says u.s. 's ' days of discrimination ' must remain ' deep in the past ' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company
the indiana bill forbids the state or local government from ' substantially burdening ' a person 's religious beliefs unless that burden is ' essential ' to further a ' compelling ' government interest , and is the ' least restrictive ' means of achieving that aim
indiana 's religious freedom act says that the state and local government ' may not substantially burden a person 's right to the exercise of religion ' unless that burden is ' essential ' to furthering a government interest
but opponents , including tim cook , claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue it will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes ' substantial ' , but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it , mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate
tim cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in indiana , with musician miley cyrus , and actors ashton kutcher , james van der beek and george takei all speaking out against it
salesforce.com founder and ceo marc benioff also announced on twitter that he would no longer send employees or customers to indiana
