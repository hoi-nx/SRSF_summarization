since the arab spring in 2011 , yemen have endured intermittent fighting , attempted coups and increasing violence but now , with houthi militiamen advancing on the beleaguered forces of president hadi in the second city of aden , things look increasingly bleak
with the capital sanaa also in the hands of the iran - backed rebels , women and children are now on the front line of a conflict that , last night alone , saw an estimated 40 people perish after saudi arabia war planes apparently bombed a refugee camp
now a haunting new set of photos has shed light on what yemen stands to lose , including a bedouin minority that has lived in yemen - and neigbouring countries such as jordan and saudi arabia - for thousands of years
under threat : these women were photographed in amran , a town that fell to the houthi last summer and is now being targeted with air strikes front line : these girls live in shaharah , a village in houthi controlled territory close to the saudi arabia border fighting : this little girl was photographed close to the city of taiz which fell to the houthi militia yesterday the pictures , which were taken by french photographer lafforgue , show the country 's women and children going about their daily lives , whether chatting in the market or having their nails hennaed
but more than ever , their future looks uncertain with saudi arabia troops massing on the border , iran refusing to back down and nightly air strikes conducted by planes from egypt , the united arab emirates , jordan and even sudan
nevertheless , even before the houthi advance began , life was n't particularly easy for the women of yemen
' when i walked through sa'naa with a girl wearing trousers , many yemen men came up to me and asked : " is it a man or a woman ? " ' trousers , unless with a long robe , are not supposed to be worn by women
' some do have more freedom , however , among them the bare - faced ladies of taiz and jebel saber close to aden
because the village is so remote , fetching water means a daily trek to a well miles from home making a living : a lady carries water in a village just outside al hudaydah while another battles a flooded wadi in tihamah scorching : women living in the huge hadhramaut province in central yemen often wear tall hats as extra protection from the sun decorative : the only adornment visible on most yemen women is a pair of hennaed hands education : many village women such as this one are not educated because their families see it as a waste of time , according to lafforgue the current round of fighting in yemen has pitted government forces led by president hadi against an iran - backed rebel force made up of houthi and soldiers supporting former leader ali abdullah saleh who was ousted in 2012
supporting president hadi is an arab coalition led by saudi arabia and including jordan , egypt , kuwait , the united arab emirates and sudan among others
the houthi are from a yemen shi'ite sect and are allied to iran , saudi arabia 's main regional rival
much of the fighting is focused on the port city of aden where president hadi is holed up amid bloody clashes with houthi forces
aden is hadi 's last stronghold in yemen and remains besieged despite a fifth day of air strikes aimed at checking the houthi advance
the saudi arabia air strikes , part of an operation named decisive storm , may herald a full - blown invasion , with troops already massing on the yemen border
in jebel saber in taiz , close to aden , women have similar powers to men overrun : residents of taiz such as this women have now been overwhelmed by houthi rebels who advanced into the city yesterday advance : soldiers from yemen units loyal to ousted president ali abdullah saleh pictured on the outskirts of taiz frightening : rebels in the yemen capital sa'naa attempt to hold off a saudi arabia air strike using anti-aircraft weapons
