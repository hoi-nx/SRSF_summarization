warrington piled on the agony for leeds as the luckless yorkshiremen lost their star full - back as well as their 100 per cent super league record on friday the 13th
the rhinos left out england international zak hardaker after it emerged that he was the subject of a police investigation into an assault case , forcing leeds to throw teenager ashton golding in for his full debut
ashton golding performed admirably but little else went right for leeds as they fell from the top of the table and suffered a fifth consecutive defeat at the halliwell jones stadium in going down 18 - 6 to a warrington side starting to find their groove
kevin penny touches down over the line to score a magnificent solo try and get warrington on their way the rhinos trailed 18 - 0 until scoring what proved to be a consolation try through winger tom briscoe and skipper kevin sinfield 's goal took him to within three points of the 4,000 mark
stefan ratchford kicked his second goal to make it 12 - 0 and warrington defended superbly to keep their lead intact up to the break , with leeds duo singleton and danny mcguire held agonisingly short of the line
leeds grabbed a lifeline on the hour when hall broke clear on halfway and centre kallum watkins was in support to get tom briscoe away and they thought they had scored again moments later when singleton touched down after stefan ratchford had fumbled kevin sinfield 's high kick but the try was ruled out for a knock - on by mcguire
