their faces covered in elaborate black patterns and , in some cases , totally dark with ink , these smiling villagers are some of burma 's last surviving tattooed women
but with younger people increasingly reluctant to be inked for fear of ridicule and for fear of the heavy fines imposed by the ruling military junta , burma 's tattooing tradition is on borrowed time and could disappear within a generation
sign of beauty : the women of the chin , magan and muun tribes say facial tattoos are a sign of beauty customs : the tradition exists alongside other customs such as playing the flute through the nose
isolated : the tribes live far from the burma capital naypyidaw in a mountainous area that was cut off until two years ago fines : the military junta has done its best to eradicate the tattoo tradition and levies a hefty fine of half a cow on anyone who gets one meaning : each of the facial tattoos is replete with symbols , although the most frequently seen design is the spider 's web ( pictured ) variation : these women , both from the chin tribe , have less prominent tattoos than those from the muun and magan peoples attractive : this lady told mailonline that her spider 's web tattoo caught men like the real thing catches flies as a result , few women now have the markings , with the majority of those who do living hidden away in the mountainous chin , arakan and arakan regions - all of which were closed off to visitors until two years ago
now an estimated 700 tourists travel to the area each year , although few are inclined to attempt the precipitous climb up to the mountain eyries of the magan , chin and muun tribes
it was supposed to make girls ugly mandatory : in the centuries that followed , the tattoos became a sign of beauty and were insisted upon by parents generation gap : although ma aung seim has facial tattoos , her granddaughter yi yi ( left ) has refused to have them for fear of ridicule all black : pa late , who says her tattoos took three days to complete , says an all - black face was once thought to be the most attractive youngest : 67 - year - old miss heu is one of the youngest women to have the tattoos in kanpelet
she was tattooed by her grandmother delicate : women of the chin tribe have smaller and more delicate tattoos that only cover part of the face painful : the facial tattoos are made using thorns ( pictured ) and ink made from a mixture of pig fat , cow bile , plants and soot toothless : many of the women regularly chew betel nuts which results in tooth loss and brown stains on the rest the tattoos , which are created using thorn needles and an ink made from a mixture of cow bile , soot , plants and pig fat , are also a sign of bravery - particularly those etched on the neck , which are the most painful of all
now , however , the tables have been turned on the tribesmen , with the brutal military junta that dominated the country until 2011 declaring the tattoos illegal and imposing harsh fines on anyone to break the rules
traditional lives : all three tribes live in remote mountain villages and , as a result , are still adept at handicrafts and believe in shamans few visitors : the mount victoria area in which they live was closed to outsiders until two years ago
now 700 tourists arrive each year english : to the tribespeople , all foreigners are ' english ' - a legacy from the uk 's time as the colonial power in burma pale : they also believe that white skin is the result of boiling the individual concerned in water smoke break : nearly all the women smoke pipes , although their frequent smoke breaks do n't seem to affect their ability to move around relaxed : most of the women smoke tobacco in their clay pipes , from which they are rarely parted no problem : the women 's daily routine , which involves heavy lifting and mountainous paths , is seemingly unaffected by their smoking hard work : for the chin , muun and magan ( chin pictured ) women , life revolves around collecting water and gathering food most homes have a small post topped with an egg beside their front doors , which according to local lore , is a way to bring the family good luck and happiness , while also repelling evil spirits
amusingly , many of locals remain convinced that white skin is the result that person being boiled
but , as with their tattoos , the future looks uncertain for the chin and other burma tribes , whose traditions are beginning to be eroded by incomers - not least in the non-chin teachers who teach the children different traditions and a different language
