president obama said tuesday that he has a ' businesslike ' working relationship with israel prime minister bibi , but that the two men have virtually irreconcilable differences in their approaches to establishing a palestinian state as a road to middle east peace
' we believe that two states is the best path forward for israel 's security , for palestinian aspirations , and for regional stability , ' obama said during an afternoon joint press conference with afghanistan president ashraf ghani ahmadzai
' ' and so this ca n't be reduced to a matter of , somehow , " let 's all hold hands and sing kumbaya " , ' the president told reporters in the east room of the whtie house
' i took him at his word , that that 's what he meant , ' obama said , later saying of prospects for a two - state solution that ' that possibility seems very dim
' ' we 'll continue to engage the israel government as well as the palestinian , ' he insisted , ' and ask them â where are they interested in going ? and how do they see this issue being resolved ? ' ' but what we ca n't do is pretend that there 's a possibility of something that 's not there
bibi had said in 2009 that he would be willing to endorse a ' demilitarized ' palestinian state as long as it recognized israel 's right to exist
after the election , bibi clarified his campaign promise about never allowing a palestinian state to take root
' distraction : the president was in the east room with afghanistan president ashraf ghani ahmadzai to talk about a potential troop withdrawal , but talk of israel occupied nearly 20 minutes of the press conference ' aspirations ' of mahmoud abbas : while palestinian - aligned terrorists call for the destruction of israel , obama aims to create conditions for the palestinian authority 's peaceful coexistence with israel obama declared on tuesday that those conditions were unworkable
' obama brushed off a follow - up question from a reporter about whether his administration would try to force the issue through the united nations security council , where the u.s. has for decades blocked measures designed to establish a palestinian state despite israel 's objections
