most people upsize their house to accommodate a growing family
but retired couple huw and jan smith have a rather more fuzzy reason for moving into a bigger home â because behind the doors of their new residence live hundreds and hundreds of teddy bears
the pair have more than 600 of the cuddly toys crammed into their four - bedroom detached property
smith surrounded by his collection of some 600 bears at his home in lancaster the couple moved into this four - bedroom home having found their three - bedroom terrace was too small for their ever growing collection of teddy bears the couple , who give each bear its own name , recently moved house to accommodate their large collection , which they have amassed over the past 23 years and estimate to be worth Â£ 4,500
mr smith , a former product manager , said some people could not understand why they would spend their money on cuddly toys
â we âve unpacked them all and they seem to be loving their new home
â the couple , who do nât have any children , began collecting teddy bears in 1991 following the death of their pet golden labrador , biffer
huw sits among a plethora of bears in one of the bedrooms at his home they name and photograph each one and record when and where it was purchased in a detailed computerised log book
in october they decided to move from their three - bedroom terraced home in st albans , hertforshire , to a larger house in lancaster to accommodate their massive brood of soft toys
â while we had the dog we could nât really start collecting the bears as he would have had them , â said 60 - year - old mr smith
mr smith cuddles up to their first ever bear , mischief , which they bought following the death of their dog huw in the lounge of his new home having relocated with his wife jan to accommodate the collection â but after he died we bought a teddy , sort of as a replacement pet , and from there we just carried on
it was nât really a conscious thing , but now , 20 years later we have hundreds
we have some that cost a couple of pounds from charity shops to others worth a few hundred
we think he is worth about Â£ 260
â the many boxes the couple used to transport more than 600 teddy bears from their former home in st albans to their new house in lancaster mr and mrs jan smith named this bear corfe , the smallest in their collection , which they bought from dorset mr smith said he and his wife love the bears so much they are â like family '
â mrs jan smith , 63 , who until recently worked as an administrator for her local museum service , added : â we never had any children of our own but i would nât say they were our fur - kids
