head of shop construction mareschal told staff at the bicester outlet village in oxfordshire the three - way mirror needed to be fitted properly in september 2012
in june 2013 , the same mirror toppled over onto austen harrison , of turners hill , west sussex , who died in hospital four days later after undergoing an emergency operation to relieve pressure on his brain
austen harrison was with his parents , simon and harrison , when the incident happened at the bicester outlet village at around 8.30pm on june 4 , 2013
mrs harrison and her son met mr austen harrison after he finished work and had dinner at a carluccio 's restaurant before going to the hugo boss store
the four - year - old had been playing with the mirror while his father tried on a suit when it fell
an inquest into his death at oxford coroner 's court heard that the mirror was not fixed to the wall and that its free - standing position meant it could easily overbalance
mr mareschal , who has since left hugo boss , told the inquest : ' i clearly remember the three - way mirror was in the wrong location , it was not in the fitting area
' i recall putting my hand on the mirror and i said " guys , it ca n't be here , it needs to be fitted properly "
i walked to the fitting room and indicated where it needed to go
' the three - way mirror was certainly not a freestanding mirror and to leave it standing on the floor would have been inherently dangerous due to its size and weight
' mr mareschal visited the shop just before leaving the company for a new job and sent an email to area manager matthew pink , copying in contractors , containing an update on work at the store a month after it opened in august 2012 , the inquest in oxford was told

' treatment : austen harrison was taken to john radcliffe hospital ( pictured ) in oxford , where he underwent emergency surgery for swelling to his brain , but died four days later mr morgan said the mirror was in a ' very high - traffic ' area , used by customers and with access to an upstairs section of the shop and a stock room
