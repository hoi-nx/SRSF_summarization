students at a high school in southern california returned to class on monday to discover that their chemistry teacher had switched gender , adopted a different first name and was dressing as a woman
amanda swager , born michael , grew up as a boy , but learned as an adult that she was actually genetically female and began transitioning
amanda swager , 32 , who teaches chemistry at chino valley unified school district , had first notified district leaders about her situation two years ago
amanda swager considered her gender very much a personal matter and so the decision was taken to notify only students in her class and their parents , rather than making a blanket announcement to everyone
' the district 's handling of the matter and amanda swager sudden change have come in for criticism from some parents who say they support the teacher but feel they should have been notified so they could speak to their kids about it
the chino valley unified school district have updated information of their website about amanda swager after the decision was taken that she would transition to a woman sooner than originally planned ' on a friday he was a man , on monday he was woman , ' said one parent
a spokesperson for the chino valley unified school district said they ca n't comment because it 's a personal and private matter for the teacher
amanda swager , pictured above , had originally planned on returning to school as a woman after the summer holidays , but that timetable had to be brought forward after she was outed by pupils over the weekend while on a date
