parkinson may have snubbed mourinho âs offer of a handshake before the final whistle sounded on bradford âs shock fa cup win over chelsea , but the 47 - year - old will gladly borrow some of mourinho âs tricks as he tries to guide the league one club to wembley again
parkinson faces reading â where he spent 11 years as a player â at valley parade on saturday knowing that another upset would see bradford return to the national stadium in the semi-finals of the fa cup for the first time in more than a century
remarkably , he has already taken bradford there twice in the capital one cup final and league two playoff final in 2013
bradford boss phil parksinon ( centre left ) rebuffed mourinho 's ( right ) handshake during their fa cup tie parkinson did not want to be distracted by mourinho âs premature offer of congratulations when bradford came from behind to record a stunning 4 - 2 win at stamford bridge in january , before going on to take another premiership scalp in sunderland in the fifth round
but the bradford manager can not help but admire the chelsea manager âs win - at - all - costs mentality compared with some managers ( look away louis van gaal ) who are obsessed with imposing their â philosophy â on a club
â i like the fact that he will do whatever it takes to win , â said parkinson
parkinson believes the big teams in the premiership are jealous of bradford chelsea were beaten 4 - 2 by league one outfit bradford during the fourth round back in january â mourinho sets up his team to win
it âs about what tweaks and adaptations are we going to make today to give us the best chance of winning ? that âs why i like looking at what mourinho does because he has great skill at that
â it âs one reason why parkinson is happy to let talk of the poor playing surface at valley parade carry on ahead of reading âs visit
he believes that it got into the heads of sunderland âs players in the last round and contributed to bradford âs 2 - 0 win

the ambitious bradford boss has also modelled his managerial style on sir alex and was able to study arsene wenger âs situation while scouting for arsenal in 2011 following his departure from charlton
â obviously i âm ambitious like every player in the squad and every member of staff , â said parkinson
â so having won the playoff final with bradford in 2013 just three months after losing the capital one cup final 5 - 0 to swansea , what are parkinson âs priorities this time around as he tries to take the west yorkshire club to the semi-finals of the fa cup for the first time since 2011 ? he said : â it âs difficult because when we had the capital one cup final , all the way i was saying â the league is more important â
â i want to do both but at this stage , when you âre so close to being in an fa cup semi-final at wembley , this has got to take priority at the moment
