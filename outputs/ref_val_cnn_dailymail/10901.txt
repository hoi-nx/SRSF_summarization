blair is said to be planning to step back from his role as the middle east peace envoy blair is to step back from his role as middle east peace envoy , it was reported last night
the former labour leader has been the envoy for the middle east quartet peace negotiators â the un , the eu , russia and the us â since he quit as prime minister in 2007
but the financial times said he was planning to â step back â from the job , in a move which could be announced later this week
he is apparently embarking on negotiations to â recast â his role while remaining involved in the peace process
it is understood that the former prime minister has met kerry , the us secretary of state , and federica mogherini , the eu âs foreign policy chief , to discuss a possible job change
the move follows months of concerns about potential conflicts of interest between mr blair âs role in peace negotiations in the middle east and his business pursuits
sources told the ft that mr blair has realised that his peace role is no longer tenable
the move comes amid mounting unease in the us and eu over his poor relations with senior palestinian figures and sprawling business interests
last year , a group of former british ambassadors joined a campaign calling for the ex-prime minister to be removed from his role as middle east envoy , raising objections to the possible clash with his business interests and a attempts to â absolve himself â of responsibility for the iraq crisis
their letter , written last july , said the former prime minister âs achievements as middle east envoy have been negligible and he was guilty of seeking to please the israeli
the former prime minister was accused by a handful of british ambassadors of trying to please the israeli
only last month it emerged that mr blair is being paid to advise the serbian prime minister
