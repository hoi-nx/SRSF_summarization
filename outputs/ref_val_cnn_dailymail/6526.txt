bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher a-level subjects , a study shows
researchers found those from disadvantaged families were far less likely to study and score highly in english , maths , science , humanities and languages
pupils who do not take these so - called â facilitating â subjects have less chance of obtaining a place at the prestigious russell group universities , which often favour them
the wide - ranging study also showed that going to a decent nursery , reading for pleasure and attending an outstanding school can boost a disadvantaged pupil 's chances of getting good results
â the study concludes that encouraging reading for pleasure , educational trips , the chance to go to a good nursery and school , feedback on school work and a supportive home life can help disadvantaged youngsters to get good results
it suggests that bright , poor students should get â enrichment â vouchers , funded through the pupil premium - public funding for disadvantaged children - to help with educational trips , reading for pleasure and studies outside of the classroom
â professor pam sammons , co-author of the report , said : â there is no silver bullet that alone can make a difference but a combination of good schools and pre-schools , the right home learning environment and supportive teachers ready to monitor progress and provide good feedback can all ensure that bright but disadvantaged students get the chance of a good university education
