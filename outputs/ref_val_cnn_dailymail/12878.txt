a year ago , when dr. hugonnet was dispatched to guinea to investigate a series of unexplained deaths , he had little idea that he 'd be contending with an outbreak that would quickly spread from a small southern rainforest village , across borders , and around the world
the ebola outbreak , ravaging primarily guinea , liberia and sierra leone , is a year old today
it takes a village before the virus ravaged west africa , before the deaths soared into the thousands , before the outbreak triggered global fears , ebola struck a toddler named emile the 2 - year - old boy is who researchers with the new england journal of medicine believe was the first person to contract the disease in december 2013
how he got infected , no one is sure , but ebola can be spread from animals to humans through infected fluids or tissue
one thing that is certain , within a month ebola not only took emile 's life , but also those of his mother , sister and grandmother
but this outbreak was different , hugonnet said
on august 6 , a businessman with ebola died in a hospital in saudi arabia
and on september 20 , the spanish catholic brother with ebola , brother miguel pajares , dies in madrid
he had been unknowingly exposed to the ebola virus -- and he became the first known case of ebola diagnosed in the u.s. he died a few days later
" ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence , " said manuel fontaine , unicef 's regional director
" why did n't we ? in a scathing new report , published monday , doctors without borders puts the blame squarely on a " global coalition of inaction " that waited months to respond to the epidemic
" the ebola epidemic proved to be an exceptional event that exposed the reality of how inefficient and slow health and aid systems are to respond to emergencies , " said said dr joanne liu , the organization 's international president in the report , " pushed to the limit and beyond
the world health organization said at the time that while the ebola outbreak is serious , it is " relatively small , still
" " for the ebola outbreak to spiral this far out of control required many institutions to fail , " said christopher stokes , the director general for doctors without borders
" and they did , with tragic and avoidable consequences
by october , when sierra leone was reporting a rate of five infections an hour , unicef said it had received only 25 % of the $ 200 million it needed for emergency assistance for families affected by ebola in the region
a significant challenge remains ahead , doctors without borders says
" to declare an end to the outbreak , every single person in contact with someone infected with ebola must be identified
" it 's sobering news a year into the outbreak
