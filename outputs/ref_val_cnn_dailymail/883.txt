trees are absorbing up to a tenth less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during droughts and the forests actually emit more carbon than they capture
the last dry spell in 2010 saw the forest release eight billion tonnes - as much as the annual emissions of china and russia combined
pictured is an view of a river boat trapped on the lago do cristo reis during one of the worst droughts ever recorded on october 21 , 2005 in the amazon region in brazil in an average year the basin absorbs about 1.5 billion tonnes of co2 from the atmosphere but prolonged dry spells are due to become more common
the oxford university study provides the first direct evidence of the rate at which individual trees in earth 's greatest rainforest ' inhale ' carbon from the atmosphere during a severe dry spell
it found photosynthesis - the process by which trees convert the greenhouse gas into energy - slowed down by 10 per cent over six months
a researcher is pictured here measuring tree diameters in tambopata national park , peru , soon after the 2010 drought ' here we show for the first time during severe drought the rate at which they ' inhale ' carbon through photosynthesis can decrease
' the 2005 drought in the amazon was described as a ' once a century ' event - but five years later an even worse one followed raising concerns about the region 's capacity to continue soaking up carbon dioxide
the 2010 drought saw the amazon at its lowest levels for half a century with several tributaries completely dry and more than 20 municipalities declaring a state of emergency
both droughts were associated with unusually warm seas in the atlantic ocean off the brazil coast - the suspected result of manmade emissions - and suggesting drought years in the amazon could become more common
some computer models of climate change project more droughts across the region as the planet warms - and a diminishing capacity to absorb co2
the three year study measured the growth and photosynthesis rates of trees at 13 rainforest plots of up to 500 trees across brazil , peru and bolivia - comparing those affected by the strong drought of 2010 with unaffected plots
there was up to a trebling in some sites in numbers of trees dying in the years after the drought - making them no longer available to absorb co2 from the air
' as trees die and decompose the concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase - potentially speeding up climate change during tropical droughts
