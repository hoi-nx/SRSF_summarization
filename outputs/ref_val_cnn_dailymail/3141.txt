newcastle united will be forced to use janmaat as an emergency centre - back in their next three matches despite the holland international admitting â â i âve never played there in my life â
janmaat is set for a spell at centre back following the fa 's decision to reject coloccini 's appeal the argentine was dismissed following a lunge on aaron lennon and will now serve a three - game ban
it means right - back janmaat is set to partner williamson , but the 25 - year - old said : â if the team needs me there , i am confident i can do well there , even though i have not played as a central defender in the whole of my career
â the dutch international has been one of newcastle united 's most consistent performers so far this season
