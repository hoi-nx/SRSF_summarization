get the truth by philip houston , michael floyd and susan carnicero ever wanted to know the best way of extracting a confession ? me neither , but here âs an unexpectedly fascinating book that shows how to do just that
interrogation is an unfortunate name with regrettable connotations not only will you learn how to have the guilty singing like canaries , this book also comes up with some genuinely important insights about the interrogation process
yes , but it need nât be like that , say the authors , former cia officers who are painfully aware of what â cia interrogation â is taken to mean â torture , screaming agony , electrodes , waterboarding â and who are appalled by that reputation
i think the authors are also against torture and pain on ethical grounds , but the nature of their disgust is partly professional
because it turns out that interrogation - by - torment is ineffective , as the cia âs skilled specialists have known for some time
number of tweets the cia monitors every day at the same time , the interrogator will be intent on keeping that suspect locked into a mode of short - term thinking â keeping the focus on particulars and specifics , trying like crazy to stop the suspect considering the long - term consequences of telling an implicating truth and being found guilty
the book consists mainly of such case studies from the authors â interrogating careers , supplemented weirdly with 70 - odd pages of commentary by a lawyer type who adds his own legal anecdotes to make the same points
presumably , this book is meant to show how the cia âs interrogation techniques can be applied in the normal world
but though it misses that trick , this book does find itself making , i think to its own surprise , a genuine and important contribution to the ongoing debate , particularly in the u.s. , about the use of torture such as waterboarding during interrogations of terrorists
forget any ethical argument , say the authors â any form of physical coercion , far less torture , just does nât work .
