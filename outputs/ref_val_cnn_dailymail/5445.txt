robert freeman is undeniably one of the greatest lost photographers of the modern age , most famous for shooting the first five album covers for the beatles and the first pirelli calendar
now , aged 78 and in poor health , it is both himself and his legacy - a historic archive of iconic photographs spanning 60 years - that could be lost forever
in response to huge public demand , coupled with the love of his family , the serene 1965 photograph ' john lennon with panda ' is today being re-released to raise funds for its photographer robert freeman 's care the exclusive sale organised by his son dean freeman will end 15 may 2015 , raising vital funds for robert freeman âs ongoing care as well as the preservation of a body of work that captured the likes of his personal friend , muhammad ali , muhammad ali , sophia loren , marianne faithful and jimmy cliff
due to the proud and eccentric nature of robert freeman , whose work includes this picture of muhammad ali called rome from 1972 , he has refused all family help after graduating from cambridge in 1959 , robert freeman became a professional photographer , with assignments for the sunday times and went on to capture pictures like this montage of jimmy cliff in 1966 as well as capturing five beatles album covers and the first - ever pirelli calendar , robert freeman 's work also includes this grainy shot of charlton heston in 1962 all previous reproductions of his work have sold for thousands of pounds so this auction is set to raise a huge sum
robert freeman became close to the beatles at the height of their fame , and it is this mutual intimacy that gave him unprecedented access to capture their lives through a series of beautifully grainy black and white photographs
in addition to being the beatles â most favoured photographer , robert freeman directed television and film commercials and two feature films : the touchables and secret world
