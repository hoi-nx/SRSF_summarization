desperate to find a holiday partner for the Â£ 1,950 trip to the dominican republic , john , from donisthorpe , leicestershire , tried to find a companion for the trip on ebay
finally , after instead selling Â£ 10 raffle tickets - raising Â£ 1,410 for testicular cancer charity balls to cancer he jetted off to the caribbean with lucky winner kelly wood - who he met for the first time at the airport
the pair admitted they were both feeling the nerves , as miss kelly wood told good morning britain her hands were shaking and mr john whitbread said he did n't know what to do with himself ' hopefully we will stay friends
' ms kelly wood , an attractive blonde , wrote on facebook : ' we are having a fantastic time and getting on like a house on fire as they say ! ' she later added : ' such great memories to take away with me though and an amazing new friend for life ! ! john whitbread was dumped by his ex-fiancee amy just weeks before their valentine 's day wedding ' loved every second of this crazy adventure ! ! could n't have asked for more ! ! ' mr john whitbread was left heartbroken after his ex-fiancÃ©e amy told him she was n't ' ready to get married ' and left him with a spare ticket to the dominican republic
instead of cancelling the trip , mr john whitbread decided to give the opportunity to a stranger to join him by auctioning off the Â£ 1,950 ticket , with offers starting at 99p
but when the two highest bidders - who offered Â£ 8,000 and Â£ 7,900 - failed to pay up he decided to raffle off the tickets for Â£ 10 instead
he was united with raffle winner kelly wood for the first time on itv just under two hours before he was due to board the plane at manchester airport for the two - week all inclusive break
arriving at the airport with his parents , mr john whitbread waited anxiously to see if the woman would arrive
' mr john whitbread was undecided on how he would greet her and was debating whether to give her a hug , a kiss - or ' a high five ' and added ' i 'll see what comes naturally '
instead of cancelling the honeymoon he decided to auction off the tickets to a stranger who might like to join him
the two highest ebay bidders failed to pay up , so he decided to sell raffle tickets instead miss kelly wood , who had set up her own facebook campaign called ' take kelly wood ' said : ' i 'm nervous - my hands have just started to shake
' a television crew from good morning britain , which filmed the moment they first met , asked the pair a few ' john whitbread & mrs ' style questions before they boarded the plane
asked who would get the window seat miss wood offered it up to mr john whitbread and whether they were thrill seekers or beach babes they agreed they were a bit of both
miss kelly wood also revealed that she ' sleeps in the middle of the bed ' and the worst habit mr john whitbread could have would be snoring , which he previously revealed he did
his new companion was then introduced to mr john whitbread 's parents , who embraced her and their son
the pair flew to the caribbean region , where they stayed in the honeymoon suite in single beds , and returned on march 3
this is the moment the pair first met live on breakfast television this morning
mr john whitbread said he wanted to save chatting for the plane explaining his decision to sell off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said : ' i was gutted when she said she did n't want to get married but i realised i could n't mope forever and i did n't want what i 'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste
' he claims his girlfriend of two years , amy , told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on valentine 's day this year
the pair stayed for two weeks at the honeymoon suite at the blue bay villas hotel in the dominican republic kelly wood had campaigned to win the ticket and was introduced to her holiday partner for the first time at the airport
miss kelly wood compared herself to feeling like a swan - fine on the surface but paddling underneath although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry on valentine 's day , mr john whitbread says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee
' kelly wood set up her own facebook page to get people to buy tickets and donate to mr john whitbread 's cause and eventually won the seat herself
