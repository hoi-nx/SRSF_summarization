but this broken brickwork is actually the result of a botched building job that brought the house down on a couple âs plan for a basement extension
goldswain and his eight months pregnant fiancÃ©e hale fled for their lives when the building cracked in half , escaping from their ground floor flat with their upstairs neighbours as debris fell â like something out of a disaster movie â
for although the builders were found by a judge to have been â incompetent â and were ordered to pay Â£ 287,000 damages , the firm is believed to be insolvent , the high court heard
now the pair fear they will never see their money â and they are still saddled with a 23 - year mortgage on the Â£ 345,000 flat

miss hale and marketing manager mr goldswain , 40 , bought the house in finchley , london , four years ago and decided to extend into the basement
miss hale said : â the good news is that we âre happy and healthy and we âve got two lovely kids
â the judge ordered aims plumbing & building services limited to pay the couple almost Â£ 290,000 for the destruction of their edwardian home
mr goldswain and ms hale were forced to move out of their dream property , along with their neighbour , and subsequent checks by finchley council revealed the house would have to be pulled down broken home : workers dismantle the property in north london after the botched basement extension
a judge today ruled that it was the builders ' ' incompetence ' which led to the collapse in tatters : the builders were ordered to pay Â£ 290,000 in compensation to mr goldswain and ms hale , but the couple were told they may not see a penny because the firm has gone bust all gone : the couple were forced to live a nomadic existence after the house was taken down ( pictured ) , moving through a string of temporary homes , but have now settled in harpenden there is now nothing more than a hole where their old house used to be , with supporting beams used to keep the neighbouring properties up edward goldswain and his partner jacqueline hale , who was eight months pregnant at the time , had to run from their flat as the house collapsed but the court heard aims plumbing & building services ltd is ' believed to be insolvent ' , so the couple may well never see any of the money

they needed more space for their growing family and decided to extend into the basement , aims plumbing & building services ltd starting work in september 2012
cracks which the couple had already noticed began to widen fast and ' they could actually hear the fabric of the house tearing apart '
the couple and the upstairs tenant , who had a baby , hastily evacuated and watched as the building crumbled
' deeply shocked ' , mr goldswain and miss hale escaped with little more than the clothes they stood up in , the court heard
heavily pregnant miss hale went into premature labour due to the trauma , although her baby was happily delivered unharmed
aims plumbing & building services ltd was ordered to pay Â£ 287,754 damages - although the couple are likely to face an uphill struggle in getting hold of any of that

â they will be paid , â miss hale said
