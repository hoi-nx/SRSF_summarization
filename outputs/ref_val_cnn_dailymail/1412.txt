clarkson could return to top gear if he faces up to â his own shortcomings â , a senior bbc source hinted last night
the insider said the 54 - year - old presenter , who is currently suspended after allegedly assaulting assistant producer oisin tymon , might be allowed to come back if he â sorted himself out â
â the remarks come after the mail on sunday provoked an outcry last week when we revealed that a bbc executive had likened clarkson âs support from politicians to that given to paedophile savile
corporation is due to decide mr clarkson âs fate this week , after he was suspended pending an independent review into allegations surrounding the alleged assault
the bbc and clarkson have been locked into a bitter war of words since it emerged he had been involved in an altercation with oisin tymon reportedly sparked by a row over the lack of hot food at a hotel
the 54 - year - old presenter ( right ) is currently suspended after allegedly assaulting assistant producer oisin tymon ( left ) during a briefing to this newspaper last week , a bbc executive also claimed the host was â self - destructing â and should go into rehab
ken macquarrie , head of bbc scotland , who has been investigating the claims , is due to report to bbc director - general lord hall , who will then decide on the star âs fate
but a senior bbc source has now told the mos there is a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear off the air while an investigation was under way
â last week , the mos âs story showed the extent of bbc briefing against the highly - paid presenter , with an executive likening oisin tymon âs position to that of savile âs victims who feared they would not be believed while he was alive
