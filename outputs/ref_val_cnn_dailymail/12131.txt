parliament ended with the most tremendous , tetchy â tearful ! â squabble : should speaker john bercow 's future be decided by secret ballot ? it became a day of wondrous hysteria , tantrums , moist hankies and survival for this stinker of a speaker
labour mps and a handful of men on the right insisted that a secret ballot would be ' undemocratic '
moderate tories and lib dems argued that labour mps openly voting against john bercow feared the squeaker 's tyrannical vengeance crashing about their ears
by the end , john bercow was blubbing with relief , while his friend ( and possible successor ) walker was wailing that some beastly , beastly men had not been entirely clear with him beforehand
boo hoo ! mr walker is so widely seen as a john bercow stooge , it may not be surprising that he was kept out of the loop by john bercow 's enemies
labour mps and john bercow 's tories nutjobs waved their order papers and accused commons leader william hague of being a soviet union dictator
bercowites leapt in the air , brandishing their pleasure and accusing the secret ballot crowd of being ' grubby ' and ' partisan '
a secret ballot may have looked harmless
' labour mps and john bercow 's tories nutjobs waved their order papers and accused commons leader william hague ( pictured ) of being a soviet union dictator ' but labour â which regards john bercow as a client speaker â saw that a secret ballot would give its own mps the cloak of anonymity
labour mps were therefore hauled back from the furthest ends of the kingdom to save the speaker for socialism
at this point you will say ' well , naturally john bercow must have let one of his deputies chair the debate , as it would have been improper for him to supervise it himself '
each of these devices use up precious time and made john bercow 's survival more likely
