osborne announced scrapping income tax paid on interest from regular high street accounts the chancellor heralded a savings revolution yesterday by scrapping income tax paid on interest from regular high street accounts
in a major move to counter the effects of years of historically low interest rates , he announced a new personal savings allowance that will make ordinary accounts tax - free for 95 per cent of the population
it means a basic rate taxpayer can earn Â£ 1,000 in savings interest without paying tax
a higher rate taxpayer will be able to earn Â£ 500
at current rates , a basic rate taxpayer would need to have more than Â£ 70,000 in an average account to go over the new Â£ 1,000 allowance
by stopping tax on savings the chancellor has effectively handed a 20 per cent boost to the rates earned by most savers in the uk
every year someone can pay in Â£ 15,000 to a cash isa where interest is paid tax - free
but on a standard high street savings account , interest is taxed at the saver âs normal rate of income tax
higher earners paying 40 per cent or 45 per cent income tax are supposed to declare the interest they receive on a self - assessment form
these deductions mean that someone with Â£ 20,000 in a high street savings account paying 2 per cent would earn only Â£ 320 a year interest if they were a basic rate taxpayer
a higher rate tax payer would earn Â£ 240 and a top rate taxpayer Â£ 220
if the interest was untaxed the saver would earn Â£ 400
in addition to this , those with total income below Â£ 15,600 a year can apply to have their savings interest paid tax - free
every year thousands of pensioners who can claim tax - free interest on their savings miss out on this perk because they do not realise they qualify
it means a basic rate taxpayer can earn Â£ 1,000 in savings interest without paying tax , while a higher rate taxpayer will be able to earn Â£ 500 figures from hm revenue & customs suggest around Â£ 1.8billion a year is received a year in savings interest tax
the chancellor outlined plans to bank a surplus of Â£ 5.2billion in 2018 - 19 â the first since 2001 â as he hailed a uk â that is growing , creating jobs and paying its way â
two years ago , uk âs building societies called for the government to scrap all tax on savings to remove this complexity
his introduction of a personal savings allowance means that from april 2016 those who earn below Â£ 16,800 a year wo nât have to pay any tax on savings interest
meanwhile , anyone earning below Â£ 42,700 â the point at which higher rate tax starts â will be allowed to have Â£ 1,000 in savings interest tax free
anyone earning more than this , and paying the 45 per cent tax band , has to pay tax on their savings interest
â anna bowes , director of analysts savings champion , said : â it feels like interest rates on savings accounts have been falling for ever , and so this effectively gives them a 20 per cent boost to a basic rate taxpayer
â maike currie , director at investment firm fidelity , said : â this allowance will eradicate the double taxation most people currently experience , where they pay tax on their wages and tax again on the interest from their savings
however , it does little to deal with the paltry interest rates currently on offer to savers
â thumbs up : palmer - with maxwell , four , and zachery , two - welcomed the tax - free boost ivan palmer , 36 , and his wife , clair , 41 , have more than Â£ 45,000 in savings
they described yesterday âs announcement that the first Â£ 1,000 in interest on savings will be tax - free from april 2016 as â fantastic news â
it means they will keep all of the interest they earn on their savings
they have Â£ 10,000 in a high - rate savings account , Â£ 20,000 in a current account and Â£ 15,000 in an isa they also put Â£ 200 per month in a regular saver for their children , four - year - old maxwell and two - year - old zachery
â we earned Â£ 150 on our isa last year , so for us to see our savings income be protected from tax really gets the thumbs up
isas are hugely popular with savers as they allow them to earn interest without paying tax
then the chancellor increased the annual allowance to Â£ 15,000 , and said savers would be allowed to move between cash and shares
