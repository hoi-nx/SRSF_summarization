it claimed the lives of four family members and has left his brother bedbound
now , the cruel disease that has gripped several generations of chris 's family has struck again
mr chris himself was diagnosed with early - onset alzheimer 's disease at just 34
this rare , inherited , or ' familial ' form of alzheimer 's disease has also left his 43 - year - old brother , tony , bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube
several members of his family have been killed by the cruel , genetic form of the condition like his brother , mr chris carries a faulty version of psen - 1 gene , which affects around 400 families worldwide
although he is young , the disease process will affect him in the same way as the estimated 500,000 people with alzheimer 's in the uk
mr chris , who was medically discharged from the army in january after 23 years ' service , said : ' my friends did n't believe me when i told them i had alzheimer 's disease
' at the age of 39 , it just does n't make sense to people : i 'm fighting fit â how can i have something like that ? we still think of alzheimer 's as a bit of forgetfulness as we get older
' this rare , inherited , or ' familial ' form of alzheimer 's disease has also left his 43 - year - old brother , tony ( pictured with his son ) , bedbound in a care home and being fed through a tube the disease also claimed the life of mr chris 's father
' alzheimer 's disease is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for killing brain cells and shrinking the brain 400 per cent faster than the normal rate of ageing
mr chris is now taking part in research studies at university college london 's institute of neurology to help scientists understand the earliest signs of alzheimer 's to boost the search for new treatments
' now , to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for alzheimer 's research uk , mr chris is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around canada and america in april
mr chris said of his brother ( pictured right with his own children ) : ' he 's in an old folk 's home , he ca n't move and has to be fed through a tube
tony is pictured with his partner jane now , to raise awareness of dementia and vital funds for alzheimer 's research uk , mr chris is heading off on a 16,000 mile cycle ride around canada and america in april mr chris , who is also supporting abf the soldiers ' charity through his cycle ride , said : ' it 's going to take me a year to do it , but i hope giving one of my good years to this challenge will help give many more good years to people with dementia
early onset alzheimer 's tends to cluster within families , sometimes with several generations affected , in which case it is called familial disease
it is likely that all of those who inherit faulty versions of any of these three genes will develop alzheimer 's disease at a comparatively early age
someone who has two or more close relatives ( a parent , brother or sister ) who developed alzheimer 's disease before the age of 60 , is advised to ask their gp about genetic testing and counselling for these rare mutations , who can also refer patients to a geneticist , if appropriate
' although chris ' form of alzheimer 's is rare , the tragic consequences it has had on his relatives will resonate with thousands of families across the uk who have experienced alzheimer 's
' chris ' situation shows how profound the impact of alzheimer 's can be â this is not forgetfulness in old age , the disease is a destructive process that takes the ultimate toll
we need to recognise the physical process of alzheimer 's â in doing so we 'll see that there 's something real we can attack and overcome with research
' travelling unsupported on an expedition which will see him cycle 16,000 miles around the coastline of america , chris is a great example of someone who , when faced with a difficult diagnosis , has shown extraordinary grit and determination to overcome his circumstances and ensure that future generations can benefit from potentially life - saving research
