suspected taliban gunmen have brutally murdered a pakistan former lawyer who represented the doctor that helped the us track down al-qaeda leader bin laden
senior police officer khan said unidentified assailants shot and killed afridi this morning in the northwestern city of peshawar before fleeing the scene
although the pakistan taliban have not yet claimed responsibility , they are considered the most likely candidates for an attack that took place close to the border with afghanistan , in the terrorist organisation 's heartland and just over 100 miles from bin laden 's abbottabad compound
the doctor was convicted in may 2012 of ' conspiring against the state ' by giving money and providing medical treatment to militants , not for helping the cia track down bin laden
