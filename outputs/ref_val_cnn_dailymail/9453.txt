while there are many threats to the endangered australia mammals , startling photographs have emerged of a feral cat killing and eating a four - kilogram marsupial
the photographic evidence , which was published on the australian mammalogy , captured a rare moment of the predator preying on an adult female tasmania pademelon
a camera survey has captured a rare moment between a feral cat ( right ) preying on a pademelon ( left ) one of australia âs leading researchers , scientist fancourt found compelling evidence of predation risk after conducting a camera survey in the woodvine nature reserve in south - east of tasmania
fancourt , from the university of tasmania said her observation provides direct evidence that feral cats are competent of killing their prey at up to four kilograms in body mass. the abdominal cavity rips open and the cat continues devouring through the abdominal organs the sex of the species also demonstrates that medium - sized pedemelons such as adult females and juveniles are at high risk of being eaten than the larger adult male marsupials
despite the photo evidence , fancourt said a single observation does not prove feral cats are entirely responsible for the extinct species , adding foxes may have been the â primary causes of population decline â .
