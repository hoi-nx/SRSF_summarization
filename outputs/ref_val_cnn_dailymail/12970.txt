a runway at new york 's laguardia airport reopened friday morning , a day after a delta plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of flushing bay
runway 13 remained closed until the plane could be removed and brought into a hangar
the delta plane slid off the runway thursday morning , with its nose busting through a fence before skidding to a halt mere feet from frigid waters
almost as soon as it did , those aboard realized something was wrong -- the aircraft 's wheels seemed to have little to no traction , sliding for about 20 seconds
a little farther , and the plane -- with 127 passengers and five crew members -- would have been in flushing bay rather than on the airport 's snow - covered ground
still , with help from first responders , everyone was able to get off and onto buses that took them to laguardia airport 's delta terminal
video showed passengers exiting the plane into the subfreezing temperatures as emergency vehicles converged on the area
twenty - four people suffered injuries that were non-life threatening
faellaci said he was thankful for the plane 's crew , first responders and god that it was n't much worse
" the plane left a relatively balmy atlanta shortly after 9 a.m. laguardia airport was dealing with snow and freezing fog as the flight approached its destination about two hours later
before touching down , the plane 's pilot said weather problems could cause a delay
all 155 people aboard that flight -- heading from laguardia airport to charlotte , north carolina -- famously survived thanks to the skills of pilot chesley " sully " sullenberger
" when the plane landed it was like me falling off of the top bunk -- did n't really know what was going on -- i just felt a hit , boom , " he told cnn 's " erin burnett outfront
" the port authority chief said plows had cleared the runway minutes before flight 1086 touched down and that two other landing pilots had reported " good braking " action on runway 13
four minutes after the plane landed , all of laguardia airport shut down to air traffic
