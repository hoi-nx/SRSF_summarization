foreign intervention in yemen 's chaos has dramatically raised the stakes in the arabian peninsula , threatening to expand what is already a civil war into a conflict pitting iran against saudi and an arab coalition
the saudi launched operation " decisive storm " last wednesday with dozens of airstrikes in an effort to blunt the advance of houthi militia and allied army units on the port of aden -- and to protect the last bastion of yemen 's internationally - recognized president hadi
many analysts were surprised at the speed and scale of the saudi air campaign , which the kingdom said would continue until the houthi -- a shia minority that has swept across the country in the last six months -- retreated and laid down their arms
essentially the saudi are trying to bomb the houthi to the negotiating table
the houthi have responded by threatening a campaign of suicide bomb attacks inside saudi
iran , which has supported the houthi as fellow shia , described the saudi offensive as a " dangerous move that would kill any chance at peaceful resolution of the crisis
" yemen is becoming the latest battleground in a contest for regional superiority between saudi and iran that goes back to the overthrow of the shah during iran 's islamic revolution in 1979
there is a real risk that yemen will collapse as a state , with a revived independence movement in the south , the houthi in the north , and the sunni heartland in between
baron , a visiting fellow at the european council on foreign relations and expert on yemen 's tortured recent history , says , " it 's not difficult to divine saudi and its coalition partners ' motivations for taking this action
it will be seen as an act of aggression by most yemen and risks taking the situation to a place that no - one will be able to control
" as in afghanistan , factions in yemen do not respond well to foreign intervention
in 2009 the saudi took military action against the houthi in support of then president saleh , using airstrikes and special forces , but were unable to subdue them
now the houthi have at least some of the $ 500 million in military equipment provided by the u.s. to yemen since 2010 , and they have proved to be capable fighters
they have also grafted themselves onto parts of the army in the battle against aqap ( aqap ) that is now raging in central and southern yemen
whether saudi and egyptian ground forces will become involved in the conflict is the big unknown
in the meantime , saudi tanks and armor have been moved closer to the yemen border , but saudi officials say there are no immediate plans to launch a ground offensive
in the 1960s egyptian intervened in yemen 's civil war on behalf of the anti-royalists -- an operation that sapped the egyptian army and contributed to its failure against the israelis in the 1967 war
president hadi said at the weekend that iran was behind yemen 's turmoil and the houthi were no more than its stooges
saudi and iran involvement in yemen threatens to deepen sectarian distrust in a country where sunni and shia have historically not been enemies
" human rights in yemen are in free - fall as even peaceful protest becomes a life - threatening activity , " according to said boumedouha of amnesty international
a u.n. - led effort to agree on a new constitution has been mired in squabbling , with all parties failing to honor commitments
" even more damaging , those with most influence -- the saudi and iran in particular -- are taking steps to undercut the negotiations , " says the icg
