mobile phone bills should begin to fall after a watchdog ordered telecoms companies to slash the cost of calling another network
for years , mobile users have faced extra charges for so - called ' cross-network ' calls to friends , family and colleagues who have a different provider
the charges , known as the ' mobile termination rate ' , is passed on to the customer who made the call , but also affect calls made from landline operators such as bt and talktalk
for years , mobile users have faced extra charges for so - called ' cross-network ' calls to friends , family and colleagues who have a different provider at the moment , these charges add 0.826 pence a minute to the usual cost of calls
by april 2017 , mobile companies will be allowed to only charge 0.475 pence per minute extra
mobile operators have spent years lobbying to keep the mobile termination rate in place , helping to fatten their profits
however , yesterday the network operators expressed disappointment over ofcom 's decision to cut them further , and issued a veiled threat they could increase other charges to make up for the reduction
' a telecoms source said that mobile phone companies would not be able to offer the same level of service if they do not get as much income from customers
mobile operators , however , said they were pleased that ofcom has given them two years to reduce the charges , as they had feared they would have to slash them overnight
mr howett added that ofcom would keep pressure on mobile companies to pass as much of the savings as possible to customers .
