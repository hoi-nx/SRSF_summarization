kate morgan said she felt ' numb ' when she came face - to - face with edwards , who was responsible for the death of her 22 - year - old daughter lona wyn jones

edwards , 25 , was jailed for three years and nine months after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving , but ms kate morgan , 45 , was haunted by the crash afterwards
' after lona 's death i felt like i was living in a bubble , ' she said
i did want edwards to get some punishment , but it was n't particularly important to me whether he was jailed
five minutes or 1,000 years in jail was n't going to bring lona back
' months later , when life without lona was n't getting any easier , i realised that i had questions only edwards could answer
' after edwards agreed to the hour - long meeting , ms kate morgan travelled with a friend to risley prison in warrington , cheshire to meet the driver , who was accompanied by his father

' i went to see edwards because i needed answers
when i first saw him i felt numb

edwards was said by eyewitnesses to have been ' driving like a lunatic ' in his ford fiesta as lona sat in the back seat , before he lost control and flipped the car over
ms kate morgan said : ' lona had come to see me in the afternoon
he lived about 20 miles away so her best friend fay and another friend edwards , who i 'd not met before , were going to give her a lift
edwards had a silver ford fiesta and i waved them off , giving lona a big hug before she went
' as well as his jail sentence , edwards was banned from driving for four years after he appeared at caernarfon crown court in august 2013
ms kate morgan said : ' in lots of ways i have been able to try and move on , but there is a massive hole in my life
