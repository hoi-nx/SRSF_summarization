as a tory mp in the 1980s proctor had a special talent
others with their extremist political views
proctor found controversy in both
in an age before politicians were out of the closet â and when the age of consent for homosexual sex was 21 â it was an open secret in westminster that the impeccably turned - out proctor was gay
but his political downfall in 1987 â accompanied by newspaper headlines of teenage rent boys and spanking parties â was one of the most dramatic scandals in recent memory as he pleaded guilty to charges of gross indecency after repeated public denials that he had done anything wrong
proctor , former tory mp , had his home searched by police as part of a probe into historic allegations of child sex abuse downfall : proctor on his way to magistrates ' court in 1987 to answer charges of gross indecency as for his politics , his views on immigration were considered so far beyond the pale that while serving as an mp he was beaten unconscious at a demonstration in scarborough , had red paint thrown over him when addressing coventry university , and burning papers were thrust through the letter box of his tiny terrace home in billericay
proctor , who became mp for basildon in the 1979 general election which swept mrs margaret thatcher to power , was a lifelong fan of the iron lady
proctor was forced to deny any knowledge of the abuse and deaths of three young boys to the media but within weeks of being elected he was irritating her and the tory high command with his strident views on migration , backing a motion calling for a ban on immigration from commonwealth countries
it was a sign of things to come â whenever proctor addressed a university as an mp he was the subject of angry and often violent protests
by the time he became mp for basildon in 1979 , he was already a darling of the tory right as a leading figure in the notorious monday club , a lobby group for the tory but considered so extreme that in 2001 the party severed all links with it
tall and gangly â he was once described in the commons as a loping greyhound â the softly spoken proctor revelled in the notoriety of being one of the most outspoken voices on the tory backbenches
on wednesday , detectives arrived at belvoir castle ( pictured ) near grantham â the seat of the duke â where proctor has lived since 2003 , and searched the 16,000 - acre estate when labour - controlled basildon council passed a motion of no confidence in him as the local mp because of his views on race , he was delighted
after the re-drawing of political boundaries jeopardised his majority in basildon , he was selected for the safe neighbouring seat of billericay , which he won convincingly at the 1983 election
proctor was loved by his local party because of his uncompromising views
fiercely ambitious , proctor was consistently overlooked for ministerial preferment by margaret thatcher because of views on immigration which even some tories viewed as racist
the first story to emerge in public about it was in 1981 , when woods , a flamboyant art dealer who was his boyfriend , had left the mp âs london flat after a row and proctor refused to let him back in
proctor repudiated the claim and got away with it
proctor resigned after he was charged over spanking parties with teenage rent boys at his flat and lost his house and flat , before signing on the dole he was embarrassed again soon afterwards when woods , who remained his long - term lover , was found in his underpants by the police outside the mp âs apartment
when police eventually charged him over the teenage rent boys in his flat , proctor bowed to the inevitable and announced he was standing down as an mp , admitting to a charge of gross indecency and accepting a fine of Â£ 1,450
he had to sell his house in the constituency and the flat in london and was on the dole for a year
the 68 - year - old proctor now lives in a large country house on the 18,000 - acre estate near grantham â the birthplace of his heroine margaret thatcher
