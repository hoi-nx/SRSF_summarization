bubbly : but mathilda soon developed narcolepsy , suffering from terrifying nocturnal hallucinations and excruciating pain when claire agreed to have her three - year - old daughter mathilda vaccinated against swine flu , she believed she was doing the best to protect her from a life - threatening pandemic
in 2009 , all children under five were invited to be vaccinated in a nationwide scheme
but claire is convinced that the vaccine against it has left mathilda with severe narcolepsy
mathilda is the youngest known person in the world to be diagnosed with the neurological condition , which causes sufferers to suddenly fall asleep during the day
mathilda also had terrifying nocturnal hallucinations and excruciating pain.now she is part of a protracted legal battle against the government for compensation for vaccine - related narcolepsy
claire , 44 , a former nhs physiotherapist , thought she was playing safe when she had mathilda vaccinated
doctors had suggested her daughter could be at particular risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition , laryngomalacia , which obstructs breathing
â we took the swine flu risk seriously since mathilda had only recently outgrown laryngomalacia , â says claire , who also has a son , elliot , and another daughter , liberty
mathilda âs first troubling symptoms developed within two weeks
â the symptoms just got worse â she was nât sleeping at night , and sleeping and crying all day , â says claire
â her brother would say a joke and she would fall down , â says claire
within six months , claire and her husband oliver , a professor of theology , were housebound caring for mathilda
she was taken to a children âs hospital for what claire calls â a series of failed visits â
â the family was being referred to a psychiatric unit when a locum doctor from india diagnosed narcolepsy , which normally appears at around the age of 15
doctors had suggested to claire her daughter could be at risk from respiratory trouble from swine flu because she was born with a minor throat condition claire spoke to a friend âs cousin , who has narcolepsy
dr mignot has also identified a possible reason why the vaccine has caused narcolepsy : a part of the swine flu virus is similar to a part of the hypocretin cell
the pandemrix vaccine primes the immune system âs â killer â cells to attack this part of the swine flu virus
but in a minority of patients , the killer cells also mistakenly attack the hypocretin cells , thinking they are swine flu cells
in the u.s. , swine flu vaccines have not used adjuvants nor have they been linked with narcolepsy
dr mignot says : â my opinion is that it was a combination of the adjuvants and the h1n1 [ swine flu ] virus particles in pandemrix that made it very nasty for narcolepsy
â gsk ( gsk ) , the pharmaceutical company which made the vaccine , says 795 people across europe have reported developing narcolepsy since its use began in 2009
experts at stanford university in california confirmed mathilda 's diagnosis mathilda began receiving xyrem , a drug that helps with symptoms of narcolepsy , possibly by affecting chemical messengers in the brain
â a course of xyrem costs Â£ 12,000 a year , â says claire
mathilda sleeps restfully at night for three hours at a time
to date , no payment has been made in respect of immunisation against swine flu
â claire says this attitude is born out of ignorance : â the condition has destroyed about 70 million neurons within mathilda âs brain âs sleep centre
claire âs lawyers , hodge jones & allen , have 68 people in a narcolepsy class action â two - thirds were children when vaccinated
â mathilda 's drug treatment has been ' life - changing ' and she sleeps restfully at night for three hours at a time after a court ruled that the patients could be compensated , a dwp appeal reversed this
claire stresses she is not anti-vaccine
â a gsk spokesman told us : â while those vaccinated with pandemrix have been shown in several published studies to be more likely to develop narcolepsy than those who were not , further research is needed to confirm what role the vaccine may have played in the development of narcolepsy among those affected
throughout the development of our pandemic vaccines there were no data to suggest a potential for an increased risk of narcolepsy among those vaccinated
