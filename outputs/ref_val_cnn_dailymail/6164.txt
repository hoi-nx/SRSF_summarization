a new ' superviscous ' layer in earth âs lower mantle has been discovered
the breakthrough could explain why parts of earth âs sinking tectonic plates sometimes stall and thicken 930 miles ( 1,500km ) underground
it could also explain why earthquakes occur deep inside the earth âs interior , suggesting it is hotter than previously thought
shown here is a simplified image of a slab from one of earth 's tectonic plates sinking through the upper mantle above , then stalling and pooling at a depth of 930 miles , where university of utah experiments suggest the existence of an extremely stiff or viscous layer in earth the research was carried out by scientists at the university of utah by crushing minerals between diamonds to replicate conditions in earth 's interior
earth 's main layers are the thin crust four to 50 miles ( six to 80km ) deep , a mantle extending 1,800 miles ( 2,900km ) deep and the iron core
the research suggests how and when earth came to develop one of its most distinct features - rigid tectonic plates - and why venus , earth âs twin - like neighbor , never has
it extends from 410 miles ( 660km ) underground to 930 miles ( 1,500km )
and this strength increased threefold at depths of 930 miles ( 1,500km ) deep
by simulating how it behaves with another dominant mineral at the same level - bridgmanite - the researchers calculated that the viscosity or stiffness of the mantle rock at 930 miles deep is 300 times great than at 410 miles deep
â this viscosity increase is likely to cause subducting slabs [ ones that move under each other ] to get stuck - at least temporarily - at about 930 miles underground
â in fact , previous seismic images show that many slabs appear to â pool â around 930 miles , including under indonesia and south america 's pacific coast
â earth 's main layers ( illustrated ) are the thin crust four to 50 miles ( six to 80km ) deep , a mantle extending 1,800 miles ( 2,900km ) deep and the iron core
the crust and some of the upper mantle form 60 - to 90 - mile - thick tectonic or lithospheric plates that are like the top side of conveyor belts university of utah geophysicist dr miyagi holds a press that houses a diamond anvil , in which minerals can be squeezed a pressures akin to those deep within earth
another implication of the stiff layer is that ' if you decrease the ability of the rock in the mantle to mix , it 's also harder for heat to get out of earth , which could mean earth 's interior is hotter than we think , ' he said
the findings could also indicate that earth 's interior is hotter than thought , averaging 2,150 â° c ( 3,900 Â° f ) at the lower mantle boundary rather than 1,540 â° c ( 2,800 Â° f ) as previously predicted scientists believe the average temperature and pressure 410 miles ( 660km ) deep at the upper - lower mantle boundary is 1,540 â° c ( 2,800 Â° f ) and 235,000 times the atmospheric pressure on earth 's surface
dr miyagi said that at the newly discovered viscous layer 's stiffest area , 930 miles ( 1,500km ) deep , the temperature averages 2,150 â° c ( 3,900 Â° f ) and the pressure is 640,000 times the air pressure at earth 's surface
such conditions prevent geophysicists from visiting earth 's mantle , so ' we know a lot more about the surface of mars than we do earth 's interior , ' according to dr miyagi
