it was a foregone conclusion that htc would use this year 's mobile world congress to launch its latest handset , but the taiwanese firm had something else up its sleeve
at the event in barcelona the phone maker unveiled early details about a full - body virtual reality system it has developed in partnership with gaming giant valve
the system , dubbed re vive , moves beyond just a headset and uses kinect - style lasers to track even the smallest of body movements , letting players become fully immersed in their games
at htc unveiled early details of a full - body virtual reality system developed in partnership with gaming giant valve
the system moves beyond a headset ( pictured ) and uses kinect - style lasers to track the smallest of body movements , letting players become fully immersed in game kinect is a system designed by microsoft for use with its xbox games consoles
this means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller , for example
htc âs vive has â full room scale â and two wireless controllers with hand tracking
a developer version will launch in the spring and the consumer model will go on sale later in the year
the system is powered by the oculus rift technology and htc will announce more information nearer the time of the developer launch
htc also used the event to unveil its 5 - inch htc one m9 phone with 20mp camera and a fitness band , in partnership with under armour
kinect is a system designed by microsoft for use with its xbox games consoles.the technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its ' small object detection ' is said to be two - and - a - half times better.this means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller , for example ( pictured ) ultrapixels are , for all intents and purposes , another name for megapixels
in addition to the upgraded lenses , htc has developed software called dynamic exposure designed around the human eye
' i have previously struggled to buy into virtual reality when it consisted of sitting on a chair and simply looking around , but htc âs vive system has convinced me otherwise
during the demonstration i was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup , the htc vive headset , two controllers and sensors on two of the walls
these sensors use lasers to plot the room âs shape , size and obstacles
but the htc spokesman told mailonline this was because of the interference from the various networks covering the trade show and the final version will be wireless
during a demonstration mailonline 's victoria woollaston was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup , the htc vive headset ( pictured ) , two controllers and sensors on two of the walls
these sensors use lasers to plot the room âs shape , size and obstacles once i put the headset on , a grid appeared around me similar to how the holodeck appears in star trek
i was then trained to use the controllers by blowing up a balloon with the left hand and punching it through the air with the right
by these standards , this technology has the potential to live up to htc âs claims of being revolutionary
that said , there is one substantial benefit to having a stationary virtual reality experience compared to one you can explore and that âs convenience
as it stands though this technology literally took my breath away at times and was the stand out tech of this year âs mobile world congress
' victoria woollaston the ' full - body virtual reality system ' was a surprise announcement at an event where htc also unveiled it m9 handset and a fitness band
the m9 has added incremental changes compared to previous htc one m8 ( pictured ) and these include taking the 4 ultrapixel camera from rear of htc one m8 and adding it to the front of the m9 handset : htc has also unveiled its 5 - inch htc one m9 phone with 20mp camera and a fitness band beside this , however , the changes between the htc one m8 and m9 are incremental with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system
mailonline 's victoria woollaston reveals her first impressions of htc 's new device
' this means it has the same great design and feels comfortable to hold - so is far from a criticism - but it hardly warrants spending money to upgrade , especially from the htc one m8
' htc leads the way with smartphone cameras and has tapped into the growing trend of ' smartphone photography '
' htc prides itself on including features that add value rather than gimmicks , but without these there seems little incentive to switch - especially if you 're a samsung or apple owner
' many of its software features , such as blinkfeed and the new dynamic homescreen , will appeal to hardcore htc fans , but may seem like bloatware to others
htc also used the event to launch its first fitness band in partnership with under armour
the partnership was announced in january and under armour âs team of designers , sports scientists and athletes have worked with htc âs connected products to create the wearable
htc said the band launch in the us later this year and the company is ' evaluating ' it in europe
in addition to the new lenses , htc has developed software called dynamic exposure designed to mimic the human eye
