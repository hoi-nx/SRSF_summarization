louis van gaal is coming under increasing scrutiny but the lack of goals being scored by his forwards is a worry - with talk of manchester united deciding not to sign falcao on a permanent transfer due to his less than impressive performances
club legend yorke formed a formidable partnership with andy cole during their years at the red devils and he feels that their current crop of creative players need to start providing the forwards with the same quality and style he had at old trafford
yorke scored an impressive 48 goals in 96 games for manchester united and sir alex ferguson speaking to the sunday mirror he said : ' i 'm sure it 's only a matter of time before things click , but as strikers you also need the players behind you to make it happen
' andy cole and yorke were formidable but had david beckham , paul scholes and ryan giggs providing them rooney is the clubs current top - scorer with 11 goals in all competitions , with the england captain also being asked to drop into midfield in the past couple of months
with robin van persie recently suffering an injury , yorke feels that rooney and falcao could be the pairing to set old trafford alight again
