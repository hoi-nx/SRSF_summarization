as romantic comedy pretty woman celebrates its 25 - year anniversary this week , the film 's scriptwriter has revealed that the iconic fairy - tale ending could have been very different
the 1990 film , which is set in los angeles , sees julia roberts as vivian , a down - on - her - luck prostitute who agrees to become a one - week escort for wealthy businessman , edward , played by richard gere
the much - loved movie ends with the improbable pair going off in the sunset together - yet the original ending was more realistic and was intended to reflect his story 's ' dark and gritty ' tone
in the original script , edward is seen to patrol around intentionally looking for a prostitute american screenwriter lawton , who penned the original script , which was called $ 3000 for the amount edward agrees to pay vivian for a week of her company , revealed in an interview with vanity fair that : ' the tone and ending are completely different
' most notably , in lawton 's original script vivian and edward do not find true love together
indeed , pretty woman 's cinderella ending that sees edward as a modern - day knight in shining armour , who ' rescues ' vivian from her apartment block would have been completely different
instead , lawton says : ' the film ends with kit [ vivian 's prostitute friend ] and vivian on a bus bound for disneyland ... with kit anticipating a fun day financed by vivian 's week with edward , as vivian ' stares out emptily ahead
the original script dictates that pretty woman ends with vivian and kit on a bus bound for disneyland as vivian ' stares out emptily ahead '
there is no ' knight in shining armour ' scene for vivian ( pictured ) in the original script , vivian is a helpless drug addict that must use prostitution to fund her crack addiction upon clocking the original script , even julia roberts described it as , ' a really dark and depressing , horrible , terrible story about two horrible people
in the original script , edward is very much looking for a prostitute when he stumbles upon vivian pretty woman stars reunited on nbc show this morning , left to right : hector , laura san giacomo , director marshall , presenter matt lauer , julia roberts and richard gere pretty woman ! the original scriptwriter has admitted that the ending could never have stayed the same ' dark and gritty ' way once the film was cast , as richard gere and julia roberts ' just light up with each other ' the iconic shopping scene where vivian is given edward 's card and goes on a limitless shopping spree never happens in the original script in the film , richard gere 's character edward is constantly looking out for vivian and even enlists the help of shop assistants to help her with her new wardrobe
in the original script he never tries to protect julia roberts 's character vivian
' vivian responds by screaming at him : ' go to hell ! i hate you ! i hate your money ! i hate it ! ' in the unrevised script , richard gere never ' rescues ' julia roberts with roses up her apartment ladder , but instead throws her heartlessly from his car and chucks money at her the original script show the heated and horrid final exchange between the two characters , who clearly never end up together lawton 's script became hot property after it was pitched to disney 's production company , touchstone
lawton suspects this rewrite was partially down to the casting of the leads julia roberts and richard gere
julia roberts described her original character as ' this drug addict , a bad - tempered , foulmouthed , ill - humored , poorly educated hooker , ' rather than the lovable and talkative vivian in pretty woman the pretty woman cast reminisced about making the movie 25 years after it came out on nbc 's today show julia roberts and richard gere have a laugh as they remember filming the 1992 blockbuster rom com ' it might have been closer to the original script and maybe not have had a happy ending
' but the chemistry between julia roberts and richard gere , it is palpable on the screen , it was palpable in auditions
julia roberts [ roberts ] was rapunzel , richard gere [ richard gere ] was prince charming and hector [ elizondo - who plays the kind hotel manager ] was the fairy godmother
sweet home alabama : rather than the tame ending where the couple kiss and then celebrate with their friends , an alternate ending sees josh lucas carrying reese witherspoon 's lifeless body into the party
