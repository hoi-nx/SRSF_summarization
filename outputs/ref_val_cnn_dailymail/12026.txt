a decision over whether to open britain âs first â new â grammar school in 50 years has been shelved until after the election , it emerged last night
the proposal for an â annexe â to an existing grammar school in sevenoaks , kent , is currently being considered by the education secretary nicky morgan
she is awaiting legal advice and was expected to rule on the matter before the election
but last night a downing street source said : â i do not think there âs going to be a decision on it this side of the election
â last month , the prime minister said he strongly supported the right of ' good ' schools â including grammars â to grow and if labour is elected in may then the scheme would almost certainly fail to get the go - ahead
the tories would probably need an overall majority rather than a coalition to give the plan a chance of being rubber - stamped
the delay will cause dismay among tories backbenchers and last night threatened to overshadow an announcement the prime minister is due to make today about the government âs flagship free schools programme
they hope to set up 500 new free schools over the next parliament and 270,000 new school places if re-elected
â the proposal for a grammar school annexe comes from weald of kent grammar school in tonbridge which wants to open a campus nine miles away in sevenoaks
however the issue is seen as hugely divisive , so it is believed that election chiefs want to avoid it coming up during the campaign
the education secretary nicky morgan was preparing to give the go ahead to the new school for girls in sevenoaks , kent the party was previously convulsed by a row over grammars in 2007
â next week âs budget will also give details of a crackdown on loopholes used by multinationals to avoid tax
