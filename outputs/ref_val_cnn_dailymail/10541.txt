over the last few weeks , jeremy has had to defend himself from all sides as he faced the axe from his top gear show
but while the tv star went through a range of emotions under the glare of the media spotlight , one constant that remained by his side was an attractive blonde , who was the first to rush to jeremy 's london home following the news of his bbc sacking today
phillipa , 45 , has been a feature in jeremy âs life since 2010 , while he was still in a relationship with his wife frances
phillipa worked as an events organiser for the show and so she was constantly by the team âs side as they visited the exotic locations
jeremy and phillipa arriving at sir david tang 's 60th birthday party last november at the dorchester in london they were first pictured together beside a pool on march 18 , 2011 , in johannesburg , where jeremy was rumoured to have fed phillipa lettuce with his fingers
a year earlier , jeremy had appeared to make reference to his rumoured love interest in a motoring column in a national newspaper where he discussed a time that he test drove a maserati in new zealand , with phillipa in the back seat
â at the time , both sides were quick to deny the affair , with phillipa telling the mirror : â jeremy and i are friends , i have worked with him , er , them ( the top gear team ) for years
â jeremy enjoying a day by the beach along with phillipa in a greece island while on holiday in 2013 the pair appears to share a laugh together as they enjoyed a few drinks soon after the pictures appeared in a national newspaper , it was reported that phillipa had left her position on the show in a bid to placate jeremy âs furious wife , who had to learn of the affair while at home with their three children
phillipa in the sea on their greece holiday for a while , everything appeared to have calmed down and little more thought was given to phillipa , until she was pictured with jeremy on holiday in rome in november 2012 , more than a year after they were photographed together
â although phillipa shied away from joining jeremy at any social engagements in the uk , the pair were then spotted on holiday together again in march 2013 , when they were photographed on a yacht and on the balcony of the tv star 's apartment in sydney , while he completed top gear commitments
phillipa and jeremy on a weekend break to rome in 2012 five months later they visited greece in august 2013 and were pictured openly kissing one another at a beach - side taverna in greece as they shared some drinks
although jeremy appeared to have a change of heart inside the venue and opted to leave with the writer rachel johnson as phillipa exited alone slightly later in the evening

philipa was always somewhat of a tomboy after growing up with two brothers , although she initially trained as a beautician and masseuse at the local country club after graduating from grammar school phillipa arrives at jeremy 's home in west london last week but the job did nât hold enough of a challenge for phillipa and she soon moved into events , where she eventually started working at top gear , where she stayed until she a newspaper reported on her alleged affair with jeremy in 2011
