grassroots clubs are missing out on millions of pounds from the transfer of their former players
that is the fear of wallsend boys club chairman , steve dale
his club benefited from the Â£ 2million transfer of fraser forster from newcastle to celtic in 2012 and have now landed another payment in light of his Â£ 10m move to southampton in august
southampton goalkeeper fraser forster was formerly registered with wallsend boys club wallsend boys club is one of the country âs most famous talent factories and had the likes of alan shearer , peter beardsley and michael carrick on their books but because junior clubs have to make an application for their entitlement to the buying club within 18 months of the deal , steve dale believes that millions could be going unclaimed by junior clubs worldwide
â wallsend were entitled to payment from the transfer of fraser forster from newcastle to celtic in 2012 and from celtic to southampton last summer because the deals were made between different football associations newcastle and england striker alan shearer played for wallsend boys club before joining southampton 's academy wallsend boys club chairman steve dale fears grassroots clubs could be missing out millions by not claiming money they are entitled to english clubs only receive the payment when a player moves between clubs registered in different football associations ( ie international transfers ) and a fee is involved , as was the case with fraser forster when he swapped scotland for england last month
five per cent of every transfer fee between clubs in different associations is set aside to be distributed to any club â including professional - to which the player was registered between the seasons of their 12th and 23rd birthdays
