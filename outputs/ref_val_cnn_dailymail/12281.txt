back in 2010 uk 's politicians broke new ground
they were long used to haranguing each other in the uk 's rowdy house of commons -- but they 'd never had u.s. style pre-election head - to - head debates
it is necessary and long - established political fare in the u.s. -- but over here in the uk , it was novel
uk 's broadcasters , keen to channel lively politics onto prime time tv and boost ratings , have been working the corridors of power themselves over the past year to try to nail down a repeat -- or two -- of the 2010 knockabout
what 's at stake is n't just the proposed debates ahead of may 's general election -- but the enshrining of such debates permanently into uk 's political architecture -- just like in the u.s. but while cameron and miliband have hired former white house election advisers to edge them in to the lead , no one can agree on what form a debate should take , how many there should be , or even who should be invited
cameron has insisted on just one debate involving the leaders of seven leading uk parties -- giving equal airtime to the greens , the scottish nationalists and the upstart rightwing uk independence party ( ukip ) , among others
but miliband 's labour is holding out for at least one head - to - head debate with cameron
it once looked like it would become as much of a uk institution as rain , or fish and chips , but now the election debate seems in danger of not happening at all
