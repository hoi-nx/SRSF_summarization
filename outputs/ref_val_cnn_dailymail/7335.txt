timeshare fraudsters duped thousands of britons victims out of more than Â£ 4million a year in a well - honed criminal operation smashed by spanish police
police chiefs today announced that they have arrested 56 people - all brits , including the three alleged leaders - and uncovered 500 mostly pensioner victims
and they said they feared thousands more would now be identified following a series of costa del sol raids against the gang which had been operating for more than five years
the three - tier scam involved calls from fake lawyers and court officials who persuaded their victims to hand over up to Â£ 35,000 after being conned into selling their timeshares
' telesales operators contacted potential victims and offered them attractive prices to sell their timeshare properties and took advantage of their ignorance of spanish law once they 'd been tempted to instruct them to pay things like administrative or public notary fees
' the third tier involved people posing as court officials ringing victims and saying cases had been resolved in their favour but they had to pay fees so they could obtain their cash settlements
' the scam sounds very crude but we estimate the fraudsters were making between Â£ 35 and Â£ 35,000 from victims and the fraud was netting between Â£ 3.5 million and Â£ 4.5 million a year
concern : police fear there may be thousands more victims may be identified following a series of raids on the costa del sol ( pictured ) against the gang which had been operating for more than five years the alleged ringleaders , who have not been named , are suspected of laundering the multi-million pound proceeds of their fraud through bars and restaurants on the costa del sol much of the money had been banked in offshore accounts
the man police say is the ringleader was detained in a second phase after returning to spanish from the britons
none of the suspects have been formally charged as is customary under spanish law , but are being probed on suspicion of money laundering , fraud and membership of a criminal gang
inspector perez said : ' we know so far this organisation defrauded 500 britons victims out of money but we expect there are thousands of victims
