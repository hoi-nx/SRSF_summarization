this well - heeled hamlet north of new york is embroiled in an increasingly nasty debate that seems oddly out of place amid the stately homes and tony boutiques : what should be done about coyotes ? self - styled coyote spotters in and around chappaqua have counted 160 incursions into backyards and streets over the last two years and at least 10 recent attacks on pets
' and members of a local task force that advocates trapping and killing some of the animals announced they were staying away from a recent public hearing on the issue ' in the interest of our personal safety
a facebook page for the group posted this photo of a coyote seen november 16 , 2014 wounded : the anti-coyote new castle coyote management task force included this photo of dogs injured by the wild animals at the end of a presentation ' i envisioned going down there and having blood thrown on me , ' said task force member joyce stansell-wong , who has since resigned

' taking out the garbage , grilling in backyards , walking children home from bus stops and the simple act of walking dogs have all attracted coyotes
' a separate group , represented by the new castle coyote awareness and safety advisory committee , is advocating more tolerance , noting that coyote attacks on humans are very unusual and that a little education â and keeping pets on leashes â can help limit close encounters
in general , they would limit killings to coyotes that attack humans or leashed pets
they differ , however , on the current effectiveness of ' hazing ' coyotes , or trying to instill a fear of humans by making a noisy commotion when a coyote is spotted
' dan bogan , a coyote expert who consults for the dec , said , ' we 're never going to get rid of coyotes
