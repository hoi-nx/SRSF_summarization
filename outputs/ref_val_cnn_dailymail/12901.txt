washington if it looks like a treaty , walks like a treaty and talks like a treaty , is it a treaty ? according to the white house , only if the president of the united states says it is
that 's infuriating republicans and even some democratic , who are demanding that the obama administration submit any final nuclear deal with iran to congress for approval
" kerry denounces republicans letter to iran leaders the republicans position could jeopardize the long - term survival of any iran deal , and it represents the party 's newest clash with president obama over the limits of executive authority , as republicans object to a pact they warn could eventually give tehran a nuclear bomb
it 's that skepticism that has largely led the white house to define the deal as a " nonbinding agreement " rather than a " treaty , " which the constitution requires senate " advice and consent " on
the distinction -- and whether it can legitimately be used to shut out congress -- turns on complicated and unresolved questions of constitutional law
" did 47 republicans senators break the law in plain sight ? republicans see criticism of the administration 's maneuver as a way to gum up the works on the current deal , and to push their larger assault on the white house 's exercise of power
at the senate hearing wednesday , kentucky republicans rand paul explicitly tied the administration 's bid to keep the deal away from congress to other accusations of white house overreach
" this is an administration that seeks to legislate when that is not in their purview , whether it be immigration , whether it be health care , " he charged , noting that he had joined 46 other republicans senators in signing a letter to the islamic republic informing them of congress 's role in approving binding agreements
" i signed it to an administration that does n't listen , to an administration that , every turn , tries to go around congress because you think you ca n't get your way
" it is a very interesting question , " said nicholas burns , a former senior u.s. diplomat , arguing that it is essentially up to the administration to decide whether it is negotiating an agreement that formally binds the u.s. to commitments under international law ; i.e. , a treaty , or a less stringent arrangement
senators grill obama officials on iran jim walsh , a specialist on the iran nuclear program at the massachusetts institute of technology , said the iran deal , which commits the u.s. to waive or lift sanctions , does not rise to the level of a formal treaty
" we have had all sorts of agreement that were never ratified by congress , " walsh said
but david rivkin , a constitutional and international law expert who worked for president george h.w. bush , said that any international agreement requiring major undertakings on the part of the u.s. -- such as the proposed iran deal -- must be sent to the senate for advice and consent
republicans point to none less than the vice president of the u.s. to bolster their case
when vice president biden was a senator in 2002 , he wrote a letter to then - secretary of state colin powell charging that a planned strategic arms reductions deal with russia constituted a treaty subject to senate approval since it would require " significant obligations by the u.s.
while congress approves some agreements , " as the authors of this letter must know , the vast majority of our international commitments take effect without congressional approval
the white house would clearly prefer a binding agreement with iran , which would have a better chance of longevity
but the strength of opposition in congress makes that route impossible
according to republicans such as cotton , the only deal the senate would approve is one that completely bans iran uranium enrichment
" if congress does n't approve this deal , congress wo n't accept this deal , now or in the future , " cotton told cnn
the administration acknowledges that congress will have to get involved at some point
but he does not have the power to lift sanctions imposed by congress , which include some of the most punitive measures against iran
" at some time in the duration of this agreement , congress will have to be heard on sanctions relief
kaine , a democratic senator from virginia who has signed onto a bill calling for the white house to put any deal up for a vote in congress , said that obama is within his rights to do what he is doing -- up to a point
" but kaine told cnn on wednesday that lawmakers did have a role to play at the point when sanctions mandated by congress are bargained away to ensure iran sticks to limits on its nuclear program
" congress has got to weigh in at some point , " kaine said .
