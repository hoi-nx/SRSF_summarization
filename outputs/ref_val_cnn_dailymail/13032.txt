" racing is one of those ... probably a crueler sport in that there 's so many other variables , " says red bull 's no.1 driver ricciardo , ahead of sunday 's season - opening australian grand prix
" ricciardo experienced the full extent of formula one 's cruelty at last year 's melbourne race
" it 's frustrating , i mean it 's a part of the sport which will always be frustrating , " said the 25 - year - old , reflecting on what was his red bull debut
but technical blunders do n't always end in disaster -- hamilton won the italian grand prix after experiencing mechanical faults early in the race , and finnish driver valterri bottas lost a wheel in 2014 's opener before roaring to a fifth - place finish
despite ricciardo 's previous disappointment , he 's ca n't wait to race on his home turf again next sunday
" after last year 's disaster ricciardo is looking to make things right , " there 's a little bit of redemption , i 'm confident we can get it back
