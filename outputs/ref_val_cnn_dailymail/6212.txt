former lib dems president farron savaged deputy prime minister nick clegg âs u-turn on university tuition fees and said the party had been â tarnished â by the coalition with cameron
farron , a bitter lib dems foe of nick clegg , said the party needed a tough new leader like ex-marine ashdown who rescued it from a similar crisis in the 1980s
he said he had the â vision and never say die â spirit needed to repair the slump in lib dems fortunes under nick clegg
left - winger farron , hot favourite to succeed nick clegg if , as expected , the lib dems flop in the election , threw down the gauntlet in an interview with the mail on sunday
nick clegg âs panicking allies have launched a â stop farron â campaign in a last - ditch attempt to stop him taking over after the election
but speaking ahead of the party âs spring conference in liverpool this weekend , farron made it clear he is determined to replace nick clegg
he brushed aside claims by the nick clegg camp that he is a â sanctimonious , god - bothering , treacherous little s * * * â , compared nick clegg âs leadership to the lib dems â â near death â in the 1980s and said voters would never forgive him for his tuition fees somersault
for a committed christian , it is surprising how much hatred farron generates among fellow top lib dems
there is no love lost between farron and his main leadership rival , minister and nick clegg ally norman lamb
nick clegg , lamb and co swallowed their lib dems pride and principles , at least on occasion , for ministerial jobs and limos in the coalition.meanwhile , farron , refused a government post by nick clegg , could grandstand from the sidelines , voting against the bedroom tax and tuition fees
farron âs supporters in the lib dems sandal - wearing brigade say he is â untainted â and see â saint tim â as a saviour
farron âs conversation is peppered with â blinkins â and â bloomins â , adding to a boyish , tintin cartoon air of wide - eyed enthusiasm
â farron believes that nick clegg , pictured , blew the trust of the voters by his u-turn on tuition fees mr farron , pictured , said neither of the two main parties should assume the lib dems will prop them up he scoffs at the idea of a â half - baked distant god â either he created every bloomin â atom in the entire universe or he did nât â
lib dems cynics are less generous : they say voting against it would have been fatal to his leadership hopes in a party known for its strong pro-gay rights stance
state - educated northerner farron , 44 , has none of the expensive suits and modulated vowels of private schoolboy nick clegg
farron dismisses nick clegg âs claim that he had to back tuition fees to save the coalition
it was â obvious â the lib dems would be â tarnished â by it and voters would not forgive them
â nick clegg allies are quick to point out farron voted for the coalition deal
far from knifing nick clegg , he says he â rode to the rescue â in several key party conference votes
â farron , pictured , said he regrets signing a letter with fellow lib dems mps to force former leader charles kennedy 's resignation claiming he was acting on the advice of an un-named senior party politician but in a clear dig at nick clegg , farron makes it clear if there is another hung parliament after the election , and he is in charge , it will take more than a swanky limo to make him jump into bed with the tories or labour
farron portrays himself as a heroic , visionary ashdown - style lib dems leader - in - waiting , name - checking him a dozen times during the interview
farron says he will rebuild the lib dems with the same â absolute bloody - minded refusal to lie down and die â spirit displayed by ashdown , a square - jawed ex-royal marine trained to kill with his bare hands
farron was too discreet to mention it , but it is a matter of record that nick clegg , four years his senior , was among the signatories
for all his claims of loyalty , those who know farron say he will have no regrets if nick clegg resigns
