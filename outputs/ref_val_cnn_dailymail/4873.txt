veteran quins nick easter is a man on a mission for the remainder of this season , hell - bent on proving his critics wrong by claiming the most unlikely of spots in lancaster 's england world cup squad
a combination of impressive form for quins , coupled with an untimely injury for gloucester no 8 ben morgan , saw easter recalled for this season 's six nations after more than three years in the international wilderness
the 36 - year - old 's last international start came in the defeat by france in the quarter - finals of the 2011 world cup , and he was subsequently omitted from the england set - up once lancaster became coach in early 2012
nick easter poses with james haskell and lawrence dallaglio at the six nations but his ability to cover at no 8 as well as in the second row saw him feature as a replacement for england against wales , italy , ireland and france in this year 's six nations , with the veteran even winning his 50th international cap in the loss in dublin
nick easter 's return to england colours has been seen by most as simply short - term option as the likes of ben morgan and wasp joe launchbury battle their way back to full fitness
' it 's going to be tough making the world cup squad with ben morgan coming back to full fitness , ' said nick easter , speaking at the rosslyn park hsbc
easter looks dejected at the end of the six nations match between england and france ' but i back myself to make it and i just hope i get a chance in the final world cup warm - ups
' i would not mind becoming the oldest scorer for england at the world cup â it would be a really nice thing to add to my career and i 'm now so desperate to get the opportunity â i will be doing everything i can to impress and earn selection
' england came within six points of winning the six nations title this season after dismantling france at twickenham on the final weekend of the championship , with only an ireland hammering of scotland meaning easter is not adding yet more silverware to an already impressive cv
easter is 36 but hopes to win a place in lancaster 's england squad a host of england players sparkled during the tournament , namely jonathan joseph and ben youngs , but it was the performances of saracen billy vunipola at the base of the scrum that caught easter 's eye
