when it comes to the americans fraternity and sorority system , it 's a disturbing truth : life is largely segregated by race , money and power ; and , yet , most of us find that unsurprising
it reportedly shows members of the sae at the university of oklahoma chanting these chilling lines : " there will never be a ni * * * * sae
" " the students on the bus clap and pump their fists as they boisterously chant , " cnn 's eliott c. mclaughlin writes , describing a clip that rocketed around social media , leading university of oklahoma 's president , boren , to rightfully shutter and ban that fraternity from the school
the video is hard to watch , but i have a feeling it 's one we need to see , both because it hints at the inner workings of certain greek organizations , and because it shows the persistent racism that still exists in the americans
what happened on the bus at university of oklahoma does n't negate their positive experiences
but it should cause us to question a system that is inherently built around the concept of exclusion
but we 'd be kidding ourselves if we did n't realize that , often , a person 's race -- or sexual orientation , for that matter -- factors into this you 're - in , you 're - out process
oklahoma school 's response to video caught between racism , civil rights act and it 's hard for me not to see the sae video as a manifestation -- an admittedly extreme one -- of this exclusionist ideology
in a system that remains largely divided by race , perhaps videos like this should n't be so surprising
that 's the view of hughey , an associate professor of sociology at the university of connecticut who studies racial dynamics in african american greek life
the americans fraternity and sorority system is " a form of african american apartheid , " he told me in an interview on monday
instead of thinking of the university of oklahoma fraternity members as " bad apples , " he said , we should see them as part of a " bad orchard
it also includes the rest of us and our country 's racist history
" largely , these organizations reflect a supersegregated and unequal system that is made up of college and alumni members all over the world , " he said
sae is no stranger to scandal and sanctions comparative data on the racial make - up of these organizations is impossible to come by , but anecdotal evidence suggests these groups are starkly divided by race
far too many of us , especially those of us with friends and family members who have participated in greek life , either are in denial about this -- or we choose to see egregious cases of racism , sexism and violence in the americans greek system as somehow isolated
as recently as 2013 , the fraternity got suspended following allegations it had photographed african american students while pledges recited rap lyrics laced with racial slurs , " according to the washington post 's terrence mccoy
then we could know the answers to some interesting questions : how segregated are greek organizations ? are certain schools or organizations more integrated than others ? what 's the trend over time ? is there progress ? john lewis on university of oklahoma students : ' they should be gone ' universities also should assess how and why they support these organizations
but it 's a system that needs to take a hard look in the mirror and make some real changes
" any time there are racist remarks made , we must speak up as americans , " boren , the university of oklahoma president , said in a news conference
