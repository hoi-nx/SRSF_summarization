new zealand police have revealed a threat to contaminate infant formula and other dairy formula with poison , in an apparent attempt to blackmail the government over its pest control policies
the letters were accompanied by small packages of milk powder containing a concentrated form of 1080 ( sodium fluoroacetate ) , a poison used by new zealand 's department of conservation to control introduced pest species such as possums and rats
the letters threatened to contaminate infant and other formula with 1080 unless new zealand stopped using the poison for pest control by the end of march , police said in a statement
the letters said the threat would be made public if the demand was not met
new zealand 's heavy use of 1080 -- it uses about 80 % of the world 's manufactured stocks , according the country 's environmental protection agency -- has been a controversial issue , with conservationists and farmers generally supporting the measure , and some hunters and animal rights activists opposed
" prime minister john key said at a press conference that police had advised that there was a low likelihood of the threat being carried out
meanwhile , government officials said supplies of formula had not been contaminated , and urged consumers to continue using the products
" we are confident that new zealand infant and other formula is just as safe today as it was before this threat was made , " said scott gallacher , deputy director - general of the ministry for primary industries
he urged consumers to check formula packaging for any signs of tampering as a result of the threat
police said an auckland - based investigation team was pursuing a number of lines of inquiry in locating the source of the threat , but the time was right to appeal to the public
" the global diary giant has been beset by problems before , most recently in 2013 , when it ordered a global recall of products -- including infant formula -- after fears they might contain bacteria that could cause botulism
new zealand infant formula exporters association chairman michael barnett said eyes were now on the response to the threat in key markets such as china , the biggest consumer of new zealand dairy exports
" trading in all new zealand - listed dairy companies was halted tuesday with the announcement of the threat
