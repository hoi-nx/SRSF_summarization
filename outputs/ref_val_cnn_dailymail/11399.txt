greeks ministers have threatened to send â millions of immigrants and thousands of jihadis â to western europe if it is forced out of the euro
the country âs defence and foreign ministers made the warning as eurozone creditors urge them to speed up promised reforms to receive payments on a Â£ 172billion bailout
he said : â there will be tens of millions of immigrants and thousands of jihadists , if you take out greeks
â in a similar warning , kammenos , the greeks defence minister , said that if the eurozone allowed greeks to go bust it would give eu travel papers to illegal immigrants crossing its borders or the thousands held in detention centres
â most greeks want the country to keep the euro , but two - thirds also continue to back the government âs tough stance to renegotiate the bailout package
the country âs creditors in the 19 - country eurozone endorsed greeks âs request for the extension after the european commission , european central bank and international monetary fund â the main institutions handling greeks âs loans â provisionally backed a list of reforms that athens proposed .
