dal babu , who left metropolitan police in 2013 , said there was a ' lack of knowledge ' among officers around race and faith issues a muslim former police chief yesterday condemned the government âs flagship anti-radicalisation strategy as a â toxic brand â
dal babu said most muslim are suspicious of the prevent scheme and think it is used for spying on them
the former chief superintendent , who retired from the metropolitan police in 2013 , said the force 's counter-terrorism command was â virtually all white â and insisted there was a â lack of knowledge â among officers around race and faith issues
the prevent programme , which has an annual budget of Â£ 40million , is designed to identify people at risk of being radicalised and potentially turning to terrorism
mr dal babu , who was chairman of the association of muslim officers within the metropolitan police , said : â there 's been a lot of concern about the prevent strategy in the muslim community over the last few years
â it 's virtually all white in the counter-terrorism command , â he said â there 's a lack of diversity in the police and , equally important , a lack of diversity in children 's services
â anyone who comes under scrutiny as part of prevent can also see their details shared with counter terrorism officers
â sir peter said it would â obviously help â to have more muslims working in the police but officers on the prevent programme had developed an â extensive knowledge of minority groups and the different facets of the muslim religion â , he said
â â this government fundamentally revised the prevent strategy in 2011 to ensure it challenges terrorist ideology , supports people who are vulnerable to being drawn into terrorism and works with sectors and institutions where there are risks of radicalisation
