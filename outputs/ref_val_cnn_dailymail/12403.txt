kabul , afghanistan grieving women carried her coffin high on their shoulders in scenes many said they had never witnessed before in the afghanistan capital
men are traditionally pallbearers in kabul , where days earlier a mob of male attackers beat and kicked 27 - year - old farkhunda before tossing her off a bridge , setting her body on fire and throwing it in the river
like many afghanistan , farkhunda used only one name
early reports suggested that farkhunda was mentally ill , but her tearful father , nadir , told cnn affiliate tolonews she was a religious teacher who taught the quran to children
farkhunda 's parents said the killing was instigated by a local mullah of the shah-e-do shamshera mosque in the city 's center , who had been angered by farkhunda 's accusations that he was distributing false tawiz
tawiz are pieces of paper containing verses of the quran which are sometimes worn as pendants to ward off evil and bring the wearer good luck
tolonews reported that " in order to save his job and life , " the mullah reportedly began shouting accusations that farkhunda had burned the quran
witnesses said a crowd gathered and hauled farkhunda into the street
" afghanistan 's ministry of hajj and religious affairs said it had found no evidence farkhunda burned the quran
farkhunda 's father said those guilty of killing his daughter should face justice : " i do n't want blood of my daughter go in vain
" on sunday , as they watched farkhunda 's casket being carried to her grave , the crowd shouted " kabul police officials should be fired , " according to afghanistan human rights activist anwari
many of them are expected to attend a large rally planned for tuesday outside afghanistan 's supreme court in kabul to call for justice for farkhunda , he said
