â mrs richardson and her husband had been on a cruise to see the northern lights on board ocean countess when she suffered a gastro - intestinal haemorrhage in march 2011
crew members strapped her to a stretcher with a blanket and tried to pass her to a team on a lifeboat which had pulled up beside the ship
but the two boats , which were travelling side - by - side at 10 knots , were not tethered together and began to move apart at the crucial moment , plunging mrs richardson into the sea
mrs richardson was being moved from the cruise ship to a rescue boat on a stretcher when she was dropped because mrs richardson suffered from cirrhosis of the liver , high blood pressure and was an insulin - dependent diabetic prior to the cruise and because she later died of natural causes the compensation payment was restricted
