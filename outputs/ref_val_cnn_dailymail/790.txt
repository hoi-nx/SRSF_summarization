a radio dj has spoken of her nightmare being stalked by a man for 13 years - who would call her 66 times an hour and even threatened to throw acid in her face
sayles became so terrified of her stalker that she began to self - harm and was afraid to go in to work at sunrise radio , in bradford , alone
the 40 - year - old says she finally has her life back after enduring more than a decade of sickening harassment because of stalker feroz
sayles ( pictured left and right , at work at sunrise radio ) endured ' sheer hell ' thanks to a stalker who harassed her for 13 years
stalker feroz was detained indefinitely in hospital feroz , 55 , was detained in hospital indefinitely last month after judge jonathan durham hall qc ruled he posed a serious danger to the public and sunrise radio station in particular
ms sayles revealed seeing her stalker in court was only the second time she had seen him in person
but during years of what she described as ' sheer hell , ' ms sayles said authorities had refused to act because he had never physically attacked her - until last year , when he threatened her with acid attacks and vowed to put her in a wheelchair
ms sayles says she became too afraid to go in to work at sunrise radio ( pictured ) in bradford alone she added : ' i was the only white person working at the station at the time so whether he fixated on that or the fact i was the only one answering i do n't know but it was 13 years of sheer hell
' ms sayles , from bradford , says the abuse started in 2001 after a rival business to feroz 's was advertised on sunrise radio
after his business went bust , feroz appeared to blame the station - and as ms sayles was the only person answering the phones at the radio station at the time , she believes this is why he became fixated on her
ms sayles was a witness in this trial , but she said he blamed his jail sentence entirely on her
' feroz was found to be mentally unfit to plead a charge of stalking involving fear of violence in november last year - but a jury found he had committed the acts alleged
feroz appeared at bradford crown court ( pictured ) last month , where a judge ruled he be detained indefinitely in lynfield mount psychiatric hospital ms sayles added : ' i would urge anyone who is suffering with harassment of any sort to seek help
' ms sayles said she was supported by the suzy lamplugh trust , which helped her through ' the most difficult times '
