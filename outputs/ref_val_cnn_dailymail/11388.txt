one of the first victims to receive an nhs payout after being sexually assaulted by savile has spoken out against the â derisory and insulting â amount he received
steve ashton , 50 , was awarded just Â£ 3,125 after a two - year legal battle
mr steve ashton , who was repeatedly abused by the late dj from the age of ten , told the mail on sunday : â i would have got more for whiplash
' it makes you wonder how many more of savile âs victims have been fobbed off with such a derisory amount
â victim : steve ashton ( left ) who was abused by savile when he was 10 , was awarded Â£ 3,125 after a two - year legal battle mr steve ashton said his case was not about the money , but he felt the figure was a snub to all victims
he added : â you hear of celebrities receiving Â£ 50,000 after having their phones hacked , but how does that compare with being sexually molested as a ten - year - old boy again and again ? â i âve been going through this for 40 years and i still feel savile laughing at me
the compensation scheme , set up jointly by savile âs estate , the bbc , the nhs , children âs charity barnardos and lawyers acting for the victims , was finally approved by the court of appeal three months ago
savile befriended mr steve ashton at stoke mandeville , where the victim âs mother pamela worked as a spinal injuries researcher
the abuse happened in the porter âs lodge and in savile âs private room at the hospital
