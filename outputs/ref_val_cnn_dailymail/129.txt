ramage , 35 , had nine organs removed in an operation dubbed the ' mother of all surgeries ' after doctors discovered she was suffering a rare form of cancer over the course of a gruelling nine - hour operation , surgeons meticulously removed 10 organs from ramage 's cancer - ravaged body
one by one they worked to rid the then 32 - year - old 's abdomen of a rare and aggressive cancer invading her stomach cavity
her right colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and umbilicus or belly button were removed in their entirety
parts of her liver and diaphragm followed
the drastic operation , dubbed the ' mother of all surgeries ' , left ms ramage with a 14 - inch scar running down the centre of her body - her ' survival trophy '
she repeatedly consulted doctors complaining of painful stomach cramps
and she was repeatedly dismissed , the finger pointed at period pains , bloating , appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome
but the true diagnosis was a grave one - a rare and aggressive cancer was invading ms ramage 's body
a doctor finally noticed a tumour on her appendix , which had burst , and covered her internal organs with jelly - like cancerous cells
experts diagnosed the rare disease pmp ( pmp ) - the same disease which claimed the life of hollywood icon audrey hepburn
ms ramage , now 35 , and from bristol , said : ' the scar does n't really bother me - i see it as a survival trophy
' ms ramage 's ordeal began in the spring of 2011 when her periods became very irregular
surgeons removed her colon , spleen , gall bladder , ovaries , fallopian tubes , appendix and umbilicus or belly button as well as part of her liver , kidney and diaphragm she spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics , after making a full recovery she went to see a doctor several times but was given a range of different diagnosis - including trapped wind and bad digestion
she said : ' then doctors thought my pains were caused by ovarian cysts , so i had scans which showed i did have cysts on my ovaries
hollywood icon audrey hepburn died from the rare disease in switzerland in january 1993 ' but after that , i did n't hear anything , so i thought it had just been the ovarian cysts , which were removed
' ms ramage went under the knife at basingstoke hospital , one of only two hospitals in the country that specialise in treating pmp
' they discovered when they opened me up that the extent of my disease was much greater than the ct scan had suggested - the tumour was scattered everywhere , from my diaphragm , right down to my bladder , ' she said
but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed ' they removed all the visible tumour along with the worst - affected organs including my spleen , half my large bowel , my appendix , gall bladder , ovaries and fallopian tubes , the peritoneum , a bit of my liver and they stripped the surface of my diaphragm
the disease spreads cancerous cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity - the peritoneum
the cancerous cells produce mucus , which collects in the abdomen as a jelly - like fluid called mucin
that fluid invades the abdominal cavity , causing tumours to spread
the most common symptoms are : source : pmp research foundation and from the critical and affected organs , the liver , kidney and diaphragm , doctors only removed what was absolutely necessary
following the surgery , ms ramage underwent another radical procedure , a chemotherapy bath
bathing the inside of the stomach with the heated chemotherapy increases the chances of the cancer cells being killed
but she faces the prospect of not being able to have children , after her fallopian tubes were removed
determined to help others afflicted by the rare disease , ms ramage has now turned her focus to raising awareness of the condition
she warned the bloating of the abdomen that is one of the symptoms caused as the tumour spreads can be mistaken for ' middle - aged spread '
' ms ramage is releasing a music video which she has filmed with other pmp survivors and supporters of the condition
