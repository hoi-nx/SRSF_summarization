breastfeeding has been shown to have many health benefits , for mother and baby - and cassandra fellingham is pleased and proud she was able to breastfeed all three of her children
yet two years ago , breastfeeding her third baby left cassandra fellingham , 34 , suffering from a condition that nearly killed her
she 'd developed mastitis , which affects one in ten breastfeeding women and occurs when a milk duct , which transports milk to the nipple , becomes blocked
milk builds up in the breast , leading to painful inflammation
cassandra fellingham got mastitis so bad when she breastfed her third child ( r ) she nearly died
pictured with sons miles , five , and jensen , two there are 15 to 20 milk ducts in each breast - these can become blocked for a number of reasons , such as the baby not latching on properly and draining the breast effectively , or feeding irregularly
often , the condition clears up on its own - if the mother continues breastfeeding , this helps to drain the breast , clear the blockage and the problem resolves
however , for some women the stagnant milk becomes infected , causing flu - like symptoms such as aches and shivers
cassandra fellingham knows these symptoms well - she had mastitis with her first child , shikiera , now 15 , and her second , miles , now five
' both times i 'd got pain , then a hardening of the breast , followed by aches and feeling rotten , ' says cassandra fellingham , a self - employed pa who lives with her partner and children in littlehampton , west sussex
' the bacteria that had caused the mastitis had spread to her bloodstream so when cassandra fellingham had her third child , jensen , now two , and started feeling unwell , she knew what was wrong
' when jensen was eight weeks old , i got the familiar pain in my left breast - then i started to ache and feel as if i was coming down with flu
' she called her gp and , because of her history , the doctor gave cassandra fellingham antibiotics straight away
it was also like the worst flu ever - i was hot , then cold , then dizzy and the aches felt like i 'd been kicked
despite her condition , cassandra fellingham was keen to continue breastfeeding
however , three days after the mastitis began , with wayne out , cassandra fellingham 's condition worsened dramatically
in one moment of lucidity , cassandra fellingham grabbed the phone and called her doctor , who told her to get to a&e
cassandra fellingham managed to climb into a taxi
cassandra fellingham was raced down to a high - dependency ward and attached to wires to monitor her heart , with a drip inserted for fluids
blood tests confirmed cassandra fellingham had sepsis - blood poisoning
for two days , cassandra fellingham battled for her life after being diagnosed with sepsis - blood poisoning less than 1 per cent of cases of mastitis lead to sepsis , says dr daniels , a critical care consultant and chief executive of the uk sepsis trust
when sepsis occurs , the body 's immune system sets off a series of reactions , including inflammation , swelling and blood clotting , which can mean the blood supply to vital organs is cut off
for two days , cassandra fellingham battled for her life , with distressed family and friends taking turns to sit with her and care for the baby
' after five days in hospital , cassandra fellingham was allowed home with oral antibiotics
' it 's not clear why some women get mastitis and others do n't , but women who have had it are prone to getting it again - possibly because of the way the mother is feeding
cassandra fellingham wants to raise awareness among breastfeeding women of the dangers of mastitis to prevent the problem , mothers should ensure the baby is latched on properly and finishes the feed on each side ; mothers should also wear a comfortable bra , and get plenty of rest - lowered immunity can raise the risk
' if flu - like symptoms develop , this can suggest an infection has developed and antibiotics are needed
however , women can continue to breastfeed , or express milk if it is too painful , she says
