liverpool goalkeeper mignolet is too modest to claim the club âs recent revival is partly due to his own impressive personal comeback after he had been dropped earlier in the season by manager rodgers
nevertheless , the facts show that the resurgent reds go into saturday 's potential top - four decider against manchester united at anfield having been beaten only once in 19 domestic games â a capital one cup semi-final second leg against chelsea â since mignolet returned to the side on boxing day

â having been heavily criticised for key mistakes earlier in the season and dubbed â dracula â by former liverpool goalkeeper bruce grobbelaar for being indecisive with crosses , mignolet is not taking recent good publicity for granted , even though he was liverpool âs man - of - the - match at swansea following crucial saves from gylfi sigurdsson and bafetimbi gomis

instead , sterling was used as a centre - forward until daniel sturridge âs recent return from injury as rodgers returned to last season âs quick - passing style
