snuggled up together and almost holding hands in their sleep , this is the heart - warming moment twin baby girls were reunited after spending their first six weeks apart as they battled for life
darcey and eden , who were born six weeks premature and with holes in their hearts , were immediately placed in separate incubators
katy mold , 31 , gave birth to twin girls darcey and eden ( pictured ) after going into labour at the 34 - week stage of her pregnancy and both girls were born with holes in their hearts - known as congenital heart defects parents katy ( pictured left with the twin girls ) and david mold ( right ) , from sway , hampshire , have been in and out of southampton general hospital after both girls fell unwell after the birth and needed urgent care their mother katy , 31 , said yesterday : ' they 're both little fighters
' the twins were born just one minute apart in an emergency caesarean on november 25 , after mrs katy mold 's waters broke 34 weeks into pregnancy when she choked on a crisp
mrs katy mold , who was wheeled in her hospital bed to visit the pair in intensive care nine hours after their birth , said : ' just seeing them so small and so helpless , it was very hard
the girls weighed just 4lbs and 13oz when they were born ( pictured ) and while darcey was allowed home straight away , eden was kept in hospital as well as being born with large holes in her heart , baby eden ( pictured in hospital ) also had a condition which meant she had a narrowing of the aorta and had no septum between the two ventricles of the heart ' sitting around watching them in a box was the hardest thing
when eden was eight days old , she had to have a six - hour operation to repair narrowing of her aorta , the large blood vessel in the heart , and to have her pulmonary artery ' banded ' to reduce blood flow to her lungs
the operation was a success but days later darcey , who had been allowed to go home because her heart condition was not life - threatening , turned blue and was rushed back to southampton general hospital where her sister was recovering
while baby darcey ( pictured ) was originally allowed home after birth , she was taken into intensive care just weeks later after being struck down with a severe case of bronchiolitis - a lower respiratory tract infection both eden ( left ) and darcey ( right ) spent six weeks apart while both were cared for on different wards at southampton general hospital
they were later separated for six weeks while eden received heart surgery and darcey was cared for in intensive care for a chest infection diagnosed with bronchiolitis , a respiratory infection , darcey spent 12 days sedated and ventilated and had to be given a blood transfusion
eden was finally well enough to go home on new year 's eve and darcey on january 2
they joined their sisters , matilda , six , and jemima , nine , at the family home in sway , hampshire
now nearly four months old , the twins are both making a good recovery , although eden faces further heart surgery this year , when surgeons will patch up the holes in her heart
a hole in the septum between the heart 's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect ( asd )
a hole in the septum between the heart 's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect ( vsd )
