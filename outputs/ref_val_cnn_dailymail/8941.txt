deila accused mcgowan of endangering the career of henderson with a wild lunge in the dying moments of celtic 's scottish cup victory over dundee united
the norwegian 's side strolled into a semi-final meeting with inverness by putting four goals past the tannadice men , yet the third of four successive meetings between the sides was again pockmarked by ill - discipline
anthony stokes was sent off by referee calum murray for a swipe at paul paton before mcgowan was also dismissed for scything down celtic sub henderson â prompting the sixth red card in three back - to - back meetings
mcgowan is sent off by referee calum murray after he scythed down celtic sub henderson and a clearly angered deila believes the young celt was fortunate to escape serious injury
celtic boss deila claimed mcgowan could have injured henderson for life with his late challenge ' these have been important games for both teams and sometimes it can get a bit tense
' deila , who wanted to look at the anthony stokes incident before commenting further , isn ' t concerned the ill - feeling will spill over in the fourth encounter between the sides on saturday
' i spoke to anthony stokes , ' he added
' his mouth was bleeding after a challenge from paul paton and he reacted
' celtic eased through at the second attempt thanks to goals from jason denayer , griffiths , kris commons and virgil van dijk
' that 's six red cards in three games now and if i was a betting man then i would be putting money on another sending off this saturday , ' he said
anthony stokes ( second left ) comes together with mcgowan during an ill - tempered second - half ' it is just one of those things and the dundee united players are getting a bit frustrated and we move on to saturday and hopefully we can pick up another three points
i just think dundee united are sick of the sight of celtic
' dundee united assistant manager donnelly believes refereeing decisions have gone against his side in the three games
' the celtic reaction on the back of their player being sent off maybe influences the referee ( when mcgowan is sent off ) but i 'll need to look at it again , ' donnelly said
deila celebrates at full - time as his side reached the scottish cup semi-finals with a 4 - 0 victory ' i thought it was another yellow card when we were having a reasonable period in the game
' meanwhile , celtic skipper brown says he 's moved on from being photographed seemingly drunk in an edinburgh street four days before the league cup
' i 'm sure the club , the manager and the fans know that my total focus will always be on the matches coming up and nothing else but winning for celtic
