a dramatic surge by the snp looks set to claim gordon brown 's scotland seat and rob ed miliband of a commons majority , according to a new poll last night
the study of marginal constituencies suggests labour and the conservatives are heading for electoral deadlock in may , with neither party able to govern alone
the poll , commissioned by former tories treasurer lord ashcroft , suggests the snp is on course for a landslide at the general election , winning as many as 56 of scotland 's 59 seats - up from just six at present
the poll , commissioned by former tories treasurer lord ashcroft , suggests the snp is on course for a landslide at the general election , winning as many as 56 of scotland 's 59 seats - up from just six at present
lord lord ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the snp in the wake of last year 's independence referendum had thrown a ' giant spanner in labour 's works ' , although the party is forecast to win tories seats south of the border
of the eight scotland seats polled , the snp would gain six - including four from labour - and tie with mr mundell , in dumfriesshire , clydesdale and tweeddale
' but as things stand , labour losses in scotland could offset their gains from the tories , leading to something close to a dead heat
' this , then , is the battle : can the conservatives fight back against labour faster than labour can fight back against the snp ? ' labour 's leader in scotland murphy ( right ) is facing an uphill battle to hang on to labour 's 40 seats north of the border the snp surge is on course to claim seats held by a string of household names , including those of departing gordon brown and alistair darling the poll throws up the prospect of a weak ed miliband government propped up by nicola sturgeon 's snp - she has ruled out supporting a tories government
and the snp has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from labour , including billions more in spending and borrowing , home rule for scotland and the scrapping of uk 's trident nuclear deterrent
tories peer lord ashcroft has carried out a series of polls in marginal scotland constituencies the new polling suggests that the snp will make deep inroads into labour 's scotland heartlands , and all but eradicate the lib dems
new scotland labour leader murphy is forecast to cling on in east renfrewshire , despite a 20.5 per cent swing to the snp
' snp election chief angus robertson described the findings as ' very encouraging ' and showed the party was picking up seats across scotland , including in areas that rejected independence , such as the borders , where mr mundell is facing a knife - edge battle to cling on
