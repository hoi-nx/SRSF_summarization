another 12 horses from his slaughterhouse in todmorden in yorkshire were sold without any records ever being kept
boddy ( left ) and david moss ( right ) have become the first people sentenced over the 2013 horsemeat scandal
the pair worked together at an abattoir in yorkshire where records of more than 50 carcasses were lost boddy and his slaughterhouse manager david moss were involved in the 2013 scandal which saw hundreds of people mistakenly sold the meat
the court heard how boddy did not produce adequate paperwork for 55 horse carcasses he had sold and accepted 17 animals into his abattoir without the appropriate documents
when questioned , he told officials that 37 had been sold to two italian restaurants in manchester and leeds
the court heard how in 2013 , food standards agency requested paperwork for carcasses that passed through the slaughterhouse in 2012
southwark crown court heard how the 65 - year - old claimed almost 40 of the carcasses were sold to italian restaurants but this was never verified while investigators could not tell exactly when and where the animals had been slaughtered , mr payter said there would have been no cause for dishonesty if they had worked to the rules
boddy was fined Â£ 8,000 for breaching eu rules on the traceability of food
however , boddy could not back up claims he had sent 40 horse carcasses to italian restaurants
after admitting one charge of failing to abide by this traceability law , the maximum sentence boddy could have faced was a two - year sentence and an unlimited fine
there was no proof to suggest either boddy or david moss tried to pass off horsemeat as anything else which was the basis for public outcry in 2013
david moss told investigators much of the slaughterhouse in todmorden in yorkshire was done ' cash in hand ' â accordingly i must sentence each of you not on the basis you were complicit in putting horse meat into the human food chain
the scandal escalated in february when it was revealed that frozen - food firm findus had produced beef lasagne which was almost entirely made up of horse meat
