campbell , who has anger management issues , injured the infant by his rough handling of it , a court heard a man who broke a baby 's arm and leg through ' reckless cruelty ' has been spared jail
doctors said the infant 's broken leg may have been caused by campbell ' yanking ' it out of its cot , while its broken arm appeared to be the result of a ' forceful rapid rotation injury '
at court , the 20 - year - old pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of ' reckless rough handling '
' court court heard how the baby was taken to hospital because it 's right arm was not moving freely and x-rays discovered fractures to the arm and leg
campbell from south shields , who admitted child cruelty , was given an eight - month prison sentence , suspended for 18 months , with supervision and 150 hours of unpaid work
but the 20 - year - old denied yanking the baby 's leg at newcastle crown court ( pictured ) and pleaded guilty to child cruelty on the basis of ' reckless rough handling ' ' i do n't consider you are a dangerous offender and sending you to immediate custody is going to achieve very little in this case
