police are seeking an attempted murder charge against the crazed activist they say slashed the u.s. ambassador to south korea while screaming demands for north korea reunification
the attack thursday on lippert , which prompted rival north korea to gloat about ' knife slashes of justice , ' left deep gashes and damaged tendons and nerves
doctors will remove the 80 stiches on lippert 's face on monday or tuesday and expect him to be out of the hospital by tuesday or wednesday
police , meanwhile , searched the offices of the suspect , kim for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved dumbfounded : kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on lippert on thursday morning , which left the ambassador covered in blood in custody : the 55 - year - old kim reportedly yelled ' north korea and south korea should be unified ' before he attacked ambassador lippert at the breakfast meeting
seen above being taken into custody on thursday journalists question kim , who was brought out in a wheelchair , as he left the police station for a court in seoul earlier today they want to charge kim with attempted murder , violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction , and have requested a formal detention warrant
but the 55 - year - old has denied that he intended to kill lippert
as part of their investigation they have also requested kim 's past travels to north korea â seven times between 1999 and 2007 â during a previous era of inter-korean cooperation , when seoul was ruled by a liberal government
kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former north korea leader kim jong il after his death in december 2011 , police said

he told police it was meant as a protest of annual u.s. - south korea military drills that started monday â exercises that the north and south korea has long maintained are preparations for an invasion
washington , which backed the south korea during the 1950 - 53 korean war against the communist north and south korea , still stations 28,500 troops here , and anti- u.s. activists see the annual military drills with seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified south korea
' south korea and north korea should be reunified , ' kim shouted as he slashed lippert with a 10 - inch knife , police and witnesses said

police did n't consider the possibility that kim , who has ties to the korean council for reconciliation and cooperation , which hosted the breakfast meeting where lippert was attacked , would show up for the event , according to a seoul police official who did n't want to be named , citing office rules

kim , who was protesting japanese 's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by south korea , hit the ambassador 's secretary instead , media reports said , and was sentenced to a three - year suspended prison term over the attack
photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the u.s. embassy in seoul to protest the u.s. - south korea military drills , which are to run until the end of april
north korea 's state - controlled media crowed thursday that kim 's ' knife slashes of justice ' were ' a deserved punishment on war maniac u.s. ' and reflected the south korea people 's protests against the u.s. for driving the korean peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills
