the crossbreed was saved from thailand 's illegal dog meat trade a couple of years ago and adopted by amanda leask from strathglass , scotland , and her six year old son kyle
luckily for miracle , the truck carrying him to his death was intercepted by agents working for the phuket - based animal welfare charity soi dog foundation
miracle ( seen here hanging over the crowded pet cages ) was destined for dog meat restaurants in vietnam when he was saved by the animal welfare charity soi dog foundation devastated by his plight and the hopelessness of his situation , she enquired about adopting him
and while miracle quickly got to work returning the favour to his new owner by creating a powerful bond with her son kyle that transformed the young boy 's life
kyle and miracle have since developed a close bond , which amanda leask says reveals an unspoken mutual understanding
amanda leask ( pictured here with miracle and kyle ) says there is an ' unspoken language ' between the hound and her disabled son she said : ' they âve both faced so much hardship in their lives , it âs like there âs an unspoken language between them
' amanda leask adopted miracle after seeing his photograph on a soi dog facebook post - he has now made a full recovery she continued : ' kids can build up confidence in dogs where they seek solace , and miracle gets this in abundance from kyle
' the unique bond between man and dog is still yet to be explained fully but amanda leask says the amount it has helped kyle is unlimited
