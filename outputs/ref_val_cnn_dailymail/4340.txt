ms taylor has now waived her anonymity to tell how the abuse affected her life and of her relief at seeing wotton convicted and sent to jail
taylor was one of a number of pupils targeted by a paedophile teacher in the 1960s and 70s
she has waived her anonymity to tell of the impact the abuse had on her life and of her relief at seeing him jailed during her school days , wotton would catch taylor 's eye during lessons , call her up to the front of the class and make her stand behind his desk while he sexually abused her
wotton , now 73 , was finally reported over thirty years later in 2013 when ms taylor read about allegations of child abuse committed by jimmy savile and rang police
her complaint was the first and started off a huge police investigation which led to 20 other victims coming forward
wotton , who now uses a wheelchair , admitted 17 counts of indecent assault , three counts of indecency with a male and one of indecency with a child over a 12 - year period from the late 1960s and was jailed for five years
wotton 's victim described him as an ' evil bully ' who wrecked the childhoods of his pupils taylor , of newcastle , tyne and wear , said : ' i was terrified of wotton , he was an evil bully and he ruined my childhood as well as many other people 's lives
ms taylor , pictured aged nine in 1973 , says the abuse she suffered at the hands of her teacher has impacted her whole life ' i feel as though he has made me the adult i am today , i 've found it hard to trust men and be the best mother i can be because of him
' as a child , ms taylor was shy and grew to hate school because of wotton 's abuse
ms taylor , who is now training to become a chiropodist , said : ' i was sitting watching the news about jimmy savile and stuart hall and i thought - i can not die with this sordid secret
