bt is to launch its own mobile phone service along with free access to premier league football on the go starting at Â£ 5 a month
this so - called â quad play â service is seen as key by the likes of bt and its rivals sky , virgin and talktalk to future growth and profits
the company âs move comes ahead of its purchase of the britain âs largest mobile phone network ee in a deal worth Â£ 12.5billion
it has unveiled three sim card deals , where customers buy a sim and simply fit it to their existing handset in order to get access to calls , texts and 4g internet services , including video streaming
the cheapest sim card deal offers 500 mb of 4g data , unlimited texts and 200 minutes of calls for Â£ 5 a month if you are an existing bt broadband customer and Â£ 10 a month for everyone else
the monthly charge for 2gb of data on 4g , unlimited texts and 500 minutes of calls is Â£ 12 for bt customers and Â£ 17 for others
at the top end , customers can take an enormous 4g data allowance of 20gb , with unlimited texts and minutes , for either Â£ 20 a month for bt customers or Â£ 25 for other customers
the cheapest deal will be for existing customers , at just Â£ 5 per month for 500 mb of 4g data , unlimited texts and 200 minutes of calls bt is sweetening the offer by giving away free bt sport on the bt sport app , which offers live premier league football matches
â starting at just Â£ 5 per month , the pricing is very competitive for existing bt customers and confirms bt âs ambitious plans to dominate quad - play before anyone else can get a foothold
â talktalk and virgin media have both had their own mobile offering for a while now , yet people have so far remained hesitant to sign up on a quad - play basis
â john petter , chief executive of bt consumer , said : â offering bt customers the britain âs best value 4g data deal is a great way to start our journey towards re-establishing ourselves as a major player in consumer mobile
