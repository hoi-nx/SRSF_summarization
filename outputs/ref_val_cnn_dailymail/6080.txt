the england are set to conduct a ' major review ' into the reasons behind the national team 's early world cup exit , although managing director downton does not expect any changes in the short term
coach moores ' position has most significantly come under fire after a campaign in which england were rarely competitive , losing four of their five games , to crash out of the tournament with friday 's final group game against afghanistan still to play
downton has the power in his hands to end moores ' second spell in charge but in the wake of monday 's 15 - run defeat to bangladesh he has so far sought to back the man he described as ' the outstanding coach of his generation ' when he appointed him last april
moores ' place as england coach is safe in the short - term , says england managing director downton morgan 's position as captain is in question after england 's early exit from the world cup it is high praise that downton still believes moores is worthy despite an unconvincing record , albeit with a remodelled team , soured further by events over the past month
' as far as his ability is concerned i still feel he is a very high - quality coach , so , no nothing has changed since we appointed him 11 months ago , ' downton said
downton says no decisions on the future of players or staff , including moores , would be made immediately but a review will take place ' you do n't become a bad coach overnight but the scale of the issues we have got to deal with are significant as everybody has seen
' england fly out to the caribbean for a test series early next month and while it appears any fall - out from the england review is unlikely to strike before then , downton did baulk at the opportunity to guarantee that moores would remain in charge
downton will be answerable to both although he has not felt the need to ask for any assurances after revealing they had met for discussions as recently as monday while england 's tournament - ending defeat was ongoing in adelaide

' england fans had been warned to expect tough times ahead after last winter 's ashes whitewash and moores was tasked with an unenviable task of rebuilding a side that had lost the considerable experience of jonathan trott , graeme swann and kevin pietersen following his well - publicised falling out with the england
they bounced back strongly to beat india after falling behind in that series , but since then england have struggled in the one - day arena , losing 18 of 27 games under moores , and the gulf in class between them and the best nations was powerfully illustrated during the world cup
england vice-captain looks dejected after top - scoring with 65 in their loss to bangladesh on monday moores endures the post-match press conference after his side fell 15 runs short of their target ' all i will tell you is that there are no quick fixes in this situation
' while one - day cricket will take a back seat over the next 12 months , when england will embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 tests , the england will use the review to look into ways to ensure the national team can be competitive when the world cup comes to these shores in 2019
