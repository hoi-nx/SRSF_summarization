matic has endured a difficult fortnight
he is , of course , pleased that chelsea won their first trophy in his time at the club , though his joy is tempered by missing the capital one cup final through suspension
and though he is now back from that two - match ban , he was part of the chelsea team which went out against 10 - man paris saint-germain in the champions league last 16 on wednesday
he earned his two - match ban for pushing over ashley barnes in fury after the burnley player executed an excessive shin - high challenge on him
matic received a red card and did nât even get the free - kick , ashley barnes went unpunished
ashley barnes commits a foul on nemanja matic but referee martin atkinson fails to blow for the foul matic was handed a two - match suspension for pushing burnley 's barnes at stamford bridge the 28 - year - old has missed chelsea 's last two games against tottenham hotspur and west ham due to suspension but matic maintains a degree of perspective
my reaction was not good but this reaction was because i thought i broke a leg
but these things happen in football
â matic has been a revelation since returning to chelsea from portuguese side benfica last january matic will not discuss the fact that referee martin atkinson did not award a foul , let alone punish ashley barnes for the tackle
â asked whether ashley barnes had apologised , he said : â no. â before the visit of southampton on sunday , matic reflected on his ban and keeping focused

â matic is a candidate for player of the year , so impressive have his performances been since he came back to chelsea last january in a Â£ 22million deal , having initially been allowed to leave and join benfica in 2011
chelsea re-signed nemanja matic last january for Â£ 22million having previously been sold by the club in 2011 matic admitted it was hard to miss the capital one cup final win against tottenham hotspur matic does not attempt to gild the failure against paris saint-germain , and is aware of what is now required
if we win the league we will have that and the capital one cup and it will be a good season
