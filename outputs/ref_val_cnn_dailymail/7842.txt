shadow cabinet ministers suspect chancellor george osbrone ( pictured ) will seek to make a â game - changing â tax announcement later this month that could be funded by scaling back tax relief to pensioners the party said it would cut the amount people can pay into a pension and get tax relief on over their lifetime from Â£ 1.25million to Â£ 1million , and reduce the amount that can be paid in to a pension with tax relief each year from Â£ 40,000 to Â£ 30,000
mr osborne has already reduced the lifetime allowance , which used to be Â£ 1.5million , arguing that it unfairly benefited the most wealthy
workers currently pay national insurance on earnings above Â£ 153 a week , or Â£ 7,956 a year , at a rate of 12 per cent , but it kicks in at a far lower level than the income tax threshold , which will increase to Â£ 10,600 in april
mr osborne said the verdict from the respected institute for fiscal studies had â put to bed â several labour myths , saying incomes had been restored to pre-crisis levels , the wealthiest have paid the most towards deficit reduction and inequality in society has been reduced
