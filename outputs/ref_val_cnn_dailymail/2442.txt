there was nothing more mind - numbingly maddening in the aftermath of england âs worst world cup exit yet than the immediate reaction of moores
well , england should rip up their data along with their whole philosophy towards one - day cricket and start again
moores faces an uncertain future following england 's humiliating exit from the 2015 cricket world cup england were beaten by 15 runs at the adelaide oval to make it four defeats against test cricket - playing nations england captain morgan looks dejected as he leaves the field after their world cup match morgan 's fifth odi duck in 12 innings summed up their poor performance at the world cup 90 - the amount of runs captain morgan scored in five innings at the world cup 12.2 - the overs it took for new zealand to beat england 's total of 123 in their second group game
111 - australia 's margin of victory in the opening game of the tournament 654 - total of runs scored by australia and sri lanka against england 1 - number of centuries scored by an england batsman against test cricket playing nations 72 - number of runs scored by sri lanka off the bowling of chris woakes 0 - number of wins registered by england over test cricket playing nations in the tournament 0 - the number of centuries scored by a bangladesh batsman in a world cup before playing england on monday
you do not need analysis to know that they have stunk this tournament out and , after this 15 - run defeat by bangladesh , are once again the laughing stock of the cricket world
the only statistic moores needs to know is that england , having been thrashed by australia , new zealand and sri lanka , were humbled by a bangladesh side who beat them here at their own very english game
the key data is that england , having defeated just scotland so far , have excelled themselves in being even worse at this world cup than the five previous stinkers since they came so close to winning the 1992 tournament in australia
and this humiliation has come after the ashes were moved and a winter of one - day cricket provided to try to make sure england had every chance of finally competing for a first global 50 - over trophy that looks further away than ever
in truth , arranging a one - day series against sri lanka before christmas was akin to putting a sticking plaster on a gaping wound because england are light years away from the dynamic , vibrant teams we have seen here

but , well done bangladesh ! you deserved it ! ' do not say we have n't prioritised odi cricket ! we played a back - to - back ashes to make sure england played six months of odis before this world cup ! ' gary lineker , the former england striker , said : ' bangladesh win ! congratulations to them
' i would n't trust paul downton and moores to run a * * * * ing bath , let alone the england cricket team
england are about to embark on a gruelling schedule of 17 tests in 10 months and the danger is that one - day cricket will again be shoved to the bottom of england âs list of priorities unless a clear strategy is undertaken
joe root ( centre ) exchanges words with bangladesh captain mashrafe mortaza ( left ) at the adelaide oval bangladesh sealed a surprise win over england at the world cup as moores and his men suffered elimination gillespie has already turned down a role with his native australia under darren lehmann and has been given permission by yorkshire to coach a team , probably adelaide , in next year âs big bash while staying at headingley
morgan refused to say that he wanted to carry on as one - day captain yesterday and reiterated his intention to miss england âs one - day international against ireland in may , their first of another â new â era , to play in the ipl
the sheer volume of cricket means that the best way for england to catch up in 50 - over cricket is to build a new young team of one - day players as different as possible to that which will contest test cricket in the next year against west indies , new zealand , australia , pakistan and south africa
morgan looks to have been given the backing by moores to continue as england 's one - day captain alastair cook ( left ) was devastated to be axed from 50 - over cricket on the brink of his first world cup ian bell , who left england far too much to do against bangladesh by getting out after scoring 62 off 83 balls , will surely bow out of one - day cricket after friday âs dead rubber against afghanistan while it is in the best interests of jimmy anderson and stuart broad for them to do the same
joe root was strongly considered for the one - day captaincy by england when they sacked alastair cook before they plumped for the out - of - form morgan and i would give him the one - day job now and build a new team around him
it is certainly possible to envisage a squad led by joe root and including jos buttler , who came so close to recuing england yesterday , alex hales , moeen ali , james taylor , ben stokes , jason roy , james vince , sam billings and adil rashid growing into an outfit capable of competing in the modern one - day world
