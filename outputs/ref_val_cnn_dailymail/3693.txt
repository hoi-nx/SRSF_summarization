russian president putin has described a secret meeting with officials last year when russian decided it would take crimea â the black sea that moscow annexed from ukraine last march
in a trailer for an upcoming documentary , shown on state - owned television late sunday , putin said that he met with security officials in february to make plans for saving ukraine 's then - president viktor yanukovych , who fled power after months of pro-european protests in the ukraine capital
the kremlin originally denied that it had sent troops into crimea , though putin later announced on state television that russian troops had been sent in
viktor yanukovych was safely on russian soil by late february , when russian 's military was establishing its presence in crimea
putin said that he met with security officials in february to make plans for saving ukraine 's then - president viktor yanukovych , pictured the virtually bloodless seizure of crimea - a black sea peninsula with an ethnic russian majority and where moscow has a naval base - was followed by a pro-moscow insurgency in the east of ukraine
western governments have condemned russian 's intervention in crimea as illegal about 6,000 people have been killed in the fighting in eastern ukraine
a fragile ceasefire , greed last month in minsk , has largely held so far russian soldiers who took part have been given state medals with the citation ' for returning crimea ' , which give the starting date of the operation as february 20 , before viktor yanukovych was ousted
