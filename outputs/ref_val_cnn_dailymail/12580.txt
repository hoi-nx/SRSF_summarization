the group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather
so far this year it 's been extremely quiet
by this time in mid-march the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide
at a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably , there has not been a single report this month of a tornado
in fact if we make it through the entire month of march without any tornado reports it would be a first , according to the center
meteorologists do n't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes , but one possible answer is the development of el nino , a warming in the equatorial pacific , which can influence weather patterns globally
recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the united states during these events
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently said that a weak el nino had developed
so while all agree this is good news so far this year , it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet
in 1984 , for instance , there was a very similar slow start through mid-march and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of june , according to data from the storm center
