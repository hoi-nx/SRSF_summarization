downing street cynically tried to prevent the release of damaging files exposing the scale of the cover - up over paedophile mp cyril smith
the cabinet office repeatedly blocked the mail on sunday âs attempts to see the bombshell documents â and caved in only after being threatened with high court action
after the shocking year - long fight , we can reveal the content of the papers , which expose just how much the establishment knew about the late politician âs sexual and physical abuse of young boys
following the mail on sunday âs victory , it can be revealed for the first time that : - margaret thatcher was personally told that police had investigated claims that cyril smith indecently assaulted teenage boys in the 1960s
- margaret thatcher was explicitly warned that awarding a knighthood to the 29 - stone liberal party mp risked damaging the â integrity of the honours system â , but went ahead anyway
- a senior whitehall mandarin took the â exceptional â step of contacting the country âs top prosecutor and police to find out why cyril smith was never charged with abusing boys at a hostel he helped run
- civil servants feared the secret cyril smith police file might be made public in 1982 â when a burglary at the fleet street offices of the sun newspaper revealed the editor was in possession of a copy
this revelation will lead to speculation that the break - in was linked to attempts to cover up cyril smith âs crimes
the fact that the cabinet office blocked five attempts by the mail on sunday to see the papers will deepen fears of a cover - up at the highest levels over the activities of vip paedophiles
labour mp simon danczuk , who exposed the scale of cyril smith âs abuse in parliament , said : â nick clegg and david cameron have colluded in covering this up
' nick clegg , who sits in this department , has already written to me refusing to carry out an investigation into who knew what about cyril smith in his party and it âs disappointing to see the cabinet office continuing this unhelpful approach
nick clegg ( left ) and david cameron ( right ) , both ministers in the cabinet office , have been accused of â colluding â in the latest cover - up of evidence that could expose vip paedophile rings the crown prosecution service revealed he had been investigated in 1970 , 1988 and 1999 while greater manchester police admitted there had been â overwhelming evidence â that he abused boys both physically and sexually
a year ago , after a battle with campaigners , the cabinet office was forced to reveal that former liberal party leader david steel had proposed cyril smith for his knighthood
now the mail on sunday has finally been given unprecedented access to the downing street files on the case
on april 28 last year , this newspaper put in a freedom of information request to the cabinet office asking for all no 10 correspondence on cyril smith âs knighthood , which should have been answered within a month
on friday the department finally released a 19 - page dossier on the - secret discussions that led to cyril smith being knighted , although other pages were withheld on grounds of national security
lord shackleton said it would be â slightly unfortunate â if this â episode â stopped cyril smith being knighted , but added : â we felt it right to warn you of our fear that the integrity of the honours system would be at some risk if the award were to be made and announced
the secretary had earlier warned sir robin , then cabinet secretary , that â the press might stir up adverse comment â over cyril smith âs knighthood â if there is fire under this smoke â
the cabinet office is still refusing to release even the titles of four recently discovered historic files on child abuse , a decision called â disgusting â by victims â families
