london in his teenage years , there was little to set emwazi -- a quiet , hardworking boy with a few friends -- apart from his classmates
that 's according to shuter , his former head teacher at quintin kynaston community academy in northwest london
now 26 , emwazi has gained international notoriety after being identified as the isis militant nicknamed " jihadi john " who 's appeared in beheading videos of western hostages
but in his school days , it was a different matter
" he was bullied a little , but because he was quiet and he was reserved ... generally he was fine , " shuter said
" if there had been any concerns about emwazi , they would have been picked up , and we would have intervened and tried to support him in any way that we could have done
" born in kuwait , but brought up in london from the age of 6 , emwazi was one of the school 's many students from an immigrant background
the school 's intake is 70 % muslim , said shuter , with many students coming from large housing estates in what is a multicultural area of london
nonetheless , emwazi was somehow drawn in by radical influences , most likely outside of school or through social media
she still finds it hard to believe that emwazi could be the apparent killer with the london accent recorded on isis videos
" i think it 's horrific , the idea that a young man like that could become somebody that people say is the poster boy for ( isis )
cage , a london - based advocacy group that worked with emwazi , has released audio of a phone conversation from 2009 in which he talks about members of the uk security services questioning him
" we 're going to keep a close eye on you , emwazi , " he alleges they told him
cage has painted a picture of a young man driven to extremism by unwarranted harassment by security services
