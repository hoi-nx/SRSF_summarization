before getting married next week , there are a couple of things murray would like to achieve in his last tournament as a single man
the immediate goal is to pass the milestone of 500 career victories â he is within one win of doing so after beating colombia âs giraldo 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in the third round of the miami open
murray can pass the mark on tuesday if he defuses the huge serving power of giant south african kevin anderson
murray could become the first british tennis player to win 500 career games if he beats kevin anderson should murray survive that encounter , it is possible he could edge ahead of rafael nadal and move back up to no 3 in the world rankings , although that also depends on the performances of others here
murray defeatedsantiago giraldo of columbia in their third round match during the miami open no british player in that time has got there , tim henman pulling stumps on his career within four of the mark
murray said : â it âs nice because when you see the list of players who have won this many matches there are nât loads
murray could leap ahead of rafael nadal in the rankings if he beats kevin anderson in the fourth round â i obviously want to win more and hopefully i still have quite a few years ahead of me to add to that number
â of those murray victories , 24 have come so far at this event , making it his most productive masters level tournament
