the recent controversy over a video showing university of oklahoma students , who also were members of the sigma alpha epsilon fraternity , reciting a racist chant revealed a key difference in approaches to parenting
that convinced me that this story was n't just about racist and juvenile behavior , but also about parenting
in it , parker apologized for actions that he called " wrong and reckless
" however , bob rice had no response to the controversy
his parents , brody and susan , addressed their son 's misbehavior in a statement , which was given to the newspaper and posted on the family 's website
it read in part : " as parents of levi , we love him and care for him deeply
while it may be difficult for those who only know levi from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist
... " of course , we are sad for our son -- but more importantly , we apologize to the community he has hurt
we would also like to apologize to the entire african - american community , university of oklahoma student body and administration
our family has the responsibility to apologize , and also to seek forgiveness and reconciliation
i applaud the pettits for stepping up and refusing to blindly defend their son , as many parents might have done
they did what parents are supposed to do : they took responsibility for the actions of the person they raised
who knew that would be so controversial ? ever since the apologies were offered , there 's been discussions in this country about whether it 's really necessary for parents to apologize for the actions of their grown children
last week , while hosting a radio show in san diego , i brought up the story of the video and pointed to the different approaches that the rices and the pettits have to parenting -- all the way from " we are not doing interviews " to " our family has the responsibility to apologize
a caller disagreed , saying he did n't see why he should have to apologize if his adult son did something wrong
they ca n't wait to wash their hands of any additional responsibility , and they might even frame their retreat as a way of advancing the principle that everyone should take responsibility for his own actions
of course , individuals should take responsibility for their actions
besides , i bet a lot of parents believe -- as i do -- that we should never stop loving our children
