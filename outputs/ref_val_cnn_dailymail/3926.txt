of all the players manchester city might have expected to drive the final nail into their champions league coffin rakitic was a long way down the list , but it was the former sevilla midfielder who got the goal on wednesday night
rakitic superbly lifts the ball over the on - rushing hart to give barcelona the lead against manchester city rakitic loops the ball over hart and past vincent kompany to earn barcelona a 1 - 0 lead at the nou camp when he signed in the summer what was the reaction ? there was no hysteria but it was considered a welcome addition for two reasons â firstly they need midfielders after selling cesc fabregas to chelsea and thiago to bayern munich , and second rakitic was , along with his fellow countryman modric , the best midfielder in la liga last season
the croatia international challenges for the ball with manchester city midfielder james milner rakitic was brought to barcelona from sevilla for Â£ 14million to replace cesc fabregas , who joined chelsea and those characteristics are ? he is versatile in as much as he can play behind the striker and score goals as he did regularly for his former club sevilla and he can play deep in front of the centre - back as he also did , although less so for his former team , and as he did for barcelona last saturday away at eibar
who brought him to spain ? sevilla signed him from schalke for â¬ 2.5m
rakitic ( laying down on left of trophy ) captained sevilla to europa league glory in 2014 rakitic was born in swiss but plays international football for croatia did he consider england ? his wife , raquel mauri , is a hairdresser from sevilla , and so he preferred to stay in spain
when barcelona came calling it was a no - brainer
he was close to going to chelsea as a 16 - year - old but his father advised him to move to schalke instead
and even more so because rakitic was denied the chance to face his international team - mate in the first clasico of the season because he was left out of the starting eleven
rakitic is mobbed by his barcelona team - mates after opening the scoring against manchester city on wednesday midfielder rakitic is joined in celebration by lionel messi , luis suarez and neymar jnr how did that work out for luis enrique ? badly
he is becoming a leader on the pitch and has bought into the ideas of sacrifice and generosity at barcelona having been very much the talisman of the team at sevilla
