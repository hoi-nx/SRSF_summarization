at dolce & gabbana 's milan fashion week show this afternoon , it was n't just the clothes that turned heads on the catwalk
in a tribute to mothers and motherhood , each model carried a baby down the runway , with some expertly holding their precious cargo and others struggling to come to grips with the little ones
the backdrop , a white panel adorned with a red rose and the word ' mamma ' in script , completed the theme of the show , which was fittingly called ' viva la mamma '
while most of the babies were apparently unrelated to the models , pregnant supermodel bianca balti , 30 , showcased her very own baby bump on the runway , looking positively glowing in a powder pink sheath dress and black heels
the backdrop , a white panel adorned with a red rose and the word ' mamma ' in script , completed the theme of the show , which was fittingly called ' viva la mamma ' according to spectators , the youngsters on the runway were comfortable and extremely well - behaved - but some of the pictures from the show tell something of a different story a model is seen holding her precious cargo as she showcases looks from dolce & gabbana 's autumn / winter 2015 collection another shot sees a model carrying her baby so that she faces forward , toward the audience , a position that does not seem to sit well with the blue - eyed little girl
