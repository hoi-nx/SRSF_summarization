david cameron should drop his pledge to reduce net migration to â tens of thousands â ahead of the election , senior tories say
the prime minister had promised to get the figure below 100,000 â â no ifs , no buts â â four years ago
last week , however , the number moving to britain exceeded the number leaving by a record margin of nearly 300,000
ken clarke , who has served as a minister under mr david cameron , said the entire pledge had been a mistake
â i âm afraid that the net migration target has proved to be a mistake
mr david cameron has acknowledged that the reason immigrants want to come to britain is because of the recovering economy and strong prospects of work
former minister ken clarke has said that the entire migration pledge has been a mistake and not possible to achieve without damaging the country 's economy the latest figures , which put net migration at 298,000 for the year ending in last september , would have exceeded 100,000 even without immigration from within europe
â that âs why this government is working to reduce net migration
â when mr david cameron entered downing street in may 2010 net migration was running at 244,000
