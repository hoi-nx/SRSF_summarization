when oakland raiders nfl running back drew retired recently at just 29 years old , he said his life had been focused on football for 24 years and he needed a change
it 's no wonder he wanted out
he has been playing football since he was 5 years old
football is america 's favorite sport
what better sport is there to teach those lessons ? but today , youth football is not looking like the best option
with such lightweight boys competing with children more than twice their size , it 's no wonder parents feel less inclined to put their kids in this sport
but not too long ago , parents thought nothing of sending their children out on the football field to run around and burn up a little energy
many parents still insist youth football is safe
that 's exactly what debra pyka thought when she signed up her son , chernach , for pop warner football in wisconsin , then later in michigan , when he was 11 years old , in 1997
chernach had played sports , including wrestling , pole vaulting and football most of his young life
" debra pyka is convinced those early days playing pop warner football triggered her son 's cte
last month , debra pyka and her son 's estate filed a lawsuit against pop warner football for $ 5 million , claiming the nonprofit failed to protect its youngest players and warn them and their parents about the permanent dangers of head trauma
the lawsuit further alleges that debra pyka 's son and other children were intentionally put in danger because pop warner used amateur coaches with short tenures , who were never properly trained in the game of football , injury prevention , concussion or head injury identification
she wants to stop children younger than 14 from playing tackle football in youth leagues
young children should not be allowed to play tackle football until they reach high school , " said debra pyka
since filing her suit , debra pyka , a registered nurse , said she 's found some solace by connecting with other parents who want to make football safer for children , but she also has received plenty of hateful emails criticizing her for allowing her son to play in the first place
should we all be arrested for letting our kids play football ? " clearly , the lawsuit faces obstacles , especially since chernach did play other sports and it may be hard to prove the cte was triggered by injuries suffered while playing for pop warner
they are going after the economics of youth football leagues
and if they win the lawsuit it may be less possible for those leagues to buy the insurance policies that allow very young children to play tackle football
... while there is incredible sadness in this story , we question the merits of singling out four years of youth football amid a career of sports that lasted through high school
and she 's not out to end football
but " a 5 - year - old playing football , it 's ridiculous to have them out there banging their brains around
she said it 's important that parents listen closely to nflers like 24 - year - old borland , the san francisco 49ers linebacker who retired this week after just one season
... but if i could relay a message to kids and their parents it would be twofold : number one : make an informed decision
