vettel , tears in his eyes , a smile wide on his face , waved the ferrari flag high , his joy unconfined
even hamilton , who was prowling around in disappointment at coming second , could understand why
for , finally , the vice-like grip of his mercedes team had been prised open at a steamy malaysian grand prix

vettel was right when he said he won the race â fair and square â , ferrari having outpaced the previously impregnable mercedes machines over 56 absorbing laps
now a sport that has developed an impressive aptitude for navel - gazing , especially after the procession at melbourne a fortnight earlier when a mercedes one - two was expected to presage a period of total silver arrows dominance , can rest from its self - loathing criticism , at least for a while
he had won in the shiny red car of ferrari , the team he grew up worshipping
but it houses the spiritual legacy of ferrari and all that is poetic about the world âs most famous car
â you would have needed a heart as hard as flint not to be swept along as he screamed over the team radio : â thank you , thank you
â this was the 40th win of vettel âs career , but his first for the scuderia in only his second race for the team since leaving red bull

nine victories in succession in 2013 was vettel âs most one - sided stretch
hamilton was involved in tetchy radio exchanges with his engineers
nico rosberg , who is out of form , was third , a place ahead of ferrari âs kimi raikkonen , who fought from 11th on the grid and an early puncture
hamilton was gracious in defeat and loyal to his team
the fact was that ferrari , who were able to run a two - stop strategy , just had too much pace on the day

the question of long - term importance is whether mercedes can continue on a clear - headed path of success without him
his old job there as technical director has been taken by the highly - rated , cambridge - educated james allison , a tall and slightly awkward - looking british engineer
ferrari 's finnish driver kimi raikkonen makes his way back to the pits with a blown out tyre toro rosso driver max verstappen , the 17 - year - old from the netherlands , on his way to an impressive seventh - place finis â ross has about a billion championships under his belt as a technical director and i have precisely zero , â he said
since then two ferrari team principals have been sacked
the third , maurizio arrivabene , belted out the italian national anthem that greeted vettel âs win
allison , the subject of more interviews than in any other one - hour period of his life , summed up the mood of the day : â it âs good to win in anything but there is something absolutely fantastic about this team
at ferrari , they work especially hard but we also have the history and tradition of the team bearing down on our shoulders
