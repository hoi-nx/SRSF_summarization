the green party is set to unveil its big weapon for the general election campaign â a sultry , pouting , middle - aged â boyband â comprising cameron , miliband , clegg and farage
the party , which is languishing at six per cent in the polls , is recruiting lookalikes to portray the four main party leaders in a cringe - inducing party political broadcast due to be screened next month
strangely , the greens are even hiring an actress to play their own leader , the gaffe - prone natalie bennett , and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates
she must also be â the voice of reason , friendly , warm and approachable but has a message to get across â
the full excruciating details of what the greens believe is â a fun , clever and refreshing idea â is revealed in a leaked casting brief
fake that : our mock - up of ( left to right ) party leaders cameron , clegg , miliband and farage as a boyband it adds that four male party leaders â lookalikes â should be unnaturally intense , emotional and passionate â like a boyband
â they may be leaders of different parties , but they seem to know the same lyrics to the same song and be in perfect harmony
i like the idea that as the song builds and climaxes , they are literally finishing off each others sentences â¦ that is how ridiculously in harmony they are
it will be amusing to have disgruntled reaction shots of the other leaders at the end as the green party âs common sense message is delivered
â on the lookalikes , it adds : â it would be great if the leaders were slightly better looking , more buff and hunkier than the actual leaders in real life
â less kind critics might suggest that the greens need to register as politicians themselves
some of the cringe - inducing lyrics of the green party âs song spoof it âs sweeter when we agree , a party political harmony ( oh baby ) lose your voting inhibitions , join the one true coalition ( ohh - ahh - lii - shuuuuun ) let âs frack this green and pleasant land
come on eddie , join the band the public wo nât know what to do , if they have to pick from me and you - uuuu the choice between us could nât be clearer
oxford ! cambridge ! diversity for ya whether it âs trident or high speed 2 , the lesser of four evils is up to you mos man : how i gatecrashed world 's unfunniest send - up by adam lee-potter it is unusual enough to be in the same room as messrs cameron , miliband , clegg and farage
welcome to the casting session for what must go down as the most toe - curlingly awful party political broadcast ever
i secretly infiltrated the green party audition under the flimsy guise of being an ersatz cameron
i emailed , just hours before the audition , telling them â truthfully â that gok wan once told me i looked like the pm
do n't call us : our reporter adam lee-potter goes to the hideously awkward audition for the green party broadcast did i say they were desperate ? i heard back within minutes â and the woman did nât ask if i was a professional actor or had an agent
but the email warned i should be prepared to â boyband it up â â possibly the four most upsetting words i have ever received
at the offices of die-cast , all 13 of us were told to learn our lines â which seemed a tad rich of the green party when its own leader could nât remember hers in a â car crash â interview with london âs lbc radio station
then five minutes later , it all changed : we were told to forget that and instead mug up on a â it âs sweeter when we all agree â version
this was rapidly becoming more confusing than a green party conference , not least because despite being middle - aged and suited , i do nât look at all like cameron
but then the other three in â my â boyband looked nothing like their supposed doppelgangers either
â give me some smoulder , â the director implored
â i âm 44 years old , for pity âs sake
i did try to smoulder , which is hard enough at the best of times , but painfully embarrassing when you âre told to lip - sync to a tepid backing track
desperate : the greens are even hiring an actress to play their own leader , the gaffe - prone natalie bennett ( pictured ) , and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates the sweet woman in charge duly dispatched him to marks & spencer , telling him to take it back for a refund â after the gig â
truly hideous : reporter adam lee-potter described his efforts as ' david brent at a teenage disco : excruciating and slightly off ' shakespeare it ai nât , but the greens clearly hope this song will ram home their point : when there âs little to divide the main party leaders , vote for us instead
