as news of sturridge âs latest injury setback emerged , those four words will have swirled around rodgers â mind
liverpool âs manager has become accustomed to picking teams that do not contain sturridge â he went from august 31 to january 31 without him , remember â but , as the campaign reaches its defining moment , this is not something he will relish
it was bad enough to lose his captain steven gerrard to a three - match suspension last sunday , and the fa âs decision to give martin skrtel , liverpool âs best defender , the same ban for stamping on david de gea exacerbated the problem
sturridge will be out of action for around a month after picking up a hip injury the new setback is another blow in a season that has been ruined by injury for the liverpool striker sturridge injured his thigh on england duty last september and did n't play for liverpool again in 2014 barclays premier league goals for sturridge since his debut in jan 2013 â from that date until he left for barca last summer , former strike partner luis suarez scored 41 immediately after the international break is over , no team in the barclays premier league has more at stake than liverpool , who have a lunchtime trip to arsenal next saturday followed by an fa cup quarter - final replay at blackburn four days later
steven gerrard and martin skrtel would have had big contributions to make to those fixtures and , without them , there is absolutely no doubt liverpool âs chances of success have been compromised
taking sturridge away has an even greater impact
lose at the emirates stadium and ewood park and the campaign that liverpool have fought hard to resurrect since rodgers changed his system to 3 - 4 - 3 will effectively be over
that is why rodgers needs sturridge fit

martin skrtel was handed the same ban after he stamped on united goalkeeper david de gea the question now , however , concerns how quickly he will be able to recover
