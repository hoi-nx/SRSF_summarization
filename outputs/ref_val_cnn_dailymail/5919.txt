steve smith scored a brilliant century to lay a solid platform but australia lost a string of wickets in the second half of their innings to finish with 328 for seven in the world cup semi-final against india on thursday
on a good scg pitch in perfect weather conditions , the reigning champions will fancy their chances of overhauling the target of 329 and taking their place in sunday 's final against new zealand in melbourne
steve smith ( 105 ) came back to torment india in a partnership of 182 with opener aaron finch ( 81 ) to lead australia to a comfortable position with close to 200 runs on the board , nine wickets in hand and over 15 overs to bat
with umesh yadav ( 4 - 72 ) to the fore , however , india struck back to remove the power - hitters in australia 's middle order and disrupt their attempt to plunder runs in the later overs
" steve smith had come to the crease in the fourth over after umesh yadav had bounced out opener david warner for 12 and rarely looked troubled for the remainder of his 122 - minute knock
the bouncers were pulled , he called for a cap when the spinners came on and hit 11 fours and two sixes to give india a rude reminder of his prolific form in the test series around new year , when he scored a century in all four matches
the crowd , the majority wearing the blue of india , were roused and finch soon departed as umesh yadav 's third victim with clarke ( 10 ) and james faulkner ( 21 ) following him back to the dressing room as australia tumbled to 284 for six
