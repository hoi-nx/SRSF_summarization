the case of a georgia woman , whose execution was postponed for a second time monday , is once again shining the national spotlight on one of the most fundamental questions we as a nation face : when do we put our own citizens to death ? but it 's an issue on which this country is all over the place
" as it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim 's life was not taken
after all , the u.s. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses that are punishable by death , and not all of them involve a victim 's life being taken
but what happened to all that " should n't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim 's life was not taken " language from the supreme court ? does n't the department of justice have to listen to the supreme court ? they do , and they have
as it relates to crimes against individuals , though , the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim 's life was not taken
apparently , when we are talking about crimes against people , the death penalty should not be expanded to nonhomicide - type crimes
while it varies from state to state , as a very general proposition , the death penalty is almost universally reserved for the crime of murder
murder is a subcategory of the broader class of homicide , and death penalty crimes are normally a subcategory of murder
if you commit an inherently dangerous felony , and a death results , you can be charged with " felony murder , " which in some states qualifies you for the death penalty
ultimately , it 's nearly impossible to articulate a simple rule for determining which crimes our society deems worthy of the death penalty
society 's view of the death penalty is constantly evolving , and so is the view of appropriate death penalty crimes
while the husband - wife execution of convicted spies ( and nonkillers ) julius and ethel rosenberg were certainly high profile at the time , the modern reality is that every person executed since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 participated in a crime in which a victim died
so what exactly will earn you the death penalty ? the message is anything but clear
