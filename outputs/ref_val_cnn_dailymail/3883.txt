it mesmerised italy with its lurid accounts of sex parties
tuesday 's ruling came at a time when the conservative leader is struggling to hold together his forza italia party and maintain a front - line role in italy politics
berlusconi was also charged with abusing his authority to get el mahroug , who was 17 at the time , released from police custody over theft accusations last month berlusconi pulled out of a pact with prime minister renzi over reform of italy 's voting system and political apparatus , complaining that renzi had excluded him from the choice of who should become the new head of state
that puts it behind renzi 's democratic party , the anti-establishment 5-star movement and the anti-immigrant northern league whose leader matteo salvini seems to be eclipsing berlusconi as the prominent figure on the italy right .
