leicester , english richard iii , the king found beneath a car parking lot , has been reburied in a solemn but celebratory service , 530 years after his death in battle
the remains of the medieval monarch were sensationally rediscovered beneath a blanket of tarmac in the center of leicester in august 2012
they have been pored over by scientists at the city 's university ever since , but after more than two years of legal wranglings , the bones were finally laid to rest thursday in a coffin built by richard iii 's distant relative , ibsen , whose dna helped prove their identity
oscar - nominated actor benedict cumberbatch , a distant cousin of english 's last king , read a poem dedicated to richard iii , written by poet laureate carol ann duffy
instead , the aim of the service was to offer richard iii a fitting farewell , and a lasting memorial -- neither of which he was granted following his death at bosworth in 1485
now richard iii 's bones , accompanied by a specially - crafted rosary , recognizing his catholic faith , rest in a lead - lined coffin of english oak , his grave marked by a 2.3 ton block of pale swaledale fossil limestone resting on a plinth of black kilkenny marble carved with his name , dates , coat of arms , and his symbol : a white boar
speaking before the commemorations , philippa langley , founder of the " looking for richard " project , said she did not expect to feel upset at the reinterment : " richard iii died over 500 years ago , so i do n't think there will be a sense of sadness there at all
" but ibsen admitted he found sunday 's service at which the remains were carried in to the cathedral surprisingly moving : " there was a slight dampening of the eyeballs , which caught me completely unawares , " he said phlegmatically
" we grew up with all the stories of richard iii we lived close to bow bridge , so we know all the legends about him
" stirling said she thought the richard iii story would be a big bonus for the city : " i think it will boost the economy and bring visitors in -- he 's got quite a fan club , after all
" leicester has always been proud of its links to richard iii ; the city boasts pubs and schools named in his honor , there 's a walking tour and a brand new visitor center built over his original grave
but in recent days , interest has risen to fever pitch : shop windows are full of richard iii - themed displays offering everything from wooden toy castles to chain mail jewelery
the florist around the corner from the cathedral is doing a roaring trade in white roses , which people have been leaving at richard iii 's statue , and his face is emblazoned on all manner of souvenirs , from paperweights and pens to mugs and bars of chocolate
" not everyone was there just to celebrate richard iii , though
leicester student sherry xie said she was " proud " of her university 's role in the discovery of his bones , but she and her classmate wendy jiang admitted they 'd come along with an ulterior motive : " to see benedict cumberbatch ! " in his sermon , the bishop of leicester , stevens said those who had joined the commemorations " ( came ) not to judge , condemn or praise , but to stand in silent , humble and reverent attentiveness at the meeting place of time and eternity
but campbell insisted that the service was held in a " spirit of reconciliation , " a thought echoed by stevens : " whether we bear a white or a red rose , whether for richard iii or henry ... whether for leicester or york , we recognize at the graveside that all our journeys lead us to this place , where reputation counts for nothing and all human striving turns to dust
" langley , the driving force behind the search for the king , said thursday 's service would mark the end of one chapter in the long - running saga ; but she said work to re-examine richard iii 's life and legacy would go on
