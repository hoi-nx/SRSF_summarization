scientists have uncovered the earliest fossilised evidence of an insect caring for its young
the fossil shows a female sap - sucking scale insect , preserved in amber , carrying her freshly hatched nymphs and unhatched eggs on her abdomen
the waxy ball like shapes on the abdomen of this 100 million year old insect wathondra kotejai contain eggs and hatched nymphs and is thought to be the earliest example of parental care in insects yet discovered the fossil , discovered in a mine in the kachin province of northern myanmar , pushes back the earliest direct evidence for insects caring for their brood by more than 50 million years
it is thought to be one of the earliest examples of parental care ever discovered and may help to explain how it first began to emerge
professor bo wang , a palaeontologist at the chinese academy of sciences who led the research , said : ' brood care could have been an important driver for the early radiation of scale insects , which occurred during the end of the jurassic or earliest cretaceous period during the mesozoic era
' although analysis seemed to suggest that ancient insects evolved brood care , this is the first direct , unequivocal evidence for the fossil record
' the insect wathondra kotejai is thought to date from the mid-cretaceous period and became encased in sap from a tree that over time turned into amber
amber makes it almost transparent researchers believe wathondara kotejai ( above ) may be one of the earliest insects to care for its young tiny hatched nymphs can be seen scattered aaround the mother insect 's body in the amber in the image above the only other direct evidence of brood care is from cenozoic ambers , which are thought to only extend to around 65 million years ago
the findings may help to offer an explanation for the early diversification of scale insects - small limpet - like suck saping insects that are common pests on plants today
the insect was found encased in amber in a mine in the kachin province of northern myanmar ( shown above ) wathondara kotejai is an ancient ancestor this sap - sucking scale insect that are now common garden pests
