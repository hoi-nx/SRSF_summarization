" every day , we cried " -- these were the words spoken over and over to me by a colleagues as we sat down after another long day for a rare drink in monrovia , liberia 's bustling capital
she was reminiscing about the period in september and october when the ebola outbreak was at its peak
as the ebola outbreak wanes in liberia , it is easy to imagine the heroes as the myriad of foreign doctors , nurses , epidemiologists and logisticians that have come to support the country in their days of need , and yes , these expatriates have definitely brought to bear much knowledge , expertise and resources on controlling the outbreak

with a beautiful beach front right at the heart of the city , there is no reason for monrovia not to be the favorite destination of african 's emerging middle class
