two police officers shot and wounded while standing guard outside the ferguson , missouri , police department early thursday were deliberately targeted in what a police official called an " ambush
" such ambush - style attacks were the leading circumstance in the surging number of shooting deaths of law enforcement officers , according to the nonprofit , washington - based memorial fund
the shootings were a chilling low point in the protests in the st. louis suburb since a ferguson police officer shot and killed 18 - year - old michael brown in august
the demonstrators were out again late wednesday -- in response to the announcement hours earlier of ferguson police chief thomas jackson 's resignation -- when shots rang out from a hill about 125 yards from where the protesters had gathered , according to witnesses
st. louis county police chief jon belmar said the shootings were an " ambush " intended " for whatever nefarious reason " to inflict harm on the officers

however , ambushes were the largest single category of circumstances in the shooting deaths of officers in 2014 , according to the group 's report
fifty officers were killed by firearms -- 15 in ambush attacks -- in 2014 , the memorial fund said
that 's compared with five ambushes among 32 shooting deaths in 2013 and six ambush deaths during 2012 , according to the fbi

" that angry rhetoric is n't confined to the case of ferguson -- or of staten island , new york , where the death of eric garner in july after police attempted to subdue him spurred national protests and preceded the slayings of liu and ramos , said groeninger , a spokesman for the memorial fund
groeninger said the uptick in ambush - style attacks was " punctuated " by the new york officers ' slayings , but there were other targeted attacks against law enforcement in 2014 that concern the fund
they included : in las vegas in june , jerad miller and his wife surprised two police officers as they ate lunch , shooting them to death
