a los angeles - based artist claims versace has ripped off one of her designs
kesshia ' kesh ' kumari , who has more than 80,000 instagram followers , used the social networking site to express her views about the luxury fashion house
she uploaded a picture of one of the t - shirts she created with american apparel inspired by her artwork in 2013 next to versace 's offering , which she captioned : ' at least make it better than the $ 30 ( Â£ 20 ) original @ versace_official
' she also uploaded a snap of versace 's Â£ 440 medusa cotton jersey t - shirt and wrote : ' this.hurts
in an interview with the cut , the london - born designer said : ' i have always had a deep admiration for versace
it is not only artwork from a collection that i created for american apparel to provide something affordable and accessible to supporters of my work
the versace t - shirt 's description on selfridges website reads : ' versace âs flair for contemporary prints can be seen with this statement t - shirt
' mailonline has contacted versace for comment
speaking to mailonline , jim dennis , an intellectual property partner at law firm gordon dadds , the english member firm at globalaw , said : ' kesh âs design is certainly distinctive and the versace design is strikingly similar
' it is for the court to decide whether versace has copied kesh âs design but the similarities between the designs are so substantial the court may readily infer that copying has taken place
if so , versace would infringe kesh âs copyright unless they can prove with clear evidence that they created their design independently and without reference to kesh âs
' carissa kendall-palmer , associate solicitor , eip in london , added : ' in short , kesh should be filing a law suit right away
the versace t - shirt is clearly very similar to the t - shirt she developed for the american apparel range in 2013
' the design could be protected by both design rights and copyright , and it certainly looks like a bit of a rip - off
