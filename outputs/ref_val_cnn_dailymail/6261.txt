a netherlands mother has abducted two of her four children and taken them to join militants fighting for the islamic state terrorist organisation in syria
the unnamed 32 - year - old chechen national had been living in maastricht in the southern netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to isis ' raqqa
according to the netherlands newspaper de limburger , the children 's father had previously reported his estranged wife to the police because he was concerned she was planning to travel to syria
shortly afterwards the woman vanished from maastricht with two of the children , prompting netherlands officials to launch a major alert , leading to an international arrest warrant being issued
despite this the woman later took to facebook to declare that she and her two children had arrived in the terrorists ' raqqa , having used fake passports to travel across europe
netherlands officials said they had no way of telling whether the group were still alive , with prosecutor bart den hartigh declaring the recovery of the children ' impossible ' as the netherlands has no legal relationship with either the syria regime or the terror group that controls the city of raqqa
