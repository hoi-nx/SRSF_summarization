when liverpool and united meet at anfield on sunday , there will not be a single local lad starting in this iconic fixture for the first time in the premier league era
april 26 1992 , the final time the two sides met in the old division one , was the last time no player in liverpool 's starting xi was born within 30 miles of anfield or a united player within the same distance from old trafford
in the 53 league and cup meetings since , the likes of steven gerrard - likely to start from the bench on sunday - jamie carragher , steve mcmanaman and fowler have starred for liverpool , while united 's local lads have included paul scholes , gary and phil neville , nicky butt and welbeck
steven gerrard looks dejected in defeat after liverpool were beaten 3 - 0 by united last december local lad james wilson also started that game for united manchester - born welbeck tackled by steven gerrard at anfield last season jamie carragher ( left ) and gary nevill during a game at old trafford in march 2010 wayne rooney , a designated scouser , does n't count ( although he was born less than four miles from anfield ) , while ryan giggs is also excluded as he was born in wales
