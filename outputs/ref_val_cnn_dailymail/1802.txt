microsoft says its new windows 10 operating system will be coming ' this summer ' in 190 countries and 111 languages
in a blog post late tuesday , microsoft executive vice president myerson said the operating system designed for multiple devices would also have a ' small footprint ' for connected devices
microsoft has yet to provide a precise date for the launch of the operating system , which is aimed at powering pcs , smartphones and also connected devices such as bank machines and medical equipment
' windows will offer versions of windows for a diverse set of internet devices , ranging from powerful devices like atms and ultrasound machines , to resource constrained devices like gateways
' microsoft is also working with fast - growing chinese smartphone maker xiaomi to test windows 10 on its devices
the move is an unprecedented attempt by microsoft to get legitimate versions of its software onto machines of the hundreds of millions of windows users in chinese
windows 10 will include a new xbox app to allow users to easily share with friends , and is extremely similar to the firm 's xbox console system
myerson , who runs microsoft 's operating systems unit , announced the plan at the winhec technology conference in shenzhen , chinese
microsoft said in january it would offer free upgrades to windows 10 for users of windows 7 or later in an attempt to hold onto users and make up for lost revenue by selling services such as office over the internet
microsoft also said it is working with chinese handset maker xiaomi technology co ltd - which generally uses a form of google inc 's android on its devices - to offer some customers a test version of windows 10 on their smartphones
