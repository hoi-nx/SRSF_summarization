and the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure to secondhand smoke , researchers warn
therefore , the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all , they say
the findings confirm previous research that linked tobacco smoke and toxins with a lasting effect on children 's cardiovascular health
the new research confirms tobacco smoke and toxins have a lasting effect on children 's heart health finnish children were measured for their exposure to passive smoking and whether their carotid arteries - the blood vessels that carry oxygen - rich blood to the head , brain and face - had become narrowed or blocked due to plaque build - up in adulthood
the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure to secondhand smoke , the researchers warn
therefore , the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all the risk of developing carotid plaque in adulthood was almost two times ( 1.7 ) higher in children who had one or both parents who smoked , compared to children of non-smoking parents
and the risk was elevated even if parents tried to limit their children 's exposure , warned the study , published in the journal circulation
study author dr costan magnussen , of the university of turku , said : ' although we can not confirm that children with a detectable blood cotinine in our study was a result of passive smoke exposure directly from their parents , we know that a child 's primary source of passive smoke exposure occurs at home
' for parents who are trying to quit smoking , they may be able to reduce some of the potential long - term risk for their children by actively reducing their children 's exposure to secondhand smoke , by not smoking inside the home , car , or smoke well away from their children
repeated exposure of children to secondhand smoke is child abuse , a leading doctor has warned
dr goldsteimn argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse his controversial opinion piece has been published in the latest issue of the annals of family medicine
