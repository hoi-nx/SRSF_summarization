steeping is the act of letting the flavour of the tea infuse into the water , and scientists claim it should be left for a minimum of two minutes
but a study has found that 80 per cent of tea drinkers ca n't wait that long - and 40 per cent of us drink it immediately meaning we do n't get the best flavour from our cuppa
researchers asked 1,000 people about their tea - drinking habits and found that only 16 % of people let the water brew , or steep , for the recommended time of between two and five minutes
nearly half ( 47 per cent ) leave their tea to cool for five minutes after they have removed the tea bag before drinking it the study was commissioned ahead of british science week - a 10 - day programme of science , technology , engineering and maths events across the british that started on 13 march

elsewhere , the age - old debate of water or milk first was found to vary depending on how the tea is being drunk
if the tea is being made in a cup or mug the milk should be added last , and more than two thirds ( 69 per cent ) of tea drinkers use this technique
but when made using a tea pot , the milk should be added to the mug before the tea - infused hot water is poured into it
