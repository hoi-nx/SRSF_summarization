a woman desperate to become a mother has been refused ivf treatment on the nhs because her partner already has a child from a previous relationship
according to ms mcphillips , she never sees her boyfriend 's daughter and insists that having a child is a ' basic human right for a woman '
charlotte mcphillips , 23 , pictured with partner robert was told as a teenager she would be unable to conceive naturally because she has polycystic ovary syndrome ' i hardly have any contact with eleanor , ' she says of partner howard 's four - year - old daughter
' i have already been told that parliament ca n't do anything and i am willing to go to the european court of human rights to get it
' it is a basic human right for a woman to have a child and be a mother
the couple read their letter informing them they can not have ivf on the nhs as robert already has a child promised ivf by medics at the time , ms mcphillips thought nothing more of it until , three years after meeting mr howard , 24 , she decided she wanted to start a family and requested an appointment
but the couple were left devastated when nhs officials told them they were not eligible for ivf because robert has a child , four - year - old eleanor , from a previous relationship
' the barmaid said she intends to fight the decision denying her the chance to be a mother ' it is heart - breaking that i ca n't have children and it was even more devastating when i was told i could n't have ivf , ' says ms mcphillips
' they have considered going private but say they are unable to afford the Â£ 5,000 fee since mr howard is unemployed and ms mcphillips works as a barmaid
