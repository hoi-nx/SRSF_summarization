it was only fitting that a former hearts man should help to finally send the championship title to tynecastle
yet it was not only a favour to his first love that lee wallace performed at easter road
in scoring the crucial , confidence - building opening goal for rangers , he also delivered an immensely valuable prize to his current employers
for the ibrox side , games against hibs this term have been akin to a sadistically extended form of torture
lee wallace ( centre ) is congratulated by his team - mates after giving rangers the lead away to hibs hibernian xi : mark oxley , gray ( keith watson - 45 ) , hanlon , liam fontaine

kenny miller scored a highly controversial clincher ten minutes from the end â when refereeing headline - magnet collum ignored hibs â claims for a foul by lee wallace â but , in truth , this was a victory that had foundations laid long before kick - off
so often in recent times , rangers fans have lamented the perceived lack of tactical thinking from those resident in the technical area
mccall , though , turned up in leith and did a number on hibs to secure the first triumph of his three - match reign
kenny miller slots home to put the game beyond doubt for rangers and close the gap on hibs â mccall âs blue - and - white army â was the chant from the visiting support as the minutes ticked down
overall , this was just a second win in 10 games for rangers but it lifted them to within three points of their hosts , with a game in hand
hibs â 15 - match unbeaten run is at an end but stubbs is adamant this will not derail the momentum they have steadily built since the turn of the year
building momentum is now mccall âs ( pictured ) aim â after he recognised something different had to be attempted against hibs if rangers were not to face the inevitably of yet another defeat
it was hardly a trio to inspire confidence in the visiting support , given their ropey individual performances this term , yet the hope was that weight of numbers would help stifle the hosts in central areas and allow mcgregor and lee wallace to advance as wing - backs
it worked , and contributed to a fractured opening period in which clear sights of goal were at a premium
lee wallace slams home the opener just before half - time to put the away side in control at easter road the easter road side had the first , thanks to a majestic , deep cross hit with pace and accuracy from the left flank by dylan mcgeouch
that was , though , as good as it got for hibs in the first half as they encountered a rangers line - up displaying a renewed level of organisation
then gray was caught out as rangers broke forward and was forced to haul down lee wallace around 25 yards out
it would , though , be the visitors who took the lead two minutes ahead of the interval via a goal made possible by mccall âs rejig
kenny miller celebrates his goal with the fans during his side 's win it was the first time rangers had taken the lead against hibs on championship duty and only the second goal they had managed during 313 minutes of this fixture
it was rangers up first , with mohnsi feeding kenny miller , whose angled ball set up clark
clark was denied space to finish at the near post after another surging run from lee wallace
lee wallace looked to play a one - two with kenny miller , but it seemed hanlon had beaten him to the return pass before they collided
