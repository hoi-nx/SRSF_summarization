researchers studying nature have turned to a new frontier they say could be more diverse than anmost anywhere else - homes
researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice - free land , or about 247,000 square miles , almost the size of texas
the various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched , with sparse studies of rodents and german cockroaches , researchers say
a study of 40 houses in north carolina used genomic technologies to document the inhabitants
it found more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa
another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods , including insects and spiders an examination of 11 houses in california found a great variety of fungus among us
the various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched , with sparse studies of rodents and german cockroaches , for example , from the pest management field , or public health perspectives on microbes
' but given the number of species found indoors , it is likely there 's a lot more going on that we do n't know about
' a study of 40 houses in north carolina used genomic technologies to document more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa ; another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods , including insects and spiders ; and an examination of 11 houses in california found a great variety of fungus among us
researchers say they have many questions regarding the indoor evolution - such as whether species found indoors were pre-adapted to indoor environments or whether they have adapted to them ; and how the indoors might drive the evolution of new species
