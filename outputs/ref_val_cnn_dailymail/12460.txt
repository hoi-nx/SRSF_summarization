london having been tony blair 's spokesman and strategist for a decade and more , having been at his side through election campaigns , wars and peace processes , political and personal crises , scandals galore , having spent thousands of hours facing down possibly the most questioning media on the planet , and having done thousands of talks and interviews since leaving tb 's side , i am very experienced in answering difficult questions
but right now , i am struggling and i thought a little bit of crowd sourcing with the highly intelligent men -- and especially the women -- who visit cnn might help
as you might know from a chat i had on cnn with christiane last month , i have written my 11th book
) the problem is women , or more precisely how i talk about them
at every single one of the nine or so events i have so far done about the book , and in several of the many interviews , i have been asked -- usually but not always by a woman -- a version of this same question : " do men and women win in different ways ? " and i do n't really know what to say
at the first event , hosted by the financial times , my partner fiona and my daughter grace were sitting in the front row , squirming as i told how i had written a chapter on the queen , named german chancellor angela merkel as the most impressive current political leader , interviewed and profiled americans vogue editor anna wintour as my main voice on leadership , done the same with arianna huffington as a great innovator , talked to gymnast nadia comaneci about her " perfect 10 , " and presented paralympian athlete and tanni grey-thompson and australian surfer layne beachley as two of the best interviews about resilience
as grace said afterwards -- well to be honest she heckled me at the time with the words " shut up dad , this is embarrassing , " -- i was answering a question i had not been asked , namely " why are n't there more women in the book ? ' rather than the one i had been asked , " do men and women win in different ways ? " at my next outing , in front of the amazingly bright international postgrad students at hult international business school , with grace not there to heckle , but fiona sitting three yards from me , the same question came again almost word for word
so i waffled a bit about glass ceilings and how fiona 's generation had won the battle for women 's equality in the eyes of the law but grace 's generation needed to win the battle in terms of the culture of the land
she said it was still a man 's world and women had essentially to do twice as many jobs as men
men also did n't appreciate either that reality , or that it therefore becomes harder for a woman to win than a man in many sets of circumstances
the row in the car on the way home was reasonably good - natured , considering my partner of 36 years was basically confirming i was not a new man and suggesting i talked absolute tosh about whether men and women win in different ways
so when the same bloody question came up again i started off with my list of names but stupidly mentioned the queen first promoting a left - leaning chorus of " for heaven 's sake she is hardly typical , " so that by the time i got to fiona 's point , i was struggling again
god knows what would have happened if i had said margaret thatcher was in there , in the section comparing her leadership to david cameron 's ( sic )
afterwards a woman who shall be nameless -- but she does work for harriet harman , the chief architect of labour 's new feminism and the proud leader of the pink campaign bus tour ( which i love by the way ) -- said this to me : " you have to come back and do more in the campaign
" in other words there 's me trying to get the right answer to a question that has genuinely been troubling me , and an arch feminist says i need to do more of the alpha male thing
and the next time i sit down with cnn 's woman winners , christiane or becky , i need to have a better answer than the ones i have been deploying thus far
