for earth - bound optical telescopes , the surface of venus is shrouded beneath thick clouds made mostly of carbon dioxide
but now , astronomers have combined the green bank telescope with the radar transmitter at the arecibo observatory to make remarkably detailed images of the planet 's surface from earth
the black diagonal band at the center represents areas too close to the equator to obtain well - resolved image data the radar signals from arecibo observatory in puerto rico passed through both earth 's atmosphere and the atmosphere of venus
here they hit the surface and bounced back to be received by the green bank telescope in west virginia in a process known as bistatic radar
by comparing images taken at different periods in time , scientists hope to eventually detect signs of active volcanism
spain astronomers have revealed a new theory for a ' y ' shape on venus ( annotated image from the pioneer venus orbiter in 1979 shown )
they say it is formed by winds pushing a ' wave ' of clouds on the planet
these winds move faster at higher altitudes , creating the odd shape ' it is painstaking to compare radar images to search for evidence of change , ' said bruce campbell , a senior scientist at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington , ' the work is ongoing
high - resolution radar images of venus were first obtained by arecibo observatory in 1988 and most recently by arecibo observatory and green bank telescope in 2012
when astronomers first started taking images of venus , they were somewhat baffled by a mysterious ' y ' shape that covered the entire planet
to take the stunning images , astronomers combined the green bank telescope ( right ) in west virginia with the radar transmitter at the arecibo observatory ( left ) in puerto rico
