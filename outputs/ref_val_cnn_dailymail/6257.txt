this is the moment a sailor was pulled from the pacific after he survived 100 minutes in the freezing water , which left him hearing voices and close to death
taylor was swept overboard and battled 66ft waves in conditions he described as ' like being in a washing machine '
he was uncertain his crew had even noticed he was missing but was determined to survive because ' it would be unfair on mum to die on her birthday ' , he said
mr taylor was thrown in the sea eight months into the clipper round the world race and watched the yacht disappear over the horizon
fearing his legs were both broken after being hit by the rudder , hypothermia then set in and he began hallucinating and hearing voices
but he had activated his emergency beacon and the boat returned almost two hours later to rescue him - and a doctor on board saved him by packing him in a sleeping bag filled with hot water bottles
he has now turned his diary entries from the trip into a book and will donate the profits to charity
the 47 - year - old continued : ' i thought i was going to die but decided , " it would be unfair on mum to die today "
' while mr taylor was doing this , a wave crashed on board and dragged him overboard
i thought my legs were broken as i watched the boat disappear
' on the horizon : mr taylor floats in the sea after he was thrown in and battered by the boat 's rudder grabbed : a member of the crew swings in to the water to grab the stricken sailor , who took three attempts to get back aboard saved : mr taylor was stripped and warmed up using large amounts of hot water bottles packed into a sleeping bag mr taylor said at this point he was sure the yacht would return for him soon
he said : ' we 'd trained in ' man overboard ' so i activated the ais beacon , attached to me , which i knew would show my location on a screen on the boat
' i thought the boat would stop , turn round and pick me up
' i pulled the pin out of my beacon and it started flashing
' mr taylor said he began to wonder if his beacon had worked and alerted the crew to his disappearance
he continued : ' i was constantly under the waves
' so i turned to face the wind hoping to get cold and stay awake
i talked to myself about family and friends and i remembered my mum 's birthday
i decided it was unfair to die on mum 's birthday and that gave me strength
' then he began to hear voices
mr taylor said : ' i thought my mind was playing tricks on me but i focussed on them and they seemed to be getting louder
' journey : mr taylor was on board the derry londonderry doire yacht , pictured leaving the dock in london , at the clipper 13-14 race start last year celebrating : taylor is second left here on a stopover in china before he was thrown overboard last march conditions : but later the boat was being hit with huge waves in the pacific , which in the end swept off mr taylor and nearly killed him the team on board tried to grab hold of mr taylor , attach him to mr middleton 's harness and haul him up out of the water
' turnaround : mr taylor 's legs were bruised and swollen and after he had six days intensive physiotherapy he then decided he wanted to carry on with the race finally , with the whole crew forging together , mr taylor was pulled out of the water almost two hours after he 'd gone overboard
' mr taylor was taken below deck and put in a sleeping bag which was packed with bottles filled with hot water , to warm him up
he said : ' for the next four hours my muscles ached and i was in and out of consciousness
' mr taylor 's legs were bruised and swollen
' mr taylor has now turned his experience into a book
proceeds from the sale of his book will go to mr taylor 's chosen charities â the ellen macarthur cancer trust and the newmarket day centre .
