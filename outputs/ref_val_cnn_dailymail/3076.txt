adopting a positive mental attitude lowers the risk of suffering a heart attack , requiring surgery and even death
the research found after suffering a heart attack or angina , the most pessimistic patients were twice as likely to suffer a more serious health condition in the next four years , compared with the most optimistic patients
these conditions include a more severe heart attack , heart surgery or death
a new study by researchers at ucl has found optimists are less likely to suffer a heart attack , heart surgery or die in the years after suffering an initial heart attack or angina in the uk , 2.3 million people are living with coronary heart disease , the major cause of heart attacks and unstable angina ( the type that does n't occur upon exertion but strikes randomly , and persists even at rest )
scientists surveyed the mental attitudes of 369 patients , who were admitted to hospital with unstable angina and heart attacks
smoking has long been known to be a major risk factor for heart attack and angina , with an estimated 22,000 deaths each year from cardiovascular disease linked to smoking
the study also showed that optimistic patients are more likely to increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables , a year after their heart attack or angina
the study found pessimists were more likely to smoke and live an unhealthy lifestyle - factors linked to poor heart health forty per cent with a positive outlook were eating the recommended five or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day
lead author of the research , professor steptoe , said : ' our research shows that optimistic people are more likely to take advice about lifestyle changes on board , like quitting smoking and eating more healthily â this results in better outcomes after a patient suffers from unstable angina or a heart attack
' suffering from a serious condition like angina or heart attack can take a drastic emotional toll , which we know can lead to depression , further lowering the chances of a full recovery after a heart attack
this study found pessimistic patients were twice as likely to have depressive symptoms a year after suffering a heart attack or unstable angina
there are two types of angina , called stable and unstable angina
unstable angina is more unpredictable
attacks of unstable angina may last longer than a few minutes and do not always respond to treatments used for stable angina
