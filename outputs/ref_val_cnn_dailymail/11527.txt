japanese scientists have successfully transmitted energy wirelessly in a breakthrough that could pave the way for space - based solar power systems
mitsubishi researchers used microwaves to deliver 1.8 kilowatts of power - enough to run an electric kettle - through the air with pinpoint accuracy to a receiver 170ft ( 55 metres ) away
while the distance was relatively small , the technology could someday pave the way for mankind to tap the vast amount of solar energy available in space and use it here on earth
while the distance was relatively small , the technology could someday pave the way for mankind to tap the vast amount of solar energy available in space and use it here on earth ' this was the first time anyone has managed to send a high output of nearly two kilowatts of electric power via microwaves to a small target , using a delicate directivity control device , ' said a spokesman for the jaxa ( jaxa ) said
the test , which took place at kobe shipyard & machinery works in nagoya , japanese , will help jaxa devise its long - awaited space solar power system
solar power generation in space has many advantages over its earth - based cousin , notably the permanent availability of energy , regardless of weather or time of day
while man - made satellites , such as the international space station , have long since been able to use the solar energy that washes over them from the sun , getting that power down to earth where people can use it has been the thing of science fiction

mitsubishi used microwaves to deliver 1.8 kilowatts of power - enough to run an electric kettle - through the air with pinpoint accuracy to a receiver ( right ) 170ft ( 55 metres ) away in a separate project , a japanese firm last year revealed plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on earth but the japanese research offers the possibility that humans will one day be able to farm an inexhaustible source of energy in space
the idea , said the jaxa spokesman , would be for microwave - transmitting solar satellites - which would have sunlight - gathering panels and antennae - to be set up about 22,300 miles ( 36,000km ) from the earth
space - based solar power â once the stuff of science - fiction â could be available sooner than expected if japanese has its way solar power has had a difficult start on earth thanks to inefficient panels and high costs
within 25 years , the country plans to make space - based solar power a reality , according to a proposal from the jaxa ( jaxa )
