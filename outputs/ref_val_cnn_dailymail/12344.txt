london the bbc producer allegedly struck by clarkson will not press charges against the " top gear " host , his lawyer said friday
clarkson , who hosted one of the most - watched television shows in the world , was dropped by the bbc wednesday after an internal investigation by the british broadcaster found he had subjected producer tymon " to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack
north yorkshire police said they had asked the bbc for a copy of the report and would assess whether further police action needed to be taken
" tymon issued a statement through his lawyer friday saying he had informed police he did not want to press charges
the matter has taken a great toll on tymon , his family and his friends , " lawyer paul daniels said
" quite simply , mr tymon just wishes to return now to the job at the bbc he loves , as soon as possible
" mr tymon agrees with the bbc 's stated view that all parties should now be allowed to move on , so far as possible
" tymon had earlier said he was grateful to the bbc for their " thorough and swift investigation into this very regrettable incident
clarkson was suspended on march 10 after what the bbc initially described as the " fracas " with tymon
macquarrie , who conducted the internal investigation into the incident , said tymon had been struck " resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip
" the physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness , macquarrie said , but clarkson continued to use " derogatory and abusive language " for a sustained period of time
macquarrie said clarkson made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to bbc management
announcing wednesday that clarkson 's contract would not be renewed , bbc director general tony hall said a " line had been crossed
after his suspension by the bbc , clarkson changed his twitter profile to " i am probably a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear
" on wednesday , the wording became past tense : " i used to be a presenter on the bbc2 motoring show , top gear
" fans had earlier expressed outrage at the bbc decision to suspend clarkson
last week , clarkson launched into an expletive - filled rant at a charity auction in north london , verbally attacking his bbc bosses
a cnn reporter who was at the event said clarkson swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the bbc had " f * * ked themselves " and had ruined a great show
clarkson later brushed off the incident , saying the rant was meant " in jest " and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the " top gear " race track .
