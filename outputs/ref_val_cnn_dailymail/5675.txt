france is one step closer to legalising euthanasia after approving a bill that allows doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until they die
the bill stops short of recommending lethal injections and avoids the terms euthanasia or assisted suicide , but would give people ' the right to deep , continuous sedation until death '
this must be at the patient 's request , but only when their condition is life - threatening in the short - term
euthanasia has been taking place in holland for many years the proposed measure was passed by a vote of 436 to 34 in france 's lower house of parliament , and it must now be debated by the senate
backed by the socialist government , the bill would also force doctors in france to follow end - of - life instructions expressed by the patients themselves , or written in advance if they are no longer able to state their wishes
the universities of ghent and brussels found that since euthanasia was legalised in 2002 , the acceptance of ending a life at the patient 's request has greatly increased
" euthanasia is legal only in the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg earlier this month in a speech at france 's lower house of parliament , prime minister manuel valls praised ' a reform that proclaims the right to die peacefully , in dignity and without suffering '
the bill has stirred debate in france and prompted a call for the preservation of ' the prohibition of killing ' by five high - profile christian , muslim and jewish leaders
so - called terminal or ' palliative sedation ' can involve medicating patients until they die naturally of their illnesses , or until they starve
