gibney said in a recent interview he does not understand why cruise has refused to comment on the numerous claims made against him and scientology over the years , going so far as to call his silence ' irresponsible
' among the claims featured in gibney 's documentary , going clear , are that cruise allegedly tapped the phone of his ex-wife nicole kidman prior to their split and that he used underpaid workers for his own personal use that were supplied by the church
then , while cruise was away with nicole kidman in england working on the stanley kurbrick film eyes wide shut , mark rathbun claims the actor ordered the church to tap his wife 's phone
mark rathbun , who also claims he was beaten and abused by miscavige , did not say what , if any , information was obtained through the tapping of nicole kidman 's phone , but the two did split just a few years later , at which time cruise became a highly vocal supporter of scientology
there are also claims in the film that church workers being paid less than a dollar an hour are used by cruise to maintain his collection of motorcycles and his private plane
