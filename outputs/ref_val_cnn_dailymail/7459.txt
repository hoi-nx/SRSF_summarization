it was a surreal start to the day for a bleary - eyed night shift worker , after he got a lot more than he bargained from his morning cereal
jarred smith , 22 , woke up at about 3pm last tuesday and headed into the kitchen at his home in davidson in sydney 's northern beaches
' then i peeked in the top of the cereal box and its head popped out , ' he said
' jarred smith then called the nsw wildlife information , rescue and education service ( wires ) and explained to the lady on the other end of the phone where the slithery reptile was hiding
the diamond python retreated into the box when jarred smith 's dad came to see the unexpected surprise the snake handler turned up minutes later and was surprised to see the size of the python , which he estimated at about one and a half metres long
although jarred smith has never seen a snake before - let alone up so close and personal - he was impressed with how attractive the reptile was
' the snake handler had to rip open the cereal box to release the snake which was two metres long although jarred smith has never seen a snake before - let alone up so close and personal - he described the diamond python as ' good looking '
