the national office of sae fraternity changed its tune
just two weeks ago , the national office condemned a racist chant that resulted in the shutdown of the ou sae chapter , saying , " the national fraternity does not teach such a racist , hateful chant , and this chant is not part of any education or training
" the fraternity brothers probably " learned the song from fellow chapter members , " sae said
but in a friday statement , the sae national office said otherwise
the ou chapter , sae said , " likely learned a racist chant while attending a national leadership school about four years ago
" the fraternity invites hundreds of leaders to a six - day conference every year , sae said
" over time the chant was formalized in the local sae chapter and was taught to pledges as part of the formal and informal leadership process , " he said
the video shows party - bound students on a bus clapping , pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , " there will never be a ni * * * * sae
" the university cut ties with sae after the video surfaced , as did the national fraternity , and both launched investigations
about 20 % of sae members self - identify as a minority or non-caucasian , sae said .
