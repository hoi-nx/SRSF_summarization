satisfied : superior court judge james r brandlin decreed the 25 - year - old had completed the terms of his sentence , which included community labor , domestic violence counseling and rehab casual : the singer arrived in court with purple hair , wearing a suit jacket but skipping the shirt or tie on again : brown and rihanna , seen here at the 2013 grammys , had rekindled their relationship for a time despite the assault four years earlier that left her face battered and cut the judge 's decision came as a surprise to many , who believed he was actually going to revoke brown 's probation and throw him back in jail after a damning report by the probation department
scott free : although he was n't implicated in either , brown was present at two recent shooting incidents in california why me ? : the singer was performing on stage in san jose - having left the country without permission from his probation officer - when five people were shot , while suge knight was also shot at a separate party he hosted wwjd ? : brown asked and then thanked god on twitter for his escape although brown was never implicated in either shooting , his probation report notes that ' there is also concern that when he performs or attends at some of his public events , people will get shot or seriously injured '
red flags : the musician , seen here performing this week at the hampton colliseum in virginia , has had his probation revoked several of times for a number of different incidents brown , seen here remanded in custody while he awaited to hear his fate following his assault on a man outside a hotel in washington , which reportedly occurred when a photobombing incident spiraled out of hand in october of that year he was involved in a fight with two men outside the w hotel in washington and his parole was again revoked , but again he escaped a prison sentence when the judge ruled his progress in anger management classes was enough to offset it
but when he was kicked out of rehab - another violation of his probation rules - he was finally sent to jail in march of last year , but released early in june due to prison overcrowding ktla reporter christina pacucci , who was outside the courtroom , tweeted ' i asked @ chrisrown how it feels to be done
