on wednesday sportsmail published its forensic study to finally settle one of football 's great debates - which is the biggest club in english ? our exclusive table ranked the top 50 teams from the 59 who have played in the top flight for six categories : crowds , global fanbase , trophies , league finish , player quality and income
manchester united came out on top followed by arsenal and then liverpool
former liverpool captain thompson and newcastle legend bobby moncur have their say on our findings
inside by thompson ( ex-liverpool captain ) arsenal bigger than liverpool ? i âm sure my old mates charlie nicholas and paul merson will be delighted about that one and they will be looking forward to the chance to rub my big nose in it
but this is not me , as former liverpool captain and dyed - in - the - wool lifelong supporter , being biased
thompson parades the trophy after their 1 - 0 victory over real madrid to win the 1981 champions league thompson lifts the trophy above his head as his team - mates celebrate beside him after the 1981 final thompson says paul merson ( left ) would rub his nose in it after arsenal were ranked as a bigger club frank mclintock , george graham and charlie george celebrate as arsenal complete the double in 1971 liverpool have always been trailblazers
but , over the course of the next 30 years , as football âs popularity has mushroomed , interest in liverpool has continued to grow
malaysian supporters cheer for liverpool during the summer tour in 2011 thompson attends a press conference during the liverpool legends tour of south africa in 2013 arsenal ended a ten - year trophy drought by coming back to beat hull in a memorable fa cup final last may the reception was phenomenal â and this was just to watch the squad doing some jogging and shooting practice
now i have great respect for arsenal
but , seriously , what i think separates liverpool â and manchester united , for that matter â from the rest is history and heritage
thompson lifts the league cup trophy onto his head after liverpool beat west ham in the 1981 final thompson lifts the champions league in 1981 as liverpool won the competition three times in five years it is why when you go to scandinavia and ireland , for example , the only clubs people will talk to you about are liverpool and manchester united ; very seldom will you hear real madrid and barcelona â never mind arsenal , manchester city and chelsea â being mentioned
liverpool and manchester united dominate these strongholds because , between them , they dominated five decades
liverpool came out on top for most trophies won , and thompson says that is what matters most thompson ( back row second left ) poses with the 1977 - 87 liverpool team sportsmail 's extensive study found that manchester united are english 's biggest club with arsenal and liverpool second at third respectively of course , there will be changes in the coming years
for starters , fans in south east asia can follow trends , and teams that are doing well â as manchester city and chelsea have been â will attract more interest , while arsenal are certainly up and coming in that region
when all is said and done , though , those clubs can not yet match the deep - rooted affinities that so many have for liverpool , which have come from those glorious nights when we won european cups and countless other trophies
why city deserve to be fifth newcastle legend bobby moncur maintains that teams deserve the â big club â tag by winning trophies
commenting on the study in thursday 's sportsmail , bobby moncur said the rankings of chelsea ( 4th ) and manchester city ( 5th ) in the â big clubs â league table were justified despite owners splashing hundreds of millions of pounds in recent years
newcastle were listed ninth in our findings , one place above rivals sunderland , who bobby moncur later joined
vincent kompany celebrates with the manchester city squad as they are crowned premier league champions manchester city are jubilant after winning their second premier league title in three years in 2014 but rather than claim the north-east clubs â with their loyal and sizeable fanbase â should reside above the likes of chelsea and manchester city , bobby moncur said : â for me , a big club is one that wins trophies
â bobby moncur , the last man to lift a trophy for the magpies when they won the inter-cities fairs cup in 1969 , added : â if you were ranking newcastle on supporters alone i âd have them in the top three
frank lampard celebrates with the champions league trophy after winning the competition in 2012 former newcastle captain bobby moncur holds aloft the inter-cities fairs cup in 1969 - the club 's last trophy â you could say manchester city have bought success but they were always a big club in my day , people sometimes forget that
â bobby moncur , 70 , also agreed with placing arsenal in second , above liverpool
leeeeave it , london i âm a chelsea fan and i was never under the impression that we were the biggest club in english
it âs a pretty well known fact manchester united , liverpool and arsenal all have more fans globally because of their past success
glasgowrangers1872 , glasgow the only club in english that are bigger than rangers is manchester united but if we were in english we would dwarf 95 per cent of the clubs
red villarreal , emirates stadium i âm an arsenal fan and even i know we âre not bigger than manchester united , chelsea and liverpool
i wish we âd stop pretending it âs ok and do something about it ! alex , marietta , united states which of these clubs are still playing in europe this season ? mr impartial , london manchester united might be top worldwide , but manchester city is the most popular club in manchester , followed by bolton and then manchester united
