it is now generally accepted that germanwings first officer andreas lubitz did indeed lock his captain out of the cockpit , put their airplane into a steep descent , and then sit back and wait calmly for the end to arrive
he joins the short and infamous list of airline pilots , a handful over the past two decades , who have used their airplanes to combine suicide with mass murder
not only are pilots smarter and better - trained than ordinary people , those stripes and caps say , but they also must be less forgetful than we , less distractible , better rested , not prone to irritability or sadness or smoldering resentments
the truth , as the voluminous history of airplane accidents reveals , is that pilots are not different from other people
when pilots talk among themselves , the mistakes , the close calls , the disasters averted by sheer luck are favorite topics
but if pilots slip up in little ways from time to time , the sweeping drama of aviation , in which they are the actors and we the audience , eclipses their faults
nor are pilots of a higher moral type than the rest of us
pilots are drawn from the diverse pool of human types
the human mind is the blackest of boxes ; no one , neither colleague nor psychologist , can reliably peer inside it
desperate , cataclysmic acts occur almost daily all over the world ; why should they not occur , once in a long while , in cockpits ? perhaps , with time , we will understand better who andreas lubitz was and what he did
