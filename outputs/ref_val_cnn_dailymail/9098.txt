gatland has told jones that he will not â get on his knees â and beg the curly haired welsh prop to come out of retirement following a world cup threatening injury to samson lee
samson lee , 22 , was on tuesday given a â 50 - 50 â chance of being ready for the â pool of death â later this year because of a ruptured achilles tendon , with his recovery already delayed by a week after specialists in london decided there is too much swelling to perform an immediate operation
it has left wales painfully low on experience in the front - row â the four props in the matchday squad to face azzurri have just 11 test starts between them â but gatland maintains the onus is on jones , capped 100 times , to reverse his decision to hang up his international boots
gatland has told jones that he will not â get on his knees â and beg the prop to play samson lee injured his achilles during wales ' 23 - 16 win against ireland in the six nations â i was surprised at the timing of his announcement , â said gatland
if jones was nât retired from international rugby , then he may very well be in the squad now
â making his test debut in 2003 , jones became a household feature in the welsh pack alongside fellow front - row jenkins
while jones will not feature on saturday because of his retirement , jenkins will play no part because of a hamstring injury
the two trophies are due to be sent elsewhere and - while there is understood to be disappointment behind the scenes - gatland accepts that it is a logical decision
â gatland knows his team need a large victory to overhaul england and ireland wales beat ireland 23 - 16 at the millennium stadium to force themselves into title contention wales have identified the final 20 minutes as the opportunity to rack up their points difference and gatland has named a bench loaded with attacking intent
the exciting thing about the world cup is the time we will have together to do in - depth coaching and stuff we do not have the opportunity to do in the six nations
â gatland 's wales side have a plus - 12 points difference , 25 behind england and 21 adrift of ireland
