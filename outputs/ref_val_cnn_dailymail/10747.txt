garde stands on the brink of driving in this weekend 's australia grand prix after sauber suffered another defeat in their legal battle with the dutchman
but , with a contract from the team stating he was to be given a full - time seat for this season , van der garde has pursued sauber through the courts these past few weeks
garde , outside the supreme court on wednesday , has charged sauber with reneging on a deal to give him a race seat after they signed marcus ericsson and nasr an arbitration panel in switzerland initially ordered sauber ' to refrain from taking action ' that would deny van der garde a drive
at present , van der garde is now pursuing an enforcement of the order to ensure sauber comply , which would result in the 29 - year - old taking part in first practice from 12.30pm local time on friday
sauber are now left with three drivers ; van der garde , marcus ericsson ( left ) and nasr ( right ) for sauber team principal kaltenborn , she has three drivers on her books , but only two seats available
in pursuing the enforcement in a separate hearing and in front of a different judge less than an hour after the appeal verdict was handed down , van der garde 's lawyer called for the potential sequestration of sauber 's assets and committal of its directors if the team failed to comply
sauber have since been asked to provide a list of those assets , which includes their cars and equipment at melbourne 's albert park in place for the race
for his part , van der garde is also attempting to acquire a valid and temporary super licence - required for any driver to compete in formula one - as the one in place for last season has since expired
van der garde had said he was looking forward to going back to the team and driving for them this weekend massa has praised van der garde 's actions , claiming ' it is a good thing for all drivers ' speaking outside court , van der garde said : ' sauber has to work with us now
' former sauber driver massa , now with williams , speaking ahead of the appeal verdict , believes van der garde had taken the correct steps to pursue his case via the legal system
