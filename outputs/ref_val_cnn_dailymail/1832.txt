hillary clinton has been hammered time and time again for the scandal which erupted after it emerged that she used her personal email account for government business
but she made light of the scandal at a gathering of reports on monday night , looking forward to ' new beginnings ' ... including a new address
clinton , who is expected to declare her bid for president in the coming weeks , even promised ' no more secrecy ' after weeks of being pressed to turn over state department emails she had hitherto kept to herself
she is pictured about at a speech earlier on monday the former secretary of state and first lady , who was speaking at the awards ceremony for a political journalism prize , admitted it was odd for her to willingly put herself in the way of the press - but tried to spin the occasion as a fresh start
she said : ' i am well aware that some of you may be a little surprised to see me here tonight
' ' ... but i am all about new beginnings
' prank : clinton joked that everyone at the prize - giving in washington , d.c. , had a non-disclosure agreement under their seat however , she could n't help but indulge her secretive side , even in jest , by pretending the guests would all be stopped from talking about the event with a legal gagging order
the event in washington , d.c. honors robin toner , a political reporter who died in 2008 , but interviewed clinton several times in the preceding decades
