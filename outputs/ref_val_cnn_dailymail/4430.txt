a major republican donor said thursday he had heard an anti-semitic remark made by gop chairman against the state auditor who later killed himself believing he was being targeted for his religion
david humphreys released a signed affidavit saying state gop chairman john hancock mentioned november 24 , when he was still a party consultant , that missouri auditor schweich was jewish
' the meaning i took from mr. john hancock 's statement and tone of his comments was clear : he ( schweich ) is jewish â in case you did n't know â and that being jewish is a negative attribute for schweich 's gubernatorial race , ' david humphreys affirmed in the affidavit
auditor schweich ( left ) committed suicide believing himself to be target of anti-semitic smear campaign , which a top republican donor said gop chairman john hancock ( right ) joined in on david humphreys is the first person to publicly attest to hearing such comments from john hancock
john hancock said thursday that he had met with humpheys at the businessman 's joplin office to discuss republican fundraising efforts , but he denied saying anything about schweich 's religion
' i did not hear him say anything about schweich being jewish , ' mouton told the associated press schweich fatally shot himself february 26 at his home in the st. louis suburb of clayton , just a month after declaring his candidacy for the republican nomination for governor
affirmed : david humphreys , ceo of building products company tamko , says he heard john hancock make a remark about schweich 's background that implied a negative view of his jewish roots former us senator john danforth , an episcopal minister who was schweich 's friend and political mentor , delivered the eulogy at schweich 's funeral
' john hancock has said previously that he had mistakenly believed schweich was jewish and , although he had no specific recollection of doing so , has said it 's possible he might have mentioned that in an off - handed way while talking to prospective donors
john hancock said he learned the truth about schweich 's religion during a pair of conversations november 14 with john danforth and schweich , and he said he certainly never mentioned schweich was jewish after that
' i did meet with david humphreys on november 24 , ' as john hancock was running for gop chairman , he said
