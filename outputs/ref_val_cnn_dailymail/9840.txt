new advice from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists rules against so - called souvenir scans before 10 weeks souvenir scans of the unborn baby should not be carried out in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy , say doctors
but new advice from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists rules against the growing trend when there is no medical reason for doing an early - stage scan
but an increasing number of clinics were offering keepsake images from as early as six weeks , he said
an increasing number of clinics are offering keepsake images from as early as six weeks dr christoph less of imperial college is the lead author of the paper which advises against scans of foetuses during the first 10 weeks in the womb unless they are done for medical reasons the review was produced by the scientific advisory committee at the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists to provide doctors with up - to - date information about the issue
dr lees said one of the possible harms might come from the slight heating effect produced by ultrasound which was more easily dissipated by the placenta after 10 weeks of pregnancy
the review highlights the various types of ultrasound , including b - mode â the most commonly used form of ultrasound in obstetrics â colour and pulse wave doppler
colour and pulsed wave doppler involve greater average intensity and power outputs than b - mode and are not recommended at all during the first 10 weeks
colour and pulsed wave doppler scans have such intensity and power output they are not recommended at all during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy 4d ultrasound is â real time â scanning and involves higher power outputs as the scanning time is longer , typically by several minutes , and should not be the sole purpose of souvenir images or video recordings in early pregnancy
dr sadaf ghaem-maghami , chair of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists âs scientific advisory committee , said â b - mode ultrasound used for clinical reasons from conception to 10 weeks of gestation is safe and the benefits outweigh any theoretical risks
