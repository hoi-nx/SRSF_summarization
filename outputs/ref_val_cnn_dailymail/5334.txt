hillary may be the democratic 's presidential front - runner , but the former secretary of state 's poll numbers do n't make her look the part
a cbs poll released thursday found that just 26 per cent see her favorably , compared with 37 per cent who do n't
across the entire voting spectrum , clinton has lost 12 points of support in the intervening 16 months
her high - water mark in the cbs poll came just two months after she took over the state department in early 2009 , when 58 per cent of americans said they liked her
waiting in the wings : a deep field of republicans including wisconsin gov. scott walker ( left ) , former florida gov. jeb bush ( center ) and texas sen. ted cruz ( right ) is chomping at the bit and waiting for a chance to attack clinton there 's bad news also for clinton - backers who hope her ' email-gate ' scandal has only temporarily poisoned the public perceptions
two - thirds of those surveyed said the brewing scandal had no impact on their opinion , giving her precious little ground to make up even if the controversy fades
forty - two per cent said yes , while 40 per cent said no. long memory : some part of voters ' negative impressions of mrs. hillary may harken back to her time as first lady thirty - eight per cent said they believe clinton kept the state department out of the loop on her emails principally to shield work - related communications from the public
forty - seven per cent of the people cbs polled said they do n't believe she is ' honest and trustworthy ' â 5 per cent more than the number who came down on mrs. hillary 's side
