a creepy video shows how a black spider , believed to be a huntsman , refusing to let the force of the powerful flush button get the better of the courageous critter
the extraordinary fight in the creature would be admirable if it was not so scary as it does n't matter how many times it gets dumped into the toilet bowl the spider wo n't give up
the creepy crawly appears from under the toilet bowel due to the pressure of the flush and get dumped into the water ( left ) and then climbs it way up thee porcelain several times with gangly legs ( right ) as soon as the flush button is pressed the creepy crawly appears from under the toilet bowel due to the pressure when it seems safe to presume it only has a matter of seconds before disappearing down the pipe and never to be seen again
the critter kept going into a ball which misled you to believe that all was lost but then miraculously stretch its long legs all the way to the top of the bowel but the remaining running water knocks it back down again and the spider goes back into a ball for long enough to think that it has to be all over for creepy critter by now
