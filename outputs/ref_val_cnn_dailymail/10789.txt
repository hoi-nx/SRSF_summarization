oh be still my beating heart
here we are , standing on the gravel outside the library doors at highclere castle , the english stately home in hampshire that provides the ravishing setting for the television series , downton
we are on the very spot where matthew asked lady mary to marry him in the first downton abbey christmas special , broadcast in 2011
remember when the violins soared and snowflakes fell ? when matthew got down on one miraculously recovered knee to propose ? for many viewers , this was their all - time favourite downton scene
â the crew were using ash to recreate the snow
it got inside the house and we had to spend ages dusting and cleaning the rooms
and the smell ! very acrid
we reached the point where we had to stop them doing it
â countess of carnarvon has always been quite frank about the travails of letting a film crew loose inside her beautiful home
on the plus side , there are the location fees and increased visitor traffic ; the crowds paying Â£ 20 a head to goggle at the splendour of her highclere interiors and the red velvet sofas where the crawleys gather to take tea
it âs like that show , poke your nose through the keyhole , â she says
on the downside , damage and disruption
â i do get annoyed when visitors chuck litter about , but my husband goes around picking it up
â and since the very first day of downton filming , when a technician smashed a much - loved green objet de vertu trinket box , she has been on red alert for transgressions
the wealthy americans designer and his family recently attended a swanky dinner at highclere , hosted by the earl and countess of carnarvon
â the countess of carnarvon is the equivalent of downton âs cora , played by elizabeth mcgovern to whizz down the mile - long drive to highclere castle is to travel back in time to a more gracious age
the stately home made famous by downton has been the ancestral seat of the earl since 1679
to look upon the soaring architecture of highclere is to understand the ambition and conceit of the old english upper classes , who once thought that life behind these ramparts of bath stone , surrounded by reynolds , van dycks and walls covered in green french silk , would go on for ever
my dears , in the real downton , the current chatelaine does nât even have a lady âs maid
but now , instead of tinkling bells , estate staff are summoned by the crackling walkie - talkie her ladyship carries in her hand
here , amid her six dogs , her horses , her staff and her husband , countess of carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme
she was fiona before she married geordie , the queen âs godson and soon to be eighth earl , 16 years ago
while her husband runs the estate , the jolly , sporty 52 - year - old has become the face and force of the real downton , in charge of monetising the legacy from the popular tv show
in this , she has been enormously successful , writing two best - selling books about previous carnarvon wives ; almina and catherine
countess of carnarvon gives the impression of a woman who reigns supreme , much like dame maggie 's dowager countess of grantham she also gives talks all over the world
in texan next month , the socialite lynn wyatt is hosting a champagne highclere tea where texan fans of downton can meet the countess over cake , all for the price of a Â£ 440 ticket
no one , least of all the couple themselves , imagined that downton would be so successful
who indeed , but shooting began this week on the sixth downton series
itv director peter fincham has told her that he wants downton to go on for 18 years
after all , before downton hit our screens , the carnarvons admitted that their estate needed Â£ 11.75 million of repairs , including Â£ 1.8 million of urgent work on the main house
â on sleepless nights , she roams the highclere corridors , and likes to sleep in her son âs bed when he is at boarding school
countess of carnarvon first met her husband at a dinner party where they bonded over a love of world war i poetry
highclere castle , the english stately home in hampshire , provides the ravishing setting for downton it âs far more likely that the carnarvons were two slightly broken people who made each other complete
they married in february 1999 and had their son edward in october ; a honeymoon baby for a gilded life
in life it is not what you take , it is what you give that matters most
