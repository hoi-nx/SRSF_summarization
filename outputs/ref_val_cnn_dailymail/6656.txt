the police should not become a ' scapegoat ' for the disappearance of three uk schoolgirls who have fled to syria to join isis , cameron said today
the prime minister insisted politicians , parents , communities and schools all had a responsibility to stop well - educated young uk joining the brutal regime
his warning came ahead of the family of schoolfriends shamima begum , 15 , kadiza sultana , 16 , and amira abase giving evidence to mps about what they say are failures by the police
the prime minister insisted politicians , parents , communities and schools all had a responsibility to stop well - educated young uk joining the brutal regime police spoke to the three girls just months before they disappeared and found ' no evidence ' that they had been radicalised officers were deployed to the school as part of counter-terrorism and anti-radicalisation measures after another teenage girl from bethnal green academy in east london fled to join isis
' but let 's be frank about this , when you have got educated uk schoolgirls at an outstanding school in greenwich finding it somehow attractive to get on a plane to travel to syria to go and live in a country where gay people are being thrown off buildings and uk citizens are being beheaded , and appalling brutality is being meted out , we have a problem , clearly , that has got to involve all of us - politicians , parents , communities , schools
' kadiza sultana 16 , amira abase 15 and shamima begum 15 are feared to have travelled to syria via turkish the families of the girls have blamed failings by the police for their disappearance last month prime minister cameron dismissed as ' nonsense ' the suggestion that jihadis like emwazi had been radicalised by their contact with security services
the girls ' families have called for an apology from metropolitan police commissioner , sir bernard hogan-howe after it emerged that letters were given to the girls to hand on to their parents , rather than being sent directly to them
the letters were sent to inform parents their children had been friends with a pupil who went to syria weeks earlier and asking for permission to take formal statements
' what is going wrong when girls at an amazing school somehow want to give up all uk offers in terms of freedom and democracy and choice and opportunity ? i 'm not saying our society is perfect , but you can come from anywhere and make it to the top of uk
we 're an amazing country - why do people want to give that up and be part of an appalling brutal death cult ? ' that goes to a big question about our country that we 've all got to answer , not just the police
' last month turkish accused the uk authorities of for being too slow to inform it about the three london schoolgirls who travelled to turkish en route to syria
turkish 's deputy prime minister bulent arinc said he hoped the girls would be found , but that it would be uk , not turkish , to blame if they were not
foreign secretary philip hammond spoke to turkish 's foreign minister on saturday about what action can be taken to stop would - be jihadists from western countries crossing the country 's border with syria in order to sign up with islamic state
' parents have responsibilities , schools and community workers have responsibilities , as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators
