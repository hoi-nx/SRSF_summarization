if you âre a saturn , it âs time to reset your clocks because it âs been discovered that a day lasts just 10 hours , 32 minutes and 45 seconds - seven minutes shorter than previously thought
scientists in israel have revealed a new estimated rotation speed for the ringed planet ( shown )
previously it was thought to rotate in 10 hours , 39 minutes and 22 seconds
but new figure of 10 hours , 32 minutes and 45 seconds is more accurate
mercury : 58 days and 15 hours venus : 243 days earth : 23 hours , 56 minutes , 4 seconds mars : 24 hours , 39 minutes , 35 seconds jupiter : 9.9 hours saturn : 10 hours , 32 minutes and 45 seconds uranus : 17 hours , 14 minutes and 24 seconds neptune : 16 hours , 6 minutes and 36 seconds the new method , though , provides what might be the most accurate reading so far
alternative methods such as measuring saturn âs radio emissions or wind field , or tracking the planet âs clouds , had only served to increase uncertainty and resulted in a rotation period of between 10 hours and 32 minutes and 10 hours and 47 minutes
verifying the method with jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to saturn and come up with the revised estimate scientists used measurements of the ringed planet âs gravitational field combined with its shape and density , some of which was gathered by the cassini spacecraft in orbit ( artist 's illustration shown ) â the alignment of saturn âs magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period , â said planetary scientist dr ravit helled of tel aviv university
â here we report a period of 10 hours 32 minutes 45 seconds ( plus or minus 46 seconds ) based upon an optimisation approach using saturn âs measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles
