' watford boss slavisa jokanovic hopes he can lead the club to the premier league next season slavisa jokanovic is the fourth man to be put in charge of watford during this campaign and joined them in october unforgiving is befitting of a championship promotion race that has nine teams still vying for a premier league place with seven games remaining
the next week is a defining moment with watford second in the table and facing rivals derby county and middlesbrough in their next two matches
the fact watford are there at all is testament to the former chelsea midfielder when you consider he is their fourth coach of the season

eight days later , after a win and a draw , owner gino pozzo called for slavisa jokanovic , who had won two doubles with partizan belgrade and the thai premier league with muangthong united
' for me , it was just a great opportunity ; a small door opened to a big chance

he is tall , lean , ruggedly handsome and has a disarming charm when he talks passionately about his desire to return to the premier league
he was frustrated in the transfer window as the pozzo principle is more about work than spending , often making players fit between their three clubs watford , granada and udinese
he says bournemouth are the best team in the league but believes he has four good strikers who can make a difference
his regret , you sense , is that the premier league did not see the best of him

' although he confesses watford 's ' rocket man ' is not on his ipod playlist , slavisa jokanovic will occasionally watch his favourite robert de niro film , the gangster epic once upon a time in america , and is reading sir alex ferguson 's autobiography as he sources extra motivation
' you always need to improve and find an edge so it makes sense to look at the man who won the premier league more than anyone else
' whether it is admiring the neighbours or his reading material , slavisa jokanovic is certainly looking in the right direction
if slavisa jokanovic can secure watford 's return to the top flight , it will be their first appearance since 2006 - 07
