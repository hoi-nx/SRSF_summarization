parents who publicly revealed they were traumatised when they were handed the wrong baby by maternity ward nurses after their son was born , have been slammed on social media
samantha stuhlener gave birth to baby levi at st vincent 's private hospital in the inner city melbourne suburb of fitzroy in january , but was handed another child to hold before nurses noticed the mix - up 45 minutes later
while some commenters have sided with the upset parents of the young boy - who have complained they have struggled to bond with their son who they say is often unsettled - others had harsh words for mrs samantha stuhlener
perhaps the reason the child was not settling is because the mother was n't focussing on him , instead of focussing on what she did n't have - a measly 45 minutes
on tuesday the samantha stuhlener family told their story , revealing that the proud parents were horrified to discover that they spent 45 minutes with another couple 's baby , after a nurse mistakenly brought another child to them from the ' settling room '
