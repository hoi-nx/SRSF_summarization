murray emerged the 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 winner after an hour and 22 minutes and was left awaiting either colombian 's santiago giraldo or dutchman robin haase
murray cruised past american donald young during the second round of the miami open the british no 1 won in straight sets in the soaring heat as he booked his place in the next round murray was largely untroubled by donald young who struggled to force the scot into unforced errors it was a comprehensive enough performance , although there was the odd lapse of concentration against a player whose own level tends to undulate sharply
murray and donald young shake hands after the straight sets win to put the scot into the third round murray , who now plays hard hitting colombian baseliner santiago giraldo , said afterwards : ' i 've played well against him the last couple of times
