sanchez has made a blistering start to life at arsenal , racking up 18 goals , 10 assists and countless plaudits in his first few months in england
sanchez has been suffering a bit of a drought since mesut ozil returned to fitness sanchez has not scored a goal for arsenal in his last seven games , providing just one assist in that time the gunners forward has been vital to their form this season , but does not look at his best at the moment a hamstring injury , which ruled sanchez out of games against aston villa and tottenham , seemed to stall his season , but there are also concerns about the 26 - year - old 's role in the team since the return from injury of mesut ozil
gunners fans had hoped that when mesut ozil and sanchez , arsenal 's two most expensive players ever , played together , arsene wenger 's side would find another gear
sanchez has not scored a goal with mesut ozil on the pitch since october 1 , and the gunners win percentage with their two stars playing together is worryingly far lower than when one is absent
sanchez celebrates scoring against stoke city in early january , his last goal for the club the chilean has scored 18 times since his move from barcelona , but none since january 11 sanchez celebrates after scoring against manchester city , but he generally struggles when mesut ozil plays in the world cup - winning playmaker 's absence , sanchez had been operating as arsenal 's no 10 , with a license to drift all over the pitch and run at the defence
but mesut ozil has slotted into that role , with great effect , shunting arsenal 's best player this season out to the left wing
sanchez celebrates with santi cazorla , who has recently moved to a deep midfield role , to great effect sanchez has hit the buffers after storming start to his career in north london mesut ozil has been in superb form since coming back from injury and slotting into the no 10 role mesut ozil 's playmaking , including both assists in a win over everton , has spurred arsenal onto a winning run in fact he has managed a shot on target every 102 minutes , a poor return compared with the rest of the season , where he had worked the goalkeeper every 57 minutes
it is not just sanchez 's position that has changed with mesut ozil 's return , but also the shape of the team
francis coquelin 's emergence as a quality holding midfielder has allowed arsenal to change their system arsene wenger has played mesut ozil in the middle , leaving sanchez to help out in a lightweight midfield arsene wenger needs to find a way of getting his two stars to play well together as arsenal push for a top - four finish since mesut ozil returned , santi cazorla has moved into a deep - lying midfield role to glorious effect , freeing up mesut ozil to drift around the midfield picking his passing
for now , it is a system that appears to be working - while sanchez 's stats falter , arsenal have been in decent form since mesut ozil 's return , the aberration against monaco aside
