a chimpanzee who was allegedly left isolated in a ' hellhole ' for years has finally found romance after being rescued and re-homed
keepers at the 150 - acre save the chimps in fort pierce , florida , say it was ' love at first sight ' when 32 - year - old iris clapped eyes on 40 - year - old abdul last month
she had reportedly been kept alone in a ' tiny , barren , and dark cell ' for three years
the look of love : apparently iris and abdul have been inseparable and heartwarming footage shows the pair lovingly kissing each other after being transferred to the save the chimps facility , iris was given immediate treatment
a few days later , when vets had given her the all - clear , she was introduced to her next - door neighbor , abdul
former home : in march 2015 iris was retrieved from a roadside zoo in georgia following an undercover peta investigation - this shot allegedly shows her former cell distressing state : with virtually nothing to do , iris reportedly resorted to smearing her own feces on the walls of her enclosure and spent most of her time huddled under a dirty blanket the inhabitants munch their way through around 1,300 bananas each day
peta is currently seeking legal action against iris ' previous owners for animal cruelty
