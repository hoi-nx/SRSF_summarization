cook is not the sort to wash his dirty linen in public so for the england captain to launch a barely concealed attack on tuesday on the management who sacked him before the world cup is little short of astonishing
cook 's words in abu dhabi , where he will play for mcc against yorkshire on sunday , will send shockwaves through an england hierarchy desperate to pick up the pieces from their disastrous world cup when they go to the caribbean next month
not least , they will concern under - pressure coach peter , who insisted in australia that cook was ' over ' his world cup omission but who must now wonder if his relationship with his england captain is seriously damaged
england one - day captain cook was removed from his post in december last year england endured a disappointing world cup campaign and were eliminated at the group stage batsmen : ( player , age , tests , county ) cook , 30 , 109 , essex jonny bairstow , 25 , 14 , yorkshire gary ballance , 25 , 8 , yorkshire ian bell , 32 , 105 , warwickshire jos buttler , 24 , 3 , lancashire adam lyth , 27 , 0 , yorkshire joe root , 24 , 22 , yorkshire jonathan trott , 33 , 49 , warwickshire all - rounders : adil rashid , 27 , 0 , yorkshire ben stokes , 23 , 6 , durham bowlers : james anderson , 32 , 99 , lancashire stuart broad , 28 , 74 , nottinghamshire chris jordan , 26 , 5 , sussex liam plunkett , 29 , 13 , yorkshire james tredwell , 33 , 1 , kent mark wood , 25 , 0 , durham cook made no attempt to hide the hurt he has felt back home on his buckinghamshire farm while england floundered so badly under his replacement morgan that they could not even make the last eight
' i think you saw in australia the dangers of making such a big decision so close to a tournament , ' said cook of his sacking on the brink of the world cup
from there you just have to win three games in a row â that 's how this world cup has worked
they made decent progress in test cricket last summer but that has been virtually invalidated by the crushing inadequacy of the world cup squad â and cook knows it
cook believes hindsight has proved the ecb wrong to remove him as captain before the tournament ' the test team was in a good place , ' said cook
' cook ( right ) feels england have to rebuild the feelgood factor that followed test success against india cook ( left ) will lead england in three tests in the west indies in april , before new zealand visit in may cook feels the ecb have highlighted the perils of changing captain so close to an international tournament morgan 's england captaincy came under particular scrutiny during the poor world cup performance cook did not mention morgan by name but there is little doubt that he proved a desperate disappointment as england 's one - day replacement captain
the irishman also spoke such gibberish in public that he ended up saying he had ' no regrets ' over the worst world cup in england 's history
whether he retains the one - day leadership remains to be seen but he has done himself few favours by insisting he will miss england 's next one - day international against his native ireland in dublin so that he can play in the indian premier league
cook may not have been able to arrest his own slump in form before the world cup but history will now say that england did not improve by ditching him after backing him as one - day captain for three and a half years
now attention is back on cook for a three - england tour of the west indies next month that is crucial if peter â along with managing director paul downton and national selector james whitaker â are to keep their jobs until this summer 's ashes
' there 's pressure on him , ' said cook
