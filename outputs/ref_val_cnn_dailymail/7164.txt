astronomers have captured four images of the same exploding star nine billion light years away as it performed an incredible cosmic illusion
in doing so , they have confirmed an effect predicted by einstein 's general theory of relativity 100 years ago
the hubble snapped the surprising multiple images with the help of a galaxy cluster that acted as a natural magnifying lens
the powerful gravity of a galaxy embedded in a massive cluster of galaxies in this hubble image is producing multiple images of a single distant supernova far behind it
both the galaxy and the galaxy cluster are acting like a giant cosmic lens , bending and magnifying light from the supernova behind them the supernova could be seen because its light took different paths around the cluster located between the exploded star and the earth - orbiting telescope
einstein predicted this when explained how huge objects bend space - time to create what we experience as gravity
they say the latest images could help refine their estimates of the amount and distribution of dark matter in the lensing galaxy
dark matter can not be seen directly but is believed to make up most of the universe 's mass. by chance , the supernova , which exploded about nine billion years ago , was aligned with the intervening galaxy cluster being used during a hubble observation period in 2011
they say the latest images could help refine their estimates of the amount and distribution of dark matter in the lensing galaxy
the light from the supernova will fade as the explosion tapers off , but due to additional warping of its light by the galaxy cluster , astronomers expect a re-run
' but we think the supernova may have appeared in a single image some 20 years ago elsewhere in the cluster field , and , even more excitingly , it is expected to reappear once more in the next one to five years , ' he added
' the supernova 's various light paths are analogous to several trains that leave a station at the same time , all traveling at the same speed and bound for the same location
similarly , the supernova images do not appear at the same time because some of the light is delayed by traveling around bends created by the gravity of dense dark matter in the intervening galaxy cluster
' our model for the dark matter in the cluster gives us the prediction of when the next image will appear because it tells us how long each train track is , which correlates with time , ' said professor rodney
measuring the time delays between images offers clues to the type of warped - space terrain the supernova 's light had to cover and will help the astronomers fine - tune the models that map out the cluster 's mass. ' we already missed one that we think appeared about 20 years ago , and we found these four images after they had already appeared , ' professor rodney added
' the galaxy cluster focuses the supernova light along at least three separate paths , and then when one of those light paths happens to be precisely aligned with a single elliptical galaxy within the cluster , a secondary lensing effect occurs
the dark matter associated with the elliptical galaxy refocuses the light into four more paths nine billion light - years away , a galaxy 's gravity is projecting a distant supernova onto the sky forming what 's called an einstein cross ( shown by the yellow points )
