last month , my husband and i took our daughters to a columbia women 's basketball game
we live nearby , had already attended a men 's game and were excited for our girls , one of whom plays basketball , to watch college women in action
only a handful of people were there , quite a contrast from the nearly packed house for the men 's team
sure , the columbia women 's team has n't had a great season for years -- and this year was n't much different
how to super bowl # likeagirl a few weeks later , the princeton women 's basketball team did something no other ivy league men 's team had done before , racking up 30 wins and zero losses during the regular season and beating the ivy league season record of 28 - 0 held by the 1970 - 71 penn men 's team
) the princeton team garnered national headlines , which was great , but i still wondered what it was going to take for women 's sports to get the same attention as men 's sports -- meaning an equal number of fans , tv rights , marketing endorsements , you name it
the average salary for a wnba player is $ 72,000 , which does n't include bonuses and benefits , while the average salary for an nba player is around $ 5 million , or about 70 times what the average female basketball player makes
the final four teams for the men 's ncaa basketball tournament got front page attention in monday 's new york times
i met hogshead-makar , a three - time olympic gold medalist in swimming , during a spectacular and inspirational women 's conference in jacksonville , florida , last week called generation w , where i moderated panels on issues affecting women
why has coverage of women 's sports stopped post-olympics ? more than 40 years after the enactment of title ix , a law that says that any school receiving federal funds can not discriminate based on sex , there are still huge disparities , she said , with men getting $ 190 million more per year in college athletic scholarships than women
' " hogshead-makar , who is chief executive officer of the advocacy group champion women , said even though title ix requires that women get the same access to media and support that men get , it 's not happening
knight , a member of the u.s. olympic hockey team , called the findings " disappointing " but said women 's sports is still young , with title ix only a few decades old
knight admits the changes in women 's sports might not come during her hockey career but says she believes they will eventually come , especially as more women play the game
" what i think is gaining traction is an awareness of female athletes in general and recognition of their strength , skill and determination -- and that yes , this has some effect on the popularity and growth of women 's sports programs , " said yulo , creator of the blog princess free zone
" girls ' and women 's sports are growing in popularity as participation increases , said slaner larkin , chief executive officer of the women 's sports foundation
slaner larkin points to u.s. women 's soccer star alex morgan , for example , who has over 1.5 million followers on twitter , and how the upcoming women 's world cup in canada is a trending topic worldwide
" these women identify as athletes and women 's sports fans , and they will now pass down their experiences to their daughters , " she said
" money will go to women 's sports as soon as an audience wants to watch women , so the best way to support women athletes is by attending women 's sports in the first place
" furjanic of chicago said he and a friend took their young daughters to a depaul university women 's basketball game for valentine 's day for the third year in a row
" in my humble opinion , any father who does n't take their young daughters to watch women 's sports ( at all levels -- grammar school through pro ) is missing a chance to expose their children to the opportunities that await them , " said furjanic , whose daughter is 7
" long - term , parents taking kids to women 's games and women 's teams promoting themselves in schools has to be helpful to establishing widespread popularity , generations at a time
" hogshead-makar , the former olympic champion , told me about a case she recently learned about involving dramatically unequal facilities for the women 's softball and men 's baseball teams at a public high school in indiana
