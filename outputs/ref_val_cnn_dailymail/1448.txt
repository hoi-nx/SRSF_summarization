london mayor boris johnson has hit out at the ' human rights ' group who claimed british was to blame for jihadi john 's murderous actions
he tore into controversial campaigner qureshi today branding suggestions british authorities caused the isis killer 's radicalisation ' 100 % the wrong way up '
the outspoken mayor then added : ' if you 're a human rights group then you should be sticking up for the human rights of those who are being beheaded in syria and northern iraq
after widespread condemnation of the group and their comments , the london mayor took on qureshi , the group 's leader , today
qureshi called into mr boris johnson 's radio show on london 's lbc radio this morning , claiming his defence of emwazi had been ' unfairly represented '
but mr boris johnson refused to go back on his previous criticism of the group and slammed mr qureshi 's claims
' they should be the object of your wrath , not the security services who are trying to keep us safe
' families of the victims of isis killer jihadi john ( pictured ) - unmasked last week as west londoner emwazi - have also slammed cage 's comments , branding emwazi ' a monster ' mr boris johnson said the group 's claims sent out the completely wrong message , adding : ' if you 're going to have an impact on the lives of young muslims you have to focus on what these people are doing wrong and not instantly scatter blame around
' mr boris johnson , who looked furious on a video of the broadcast filmed in the studio , replied : ' i just feel that you 've got it 100 % the wrong way up
reg henning , brother of british aid worker alan henning who died at the isis executioner 's hands , said : ' if he 's a " beautiful , kind man " , why is he killing innocent civilians ? ' he 's a monster
