the u.s. will have to negotiate with syrian president assad for a political transition in syrian and is exploring ways to pressure him into agreeing to talks , u.s. secretary of state kerry has admitted
washington has long insisted that assad must be replaced through a negotiated , political transition , but the rise of a common enemy , hardline militant group islamic state , has evidently softened the administration 's stance towards him
syrian 's civil war is now into its fifth year , with hundreds of thousands killed and millions of syrian displaced
' what we 're pushing for is to get him ( assad ) to come and do that , and it may require that there be increased pressure on him of various kinds in order to do that , ' the secretary of state said
new problem : the u.s. has been more willing to deal with assad since the rise to power of isis in syrian and iraq opposition : assad 's regime is under attack from rebel soldiers , such as those above , as well as isis 's hordes ' we 've made it very clear to people that we are looking at increased steps that can help bring about that pressure , ' he added
and i am convinced that , with the efforts of our allies and others , there will be increased pressure on assad
syrian sank into civil war after a peaceful street uprising against four decades of assad family rule began in march 2011
assad seems more likely to survive the syrian crisis than at any point since it began
