scotland 's long - term plan to abolish the airport passenger duty tax completely could significantly harm england 's already suffering smaller airports , revealed a report from mps
a report from the house of commons transport committee said the success of the uk 's smaller airports are being held back by the existence of the apd , one of the world 's heftiest departure taxes
and when apd is charged at both ends of a trip the tax ' incentivises airlines and passengers to fly from airports located in other eu member states ' , said the mp 's report
the scottish government 's plans to abolish the airport passenger duty could harm england 's airports the scottish government wants to reduce apd by 50 per cent in the next term of the scottish parliament and eventually get rid of it altogether in a bid to win the country 's airports a ' competitive advantage '
however , there is no such commitment to axing apd in the rest of the uk , despite a decision by the chancellor to abolish apd payments on children 's tickets back in december
a spokesman for the campaign a fair tax on flying , d'alfonso , welcomed the report and called on the rest of the uk to follow scotland 's lead
' we welcome the committee 's report highlighting the detrimental effect that apd has on smaller airports , and the committee 's recognition that a lower level of apd in scotland will have a negative effect on the rest of the uk , ' mr d'alfonso said
however , a cut in apd in scotland needs to be matched by a cut in apd across the rest of the uk , so that no part of the country is disadvantaged in any way
' a report from the house of commons transport committee said the success of the uk 's smaller airports are being held back by the departure tax , which is one of the largest in the world the report warned that if apd is scrapped in scotland - the wheels are already in motion with the tax being devolved to holyrood - ' airports in england would be subject to a similar competitive disadvantage to that currently experienced in northern ireland '
plans to exempt children from apd , announced in the autumn statement of 2014 , was ' a marginal change which did nothing for business travellers and little for smaller airports ' , the report added
but the smaller airports sector - which is vital to people and businesses in the regions - is limited by apd
we want to help these airports thrive as part of our long - term economic plan , which is why we launched the regional air connectivity fund to support more new air routes
' we welcome the publication of the committee 's report on smaller airports and we will study their conclusions carefully before responding in due course
