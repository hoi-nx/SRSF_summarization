they had earned a trophy and a promising title shot , but there was an appropriate lack of rejoicing by england on saturday night
the calcutta cup had been retained , but the limitations of the opposition meant that was never in real doubt , despite considerable scots tenacity and occasional artistry
stuart lancaster , his assistants and his squad know that the standards they reached at twickenham will not suffice against the leading rugby nations
england beat scotland but they have n't shown enough to convince yet during the six nations defeating scotland earned chris robshaw and his men a trophy , but they did n't do enough the england squad smile for the cameras having defeated scotland 25 - 13 to win the calcutta cup 1st minute : george sends burrell clear but he ignores anthony watson in space on the right and the door slams shut
15th minute : the pack drive a scrum towards the scots line but billy vunipola is unable to pick up and touch down
54th minute : rampant england swarm into the visitors â 22 but the attempted offload by geoff parling is pinched by blair cowan
62nd minute : mike brown blasts over the scots 22 to score , but the â try â is disallowed due to another forward pass in the build - up â this time by james haskell
while the red rose is now planted at the top of the six nations table , even shambolic france may be no push - overs in the tournament finale at twickenham next saturday if there is not a sharp up - turn in english precision
â if you look at the all blacks , when they create a line break they usually end up scoring , â said stuart lancaster
â we created 12 line breaks , which is a huge positive because i have nât seen any team pull scotland apart like that , but to only come away with three tries is frustrating
there is a recurring concern for england
the tone was set on saturday by burrell , who did nât manage to pass to the unmarked anthony watson on the scots 22
george got england off to a perfect start in the second - half but the first half will have worried them exeter wing nowell crosses over to score england 's third try and send them top of the six nations table the saints player was not the sole offender , with nowell at fault for ignoring support more than once
it may seem churlish to criticise the exeter wing , who was dynamic and dangerous , but england urgently need a clinical edge
â it âs that composure after the line break , â said stuart lancaster
â it was good on some occasions because we scored three good tries , but there were also missing elements and we need to fix those for next week
â england must not over-state their satisfaction at mere creation alone
on the latest evidence , their closest world cup pool a rivals wo nât be line - break fodder in the way scotland so often were
tom youngs ( centre ) leads an england breakaway as lancaster 's side returned to the six nations summit anthony watson runs clear but england repeatedly failed to take their chances at twickenham on saturday mike brown was one of the better performers but england spurned too many opportunities at twickenham ben youngs hands off a tackle but the man of the match was n't happy with his team 's overall performance joseph , his club - mate at bath , said : â i have played with george since under 18s and he has always been that kind of player who thrives under pressure and more or less always delivers
â five days from now , england can win the title using their home advantage and the benefit of playing last and by preying on simmering french doubts
