last november , the americans people placed a great amount of trust in gop when they gave them complete control of congress
voters bought the illusion that a gop congress would govern effectively , help the middle class and focus on important issues like jobs and the economy
over the last two weeks , we have seen the congress manufacture , then escalate , a political crisis by threatening to shut down the dhs
by failing to do a full extension of dhs funding â holding it hostage with demands that the legislation roll back the president 's immigration actions -- gop are leaving uncertain the livelihoods of more than 240,000 men and women who proudly serve as employees of the border patrol , transportation security administration and other dhs agencies
the congress seems more intent on bickering with itself , pushing an agenda to help special interests and catering to the most extreme wing of the party , than working for the middle class
