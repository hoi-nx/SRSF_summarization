mark shares his story on channel 4 show nhs : Â£ 2bn a week and counting which aims to show viewers the dilemmas the health service faces when trying to decide who to treat mark , who has been married to wife lorraine for 30 years , has twice been denied weight loss surgery so has applied to the nhs in scotland for a third time
' he admitted he knows people watching will think he does n't deserve to have the operation on the nhs
but in the long run , it could save nhs funds as they would n't have to treat him for diabetes or other health conditions he may develop as a result of his obesity in the future
professor david kerrigan , a bariatric surgeon who treats both nhs and private patients , agrees that weight loss surgery can be cost effective for the nhs
' i do n't care how or why they got it , i know they are at the bottom of a deep hole they ca n't get out of and the surgery offers them an escape
' this surgery is transformative for people 's lives , there are very few operations we do that can achieve that
' the show also interviews other people desperate to be treated on the nhs to show viewers how difficult it can be to decide whose need is greater
