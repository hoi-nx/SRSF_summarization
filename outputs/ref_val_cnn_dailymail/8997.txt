a revitalised fellaini owes his eventful premier league career to a stand - out performance at anfield â the ground he returns to on sunday carrying the champions league hopes of united on his broad shoulders
fellaini was a 20 - year - old with standard liege when his outstanding display against steven gerrard in a 2008 champions league qualifier persuaded toffees to buy him 19 days later for a club record Â£ 15million
he became a cult hero at goodison park for the next five years before signing for united in 2013
now in his second season at old trafford and used mainly as a striker by louis van gaal , he is in the best form of his united career and scored and made an assist in last weekend 's 3 - 0 victory against tottenham
fellaini fired united into the lead against tottenham with a smart finish the belgian trains ahead of united 's crucial clash with liverpool on sunday , where he is sure to be involved fellaini has grown from a bit - part player last season to become a vital member of louis van gaal 's squad round , assistant - manager to david moyes at toffees and united and who worked with fellaini at both clubs , recounts how it all began
' fellaini had been on toffees 's radar for a while
' david moyes asked me to go and watch him play liverpool at anfield and he was very impressive
a lot of players would have been dominated in midfield by someone like steven gerrard in his own stadium but fellaini competed and gave as good as he got
' when david moyes asked my opinion , it was positive and the club signed him in what was a big deal for them given their finances at the time
' former toffees assistant round watched fellaini play against liverpool for former club standard liege round gave the midfielder a glowing reference to david moyes who sanctioned a Â£ 15m deal to sign him fellaini became one of the most instantly - recognisable figures in the english game with his huge hair making him appear even bigger than his 6ft4ins frame

' a protracted transfer from toffees to united was finally completed in the summer of 2013 for Â£ 27million after david moyes and round had been appointed at old trafford to begin the post-sir alex ferguson era
' fellaini followed david moyes to united , but was considered a figure of fun after the disappointing season under the former toffees boss fellaini starred in the 3 - 0 win over liverpool at old trafford in december , and offers van gaal an alternative after a nightmare first season in which united finisehd seventh , david moyes was sacked and round left too
