the first of our human ancestors emerged in africa around 2.8 million years ago - 400,000 years earlier than previously thought , a newly discovered fossilised jawbone has revealed
the partially complete lower jaw , which was uncovered in the afar region of ethiopia , is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the homo family
this would make it the common ancestor for modern humans - homo sapiens - and their extinct relatives including homo habilis , homo erectus and neanderthals
the fossilised lower jawbone , shown above with teeth still in the bone , was found in geraru in ethiopia scientists say the fossil , which is known as ld 350 - 1 , is recognisably human but also has more primative features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the homo family
researchers who have digitally reconstructed the jaws of other ancient human ancestors say the fossil also matches what they would expect from this common ancestor
they had brains no larger than a chimpanzee 's 2.8 million years ago - ld 350 - 1 appeared and may be the first of the homo family 2.7 million years ago - paranthropus , lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing 2.3 million years ago - homo habalis first thought to have appeared in africa 1.8 million years ago - homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record 1.6 million years ago - hand axes become the first major technological innovation 800,000 years ago - early humans control fire and create hearths
brain size increases rapidly 400,000 years ago - neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across europe and asia 200,000 years ago - homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in africa 40,0000 years ago - modern humans reach europe the discovery , which was found in the ledi - geraru area of afar region , has put a new date on the emergence of the first ' man ' from our more ape - like ancestors
dr brian villmoare , from the university of nevada , las vegas , helped lead the fossil hunters , said : ' in spite of a lot of searching , fossils on the homo lineage older than two million years ago are very rare
' ld 350 - 1 reveals that many of the anatomical patterns we see in 2 million - year old genus homo were established much earlier in the evolution of the genus
' at 2.8 million years ago we see relatively evolved homo traits in combination with other much more primitive anatomical features
details of the australopithecus are best known from a fossil named â lucy â , dating back 3.2 million years , which was discovered in ethiopia in 1974
but exactly how homo habilis had appeared was unclear due to a huge gap in the fossil record
scientists say it can provide important clues to the changes in jaw and teeth that distinguished members of the homo family from those belonging to australopithecus
until now the earliest evidence of the existence of the first homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million year old fossils
other fossils of antelope , prehistoric elephants and hippos discovered alongside the jawbone suggest that this early homo species lived in open grassland and shrub habitats
' the new fossil has helped fill a huge gap in the evolutionary history ( above ) of how the homo family appeared another study published in the journal nature has also provided convincing evidence that ld 350 - 1 was a common human ancestor to the homo family
the image on the right shows an early reconstruction of genus homo hablis at the westfã¤lisches museum for archaology in herne they found that the ancestor of homo habilis would have had features similar to those found in the fossilised jawbone ld 350 - 1
' this reconstruction of the jaw of homo habilis by the ucl team shows that it was more primitive than the jaws of homo erectus or homo sapiens and was more similar to the jaw of australopithecus afarensis dr simon underdown , an anthropologist at oxford brookes university , said the discovery of ld 350 - 1 could help scientists unravel the complex beginnings of our own species
