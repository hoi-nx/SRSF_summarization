autism is mainly caused by a child âs genes , a major study of britain twins has found
controversial research linking autism with the mmr jab has been widely discredited , but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution
the team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins , who share all their dna , and non-identical twins , who have only half their genes in common ( file picture ) with cases of autism much more common today than in the past , many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles
but the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics
the team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins , who share all their dna , and non-identical twins , who have only half their genes in common
they found the condition was far more common in identical twins than in non-identical ones
controversial research which linked autism with the mmr jab has now been widely discredited ( file picture ) dr francesca happe told the bbc : â our findings suggest environmental factors are smaller , which is important because some parents are concerned whether things like high pollution might be causing autism
â this large population - based twin sample is significant because it helps us to understand much more about the role genetics play in autism and opens up the possibility of whole families gaining a better understanding of a condition they may share
â the study looked at 128 pairs of twins in which at least one sibling had an autism diagnosis , between the ages of 12 and 14
