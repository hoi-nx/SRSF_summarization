just as i ca n't travel to liverpool without thinking of the beatles , so i ca n't travel to los angeles without thinking of the beach boys
their songs of beaches , baggies , boards and bikinis painted a picture of a sun - kissed paradise , and their voices sounded as bright and as laid - back as california itself
this time i was travelling specifically to discover the people and places that inspired the band
their songs sounded as bright as a sun - kissed paradise , their voices sounded as laid - back as california itself i started in hawthorne where the three wilson brothers-brian , carl and dennis - were raised , and joined up with guitarist jardine and vocalist mike love to form a group
the rest of the street remains though , its neat lawns , porches and fluttering flags reminders of the group 's clean - cut all-american origins
a redbrick memorial now stands at the site of the wilson house , with a bas - relief frieze showing the group carrying a surfboard and a plaque noting that the music conceived here ' broadcast to the world an image of los angeles as a place of sun , surf and romance '
hawthorne is indeed a place of sun ( 263 days a year ) but no surf and little romance
hawthorne boulevard , with its low - rise jewellery shops and furniture stores , is no place for the young
the pizza show added a splash of colour when it arrived in 1956 and became a home from home for the fledgling the beach boys
i started in hawthorne where the three wilson brothers-brian , carl and dennis - were raised , and joined up with guitarist jardine and vocalist mike love to form a group now run by the son of the original owner , it retains its kitsch medieval italian interior , with wrought iron chandeliers , tiled awnings and mock grilled windows
foster 's freeze , another gathering place , is a blue - roofed fast - food outlet that offers food from one service hatch and ice cream from another
the beach boys came back to play the 1969 prom and honoured the institution in their song be true to your school
the nearest surfing beach to hawthorne is manhattan , but the best is huntington beach , better known as surf city usa
here the sand is soft , the surf is year - round , and the broad beaches stretch for more than eight miles
other than dennis wilson , the beach boys were famously non-surfers , but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning ocean - side culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it
the sports shops sell everything from boards and wetsuits to sunglasses , caps and jeans
from the pier i could watch them mounting their boards and waiting patiently to ride in on the most powerful of the tall , grey waves
as if on cue , a local surf music tribute band , the breakaways dressed in faded blue denims and short - sleeved hawaiian shirts , began playing at the pier entrance
as a 15 - year old schoolboy in 1961 he 'd composed a hit tune called mr moto for the bel-airs
other than dennis wilson , the beach boys were famously non-surfers , but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning ocean - side culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it when the beach boys adopted this sound the hard - core sports crowd initially shunned them
' when the beach boys started recording their focus shifted from hawthorne to hollywood
the beach boys ' earliest albums were recorded at capitol but by the time of surfer girl and little deuce coupe , they were also recording around the corner at united and western ( 6050 sunset boulevard )
several the beach boys ' albums , including smiley smile , wild honey , 20/20 and surf 's up , were partially recorded here , while charles manson , a fringe figure on the los angeles music scene in 1969 , visited to tape songs that he 'd written
in songs such as little deuce coupe , shut down , little honda , and fun fun fun , the beach boys explored the parallel teenage subculture of cruising and hot - rodding
spread over two spacious floors , there are plenty of cars from the era the beach boys celebrated - a peach - coloured 1957 lincoln premiere once owned by jayne mansfield , a black 1957 chrysler , and a wonderful boat - sized 1959 red cadillac convertible
there 's probably no road that better embraces the joys of los angeles - steep hills and canyons to one side , broad beaches and ocean to the other on my final day i headed north on the pacific coast highway to malibu
there 's probably no road that better embraces the geographical joys of los angeles - steep hills and canyons to one side , broad beaches and ocean to the other - and no drive is better suited to a the beach boys ' soundtrack
maybe that 's why the beach boys came here - and why they kept their shirts and jeans on during the shoot
