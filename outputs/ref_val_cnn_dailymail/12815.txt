as a person - of - color , african-american , veteran minority journalist and longtime enthusiast of all things " daily show , " i am of course as happy , proud and thrilled as the wife of a successful apollo astronaut over the impending ascension of trevor noah , the biracial comedian from south africa , to stewart 's anchor chair on what 's believed by many to be the most trusted half - hour of news and information in america
as a person who believes in fair play and equal opportunity for all , i am also moved to wonder when a woman will get the chance to preside over a talk show after sunset ? look
indeed , in pushing forth both trevor noah and wilmore , the writer , comic and erstwhile national black correspondent for " daily show , " to preside over both halves of comedy central 's much - coveted 11 p.m. - to - midnight bloc , stewart is acknowledging what the mainstream of the country truly is : i.e. not as pale - faced as it once thought it was
still , one does wonder what happened to the groundswell of support building among " daily show " constituents for jessica williams , a three - year veteran of the show and an early favorite for stewart 's spot after he announced last month he was leaving
jessica williams , who is black , tweeted back to her supporters her grateful opinion that she was " extremely under - qualified for the job
" maybe , but what about samantha bee ? she 's the " most senior correspondent " for " daily show " and is taking her penchant for performance artistry and provocation to tbs , where she 'll create her own satiric news franchise
there was even less buzz about the stewart opening than colbert 's a year ago , during which time there were many willing to say that now was the time to finally give a woman a shot at late - night tv for the first time since the late joan rivers ' fox network effort , " the late show " came in 1987 -- and went in 1988
