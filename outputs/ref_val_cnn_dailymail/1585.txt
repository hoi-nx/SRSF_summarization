drinking coffee may reduce the risk of cancer in heavy drinkers , research has found
for each cup consumed a day , there is about a 14 per cent decreased risk of liver cancer , found the study by the world cancer research fund
but although the research found strong evidence that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of the disease , the report did not recommend the amount that should be drunk
the report comes after research published by the same team in 2013 found drinking coffee reduces the risk of womb cancer
the world cancer research fund ( world cancer research fund ) report warned that while coffee might protect against the effects of alcohol abuse , just three alcoholic drinks a day can be enough to cause liver cancer
the increase in risk per 10g of alcohol consumed â around one alcoholic drink â is about 4 per cent , says the world cancer research fund
the review also found a strong association between obesity and liver cancer and that physical activity and fish consumption may also decrease the risk of liver cancer , although more research is needed before any firm conclusions can be reached
the world cancer research fund 's continuous update project reviewed global research into the relationship between diet , weight and physical activity , and liver cancer
risk : previous research has shown alcohol to be strongly linked with a range of cancers , including liver the world cancer research fund recommends women should try to limit their alcohol intake to one drink per day and men to two
to prevent weight gain , if you want to have a coffee , it âs wise to choose unsweetened versions with skimmed or semi-skimmed milk , according to the world cancer research fund
but when it comes to liver cancer risk , although there âs strong evidence that coffee may be beneficial , it 's not clear why , says the charity
she added : ' to help reduce the risk of getting alcohol - related liver cancer , it is best to drink within the lower - risk guidelines of 2 - 3 units a day for women , that 's a 175ml glass of 13 per cent wine , or 3 - 4 units a day for men , a pint and a half of 4 per cent beer
