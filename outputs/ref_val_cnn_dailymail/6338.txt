â another local said : â do nât think i âll bother paying to go to center parcs or butlins any more ! â the site has five â transit â pitches for short stays and eight permanent plots with a living room , sanitary facilities , a patio and parking for two caravans and two cars
he said : â it is a vast improvement but the question is could it have been done cheaper ? â carrswood view has been developed on the site of an illegal encampment in bath which had become run - down and full of rubbish the illegal site was full of discarded rubbish and gas canisters , and councillors hope the new development will give them more control each utility unit has been built in wood and have a roof which will be covered in grass to minimise the impact of the green belt development tim warren , of the opposition tory group on bath , said : â it âs absolutely beautiful , however , is this the best use of taxpayers â money ? i âm also not convinced this is the final figure
