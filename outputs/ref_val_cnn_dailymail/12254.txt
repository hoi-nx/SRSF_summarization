a lawsuit that 's stirring concern among drinkers of some california wine starts with a history lesson
the deaths of napoleon bonaparte , simon bolivar , king george iii , king faisal i and other prominent figures have been attributed to arsenic poisoning , the first paragraph of the 30 - page complaint says
and , now , drinkers of some california wine have become " unwitting ' guinea pigs ' of arsenic exposure , " thanks to the negligent and misleading actions of dozens of california wineries , according to the class action complaint filed march 19 on behalf of two california couples
the lawsuit does not include any allegations of physical injury or death due to arsenic consumption associated with drinking the wines named in the complaint
the plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a court order requiring the defendants disclose on the bottles the risks of consuming inorganic arsenic in wines and engage in " corrective advertising " regarding their conduct
even the maker of trader joe 's charles shaw zinfandel varietal ( affectionately known among fans as " two - buck chuck " ) , was called out for allegedly failing to warn consumers that it contained " dangerously " high levels of inorganic arsenic
but should consumers start looking to other winemakers or other wine - producing states for gallon - sized bottles of zinfandel ? or is the lawsuit a fearmongering tactic being used to drum up business for the beverage - testing company used for the lawsuit , as some defendants and industry insiders have insinuated ? most of the defendants said their wine was safe to drink when contacted by cnn
others referred cnn to the wine institute , a california trade group that called the claims " false and misleading
" " we are concerned that the irresponsible publicity campaign by the litigating party could scare the public into thinking that wine is not safe to consume , which is patently untrue , " said the group , which represents 1,000 california wineries , including 10 of the defendants
the lawsuit alleges that three separate labs " skilled in arsenic testing " independently confirmed that the defendants produce wines containing " dangerously " high levels of inorganic arsenic , in some cases up to 500 % more than what is considered acceptable
" put differently , " the complaint states in bold letters , " just a glass or two of these arsenic - contaminated wines a day over time could result in dangerous arsenic toxicity to the consumer
and we hope the winemakers will take these findings just as seriously and work to make sure their wines are safe , " spokesman rob feldman said
without seeing the lab results , experts suggest reserving judgment based on the following issues to arise from the lawsuit : arsenic is found in air , soil and water throughout the world
" plants take up trace amounts of arsenic from the soil , and we have been ingesting these trace amounts for all of human history
generally , these amounts are at levels well below that associated with either acute or chronic toxicity , " said cornell university 's sacks , director of undergraduate studies for the viticulture and enology program in the college of agricultural and life sciences
arsenic occurs in inorganic and organic forms
the first time the fda set limits for arsenic levels in food or drink was in 2013 , when it proposed to limit the amount of inorganic arsenic in apple juice to 10 parts per billion
according to the lawsuit , inorganic arsenic makes up the " overwhelming majority " of arsenic in wines at issue , despite the winemakers ' ability to limit inorganic arsenic through " responsible winemaking procedures " and " sophisticated testing equipment
even though the fda has not established a standard for acceptable levels of arsenic in wine , california wine exports are tested and found to be below the established limits for export , holmes said in an email
countries that import california wine also test for arsenic using their own standards : 100 parts per billion in canada and 200 parts per billion in europe -- 10 to 20 times higher than the drinking water limit in the u.s.
