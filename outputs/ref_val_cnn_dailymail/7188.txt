even by their own self - proclaimed standards , this sunday on sky had the prospect of being even more super than normal
a top of the league clash and a cup final saw everybody from the channel involved on the day setting their alarms alarming early , and making their way to wembley
and it was neil ashton who opened proceedings with a special sunday supplement from sky ' studio high in the stands
there he welcomed among the guests a new face on the team here , oliver holt
and early in the discussion , ollie proved most prophetic in discussing the game that would take place below them later in the afternoon
with a cup final and a top league clash it was always likely to be a super sunday that lived up to its billing philippe coutinho scored a fantastic goal for liverpool in sky 's first game of the day from anfield he acknowledged the league cup was probably ' bottom of the league for top clubs '
next up it was goals on sunday , during which chris kamara very nearly scuppered the super
a very entertaining paul robinson then told us about a previous tottenham visit to wembley under juande ramos , before which the usually circumspect boss had arranged a team ' stag do ' , complete with ' archery , a mock casino ... and a shed load of cheese toasties ' , during which time kammy had made his way to the chelsea dressing room
there was even a great chat with chelsea kit man gary who explained that john terry took his captain 's duties so seriously , he was like ' a second kit man '
another welcome guest was gary neville on sky ' co-commentary who , it has to be said , did n't have much nice to say about his neighbours from up the m62
what 's more , he carried on not saying it
time to head back to wembley , where host simon thomas and his excellent trio of jamie redknapp , glenn hoddle and thierry henry not only had the run of wembley , but also a seeming age to fill before kick off
john terry fires the ball home via a deflection off eric dier to put chelsea in front at wembley after the game at sky headed back to wembley to see tottenham 's failed quest for the league cup gary neville was critical of manchester city after their ' embarrassing ' defeat to liverpool at lunch time for their cup final coverage sky put together a team of glenn hoddle , thierry henry and jamie redknapp glenn hoddle kept thierry henry focused on football as the ex-arsenal man put in his best peformance since joining sky luckily , though , the boys decamped at kick - off to the studio where the day had begun
where as the game got under way , things started to get back to nudging super
all of which was certainly aided at the final whistle by the frequent images we saw of a surprisingly uninhibited chelsea gaffer , who even managed to take a fall - yet still retain his pride
' i 've never seen him so happy ' , said jamie redknapp
what 's more , i think this was also the best we 've seen of thierry henry since his formal arrival at sky
with the insightful experience of glenn hoddle on one side , and the encouraging cajoling of jamie redknapp on the other , thierry henry was sharp , punchy and keen as mustard to talk football
with jamie redknapp steering him through from a ( thankfully ) fully functioning tv monitor , his dissection of diego costa 's goal was nigh on a masterclass
