such a procedure would cost around Â£ 15,000 at a private clinic she is now waiting for a green light from nhs bosses so that she can have an operation to remove the saggy skin from her waistline
' despite her struggles with low confidence , miss sarah lord said she has gained a lot of positives
she said : ' i feel much more freedom in my movement and my daughter bryony looks up to me
unfortunately , while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat , the skin can not retract
doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy â but all over the body
factors that affect how much skin is left include age , how quickly the weight was lost ( gastric bands are slower than bypasses , for example ) , and , for women , the number of children she has had
