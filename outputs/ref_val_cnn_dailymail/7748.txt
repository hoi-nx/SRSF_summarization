one of at least four airmen captured by al qaeda militants after their syrian air force helicopter crash - landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric
the pilot , who was captured near jabal al-zawiya in idlib province , is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi abdullah al-muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle
al-muhaysini , who has long been affiliated with al qaeda - linked groups in syrian , suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the syrian regime releases notorious jihadi abu mus'ab as - suri , who is wanted in spain for suspected links to the 1985 el descanso and 2004 madrid bombings
al-muhaysini 's primary demand is that the syrian regime release abu mus'ab as - suri - a notorious al qaeda linked militant who was arrested in pakistan in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland
aleppo - born as - suri - who holds spain citizenship remains a wanted man in spain on suspicion of taking part in the islamic jihad organization 's 1985 bombing at madrid 's el descanso restaurant , which left 18 dead
