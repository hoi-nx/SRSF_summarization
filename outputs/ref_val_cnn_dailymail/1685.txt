a 20 - year - old air force satellite has exploded in space , adding 43 pieces of space junk to earth âs orbit , reports have claimed
the explosion happened on 3 february due to a sudden temperature spike , although the event has only just come to light
however , talking to mailonline , nasa and esa said the catastrophic event posed no significant risk to other satellites in earth orbit
a us air force satellite has exploded 500 miles above earth 's surface
an unknown ' temperature spike ' caused the explosion of the defense meteorologicalsatellite program flight 13 ( dmsp )
this has resulted in 43 new pieces of debris in earth orbit the previously unknown incident was revealed by space news , after posing questions to air force space command
one major source of debris in the past was a chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere
in 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a us communications satellite and a defunct russian military probe over siberia
exactly what has happened to the satellite , though , is still not clear , with the temperature spike remaining a mystery
this was followed by ' an unrecoverable loss of altitude control ' , before pieces of debris were then spotted in the vicinity of the satellite - suggesting it had partially exploded
this was followed by ' an unrecoverable loss of altitude control ' , before pieces of debris were then spotted in the vicinity of the satellite - suggesting it had partially , or completely , exploded ( stock illustration shown ) six other dmsp satellites are in orbit , while a seventh is scheduled to launch in 2016
the air force played down the significance of the event , and said that the loss of the satellite - which had been retired to a back - up role - would not be detrimental to any of their operations
â because this satellite was no longer used by the national weather service or the air force weather agency , the impact of the loss of this satellite is minimal , â the air force told space news
â however , the main fear from such an event is the increase in the amount of debris into earth orbit
previous explosions in orbit , most notably the accidental collision of a us iridium satellite and a defunct cosmos satellite in 2009 , have released hundreds of pieces of debris into orbit
this latest explosion is not thought to pose a significant risk , though but speaking to mailonline , nasa and esa played down the risk of any potential issue
' dr krag noted that the explosion occurred above 500 miles ( 800km ) , where few other satellites were in orbit
indeed , esa âs closest mission is cryosat-2 , at an altitude of 450 miles ( 720km ) , so dr krag said they â do not expect any meaningful risk increase due to this event
