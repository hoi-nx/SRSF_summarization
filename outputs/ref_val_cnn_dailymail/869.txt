durst 's lawyer has dismissed his clients apparent confession during the final seconds of hbo 's the jinx docudrama and said the unguarded comments could be interpreted in a 100 different ways
of course , ' durst was heard to mumble to himself
there is speculation that durst 's explosive comments could be used against him in court , but attorney deguerin said they prove nothing
' there 's one hundred ways of interpreting it ... one of ' em being very shakespearean
he said he first heard durst 's recorded comments ' along with the rest of america ' when it was broadcast last sunday
deguerin , the lead attorney on durst 's team , has compared his client 's apparant confession to a shakespearean soliloquy and claims that it could be interpreted in a hundred different ways the lawyer also said that it is well know that durst talks to himself and ' that 's just one of his quirks
... my daughter 's a journalist , and she was outraged at what andrew jarecki and his producers pulled
' deguerin also said he was ' astonished ' that durst was interviewed by los angeles prosecutors for three hours without his lawyer present after his arrest last saturday
' bob is not sophisticated , he is intelligent , he 's got asperger 's , ' said deguerin explaining why his client had n't simply refused to speak until he had his counsil present
deguerin filled court papers on friday in which he claims durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in california , as well as drug and weapons charges filed in new orleans
in the papers filed at the state criminal district court in new orleans , gibbens and deguerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep durst jailed
... they 're gon na find nothing , ' deguerin , the lead attorney on durst 's team , told ktrk-tv
deguerin also accused andrew jarecki , the director of the jinx , right , of setting up durst ' i think louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie
the documents blasted the arrest , which the attorneys say was orchestrated ' to coincide with the final episode of the hbo docudrama the jinx
durst 's arrest came shortly before the hbo finale about his links to three killings â that of his first wife , who disappeared in new york in 1982 ; berman , the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared ; and a 71 - year - old neighbor in texas whose dismembered body was found floating in galveston bay in 2001
however , durst 's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge
after the killing , durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap galveston bay , texas , boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001
while legal experts said durst 's remarks off - camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible , prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing
