cavendish has issued a typically blunt assessment of the circ report into past practices of doping and suggested lance armstrong 's charity return to the tour de france ' could be done in a different environment '
circ was established to investigate whether the uci , cycling 's world governing body , was complicit in past doping practices , such as the lance armstrong affair , which saw the american stripped of his seven tour de france titles and banned for life
cavendish says there were few revelations in the circ report the 25 - time tour de france stage winner said the report was ' all the s * * * that 's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document ' cavendish , speaking after announcing he 'll compete in august 's prudential ridelondon-surrey classic , said : ' to be brutally honest , i do n't really think there 's anything new in there
cavendish does n't see much use in the report , commissioned by new uci president brian cookson cavendish did not confirm if he had read the report in full or just the media dispatches which followed its publication earlier this month
asked if he felt the report represented the views of the modern peloton , cavendish said : ' absolutely not
lance armstrong ( left ) plans to return to the tour de france , the event for which he was stripped of seven titles due to doping , as part of a charity ride with former footballer geoff thomas geoff thomas is riding the tour de france route one day ahead of the professional peloton , which includes cavendish , to raise funds for charity and has invited lance armstrong to join him
cavendish said : ' there 's no denying what lance armstrong did for charity ; he did work a lot for charity
