a different kind of weather by waldegrave at the start of the falklands war in 1982 , waldegrave , then a junior minister in thatcher âs government , was standing in the division lobby of the house of commons when he saw thatcher and her entourage of â toadies â marching towards him
he felt compelled to say something , so , with the americans secretary of state alexander haig at the time trying to broker a british â sell - out â to the argentinians , he asked : â where do the americans stand , prime minister ? â â i do nât know , waldegrave , â came the immediate reply
â would that david cameron could deal so unequivocally with the white house , but then none of thatcher âs successors have , least of all the pusillanimous blair , whom waldegrave compares with heath
thatcher ( right ) is once said to have fought off norman tebbit ( left ) with a snarling remark in waldegrave 's defence this is surprising , for waldegrave was a passionate heath loyalist before transferring his allegiance to thatcher
but he is surely right when he asserts that heath âs great disappointment in life was that the patriotic , liberal tory in which he believed so fervently â â he and it were family â â did not return his devotion
and in that respect waldegrave is reminded of blair , who â genuinely thought â and thinks â that he created a family called new labour which loved him â
getting back to heath , he recalls one of the old curmudgeon âs dinner parties â â not occasions of much merriment â â at which soames gamely tried to enliven proceedings with an anecdote about her brother nicholas , who had just been selected to contest a tough seat in glasgow
at a raucous selection meeting , very unlike anything in the home counties , the prospective mp had been grasped by the lapels and asked , â are ye married ? â around heath âs table , the diners waited expectantly for the end of an amusing story , but soames suddenly and mystifyingly stopped speaking
driving her home later , waldegrave asked if she âd forgotten the punchline ? â no , â she said
â i was on autopilot and got that far without remembering that after nicholas admitted to being unmarried , the response was : â och , not another tory poofter ! â â she had nât wanted to offend her illustrious host , whose sexuality was always the subject of speculation â though waldegrave adds that in relation to the scotsman âs allegation , it was not â as far as anyone i ever knew could discover , true â
waldegrave âs own background differs markedly from those of two of his tory heroes , heath and thatcher , if rather less from that of another , the grouse - shooting enthusiast harold macmillan , whom he recalls silencing another dinner party , this time at waldegrave âs own house , by turning to his neighbour and declaring : â such a pity they abolished the gold sovereign , you know
what does one tip one âs loader ? â waldegrave 's privileged background was very different to that of his tory hero , thatcher ( pictured ) the seventh and youngest child of an earl , directly descended from king james ii , waldegrave is himself the very definition of a toff
and he grew up privileged not just socially and materially but also intellectually
for those of us who do not come from such lofty beginnings , there is something beguiling yet also appalling about the upper - class milieu waldegrave describes so well
â from an early age , waldegrave âs ambition was to rise to high political office
the path ahead looked gilded when he became mp for bristol west in 1979 , and thatcher did eventually make him health secretary
from an early age , waldegrave 's ambition was to rise to high political office , thatcher ( pictured ) liked him and eventually made him health secretary as british âs representative on the european environment council in 1984 , waldegrave had tried to force british leyland into taking the dangers of pollution more seriously
it is more a reflection on a fascinating life than an account of it , and waldegrave is an astute observer of the political animal , noting that the current mayor of london has more than a little in common with the late willie whitelaw
