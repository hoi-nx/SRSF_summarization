early results are said to be ' exciting ' but the full findings must wait until funding can be found to complete the research
the research , being conducted at cardiff university , is being led by the former drugs tsar david nutt
professor david nutt was sacked from his job as the government 's chief adviser on drugs in 2009 after saying saying ecstasy and lsd were less harmful than alcohol
at a briefing in london this week , he spoke out against restrictions on research on recreational drugs which he called ' the worst censorship in the history of science '
having been turned down by ' classic funders ' , he is now campaigning to raise the Â£ 25,000 needed to carry out analysis of the brain scanning data from the science crowdfunding site walacea.com
he compared current attitudes to studying recreational drugs with the catholic church 's clampdown on pioneering italian astronomer galileo galilei in the 17th century
' the only comparable example is when the catholic church banned the telescope in 1616 , ' said professor david nutt , who is based at imperial college
in the controversial study , 20 british volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on lsd ' i would n't say that it 's a dangerous experiment , but i would say that lsd has potential negative effects
' he said there had been no evidence of psychedelic drugs such as lsd triggering psychosis in research studies , although there were anecdotal reports of this occurring through recreational use
professor david nutt said lsd was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating ' many conditions ' , in particular alcoholism
' that is an absurd amount of censorship , ' professor david nutt added
he stood by the claim that got him into trouble with the government - that psychoactive drugs such as ecstasy and lsd were considerably less harmful than alcohol
' interesting drugs that we 've been researching like mdna ( ecstasy ) and lsd , are relatively low in terms of harms , considerably less even than cannabis and very much less than alcohol , ' he said
initial funding for the lsd study came from imperial college and the beckley foundation , which promotes drug policy reform and research into the medical benefits of psychoactive substances
professor david nutt said lsd ( a molecule of the drug is pictured ) was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating ' many conditions ' , in particular alcoholism professor david nutt said he approached the medical research council and wellcome trust for the outstanding funding to no avail
' dr carhart-harris said : ' this is the first lsd brain imaging study that 's ever been conducted
' we think it 's essentially important to understand how these drugs that are widely used and seem to have this therapeutic potential work in the brain
