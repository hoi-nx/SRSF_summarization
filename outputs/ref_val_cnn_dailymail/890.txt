paul gambaccini : no charges were brought men accused of rape and other sex crimes should remain anonymous until they are charged , mps demand today
they have urged a shake - up of the law after several high - profile figures were arrested and named , only to see their cases dropped
in january , tory mp mark pritchard called for those accused of rape to be allowed anonymity until they are charged after an accusation against him was dropped by police
they said that if predatory paedophiles such as rolf harris and stuart hall had been granted anonymity as suspects , other victims may not have come forward to help convict them
lifelong anonymity is granted to anyone who complains to police that they have been sexually assaulted
in may 2010 , the coalition vowed to reintroduce anonymity for rape suspects after it was dropped in 1988
but ministers faced huge opposition to the idea and axed it
it concluded that because of the stigma attached to rape accusations , it was unacceptable for suspects to have their identities publicised before they were charged
critics say other victims may not have come forward if predatory paedophiles such as rolf harris , pictured left , and stuart hall , pictured right , had been granted anonimity â it is inexcusable that information about suspects is released to the media in an unattributed way
