scientists have found that english speakers struggle to identify and describe odours compared to other languages
i 'm getting blackberries and thistles : the english language is not the best for describing odours say scientists researchers found those who use english as their first language can take five times as long to describe an odour than they can a colour
however , native speakers from the jahai tribe in perak , malaysia , described odours far more consistently and in less time than they can a colour
the jahai have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the maniq , a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern thailand , have 15 words
the findings suggest english speakers appear to have lost the ability to accurately describe smells
professor asifa majid , who led the work at the centre for language studies at radboud university in nijmegen , in the netherlands , said : ' our findings show that the long - held assumption that people are bad at naming smells is not universally true
' professor majid has found that the english language has few specific words that are capable of describing smells
most of the time english speakers have to rely upon the source of the smell as a description - using words like fruity or lemon
in a study published in the journal cognition , professor majid asked 10 english speakers and 10 native speakers of the jahai to describe colours and odours
they found that when describing the odours , there was little agreement among english speakers when describing the odours
the jahai use 12 abstract words to describe odours ( shown , left ) in the same way they do colours ( right ) in many western societies , smell has become a largely under - used sense
for example when presented with a cinnamon odour , english speakers described it as spicy , sweet , candy , smoky , wine and pot pourri
however , the jahai were found to use a series of succinct terms to describe the smells , such words that mean to ' smell edible ' and ' to have a bloody smell that attracts tigers '
however , while abstract words were dominant among the english speakers when describing colour , they used source based descriptions
when describing smells , english speakers , for example , most often resort to source - descriptors , such as like a banana or fruity , but even these descriptors are not applied accurately
' it is unclear exactly why english speakers have lost the ability to describe smells accurately , but vision has become the predominant sense in almost all human cultures
in a recent study published in the journal of cognitive linguistics , professor majid and her colleagues found that english speakers use specific words for vision and hearing but have few for the other senses like touch , smell and taste
