at the beginning of february 2012 , a spate of injuries forced the knicks to promote a little - known basketball player called lin to their starting roster
lin had looked as though he was destined for a career as a journeyman
he was struggling to make it to the big time
kane 's meteoric rise continued on friday when he marked his first england game with a goal kane headed in england 's fourth against lithuania shortly after replacing wayne rooney kane 's progress is reminiscient of lin 's form when he was playing basketball for the knicks lin propelled the knicks to a winning streak but failed to recapture his form after sustaining an injury by the end of the first week , celebrities were flocking to courtside at madison square garden to catch the buzz
you get the point ? well , you would have done if you had been at wembley on friday night , heard the deafening , rumbling cheer that rolled around the stadium when kane ran on to make his england debut and witnessed the scenes when , 79 seconds later , he scored with a far - post header
â it âs nice when fairytales come true , â said the england manager hodgson afterwards , beaming into the camera
â it âs incredible really , â wayne rooney said of kane âs impact
late on friday night , the bbc displayed a map of the world showing where social media reaction to kane âs goal had been at its height
the yellow dots showing maximum interaction were spread from england to indonesia to mexico to japan and brazil
wayne rooney ( right ) praised kane 's impact with tottenham and now at international level kane wheels away to celebrate scoring for england against lithuania at wembley on friday kane was sent on loan to a number of football league sides before breaking through to the tottenham side this is a kid who was shunted around the lower leagues to leyton orient , millwall , norwich and leicester while tottenham tried to work out what to do with him and whether he was good enough to make the grade with them
this is a kid , an english kid , a local north london kid , whose meteoric rise has coincided with immigration leaping to the top of the political agenda and concerns about the proliferation of foreign players and owners in our leagues
when tottenham fans sing that kane is â one of our own â , their boast represents not just a celebration of his talent but a lament for a time when they could identify more closely with the players they were watching
in an age where teams are being taken away from the fans , kane represents a reconnection
riding along on kane âs coat - tails , fa chairman greg dyke has quickly and adroitly tapped into those fears and prejudices and seized the moment to propose that every premier league club should have 12 home - grown players in its 25 - man squad
kane is at the centre of all this but as he walked triumphantly from the pitch on friday night , the next question is how long can he maintain this trajectory ? is this his natural orbit , is he here to stay or is this , like linsanity , some brief enchantment ? the media , of course , is already being accused of building a kid up just so it can knock him down but kane is fortunate that in his club boss , mauricio pochettino , and hodgson , he has two managers who will shepherd him wisely
but on the other hand , i am rather hoping i have got kane for a long period to come and i do nât want to be the one who throws him in and he flies too close to the sun. â did the england manager give any thought to the idea that kane might fall back into the shadows ? â i suppose when someone has shone quite so brilliantly , that is always in the back of your mind , â hodgson said
hodgson believes that kane will be able to maintain his astonishing standard of form kane is in line to feature for england in a friendly against italy in turin on tuesday england manager hodgson is pleased with how kane is being handled at tottenham by mauricio pochettino â i still think it is prudent for mauricio pochettino and myself , as the england manager , not to stand here in front of you singing his praises
the kane train is setting off for turin on tuesday , full steam ahead
