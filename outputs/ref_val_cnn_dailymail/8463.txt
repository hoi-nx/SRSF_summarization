it has been described by guests as a night spent living like the flintstones
ambitious farmer , charles cole , 49 , has hand - built a primitive wooden roundhouse in devonshire , which comes complete with a six - ton thatched roof to protect guests from rain
mr charles cole had dreamt of creating the b&b since he was a teenager , after watching a bbc documentary of a small community recreating an iron age settlement
the walls were made by mr charles cole and his son hedley , 25 , who trained with the royal marines and featured on channel 4 's royal marines commando school bare essentials ! switch off from the busy world , and enjoy a simple night stay in devonshire - but do n't expect a luxurious experience ! all the furniture in the roundhouse was made from mr charles cole 's 214 - acre farm
all members of the family helped out on the project , which had been mr charles cole 's dream since he had been a teenager although it is a iron age roundhouse , many guests have said they felt it is similar to fred and wilma 's home in the 1960s cartoon , the flintstones the hut took mr charles cole , his wife iona , 42 , and their children hedley , 23 , lizzie , 21 , may , 18 , and charity , 14 , six months to build , which is a total of 2,500 man hours historic roots ! allegedly the land which the roundhouse sits on today was home to the dumnonii people who inhabited the area from at least the iron age up to the early saxon period mr charles cole admitted feeling anxious that the wooden structure would fill up with smoke from the fire
although guests will be experiencing primitive living , it will set them back Â£ 170 a night to experience life as a bedrock resident
inspiration for the home came from a fly on the wall documentary called living in the past on the bbc in 1978 , where a small community recreated an iron age settlement a fear the family had in recreating their homes was ventilation and there were concerns the smoke from the fire would fill the roundhouse , thankfully the smoke passes through the thatch , allowing meals to be cooked on the hearth the painstaking reconstruction of an iron age roundhouse was achieved by charles cole in the heart of the devonshire countryside the whole family helped out , including daughter lizzie , ( left )
