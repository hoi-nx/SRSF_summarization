hill house independent junior school was rated ' inadequate ' in every single category by ofsted inspectors the former prep school attended by charles ( pictured centre , introducing his mother , queen elizabeth to teachers ) could be closed after ofsted inspectors rated it ' inadequate ' in all five areas hill house was also criticised for focusing on getting older pupils to practice entry tests for secondary schools at the expense of teaching them in depth about their subjects
the family run school , which is based at several houses in kensington and chelsea , has previously been described as ' eccentric ' in the good schools guide
a spokesman said ' all options ' remained open , despite the school 's independent status
lily allen is among the school 's famous alumni among the criticisms leveled at the school by inspectors , who visited at the beginning of december last year , was the poor educational attainment by pupils
the report said : ' too few pupils make adequate progress across the school , particularly in writing and mathematics
' behaviour and safety of pupils also achieved a blistering ' inadequate ' rating by inspectors
inspectors highlighted poor attention paid to health and safety
ofsted inspectors rated the school as ' inadequate ' in each of the five categories of leadership and management ; behaviour and safety of pupils ; quality of teaching ; achievement of pupils ; early years provision
the prep school was ranked as inadequate in all five areas that were inspected by ofsted in december a spokesman from the department for education said : ' we have just received a copy of ofsted 's published report following an inspection at hill house international junior school
' it would be wrong to take any decisions until we have studied the findings , but all options remain open - including closure
prince charles is pictured fighting with jim dowdall while at the Â£ 14,000 a year preparatory school the heir to the throne played circular cricket , one of the key activities of the school 's field day ' we have repeatedly demonstrated for all types of school that we will not hesitate to take tough action if required
five years later in 1956 prince charles went to the school - the first time an heir to the throne had attended a school outside the royal household
after his time at hill house , prince charles was enrolled at cheam preparatory school in berkshire and later was moved to gordonstoun in scotland
hill house was founded in london in 1951 while it offers trips to switzerland and sports practice at the duke of york âs barracks in chelsea , as well as compulsory swimming lessons , inspectors were less than encouraged by the way teachers ensure pupils make progress
inspectors also said that because the school measures pupils against its own system of attainment it is not possible to compare this with national achievement of children
the school has already asked the firm capita to report on the school 's health and safety standards and is holding a security audit
' an emergency inspection last may , carried out at the request of the department for education , found the quality of education was effective but the school was failing to meet safety requirements , the evening standard reported .
