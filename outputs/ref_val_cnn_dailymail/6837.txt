pakistan - born bowler ahmed has been tipped to give england a stern examination this summer after being called into western australia 's ashes squad on tuesday
the 33 - year - old , who sought asylum in western australia in 2010 before securing residency two years later , is one of 17 players selected for both the five - ashes test series and a preceding tour of the west indies
ahmed took 48 wickets during victoria 's triumphant sheffield shield campaign , catching the eye of national selector marsh , who feels the spinner can make life difficult for england 's batsmen when the ashes series starts in july
ahmed celebrates after taking eight wickets for victoria in the sheffield shield final last week ahmed bats for victoria during the sheffield shield final with western australia in hobart ' him being a leg - spinner as opposed to a finger spinner gave him a slight advantage , ' marsh said at a press conference organised to announce the squad

one - day specialist glenn maxwell , named in the international cricket council 's team of the tournament following sunday 's triumph over new zealand in melbourne , made only 41 runs and failed to take a wicket against pakistan in his last test appearance for the baggy green back in october
' adam voges , seen here playing for western australia , has been selected after an excellent season glenn maxwell has not been picked in the squad despite helping western australia to world cup success while fast bowler ryan harris is included , he will remain in western australia throughout the tour of the west indies , which begins in dominica on june 5 , as he anticipates the birth of his first child
new south wales wicket - keeper peter nevill is included in a test squad for the first time after scoring 764 runs throughout the sheffield shield campaign
ryan harris has been selected but will miss the tour of the west indies prior to the ashes ' peter nevill has been on our radar for some time and deserves his opportunity through weight of runs and performances behind the stumps , ' said marsh
' we believe this squad has sufficient depth for these important test matches against the west indies and england and will give us the best chance of success
