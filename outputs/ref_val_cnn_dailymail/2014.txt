supermarkets have been accused of ' bully boy tactics ' by offering their suppliers bank loans instead of swiftly settling their debts
chains including morrisons and m&s have introduced schemes that delay the payment of invoices to small businesses that supply them with goods
the suppliers have to wait up to a month longer to have their bills honoured , but if they can not hold on this long , the supermarkets offer them access to credit from a bank
supermerket chains have introduced schemes that delay the payment of invoices to small businesses meaning many farmers will face a cashflow crisis critics say such schemes force small firms to pay through the nose to get money that should have been handed to them promptly in the first place
under arrangements introduced late last year , most of the supermarket 's suppliers have been persuaded to wait 90 days for their invoices to be paid , a month longer than previously
the bank can give suppliers their money sooner in the form of a loan lloyds earns interest charges , morrisons keeps the cash it owes in its coffers for longer â and the firms pay to get their money
a morrisons supplier , who wished to remain anonymous , said it is the latest example of big business using ' bully - boy tactics ' to make an extra profit
mr orford said : ' there is a growing trend for large businesses to use supply chain finance to extend payment times and pass the cost of credit down to their suppliers
2 a year into the contract the supermarket says it is keen to work with the supplier for another 12 months â but rather than settle the invoice monthly it would prefer to hang on to the cash for longer and delay payment to 90 days
one supplier , who asked for anonymity , said morrisons and others are being opportunist introducing the schemes at a time when interest rates are low
morrisons ' deal with lloyds allows the supplier to receive payment earlier if they pay interest at 0.75 per cent above the libor benchmark rate , currently 0.27 per cent , meaning a charge of 1.02 per cent
other grocers offer similar schemes , but they are not tied to suppliers agreeing a lengthening of payment terms
m&s increased the waiting time for suppliers before their bills are settled from 60 days to 75 for clothing and ' general merchandise ' in 2013
food suppliers wait between 19 and 39 days
