for $ 89 , self - styled entrepreneur waring will ship you 6 pounds of boston - area snow in an insulated styrofoam -- enough for 10 to 15 snowballs , he says
" we will not ship snow to any states in the northeast ! " says waring 's website , shipsnowyo.com
with more than 45 total inches , boston has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history
according to boston.com , it all started a few weeks ago , when waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in manchester-by-the-sea , a coastal suburb north of boston
he joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states , and an idea was born
he also has begun selling a 10 - pound box of snow for $ 119
many of his customers appear to be companies in warm - weather states who are buying the snow as a gag , he said
