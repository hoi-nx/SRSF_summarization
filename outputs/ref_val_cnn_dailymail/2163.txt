a mother - of - one has argued that parents should be doing more to teach their children about sex following the news that pupils as young as 11 will be taught the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools
education secretary nicky morgan said the proposed lessons ( which schools and parents can choose to opt in to ) will better prepare pupils for life in modern britain
if anybody needs to be having sex education lessons it 's parents
' children are seeing " pop porn " from rihanna and nicki minaj and we need to be telling children in schools - if anything at all about sex education - that 's it 's about relationships and respecting yourself
anna williamson , 33 , a childline counsellor , believes it 's never too early for children to talk about sex ' we are thrusting them into this sexualised world when we do n't need to
' she added on the issue of teaching the difference between rape and consensual sex in schools : ' we should not be normalising this for children
' however , tv presenter anna williamson , 33 , from london , who is a childline counsellor , said she believes it 's never too early for children to talk about sex education
' we know at childline that there is a deficit ( in sex education ) between the ages of six and 11 so these children do n't have the tools and the know how - or where to ask for help - or to know what is wrong
' she said that having a proper syllabus is vital to keep children safe and to stop them being misinformed and then spreading myths about sex in the playground
under nicky morgan 's proposal , pupils are to be taught from the age of 11 about the difference between rape and consensual sex
the two women debated the issue raised by education secretary nicky morgan with tv presenters phillip schofield and amanda holden the lessons , which could come in as soon as after the easter holidays , will be based on a series of resources being developed by the pshe association
the sex education lessons will be based on a series of resources being developed by the pshe association nicky morgan has said ' it 's our duty to ensure that our daughters leave school able to navigate the challenges and choices they 'll face in adulthood ' thousands of this morning viewers took to the show 's facebook page to join in the debate
carla pointing said she agreed with anna williamson 's points and welcomes the move to change sex education in schools
if they do n't know , then how will they speak out about it ? ' but samantha roythorne thinks 11 is too young for children to be taught about rape
she said : ' how can an 11 - year - old process the feelings and emotions that go along with this conversation , we moan about the state our country is in yet we give children responsibilities and emotions they ca n't deal with and wonder why they are stressed , self harming and having mental health problems it 's ridiculous ! they are only children for a short time lets let them be innocent !
