the unusual vehicle , which also features a rather flimsy looking safety fence , was last spotted making its way along the swale between the isle of sheppey and kent coast
unusual sight : the pensioner has now taken to the water in a floating caravan , seen in recent days chugging along down the swale between the isle of sheppey and kent coast puzzled locals , who have watched the bizarre contraption in disbelief , said the owner is a keen boatman in his ' 70s or 80s â and lives in nearby sittingbourne
â and fisherman trevor ryan , 63 , added : â he bought the catamaran and then he fitted the caravan on it and launched it from iron wharf boatyard
close - up : the caravan has been fixed to the base of a catamaran fitted with a small engine - and while there is a flimsy - looking fence around the vehicle , there are no other obvious safety measures â he is about 70 or 80 years old and he has got a few yachts and boats in the harbour but for some reason he has obviously built this caravan
