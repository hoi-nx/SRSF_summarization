police say there is little that can be done against a man who made a nazi salute while urinating on a memorial in a former concentration camp
photos of appl , 24 , urinating next to the star of david at the theresienstad concentration , were handed to czech police by a disgusted former friend
but the force investigated have admitted it may be difficult to take legal action against appl , as promoting nazi ideology is not illegal in the czech like it is in neighbouring german or austrian
disgusting : appl was said to be drunk when he was photographed urinating on a memorial in a concentration camp in the czech
he has since denied being a nazi to czech media the pictures were taken when appl was visiting the former camp , situated in the north of the czech close to the german border with jiri , 25
' i knew that he had some questionable ideas but when he started urinating alongside star david and then stood on the wall making a nazi salute i just felt it was going too far , as i handed the photos in to the police ' , he said
' czech media has reported that appl has a nazi tattoo on his arm with the words ' arbeit macht frel ' - meaning ' work makes you free ' , the same chilling saying that was put above the entrance to auschwitz and other concentration camps
salute : appl 's former friend jiri lava handed the photographs to police
