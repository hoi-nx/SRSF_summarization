a prisoner who asked warders for a bible was offered pornographic magazines to help him â get to sleep â , a report has found ( file picture ) the study , for a commission established by the howard league pressure group , said some jails were not providing inmates with condoms to stop the spread of sexually - transmitted infections behind bars
even though sex between prisoners or with staff is not allowed , inmates are supposed to have free access to condoms if they are thought to be at risk of catching a disease
the report said : â one interviewee recalled how , feeling â overwhelmed and nervous â on his first night in prison , he asked the night staff for a bible
â after some time , an officer returned and apologetically explained that he could not find a bible but he could lend instead a selection of pornographic magazines â to help you get to sleep â
the research project found that the availability of condoms to minimise the risk of stis â and the potential for them to be passed on to future lovers in the general population â was varied among prisons
