but the plan was criticised by all sides , with former snp leader alex salmond asking whether david cameron would be jailed at wandsworth for failing to take part
miliband was ridiculed yesterday for his plan to pass a law guaranteeing that television debates will take place in the run - up to future elections he told bbc radio 4 : â could you actually pass a law which says that somebody has to turn up at a tv debate ? â what do you do when david cameron does nât turn up ? shall we stick him in the clink , do we put him in wandsworth ? â labour âs launch of the proposed law was designed to keep up pressure on mr david cameron over his refusal to comply with broadcasters â plans for three tv debates during the election campaign
the plan was criticised by all sides , with former snp leader alex salmond asking whether david cameron would be jailed at wandsworth for failing to take part â otherwise , all we are doing all the way through the campaign itself is talking about the debates
mr miliband said : â in recent days the british public has been treated to the unedifying and tawdry spectacle of a prime minister seeking to duck out of the tv debates he once claimed to support with great enthusiasm
â on bbc radio 4 , mr alex salmond , right , asked : â what do you do when david cameron does nât turn up ? shall we stick him in the clink , do we put him in wandsworth ? â he told the observer that the broadcasters had â made it clear they would not be cowed by his tactics but it is wrong for them and the british public to have governing parties use this kind of pressure in campaign periods
it is time to ensure , once and for all , that these debates belong to the people , not the prime minister of the day
