like 70,000 other refugees from syrian , iraqi , sudan and the palestinian territories , farah ( her name and the others in this article have been changed to protect their anonymity ) now lives with her family in zarqa , a poor jordan city teeming with factories and crumbling apartment blocks
men dominate public spaces , and many women stay at home , isolated
every day she navigates the dangers of zarqa 's crime - ridden streets and ignores sexual advances from men
some 384 female refugees working with the near east foundation have been able to re-establish savings , restore dignity , strengthen their capacity to bounce back and rebuild their lives
they belong to a network of jordan and refugee women -- coaches , mentors and peers -- who lean on each other and offer business and social support , exchange tips and build friendships
some 80 % of the refugees in this network have chosen to invest in building a small home - based business
now she runs her own leather goods home - based business , making belts , wallets and key chains for tourists from the safety of her home
zainab , also an iraqi refugee , is now a hairdresser in zarqa
on the side , she teaches the art of hairdressing to young women , walking alongside them in their first steps to become economically independent
on march 8 , we celebrate international women 's day and the empowerment of women globally -- including the nearly 6 million refugee women and girls who , like farah , fatiya and zainab , continue to adapt to life in their new surroundings with determination , creativity and skill , despite increasingly limited options
aid agencies must match the strength of these women 's resilience
of the 10.5 million refugees registered with unhcr , the un 's refugee agency , less than 1 % are eventually resettled
farah , fatiya and zainab are among hundreds of women who are finding a world of options as they build their vocational skills and financial literacy
to help this network of women control the income they earn , the near east foundation facilitates discussions with male family members about their wives ' and daughters ' newfound roles
we must ensure that beyond immediate aid , women have access to skill - building , financial resources , social networks and protection from violence and harassment , so they have the chance to build their own futures .
