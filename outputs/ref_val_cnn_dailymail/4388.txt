the u.s. could face a shortage of 90,000 doctors by 2025 as it struggles to cope with an older , sicker population and increased demand from affordable care act , a new report has warned
the dire need for doctors , particularly surgeons treating diseases common among elderly people , such as cancer , was revealed by the aamc on tuesday
' the doctor shortage is real â it 's significant â and it 's particularly serious for the kind of medical care that our aging population is going to need , ' said kirch , ceo and president of aamc , which represents medical schools and teaching hospitals across the country
the demand is thanks to the affordable care act ( affordable care act ) and retail clinics , among other factors problem : the greatest shortage will be for surgeons , particularly those treating diseases among the elderly the number of physicians is expected to grow by nine per cent over the next ten years , but the demand for healthcare services could grown by up to 17 percent
it predicted there could be a shortfall of between 46,100 and 90,400 doctors in 10 years ' time and , of these , there could be a shortage of as many as 63,700 non-primary care physicians
' an increasingly older , sicker population , as well as people living longer with chronic diseases , such as cancer , is the reason for the increased demand , ' kirch told the washington post
demands : the aamc , which compiled the report , has called upon the government to pay to train 3,000 more physicians a year in a bid to meet the growing demand ' because training a doctor takes between five and 10 years , we must act now , in 2015 , if we are going to avoid serious physician shortages in 2025
