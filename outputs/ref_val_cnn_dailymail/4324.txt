hidden cameras captured a pod in action as they got ' high ' from nerve toxins released by a pufferfish in waters off southeast africa
in the incredible scene , filmed for a discovery channel special , the sea creatures are seen rolling on their backs with their eyes closed in an apparent state of bliss
as the dolphins drift off into their own world , the weary pufferfish seizes the chance to deflate and slip away into the deep blue
getting in on the act : though large doses of a puffer 's neurotoxinthe can be deadly - 100 times more potent than cyanide - in small amounts it is known to produce a narcotic effect the footage , from dolphins : spy in the pod , was taken by wildlife filmmaker john downer - who has previously used hidden cameras to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television screens
john downer designed underwater cameras disguised as squid , tuna and even other dolphins
' the series , which aired on the discovery channel on saturday , follows the success of penguins : spy in the huddle , which used similar tactics of disguised cameras , documentary producer john downer was eager to create a range of cameras disguised as sea creatures to offer viewers unprecedented proximity to their favorite species
fun and games : to release the substance , the bottlenose dolphins were caught chasing the pufferfish along the ocean floor - in a bid to escape attack , footage shows the fish quickly inflating into a ball shape water polo : the playful dolphins then grab the puffer between their teeth and pass it around until it eventually lets out a burst of poison covert : the footage , from dolphins : spy in the pod , was taken by wildlife filmmaker john downer â who has previously used hidden cameras ( seen above ) to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television screens as well as the dolphincam , the tunacam , turtlecam and squidcam have also been created for different spying roles , with each fitted with hd cameras to capture life under the sea
the pufferfish footage was filmed in waters near mozambique
speaking of the project , john downer said : ' unlike penguin - cams , this time our spy creatures had to keep pace with fast - moving dolphins , often out in the deep ocean
' john downer 's last project , spy in the huddle , took viewers inside the world of penguins by deploying 50 cameras to the arctic for almost a year .
