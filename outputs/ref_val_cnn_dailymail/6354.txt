norwegian air travellers today lampooned ryanair 's plans to offer Â£ 10 transatlantic flights by suggesting they may have to stand , pay to use the toilet or even parachute into us because it is so cheap
the budget airline has announced it plans to fly to new york , boston , chicago and miami from london stansted , dublin and berlin from 2020
the Â£ 10 - a - ticket proposal is part of a wider plan to change its image and ' stop p * * * * * * people off ' because boss o'leary 's schemes to squeeze more money out of passengers left many irate
breaking new ground : ryanair 's directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline offering flights from as little as Â£ 10 but there has also been considerable fun at their expense but despite a largely positive reaction online to the proposed transatlantic expansion , others have also used it to crack a joke at the frugal airline 's expense
some said that ryanair 's new york hub could be in nova scotia , canada , or passengers may have to ' sky dive in and hope you do n't land in the hudson ' so the thrifty company can avoid landing costs
others pondered how much people would be charged for not printing their own tickets , and if the Â£ 10 deal would include any food , leg room , entertainment or any luggage
jason bournemouth tweeted : ' it 's ryanair so new york means , at best , landing in new jersey

the budget airline âs directors have approved plans to start a transatlantic airline as part of an ambitious growth strategy at european âs largest low - cost carrier over the next five years
the airline has set out proposals for one - way tickets costing from under Â£ 10 , although some fares would be much higher
ryanair says it is studying plans to fly between about a dozen european and us cities on a transatlantic service that could start â in four to five years â
ryanair âs chief executive michael oâleary has talked over many years about his dream of setting up a transatlantic airline offering cheap â ten buck â transatlantic fares â with $ 10 currently equivalent to Â£ 6.75
the company said yesterday : ' european consumers want lower cost travel to the us and the same for us coming to european
he has seen it through two decades of extraordinary growth but it is dominated by long - established european and us airlines including british airways , american airlines and , on a smaller level , virgin atlantic , which is in partnership with us âs delta
ryanair âs plan has echoes of 1970s cut - price pioneer sir freddie laker whose cheap skytrain flights to the us transformed transatlantic travel for the masses , until it was effectively killed off by the established airlines , though it inspired sir richard branson to launch virgin atlantic
ryanair has said it would fulfil its long - expressed promise of offering some bargain - basement transatlantic fares at Â£ 10 , but other one - way tickets would be priced from Â£ 99 or more
in november ryanair 's profits soared by 32 per cent and its loud - mouth boss o'leary admitted : ' being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy '
