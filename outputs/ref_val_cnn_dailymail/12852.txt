in the past eight months , isis has seeded itself in some dozen countries around the globe
indicative of this was the announcement on saturday that the nigeria terrorist group boko haram had pledged its " allegiance to the caliph of the muslim , " isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi
the global spread of isis raises key questions about whether these new affiliates signal an intensification of the threat of terror
it also has important implications for the debate in congress over obama 's request for a new authorization to fight isis
lt. col. michael waltz , a united states special forces reserve officer who has just returned to the united states after advising the nigeria ministry of defence in its fight against boko haram , told me , " so far the pledge ( to isis ) seems to be legit
" waltz says there is some debate about the timing of the pledge , because boko haram has recently come under effective attacks by nigeria forces allied with the armies of neighboring african countries that are also threatened by the group : " some folks in the region are saying it 's a sign of desperation , as the regional offensive by nigeria and its neighbors has knocked boko haram on its heels and out of a number of its sanctuaries
" but waltz also says there is some evidence that the boko haram pledge to isis " has been in the works for some time
hilary matfess , a researcher at the nigeria social violence project at the johns hopkins university school of advanced international studies , told me , " boko haram would be the largest group to pledge allegiance to isis , but it 's not certain what kinds of logistical or operational support that isis could provide an african affiliate
" since august , boko haram is one of some 30 terrorist groups that have issued statements of support for isis or have gone further and pledged their allegiance to isis , according to intelcenter , a virginia - based company that tracks terrorist organizations
in addition to boko haram , terrorist groups in afghanistan , algeria , egypt , lebanon , libya , india , indonesia , pakistan , the philippines and yemen have pledged allegiance to isis , according to intelcenter
the increasing globalization of isis raises some interesting questions for the obama administration and for congress
obama 's aumf proposal mentions combating isis in its heartland of syria and iraq , but it does n't mention the dozen other countries where isis now has a presence or foothold
the ball is now in congress ' court to decide how geographically wide the scope of the fight against isis should be
it will be an interesting debate : on one side , those who want to prolong indefinitely what is already united states 's longest war , against jihadist terrorist groups like isis that have affiliates from algeria to afghanistan ; and , on the other , those who want to circumscribe that war both in time and in space
