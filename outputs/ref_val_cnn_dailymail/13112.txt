andreas lubitz , the co-pilot who authorities say deliberately crashed germanwings in french , passed all his tests and medical exams and gave no voluntary indication that he was unstable or mentally ill , lufthansa ceo carsten spohr told cnn thursday
that has n't been used either in this case , so all these safety nets we are so proud of here have not worked in this case , " carsten spohr said
the ceo said he did n't know much more than what has been released by french authorities : the captain left the cockpit , tried to regain access by knocking on the door and " the door was either kept locked or not opened in the way it was supposed to be , and that for sure is a clear indication that the remaining pilot -- the co-pilot -- did n't want the captain to return
american airlines require that any pilot leaving the flight deck be replaced by a flight attendant , so that two people remain in the cockpit at all times , but that 's not the case with all airlines internationally , cnn aviation analyst david soucie said
an 8 - minute descent to death a lufthansa spokesman previously said that the airline complies with all germany and european aviation regulations , something carsten spohr reiterated in his cnn interview
that 's a global thing , most accepted procedure , which we have used at lufthansa for many , many years , " carsten spohr said
