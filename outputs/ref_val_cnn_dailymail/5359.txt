she would have loved to sit down with charlie and now with gabriel to discuss whatever it was that they were studying
and charlie and gabriel will never be able to do that with their mother
they tease her mercilessly , which she plainly adores , calling her a variety of names from glo , to g-dog , g-lo or big g. she said : â what helps to sustain me now is that they âve turned out to be such fine young men
charlie has her wicked sense of humour and gabriel looks so like her
