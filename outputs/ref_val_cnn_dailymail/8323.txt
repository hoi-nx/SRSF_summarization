those who claim britain 's got talent and the x factor humiliate their contestants will be foaming at the mouth when they hear about itv 's latest prime - time saturday night extravaganza
when international illusionist keith introduces an extraordinary new generation game - type tv show tonight , viewers will see what happens when the contestants who are competing to win pots of money are given bizarre instructions under hypnosis
they end up doing the most mind - bogglingly embarrassing things â to the extent that while your toes do curl for them , you have to remind yourself that they have willingly volunteered to make fools of themselves
hypnotist keith with five contestants on itv 's new show you 're back in the room hosted by phillip schofield , itv 's you 're back in the room pits five hypnotised strangers against each other as they take on apparently simple game - show challenges straight out of bruce forsyth 's 70s heyday , such as making balloon animals and doing impersonations of pop stars
the twist that brings it into the 21st century hunger games - style arena is when keith â who 's already hypnotised them â then sabotages their chances of winning by telling them to do the weirdest things
kate , with host phillip schofield , believes her sculpting clay is face cream after being hypnotised ' they were like greyhounds coming out onto the track , ready to accept any suggestion i gave them , ' he says
' but i was a bit worried they might run amok because while phillip schofield is on stage at all times , i 'm not
' hypnosis is about shutting down the conscious mind and re-igniting the unconscious and the imagination , so while i give instructions to them under hypnosis the contestants might interpret those instructions in all kinds of ways
for example , 60 - year - old contestant carolyn was a polite and gentle soul off - camera , but after hypnosis i could get her to do anything
phillip schofield was shocked ! ' another contestant was asked to throw a pizza off stage
that proves just how spontaneous the show is
' every week members of the studio audience who 've come to see the show being filmed are invited to take part in a few tests before the show begins to see which of them are more susceptible to hypnosis â and so who is likely to make a fool of themselves and get the biggest laughs
then five are picked to compete in the challenges onstage
then i get them to imagine they 're at the top of the stairs and to count down , imagining their own choice of colour for the stairs and how many there are as they 're walking down , so that by the time they reach the bottom they 've drifted into a calm hypnotic state
but they 're still in a waking trance , and although they 're speaking and acting normally in this state , keith only has to say the word ' sleep ' and they instantly nod off
' once you 've hypnotised someone once , you can pretty much put them under instantly any time you meet them afterwards , ' says keith
tv chef paul rankin is served dinnerby a hypnotised contestant on the show the instructions he gives them can have astonishing effects
' phillip schofield was sceptical at the outset but he soon realised how real hypnosis is and how it allows people to do things they would n't normally do
after each show he tells the studio audience that he would never have become involved unless he was 100 per cent convinced that everything i do is real
he showed people how they could utilise hypnosis to help themselves become more confident and conquer anxiety , bed - wetting , losing weight and giving up smoking
does this show do that ? that 's not for me to say , it will be up to the viewer to decide
' whether the show will put off people who might have considered hypnotherapy to help themselves we can never know
keith says at the end of each show his final task is to ' de-fry ' , as he calls it , the five contestants and bring them back to normal consciousness
' i remove all the game show suggestions i 've implanted in their minds and replace them with confident thoughts so they can look to their futures in a positive way , ' he insists
' i was told to fall in love with phillip schofield
' those who believe in self - control will watch with their hands over their eyes but phillip schofield , who is no doubt hoping it will get similar sort of ratings to bgt , is convinced it will be a hit
