when she was 11 - years - old , new york girl nicole - who asked that her surname not be published - was given a school assignment to write to a pen pal , with an ad placed in different newspapers calling for people in other states interested in corresponding with the students
norman , a writer from bastrop , texas , came across the ad and responded , subsequently beginning an exchange that would - and continues to - last a lifetime
that was 1996 , and norman - then 61 - and his wife , bobbie , started to eagerly await letters from their young pen pal , nicole , kvue tv reported
finally : nicole and norman have been writing to each other for the last 18 years , but have only just met each other in the flesh in batrop , texas first meal : the two decided to meet for dinner and share their first meal together
one year norman playfully told nicole he wanted either a cadillac or rolls royce for his birthday
however , much to his dismay , norman , now almost 80 , was forced to stop writing back to nicole recently , as his parkinson 's disease worsens and his hands are too shaky to put pen to paper
unwilling to be cut off from her surrogate grandparents , nicole traveled the 1,600 miles from new york to bastrop , to finally meet them
a reunion of sorts : norman and his wife bobbie ( together ) finally got to meet nicole ( center left ) and her family , after nicole traveled from new york to meet with the couple norman sat anxiously in the restaurant where they planned to meet
celebration : together with their families , nicole and norman ( back left ) have now finally met once the tears stopped , the two shared their first proper conversation and meal
