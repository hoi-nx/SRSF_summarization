a nine - year - old boy found a message in a bottle while exploring a wooded beach of a small lake island on a family vacation - and then realized it was addressed to his grandfather
rogers had been on a fishing trip with his family on lake murray in south carolina
that 's when rogers came across a screw - top dr pepper bottle with a rolled - up letter inside sitting next to a log
the letter was written to rogers 's grandfather , mike rogers ( right ) rogers imagined it was a ' note from the pirates or something ' , and showed his parents who read the note first , according to the slate
garrick recognized the signature from an old friend of hers and immediately sent a picture of the letter to her friend diane bryant , who responded by saying she knew ' exactly where that came from '
in 1970 , when bryant , who 's now 58 , was about 13 years old , she was on an overnight church gathering on lake murray
the letter , found in the bottle pictured , had faded , but garrick could read , ' i wish i could see you ... i love you so much ... i love you , diane bryant bryant ( left ) hoped that rogers , righty , would find the letter when he was on vacation with his family later in the summer of 1970
he did n't discover the letter for another 45 years she was missing her then - boyfriend , mike rogers , who was n't allowed on the trip because he had gotten in some kind of trouble at the time
' i 've thought about it through the years , thinking , " i wonder if anyone ever found that bottle ? " ' bryant and rogers remain friends to this day , though they are no longer romantically involved
they both married different people and 45 years later , rogers did find it
though the pair remained friends over the years , they decided they ' would have killed each other a long time ago ' , bryant said
ron was on the same church trip as bryant the day she wrote her love letter to rogers
