closed for over a decade , a trail that 's been described as " the world 's most dangerous path " will no longer be off limits to the public thanks to a massive reconstruction project
due to reopen march 26 , spain 's stunning caminito del rey features a cliff face boardwalk that hangs 100 meters above the guadalhorce river
the trail , which begins in the village of el chorro in southern malaga province , has been around since the early 1900s , originally built to provide access to two waterfalls for hydroelectric workers
the reopening , which comes over a year since reconstruction efforts kicked off , coincides with spain 's annual holy week celebrations
