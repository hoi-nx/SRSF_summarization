highly successful businessman randy work ( right ) , who was ' not willing to pay a penny ' to his wife gray ( left ) in a multimillion - pound divorce battle , has been told by a judge that he must hand over around Â£ 80m she was therefore prevented from receiving a more substantial sum - and would be given little over Â£ 3m when bills were paid
but mr justice holman , sitting in london , disagreed and told mr randy work : ' having offered to pay her nothing you now have to pay her tens of millions of american dollars
' the judge , sitting in the high court of london 's high court , said the couple had been equal partners in a relationship of more than 20 years
they married ' without a bean ' and the husband made his Â£ 150m fortune during the course of their marriage while supported by his wife , he added
mr randy work had argued the mother - of - two was only entitled to Â£ 5m after breaking a post-nuptial agreement in the witness box , the tycoon described how he had gone to japanese and made billions of dollars for lone star , buying up real estate , including troubled golf courses , after the japanese economy became stuck in a sharp downturn
he added that ms gray had been ' a good wife ' over 20 years and ' a good mother ' and would have been entitled to at least Â£ 70 million , the ' total sum payable ' under the post-nup agreement they signed in october 2000
the judge disagreed and said : ' it would , in my view , be unsatisfactory and gender discriminatory now to make an unequal award
mr justice holman ( above ) disagreed with mr randy work and said : ' it would , in my view , be unsatisfactory and gender discriminatory now to make an unequal award ' in 1997 he was offered a job with lone star in dallas , texan , and soon afterwards he was offered a post in tokyo , where the couple lived from 1998 until 2005
the court heard that both mr randy work and ms gray were born in the american but had ' expatriated ' and both are now resident in london
