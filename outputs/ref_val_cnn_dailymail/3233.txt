the zoo 's snakes are never fed live food in order to protect their safety
' a rock python , an anaconda and an eastern diamondback rattlesnake , the largest rattlesnake and the heaviest venomous snake in the americas , have also moved into the exhibit
the exhibit was celebrating the zoo 's new 48 ft long , life - sized replica of the prehistoric titanoboa snake - the heaviest and longest snake ever discovered ' its believed either people could n't take care of them anymore , released them , or the hurricane destroyed the facilities and liberated the animals , ' maloney said
an eastern diamondback rattlesnake featured in the titanoboa exhibit , the largest rattlesnake
maloney said the zoo , which carries a rock python that was caught in the everglades , tries to provide homes for wild snakes if they can - but there often is n't the space to house such large animals
' we âre celebrating snakes by showcasing not only the big snakes living on the planet today but the biggest snake that ever existed
