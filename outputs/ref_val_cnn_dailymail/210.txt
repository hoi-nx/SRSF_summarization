marr has branded paxman as a â genuinely tortured , angry individual â
the bbc presenter said mr paxman , 64 , was barely able to hide his disdain for those he interviews â and that it had been a mistake to allow him to grill cameron and miliband last thursday
speaking at the london school of economics , mr marr argued the former newsnight host âs aggressive interviews were â not a good replacement â for debate between the prime minister and the labour leader
â the thing about paxman is that he is a genuinely tortured , angry individual â and you get the real paxman , â mr marr said
â however , mr marr , 55 , suggested mr paxman had forgotten why the leader interviews were being televised and had allowed his own ego to get in the way
â mr marr , a former colleague of mr paxman , said it had been a mistake to allow the former newsnight presenter to grill prime minister cameron and labour leader miliband last thursday for the election debate a number of television critics said mr paxman dominated the show so strongly that viewers might have finished wanting to vote for him rather than either of the party leaders
however , mr marr âs comments went down badly with viewers , who accused the bbc political editor of being â supine â , â sycophantic â and having an â inflated sense of his own importance â
others speculated mr marr âs remarks were driven by jealousy
speaking at the london school of economics , mr marr said paxman âs aggressive interviews were â not a good replacement â for a debate between the two political leaders a bbc source said executives were â very surprised â by mr marr âs outburst , as the two men never really â trod on each other âs toes â even when they worked together
but mr marr made it clear he prefers a friendlier approach than the aggressive line of attack for which mr paxman is renowned
viewers have accused mr marr , who has hosted bbc1 's sunday - morning current affairs programme for the past decade , of being â supine â , â sycophantic â and having an â inflated sense of his own importance â â we do nât have to be this kind of really , really aggressive opposition all of the time
mr miliband âs grilling was so severe the presenter asked him at the end : â are you ok , miliband ? are you all right ? â however , when mr paxman told the labour leader his party would never get a majority , mr miliband said the broadcaster does not get to decide who wins .
