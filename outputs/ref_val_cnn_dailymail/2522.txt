lots of people loved peter mayle 's a year in provence but it made me more determined than ever to spend summers in british
the cash rolled in , but provence became a clichÃ©
but that 's nothing compared to susan , my 80 - something mother - in - law , who had n't been to french for half a century
then , to my horror , as soon as the eurostar pulled out of london st pancras , susan produced a crumpled copy of peter mayle 's book and quickly became engrossed
a region of colour and aromas : rolling fields of lavender are a welcome sight for visitors to provence i was just uncorking the first bottle of rose and about to toast our good fortune when susan noticed her suitcase was not the one that she 'd left norfolk with
she was a little down about it all , but her spirits picked up no end that evening when we drove to the hill - top village of menerbes ( gothic - style church , corkscrew museum , teenyweeny streets and , yes , the backdrop to peter mayle 's literary money - spinner ) and looked out over the luberon national park , with the vaucluse mountains in the distance
two kilometres away is the ravishing la bastide de marie , a 14 - room hotel ( including one gypsy caravan ) set in acres of its own vineyards
misty highs , lovely lows : mont ventoux provides a beautiful backdrop to the pretty villages of provence ( left ) - while lunch in the medieval enclave of l'isle-sur-la-sorgue ( right ) , above the river sorgue , will perk up the soul the restaurant ( Â£ 50 a head , including wine ) is open to non residents - and the food and service assuaged any lingering negativity about the indifference of the french to missing suitcases
aix en provence is an hour south east
with its creamy stone , bleached shutters and imposing church , it is everything you could want in provence - and more
at 6,273ft metres it 's the highest point in provence , the arid summit way above the tree line
it was n't a difficult climb - by car , that is
a familiar sight : mont ventoux has often played host to the tour de france - and is also great for non-cyclists just before you reach the summit , there 's a grave by the side of the road , a memorial to the great british cyclist tommy simpson , who died from heart failure in 1967 on one of the hottest days ever recorded in the race
his last words were : ' put me back on the bloody bike
' mont ventoux is an essential outing
the village is irresistibly pretty , so much so my father - in - law very nearly bought a set of those plastic place - mats with scenic photographs complete with a greetings from gordes inscription
a week in provence might not have the same ring to it as the title of peter mayle 's book , but a mere seven days here works wonders for the soul
