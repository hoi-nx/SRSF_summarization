how could a young person -- who was a close friend of the deceased , conrad roy , 18 -- allegedly do such a horrifying thing ? and what are the legal ramifications of what a teen says online or in a text ? but a lesser discussed point this tragic story raises is how quickly a teen can go from normal everyday life to facing severe , life - altering legal consequences
that is why lisa green , author of the informative new book " on your case : a compassionate ( and only slightly bossy ) legal guide for every stage of a woman 's life , " believes every parent of a teen should have a criminal defense lawyer in mind and at the ready -- just in case
" to me this is the unrecognized area that parents , particularly parents of teens , miss all the time , " said green during a recent interview at cnn 's studios
whether it 's a case as serious as carter 's involuntary manslaughter charge , or a simple allegation of vandalism , parents need to be prepared , green said
for instance , what if a teen is asked by a school administrator to turn over his or her cell phone based on allegations the teen was sending inappropriate texts ? what parents should know , green said , is that a school ca n't open a cell phone for no reason at all
" they need to have reasonable suspicion that something 's wrong , " said green , who said parents would be wise to talk to their teens about what 's appropriate and what 's not when it comes to handling such requests from school officials
and even before teens head off to college , parents should know about social host laws , where parents could be held criminally responsible or face civil damages if teens drink alcohol in their home and then go off and do something inappropriate or even tragic
scary consequences for parents hosting underage drinking more than 150 cities or counties and 24 states currently have such laws on their books , according to mothers against drunk driving
in some cases , parents can be held liable even if they did n't know the drinking was taking place
" if you 've made it possible in your home , if you do n't lock your liquor cabinet -- i never did -- and all of a sudden kids are drinking , that could be a problem as well
" while green is passionate about educating parents on why they need to think about the law , she stresses that bad behavior by teens still needs to be punished either legally or at home
" so if after reading this , you are moved to try to find a criminal defense lawyer , how on earth do you go about finding one ? green 's advice is to ask friends and colleagues for referrals and also consult with your state bar association , since you would want someone in your state who has experience with criminal defense issues
