president obama wasted little time monday night in blasting wisconsin walker gov. walker for a new state law that bans requiring the payment of union dues as a condition of employment , saying it ' will weaken , rather than strengthen workers
' walker signed the bill into law on monday , making the wisconsin the 25th with such a ' right to work ' law
wisconsin gov. walker signed the measure into law monday
walker is expected to run as a republican candidate for president in 2016
by 9:00 at night , the white house was circulating a statement from obama claimign that walker had notched a ' victory over working america
' if the wisconsin governor were interested in protecting workers , the president said , be would be ' taking meaningful action to raise their wages and offer them the security of paid leave
' the nod to wages was a subtle jab at wisconsin for not embracing a white house - led push to raise the minimum wage nationwide
the new wisconsin law , obama claimed , is part of ' a sustained , coordinated assault on unions , led by powerful interests and their allies in government
' wisconsin is the first to enact a right - to - work law since michigan and indiana did it in 2012
so it âs inexcusable that , over the past several years , just when middle - class families and workers need that kind of security the most , there âs been a sustained , coordinated assault on unions , led by powerful interests and their allies in government
mix , president of the national right to work committee , said the wisconsin law could bring a new wave of imitators in the american midwest â historically strong industrialized regions with robust labor unions
' not all wisconsin residents are behind walker , most notably labor union bosses and much of their rank - and - file
halfway there ? with wisconsin 's new right - to - work law , it 's now illegal in half of america 's 50 states to require the payment of union dues as a condition of employment about 5,000 union supporters marched against ' right to work ' legislation on feb. 28 in madison , wisconsin , a fraction of the estimated 100,000 who had massed near the state capitol four years earlier in another anti-scott walker protest walker is now fine - tuning campaign messages in advance of what is expected to be a bruising republican presidential primary season â and many of those talking points have obama in their crosshairs
' workforce participation is up in wisconsin because walker is a leader who tackled the tough economic problems left by his predecessor , ' the pac 's spokeswoman kirsten kukowski said in a statement
