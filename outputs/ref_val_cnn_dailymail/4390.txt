the washing machine - sized philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67p on 12 november 2014
but after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface , the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power
now , as the comet approaches the sun and solar rays recharge philae 's batteries , rosetta mission manager martin tells mailonline he is confident of finding the probe soon - but it will be a race against time to get it working again
he warned that once the comet begins heading away from the sun in august it will enter hibernation again - but this time for good
rosetta mission manager martin told mailonline he is confident of making contact with philae on comet 67p soon ( approach of lander on 12 november shown )
the probe has been silent since it ran out of power in november , and esa scientists in germany recently failed to make contact last week , experts at the dlr ( dlr ) abandoned an eight - day attempt to find the probe - the first attempt at trying to restart communications since it went dark
the rosetta probe , which was carrying philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre ( 40 inches ) per second relative to the comet
but it is covered in solar panels and , as the comet approaches the sun , it is expected to get enough power - 19 watts - from its panels to make contact with the orbiting rosetta spacecraft
making contact will enable scientists to get philae to continue the groundbreaking science it managed to perform in its brief operational time on the surface - and it will also allow rosetta to pinpoint its location
speaking about the attempt to find the probe last week , mr martin told mailonline : â we were trying to see if the lander would wake up and , at the same time , we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation
but this did not stop it from completing more than 90 per cent of its science goals in 60 hours of operation on the surface philae , pictured left by rosetta on its approach to comet 67p on 12 november , needs 19 watts of power in order to communicate with earth through rosetta
mission manager mr martin , pictured right , said they had already sent commands to the lander , some of which it may have carried out the landing of philae on 67p was a groundbreaking moment not only for esa , but for spaceflight as a whole
shown are some of the team celebrating when news of the successful landing was received back at mission control in darmstadt , germany â it âs a very complex configuration , â explained mr martin
â at the next attempt , martin said there was a â 50:50 chance â they would hear something from philae , but even if that attempt is unsuccessful he is very confident that we will have heard something from philae by the time 67p makes its closest approach to the sun - known as perihelion - in august
when it wakes up , mr martin said his team would â check the situation of the lander and all its units , try to understand what has happened since november , and then as quickly as possible start the long term science phase
philae âs power system included a non-rechargeable 1,000 watt - hour primary battery and a secondary 140 watt - hour battery , charged by the 24 square feet ( 2.2 square metres ) of solar panels on its exterior scientists are desperate to study the jets that are being emitted by the comet in more detail - one is seen in this rosetta image - as it approaches the sun. and philae will play a big part in increasing our understanding of how this process takes place , if esa is able to wake it up in a reasonable amount of time but while they are confident philae will wake up , scientists will be hoping it happens sooner rather than later as it will not be able to operate indefinitely on the comet
â after the summer we start getting more away from the sun , so there will be a point where it will happen again , and then the lander will go into hibernation , â mr martin said
