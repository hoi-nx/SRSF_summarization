that much is known about the final few minutes for the 144 passengers on germanwings 9525
beyond that , it 's a matter of imagination and speculation -- about what they saw and what they felt as their plane approached and then crashed into the alps
none of them can speak for themselves , nor can any of the flight 's six crew members
but authorities have given some clues , based on what investigators know about the aircraft 's trajectory and what they 've heard on a mangled cockpit voice recorder recovered at the crash site
it all began on what seemed like most any other tuesday as citizens of 18 countries packed into the germanwings plane in barcelona , spain
the passengers came from all walks of life , using lufthansa 's low - cost carrier to get to dusseldorf , germany
they were high school students , heading home after a week in spain
there was a 26 - minute delay before takeoff because air traffic controllers did n't give the ok to start the plane 's engines earlier and there was a small wait in the takeoff rotation , according to lufthansa
for any frequent flier , that kind of delay is nothing abnormal
the plane leveled off at 38,000 feet , its cruising altitude
a seemingly innocuous act changed everything : the aircraft 's pilot had to use the restroom , according to lufthansa ceo carsten spohr , telling the co-pilot that he was stepping out
it 's possible that passengers saw the captain in the cabin , going to or from the restroom
they also could have noticed that the aircraft was going down -- even though they were about a half - hour into a nearly two - hour flight , with the alps ahead of them
this was around 10:45 a.m. it was n't like the plane suddenly jerked down , plunging straight into the ground
still , it is the kind of descent you 'd expect while nearing an airport -- not traversing the alps
