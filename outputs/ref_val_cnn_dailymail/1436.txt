three years after his claims he was n't an extremist , emwazi appeared in syria beheading western hostages in isis videos
emwazi ( pictured , left , in 2009 and , right , while a student university of westminster ) - known as jihadi john - was recorded by campaign group cage complaining about his treatment by mi5 in the years before he went to syria to join terror group isis in the new tapes , emwazi said he spoke to an mi5 officer following his return from tanzania and was questioned over his views on islam and terrorism
in a recording released today , he told cage : ' [ the mi5 agent ] said : " emwazi , what do you think of 7/7 ? " i said : " innocent people have died
' but the mi5 agent did not believe his views were moderate and replied : ' i still believe you are going to somalia to train
' cage have released the tape as part of their widely - criticised claims that emwazi was ' harassed ' by security services
cage 's statement claimed that emwazi ' desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation , but the system ultimately rejected him '
the reported interview with mi5 took place after emwazi was refused entry to tanzania because authorities suspected he was trying to get to somalia , where terrorist organisation al-shabaab have been known to train british militants
in the recordings , emwazi ( pictured in the isis beheading videos which earned him the nickname ' jihadi john ' ) claims he condemned previous attacks such as 9/11 and 7/7 when he was questioned by an agent the recordings were released by human rights group cage , who have been widely criticised for trying to blame british authorities for emwazi 's actions lee rigby 's killer michael adebolajo was picked up by the sas and mi5 in similar fashion as he tried to enter the east african country in november 2010
the year after his recorded conversation with cage , emwazi contacted mail on sunday security editor verkaik in december 2010
he told mr verkaik he feared mi5 were following him and wrote in an email : ' sometimes i feel like im a dead man walking , not fearing they may kill me
' mr verkaik recalled : ' like many young muslim men at the time who i had interviewed , he appeared to have a grievance against the police and mi5
' after foiled attempts to go to his father 's home country , kuwait , and to get a teaching job in saudi arabia , emwazi slipped out of british and later appeared in syria
he has since gained global notoriety as the masked killer of western hostages including british aid workers alan henning and david haines in isis beheading videos which have shocked the world
emwazi was interviewed after he was picked up by authorities in tanzania in 2009 , suspected of trying to get into somalia to join islamist group al-shabaab ( pictured ) other british extremists have also been linked to al-shabaab - including lee rigby killer michael adebolajo and ' samantha lewthwaite ' samantha lewthwaite cage has been widely criticised for its defence of emwazi after he was unmasked as jihadi john last week
asim qureshi , leader of campaign group , caused outrage by saying the murderer was ' beautiful ' adding that he ' would n't hurt a fly '
the moaning voice of emwazi in recordings of him complaining to cage appears to sound different from that in the speeches against the west made by jihadi john in isis 's horrific beheading videos last year
the difference suggests isis either used another militant to voice over the films or may have doctored or slowed down emwazi 's voice to make him appear more fearsome in the propaganda films
jihadi john in his own words : full transcript of how emwazi tried to get off the hook amid suspicions he wanted to train with terrorists emwazi went to campaign group cage in 2009 after he was questioned by mi5 over his suspected links to terrorism
he is said to have been questioned by intelligence officers at amsterdam 's schiphol airport , where he was flown after being refused entry to tanzania ' i told him everything that was happened , all bombs or whatever that happened was from extremists
