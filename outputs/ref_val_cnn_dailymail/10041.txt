apology : police officer david duckenfield today said sorry for failing to admit that he ordered the gates at hillsborough to be opened the police chief on duty during the hillsborough disaster today apologised for lying to officials about ordering the gates to the stadium to be opened , leading to a deadly crush which killed 96 liverpool fans
as the disaster unfolded , david duckenfield told officials from the fa that ' some fans have got in through a gate ' - which he admitted today was a ' terrible lie '
the former officer said that he ' apologised unreservedly ' for failing to confess that he had personally ordered police to open the gates in order to relieve overcrowding at the turnstiles of the sheffield stadium
after the gates were opened fans rushed into the terraces , causing dozens of people to be crushed under the weight of bodies
mr david duckenfield was the officer overseeing the fa cup semi-final between liverpool and notthingham forest on april 15 , 1989 , even though he had been promoted just two weeks previously and had never been in charge of policing a football match before
yesterday he told the inquest into the fans ' deaths that he was ' not the best man for the job ' given his inexperience , and today he gave evidence about his decision to open gate c eight minutes before kick - off
after the gate opened an estimated 2,000 fans poured in , heading straight for a tunnel leading directly to the already - packed central pens three and four , behind the goal
mr david duckenfield , 70 , today recounted a conversation he had with fa officials kelly and glen kirton minutes after the match was abandoned amidst the chaos
he denied the suggestion that he had said the gates were ' stormed ' , and claimed he told the men ' something like , " some fans have got in through a gate
' christina lambert qc , counsel for the inquest , asked : ' do you consider now that you told them a lie ? ' mr david duckenfield replied : ' yes , ma'am
' evidence : mr david duckenfield pictured in the dock , where he talked about his actions on april 15 , 1989 relatives : campaigners margaret aspinall , left , and jenni hicks , right , pictured outside the inquest asked if he was trying to hide the truth because he was responsible for the tragic events , mr david duckenfield said : ' i think in a crisis , and probably in this shock and in stress , i said something i deeply regret
that was a terrible lie , in that everybody knew the truth
' earlier mr david duckenfield said he now realised ' in hindsight ' the ' most likely ' route fans would take once gate c was open was to go down the tunnel facing them and in to the central pens
do you think as a match commander the consequences of the decision you made , and in particular thought as to where the fans might go , is something you should have considered ? ' mr david duckenfield replied : ' i think it is fair to say that is arguably one of the biggest regrets of my life , that i did not foresee where fans would go when they came in through the gates
' the commanding officer , who was stationed in the police control box with a bank of cctv monitors , said he was ' shocked ' at the request to open the gates from superintendent marshall after police became ' overwhelmed ' by the number of fans gathered at the turnstiles
crush : 96 liverpool fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground 's perimeter fence mr david duckenfield said : ' i do n't mind telling you i was shocked and taken aback by it and thinking , " where are these people going to go if i open the gates ? " ' he said another message then came through on the police radio from mr marshall saying : ' if we do n't open the gates someone 's going to get killed
mr david duckenfield said : ' i remember saying to him quite clearly , mr murray , if people are going to die i have no option but to open the gates
chaos : fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster after climbing over perimeter fences the gate remained open for five minutes , allowing fans to flow into the ground , but the officer said today that he did not think about where those supporters would go
