london a supporter of suspended " top gear " host clarkson delivered a petition with nearly 1 million signatures calling for his reinstatement to the bbc 's headquarters in london on friday -- driving an armored tank up to the building
clarkson was suspended for allegedly hitting a producer , the bbc reported last week , and " top gear " -- a highly popular show with a big global audience -- was not broadcast as scheduled sunday
the bbc 's decision to take the show off the air pending an investigation has outraged many of clarkson 's die - hard fans
whether the show of support will have any impact on the bbc 's response is unclear
clarkson tweeted his thanks friday night to those who are calling for his reinstatement , saying he is " very touched
" the findings of the internal investigation are due to be presented to the corporation 's director general next week , the bbc said thursday
the bbc said in an earlier statement that clarkson , one of the corporation 's highest earners , had " a fracas with a bbc producer
" in an indication of its popularity , " top gear " was named as the world 's most widely watched factual program in the guinness world records 2013 edition book , with an estimated 350 million global viewers
a cnn reporter who was at the event heard clarkson swear liberally as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the bbc " have f * * * * * themselves " and that it had ruined a great show

last year , the bbc show hit the headlines when argentina complained about a " top gear " special filmed in the country in which the number plate h982 fkl was used -- interpreted by some as a reference to the 1982 falklands war
forced to stop filming and leave the country , clarkson said on the bbc newsbeat website that the use of the plate was purely coincidental in a previous article on its website , the bbc said " clarkson is not a man given to considered opinion
