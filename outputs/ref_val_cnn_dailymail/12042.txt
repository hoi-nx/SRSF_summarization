an incredible road map of the universe showing the pathways between our milky way and 100,000 other far away galaxies has been revealed by scientists after a 10 - year quest into the unknown
the gigantic supercluster of stars , planets and asteroids , which stretches 500 million light years across and has the mass of a hundred quadrillion suns , has been named laniakea-hawaiian for ' immeasurable heaven '
the astonishing discovery has revealed that the milky way - home to earth and our solar system - is on the fringes of the enormous cosmic web
our supercluster is the first to be mapped and shows galaxies strung out along glowing pathways that are held together by gravity the vast road map may look as though it is densely packed , however there are vast expanses of darkness where nothing can be found for hundreds of light years the astronomers compared the movement of the galaxies with that of water among hills and valleys to chart the supercluster dr brent tully , from the university of hawaii in honolulu , led the team of scientists that mapped laniakea 's boundaries around our supercluster are four others - known as shapley , hercules , coma and perseus - pisces - however it is difficult to show exactly where our neighbourhood of galaxies ends and the others begin
the researchers compared the galactic movement with that of water in a landscape of hills and valleys , tracing the outer surface of a region where the net - motion of galaxies was inward
