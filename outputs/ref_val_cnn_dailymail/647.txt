terry is going to cause chelsea a huge problem in the future and the cost to fix it will be enormous
there will come a point one day when jose mourinho is no longer able to rely on his captain and , privately , he will be dreading when that time comes
the term to describe terry âs influence on this chelsea team is the same as the one you would label his performance at wembley stadium : colossal
jose mourinho âs brilliance as a manager can not be overstated
some managers need big individuals to get them over the line but jose mourinho does it regardless of who he is working with
terry 's current form for chelsea is arguably as impressive as it was 10 years ago terry scored the opening goal of the game in the recent capital one cup win against tottenham premier league : 2004 - 05 , 2005 - 06 , 2009 - 10
when chelsea won the league cup 10 years ago â the first of the five trophies they lifted during jose mourinho âs first reign â the side was built around a formidable spine of petr cech , terry , claude makelele , frank lampard and didier drogba
terry was as good against tottenham as he was against liverpool at the millennium stadium in 2005 and you have to ask when the time comes to fill his shoes , what will the price be ? when you think manchester city paid Â£ 32million for eliaquim mangala last summer and david luiz cost paris saint-germain Â£ 50m , you get an idea of how difficult it will be to find someone with terry âs many qualities
on these pages 14 months ago , i described terry as the best defender in premier league history and one moment towards the end of the game on sunday showed why he has stayed at the top of his profession for so long
terry is the only player that remains from the old spine of the chelsea team , the others have been replaced jose mourinho recognises the importance of his captain ad will be keen to retain his services the game was won but tottenham were looking to grab a consolation and it looked like it might arrive when harry kane wriggled into the area
he was denied , though , by terry putting his body on the line to make sure chelsea âs goal was nât threatened
sometimes i do nât think it gets appreciated how difficult it is to stay at one club for your entire career , especially in the position john has filled
paris saint-germain paid Â£ 50million for david luiz , who was considered surplus to requirements at chelsea manchester city paid Â£ 32m for eliaquim mangala but did n't feel comfortable starting him against barcelona but john has never hidden , not even after the campaign two years ago when he made just 14 appearances
gary cahill and kurt zouma are good players but without terry , i would not be confident about chelsea winning the premier league next season
if he was to leave , there would not be a team in the top flight who terry would not improve
