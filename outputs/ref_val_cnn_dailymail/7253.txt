the u.s. senate failed wednesday to override president obama 's veto of a bill approving construction of the controversial keystone
it 's expected to be the first of many confrontations between the republicans - controlled congress and the white house this year over energy policy
the 62 - 37 vote involved eight senate democrats voting with all 54 republicans
a ninth democrat , who also favors the pipeline project , missed the vote
the same exact group of nine joined together earlier this year to give senate majority leader mitch mcconnell enough votes to pass the bill , dubbed 's
and danielle droitsch , canada project director at the natural resources defense council , vlaimed canada 's ' dirty tar sands oil pipeline is simply not in u.s. 's national interest
' proponents of the keystone bill have said since its introduction that they did n't have the two - thirds of the senate vote needed to override obama 's veto
they 've already been discussing other way to force the pipeline 's approval , either by attaching it onto must - pass spending bills or other , broader , energy legislation
short - lived : republicans signed their keystone bill on feb. 13 and sent it to the white house , but it came back to them with obama 's ' veto ' signature his veto of the bill , the third of his presidency , said that the bill circumvented longstanding and proven processes for determining whether cross-border pipelines serve the national interest and cuts short consideration of its effects
environmentalists have framed the pipeline as a test of obama 's commitment to address climate change , arguing that it would open up a path for tar sands oil to get to market
republicans have pushed the pipeline as a job - creating infrastructure project that will supply the u.s. with oil from a friendly neighbor , rather than unstable regimes
