jamie has warned that a new trade deal with us will open the door to inferior food , including beef pumped up with growth hormones , banned additives and pesticides
there are also concerns that gm crops and food produced in the us , which have not been through more strict vetting procedures in europe , could be forced on to dinner plates
the campaigner and chef held talks this week with business secretary vince cable to outline his â massive concerns â that the deal could seriously undermine uk food and farming
concerns : celebrity chef jamie has held talks with business secretary vince cable about his worries that rules to protect food in the uk and europe could be lost with a new free trade pact campaigner : tv chef jamie has long been an advocate of quality food and ingredients and has expressed ' massive concerns ' over the potential of a new trade pact with us the eu and the us government are negotiating a new free trade pact â known as ttip â which will lift barriers to trade in key sectors of the economy across the atlantic
however critics like the chef fear it will expose uk families to inferior food and drink which does not meet the higher health and welfare standards that exist in this country and europe
for example , us farmers are allowed to pump up beef cattle , which are raised on vast factory farm feed lots rather than in fields , with growth hormones
uk has effectively banned the use of certain artificial colours from food for children because of an association with hyperactivity , however these are not banned in the us
us farmers can also use pesticides that have been banned in this country as a health risk
balance : business secretary vince cable , pictured , told jamie his fears were unfounded however , all these protections could be swept away , according to jamie and other critics of the ttip proposals â transatlantic trade and investment partnership â which is the biggest free trade deal in history
writing on instagram , the chef told followers he had been to see the business secretary â to tell him my massive concerns about any possibility of the uk âs and europe âs food standards being compromised â
he said : â we have fought long and hard to get where we are today and i really do nât want feed lot beef with growth hormones , nor chickens washed with chlorine or food produced with banned pesticides and additives , to name but a few , and i certainly do nât want our farmers undermined
â wholesome : jamie , pictured here for jamie 's summer food rave up , says he does n't want ' chickens washed with chlorine or or food produced with banned pesticides and additives ' , allowed in the us beef : most us beef cattle are fed with synthetic growth hormones to pump them up , boosting muscle
beef from these animals was banned in europe , including uk , in 1989 amid concerns the residues were a cancer risk â particularly breast cancer - in humans dairy : cows in the us are routinely given the synthetic hormone bovine somatotrophin , which dramatically boost milk production
milk and dairy products from the us were banned in the uk and europe in 2000 because of concerns of a cancer risk to humans and evidence of harm to the cows
chicken : farmers in the us are allowed to feed antibiotics to chicken to speed up growth
this practice was banned in uk and europe in 2006 amid concerns it was leading to the emergence of superbug versions of dangerous infections , such as campylobacter and salmonella.producers in the us wash chicken carcasses in a chlorine and water solution to kill bugs
this is based on concerns they are linked to hyperactivity and changes in behaviour.there are no such controls in the us where these additives are commonly used in processed food , including breakfast cereals
pesticides : 82 pesticides that are banned in the uk and europe are allowed on us farms
gm : many gm crops such as maize or corn and soya are grown on an industrial scale in the us and appear in thousands of processed food products - everything from snacks to fast food , breakfast cereal , cooking oils and chocolate
the uk government is one of the driving forces in the eu to get the new free trade deal approved
it claims ttip could add Â£ 10billion to the uk economy , Â£ 80billion to the us and Â£ 100bn to the eu every year
