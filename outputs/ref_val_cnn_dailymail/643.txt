families face having to wait for four weeks for household rubbish , including food waste , to be collected families face having to wait for four weeks for household rubbish , including food waste , to be collected
labour - run fife council yesterday became the first local authority in the uk to announce a trial of monthly bin pick - ups
it means food scraps and rubbish including soiled nappies , pet waste , used kitchen towels and sanitary products will be left to rot for weeks
last night the initiative â which fife council claims will save Â£ 900,000 a year from 2021 when extra limits will apply to landfill waste â was criticised as another reduction in the service to householders as councils escalate their â green â crusade
â fife council says it has to bring in the scheme because of a need to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill , due to punitive eu taxation
â a separate fife council trial , in addition to monthly collections , will see such general waste picked up once every three weeks , with the council upping recycling collections to help householders cope with the build - up of festering rubbish
four bins are used by fife council householders : one for general or non-recyclable waste â also known as â residual â rubbish â another for cans and plastic , a third for paper and card and the fourth for food and garden waste
under the four - weekly scheme , families who use nappies will be offered fortnightly pick - ups of their general waste
but the people participating in the three - weekly trial who throw out nappies will have to wait for the full three weeks for them to be picked up â though they will be able to get bigger bins
the scheme means food scraps and rubbish including soiled nappies , pet waste , used kitchen towels and sanitary products will be left to rot for weeks ( file picture ) council officials said â criteria will be developed for this â so it is clear when people will be entitled to a larger landfill bin , for example if they have nappies or medical needs
â in the winter months , between november and february , food and garden waste will only be collected once a month under both of the fife council trials , with fortnightly pick - ups during the summer
â if no improvements are made to the current four bin system and the cost for landfill disposals stays the same this could cost the council an extra Â£ 1.5 million a year
in 2013 , falkirk council announced it would become the first in uk to introduce bin collections every three weeks , for â residual waste â , saying the change would save Â£ 1.4 million a year , as landfill taxes soar
four of scotland âs largest councils - fife council , aberdeen , edinburgh and perth and kinross - are cutting bin sizes from the standard 240 litres to only 180 litres or even 140 litres , to be picked up every fortnight
