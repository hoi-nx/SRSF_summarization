a desperate mother has to watch in horror as her daughter becomes paralysed every other day
in this state ms firth 's daughter , mia park , can only cry out for help and wait until drugs help her regain movement
' firth , 39 , has to watch helplessly as her daughter , mia park , 12 , becomes paralysed every other day to a rare genetic condition mia park has hypokalemic periodic paralysis which means she has periods where she ca n't move her body and has to be rushed to hospital ( pictured ) mia park , who is just 12 , suffered her first petrifying episode of paralysis in january this year
' but by the morning , mia park said she could n't feel her arms or legs
hypokalemic periodic paralysis is a disorder that causes occasional episodes of muscle weakness and sometimes a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood
symptoms include attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement ( paralysis ) that come and go
the weakness or paralysis : other symptoms may include : source : us national library of medicine ' my ex-husband , mia park 's dad , and her grandad , also suffered from a condition that intermittently left them paralysed
' the extremely rare and potentially fatal condition , hypokalemic periodic paralysis , is caused by dangerously low levels of potassium
it took four paramedics to safely lift mia park , who had become a dead weight , onto a back board and into an ambulance
it was there her potassium levels were checked and results showed they were extremely low and a neurologist , dr rittey , diagnosed mia park with the debilitating condition
mia park was given potassium intravenously , but only after an agonising 14 hours , did she slowly regain movement
i never thought i 'd be so happy to see mia park wriggle her fingers and toes
' it is something you just take for granted , never imagining your child will literally freeze in her sleep , and lose sensation of almost every muscle from her neck down
' over the following week , mia park fell into a state of paralysis every other day , each time it starting in her sleep
' all we could do was wait for the iv potassium to flow through her body and pray it would take effect
' the condition , caused by mutation of chromosome 17 , only effects one person in every 100,000 and is far more common in men than women
ms firth continued : ' that 's why it never initially occurred to me that 's what mia park had
her dad had always told me it was a condition that affected males , not females , but obviously it does happen in girls too
' although mia park 's attacks have slowed down to every couple of weeks at the moment , we have been warned the bouts of paralysis can happen at any time and could get more frequent
' if it happens when she is awake , mia park starts to slowly feel a tingling sensation in her fingers and she knows it 's about to happen , and can take a form of potassium syrup to stop it developing
' but when it starts in her sleep , she has no idea , and wakes up completely paralysed
i ca n't allow mia park to sleep over at friend 's houses , something girls her age take for granted , or go on an overnight school trip without me in case she has an attack
if we do n't we could lose mia park
mia park 's attacks usually occur in her sleep , and she wakes up paralysed
in between attacks she can move normally mia park was once paralysed for 19 hours
' the longest episode mia park has suffered has lasted 19 hours
' and because mia park is up and about a lot of the time and maintains a normal lifestyle as such , people do not realise how poorly she is and the severity of her illness
during an attack , ms firth is rushed to hospital where she is treated with potassium through an iv drip ( she is pictured in hospital , left and right ) ms firth added : ' we just have to take it in our stride and hope that we can manage the condition
when mia park was in hospital , ms firth kept vigil at her bedside , sleeping in a high - back chair
in the new wing , she would have her own pull - down bed , mia park would have more privacy , and would get better more quickly in a hospital designed with children in mind
david vernon-edwards , director at the children 's hospital charity , said : ' mia park is an inspirational girl , fighting a terrifying illness with such bravery
' we are so lucky to have the specialist consultants at our hospital , such as dr rittey , who can help treat and control this condition
