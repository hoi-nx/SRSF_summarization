the paris is often captured in all its beauty with a series of images that show off its romantic side
but an american filmmaker has created a three - minute video that presents paris in an entirely unique way
sean collins , a 31 - year - old from la , used special effects to make the french capital 's famous landmarks , including the eiffel tower and arc de triomphe , and pedestrians look like miniature toys
the video is the work of photographer sean collins , who studied at the american school of paris the american video maker captures a shot of the eiffel tower in the distance of his unique film sean collins filmed the scenes over the course of eight days while visiting his girlfriend , a boston university student who is studying in paris
sean collins spent two weeks testing different ways to change the texture of the different images a train is captured in the film and appears to look like a toy being controlled by a child shots of boats travelling under bridges tie paris ' natural beauty with its urban iconography a couple of timelapse shots of the eiffel tower continue this theme before a train , which looks like it could be being controlled by a child , travels across a bridge
sean collins recorded the video over eight days with the help of his girlfriend who he was visiting in paris the arc de triomphe is momentarily captured before more close - ups shots of people looking like toys a distant shot of the arc de triomphe is momentarily captured before more close - ups of people negotiating busy streets
eventually the video concludes with footage of pigeons , a boat travelling under a bridge â which ties paris â beauty as a natural landscape and an urban city together â and a casual shot of the eiffel tower
sean collins 's goal was to show paris in a new light for those who have never had the chance to experience it sean collins had to prepare for each shot and was unable to film on rainy or cloudy days or days with poor air quality â it 's not as simple as just adding blur to the top and bottom to achieve the effect
