even when england put what looks like a challenging score on the board they are still brushed aside with contemptuous ease
sri lanka , with the imperious kumar sangakkara to the fore , cruised to their target of 310 here in such a ridiculously easy manner that england appeared just as far away from competing in this tournament as they did when they were thrashed by australia and new zealand
it is frightening how far away england seem from the real challengers in this world cup , astonishing how far they have been left behind in 50 - over cricket since they should have won the champions trophy less than two years ago
the stark reality is that they need to beat bangladesh and afghanistan in their last two group games to advance to the last eight and while they should still do that it is fanciful to expect them to defeat anyone of note
when england had scored 309 for six they looked favourites at a westpac stadium where southee had destroyed them with swing when they were last here just nine days ago
james taylor drops a catch on the boundary as england failed to build on their score in wellington england captain morgan was left with plenty to ponder after suffering his third defeat of the world cup sangakkar and team - mate lahiru thirimanne shake hands with morgan after sri lanka 's nine - wicket wi it is another indictment of england âs long - term one - day strategy that they threw ballance into this side on the eve of the world cup and it would appear they have no choice but to throw him out again
if alex hales , who england seem so reluctant to pick , does not play next week against bangladesh in adelaide then he really should despair about ever breaking into the 50 - over side
england made a great start , reaching 62 after nine overs , but they ran into trouble when they resorted to their old - fashioned habit of consolidating in the middle overs when they lost moeen ali , ballance and ian bell within 11 overs
it may seem harsh to criticise england when they have ended up scoring more than 300 but the one - day game has progressed so rapidly that you just can not afford to score at four an over for 10 overs as england did here
root was at least one bright spot for england as he hit 121 off 108 balls including two sixes root celebrates with his team - mate james taylor after reaching a century against sri lanka the impressive yorkshireman is the youngest english , at 24 , to score a world cup century and upon him rest so many hopes over the next 10 years in all forms of cricket
sri lanka fans were in full voice as they watched their side ease to victory over england morgan talks to bowlers steven finn and james anderson as england struggled against sri lanka fat chance
england perhaps had their opportunity when root dropped lahiru thirimanne on three off stuart broad but from then on , with england failing to locate the swing that southee gained here at the westpac stadium to take seven english wickets , it was all one - day traffic
once kumar sangakkara joined lahiru thirimanne the game was effectively over as the pair put on an unbeaten 210 after the loss of tillekeratne dilshan and only faltered when lahiru thirimanne offered what looked like a simple chance on 98 but moeen ali did not even get a hand on it
when kumar sangakkara , in his 401st one - day international , reached his 23rd century off just 70 balls sri lanka âs triumph was almost complete and england âs misery was acute
