scientists have provided the best estimates yet , claiming it once had more water than the arctic ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years
the findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on mars to thrive , but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry
nasa scientists in maryland have calculated how much water was once on mars
they found that 3.7 billion years ago it had more than the arctic ocean
since then , 87 % of the water has been lost to space , with the rest stored in ice at the poles the study by scientists at nasa âs nasa goddard in greenbelt , maryland , is the first to determine just how much water mars had in its past
during its wet noachian period - 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago - it is estimated that it had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet ( 137 metres ) deep
however , it âs likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of mars , which would have been as deep as one mile ( 1.6km ) in places - comparable to the mediterranean sea on earth
â our study provides a solid estimate of how much water mars once had , by determining how much water was lost to space , â said dr geronimo villanueva , first author of the paper and a scientist at nasa âs nasa goddard
â we now know that mars was wet for a much longer time than we thought before , â said dr michael mumma , co-author of the study and senior scientist at nasa goddard
â curiosity rover shows it was wet for 1.5 billion years , already much longer than the period of time needed for life to develop on earth
â during its wet noachian period , 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago , it is estimated that mars had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet ( 137 metres ) deep
however , it âs likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of mars ( illustrated ) as deep as one mile in places it is thought that while 87 % of the water has since been lost to space ( illustrated ) , owing largely to the planet losing its atmosphere , the remaining 13 % resides in the ice caps
it would have had a greater volume than the arctic ocean ( shown ) , which contains 18,750,000 cubic kilometres ( 11.7 million cubic miles ) of water missions like the curiosity rover ( illustrated ) have shown that mars was once wet for 1.5 billion years , but the scientists now think it had water for even longer
this is longer than the time it took life on earth to arise , providing tantalising hints that mars might once have been habitable
