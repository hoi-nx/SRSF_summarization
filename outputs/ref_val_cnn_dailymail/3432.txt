a new injectable drug designed to eliminate double chins without surgery was unanimously recommended for approval by a fda advisory committee this week
the drug , currently known as atx-101 , now only needs to receive final fda approval before it becomes available to the public
unlike current double chin surgeries , which require doctors to ' cut it out or suck it out , ' atx-101 will be a ' noninvasive , in - the - office procedure , ' according to dr. weinkle
side - effects include short - term swelling , bruising and numbness weinkle , a dermatologist who has been working with atx-101 - 101 since 2007 , said many people have fat underneath the chin , even if ' they 're not fat in the rest of their body ' , she told abc news
to insert the drug , weinkle marks the area where she sees the ' max amount of fat ' with a grid of tiny dots , which act as the injection sites for the atx-101
weinkle says the procedure only takes about five minutes and patients heal in two to three days - and do n't even need to wear a bandage
dr. derek jones , who presented atx-101 - 101 to the fda , said the drug destroys the membrane of the fat cells underneath the double chin
the atx-101 - 101 treatment only takes five minutes to administer and two to three days to heal this causes the fat cell to burst
as with any drug , there are side effects
they include short - lasting swelling , bruising and numbness that was found to be ' mild to moderate ' , according to dermatologist rotunda
