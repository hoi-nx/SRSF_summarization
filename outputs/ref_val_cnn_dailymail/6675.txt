keith allison of smithville , ohio , has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was fired by green local school district ' because he opposed dairy farming , on his personal facebook page , on his own time ' along with the photos , allison - who is a vegan â had also posted a message voicing his support for animals rights
' as someone who grew up feeling parental love and support , and now as a parent who gives love and support , i reject the claim that separating babies from loving mothers to raise them isolated in boxes can ever be considered humane , ' he wrote on the post
according to a lawsuit , school administrators told him he his contract would n't be renewed because of photos he had posted online showing baby calves in small crates ( stock photo ) ' i was also told that i could have any personal beliefs i want to have , but if i want to be a strong vegan advocate , i might want to look into doing something other than teaching
