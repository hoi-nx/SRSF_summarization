in a sport increasingly dominated by statistical analysis and calm dissection of performances it was reassuring to hear dan cole discuss the depth of anger felt by england âs players on reviewing their ireland no - show
dan cole , one of the few england stars to depart dublin with his reputation enhanced last sunday , revealed the extent of the frustration within the england squad at their misfiring display when their grand slam dream was broken by a series of tactical and technical blunders
stuart lancaster âs men held a debrief on tuesday at their five - star pennyhill park retreat in surrey and the video analysis made for uncomfortable viewing
dan cole has revealed the frustration felt by england 's squad as they relived the ireland defeat chief among their concerns was the spectacular first - half line - out fail which saw england hooker hartley throw straight to 6ft 10in ireland lock toner at the back when a clean catch and drive would have almost certainly yielded points
england âs repeated disciplinary infringements also led to a 13 to eight penalty deficit and dan cole admits watching the match again was deeply frustrating
â there is that frustration and it comes out in anger or whatever from coaches and players because they are frustrated in that regard
â ireland outmanoeuvred england by denying them scrummaging opportunities and by failing to implement the expected â choke tackle â , therefore denying the visitors the chance to play to their strengths
dan cole was one of the few englishmen to come out of the defeat in dublin with any credit â that line - out was a frustration
it was nât the reason we lost the game but next time we âll probably throw away from the 6ft 10 bloke with long arms ! â the england prop will hope his side can bounce back against scotland at twickenham next week while south african referee craig joubert took exception to much of england âs work at the break down , lancaster and his team hope frenchman romain poite will be more forgiving at twickenham against unfancied scotland next saturday
dan cole added : â referees have their strengths and weaknesses , just like players do
