england fans upset at the fa for switching the extra loyalty value of attending matches from away games to wembley will be infuriated at the way their appeal over the change has been ignored
the fa intend to carry on regardless awarding two caps to their england club members for coming to home games and one cap for trips abroad
for years it had been the other way round for the loyalty league table that will next be used to allocate fa tickets for what will be a hugely over-subscribed euro 2016
england supporters have chanted their upset - â two caps for wembley , you âre having a laugh â - at every international game since the rugby world cup and the matter was raised by fans chief clarke at the last fa council meeting
england fans are unhappy with the fa 's move to switch loyalty value of attending away games to wembley england supporters who attended england 's friendly in italy will have earned just one cap for the trip the fa board said they noted clarke âs concern
but rather than look fully into whether they had made the right decision , the fa are staying on the same course
they claim that the hardcore loyal support who go to home and away games are not being disadvantaged and that filling wembley is the over-riding priority
england fans ambassador kevin miles said : â we have appealed in the right way through our council representative and it will be disappointing in the extreme if our complaints are effectively ignored
the fa have not heard the last about this
