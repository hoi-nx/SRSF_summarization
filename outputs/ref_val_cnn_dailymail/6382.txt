caretaker boss kenny mcdowall fears rangers could be run out of the play - offs entirely â after they threw away a late lead against queen of the south to draw 1 - 1
on a night when john greig , walter smith and john brown returned to sit in the main stand alongside the new board - following the suspension of their predecessors earlier in the day - the team could nât match the renewed sense of optimism around ibrox
dropping another two points not only means hearts can win the scottish championship title before the month is out , it also keeps rangers in third place behind hibernian - with last night âs visitors only six points adrift
kenny mcdowall issues instructions to his layers during the 1 - 1 draw with queen of the south kenny mcdowall says his side must be wary of queen of the south in fourth and falkirk in fifth asked if he thought that either the dumfries side or falkirk could pip his team to the final play - off spot , kenny mcdowall said : â there is every chance
â queen of the south are a good side , as are falkirk

â a cool vuckic finish following a goalmouth scramble with 13 minutes remaining should have been enough to give rangers an ill - deserved three points from a bitty performance
but queen of the south equalised three minutes from time , 17 - year - old sub aidan on the spot â and granted plenty of time - to bury the rebound from a michael paton shot following a defensive mistake by home sub bilel moshni
the home team left the field to a smattering of boos from the second biggest ibrox crowd of the season
kenny mcdowall said : â it âs very disappointing , when supporters had come out , the new board is in place and the stadium is full
