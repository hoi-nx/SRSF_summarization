the magic and wizardry in hogg âs feet has already earned him a special mention from one of the scots rugby team âs most famous fans , jk rowling
but memories of last year âs shocking 20 - 0 defeat by england at murrayfield still pain the melrose - born 22 - year - old , even though he remains hopeful about unlocking the curse of twickenham , where the scots have not won since 1983
hogg is aiming for a first twickenham win for scotland since 1983 hogg and his team - mates have not had a happy campaign at home or away in the six nations this year hogg ( centre ) tries to shake off the attention of italy player joshua furno in the six nations game hogg is desperate to inspire scotland to victory over england at twickenham on saturday harry potter author jk rowling included hogg in a story about the wizarding world england âs world cup - winning coach sir clive woodward was particularly scathing of the scotland performance that day under scott johnson , claiming they were so toothless they would have been beaten by an also - ran aviva premership side
â last year âs game is one that we always keep in the back of our minds , â said hogg
it was probably the worst game i âve ever been involved with in a scotland jersey
â looking out onto the scene of that murrayfield defeat , hogg speaks candidly about england âs second - class opinions of scots rugby
hogg says losing to england last year was the worst game he 's been involved in our man nik simon sat down with hogg at the home of scots rugby ahead of the england game hogg 's scotland side have lost all three of their six nations games so far hogg breaks away to score the opening try during the six nations game against wales in february â i had a bit of pace when i was younger , so i could get away with things , â revealed hogg
â hogg was soon tearing down rugby pitches and went on to make his scotland debut as a 19 - year - old , coming on as a substitute against wales
hogg is hoping the scots will be able to give england something to think about when they clash â you want to get people on their feet and cheering , â said hogg
â with scotland , we go out there to enjoy and express ourselves
â hogg âs box - office style caught the eye of distant relatives in northern ireland , prompting them to get in touch and uncover the family connection to manchester united legend best through his late grandmother
keeping up the sporting tradition , hogg played as a defender in junior football â although he claims to have had â the touch of a baby elephant â â and is a fair - weather celtic and arsenal supporter
hogg holds on to the ball in scotland 's 22 - 19 defeat against italy in their last six nations game hogg ( third left ) tries to get past matias aguero for scotland against italy at murrayfield but rugby has always been his first love and he remains hopeful that scotland can deliver on the promise shown during head coach vern âs first autumn campaign last year
however , the six nations â defeats by france , wales and italy have stunted any progress made
the scots are huge underdogs for the final two matches , against the auld enemy and ireland , but hogg is convinced they can still salvage something from a campaign in which they are in danger of picking up the wooden spoon
â vern ( below ) was fairly quiet when he first came in but he is used to the environment now , â said hogg
â in the past , the scots have had a good autumn and then not backed it up in the six nations
hogg , for his part , will hope to discover his inner - wizard at twickenham this weekend
