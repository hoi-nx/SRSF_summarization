wenger is still haunted by the game which was the catalyst for manchester united âs greatest ever achievement
manchester united were down to 10 men and dennis bergkamp had missed a penalty for arsenal in the final minute of normal time with the game locked at 1 - 1
wenger looks on dejectedly after losing the fa cup semi-final replay to manchester united in 1999 dennis bergkamp ( right ) missed a penalty in that game in manchester united 's treble winning season ryan giggs ( right ) struck manchester united 's winner with a sensational solo effort to send them through to the final then on 109 minutes , patrick vieira misplaced a pass , ryan giggs picked up the ball in his own half and set off on a run which would end up in him revealing an alarming amount of chest hair after scoring one of the great goals in the history of the tournament
in wenger âs mind , it tipped the balance in the title race and provided the foundation for manchester united to achieve an unprecedented treble of fa cup , premier league and champions league
â i saw that goal again when ryan giggs retired
i think that goal won them the treble because , if dennis bergkamp scores , i think the game is over
â dennis bergkamp recalls missing the penalty in his book and admitted it bothered him for a while after the game ryan giggs ( second left ) will now take on wenger from the dugout as an assistant to louis van gaal wenger will be hoping to avenge the defeat by beating manchester united in monday 's fa cup quarter - final dennis bergkamp in his book , stillness and speed , said : â i still took the odd [ penalty ] without problems , without hesitation and without missing
â ray parlour , who was interviewed for the same book , said : â in those days it was only us and manchester united
dennis bergkamp , if he scores that penalty , we win the double because ... their heads would have gone down in the league
â as for monday , wenger said : â let âs not consider manchester united
