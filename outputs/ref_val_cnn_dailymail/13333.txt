washington updates on scott walker , marco rubio and john kasich , an economic twist on the old adage " all politics is local , " and an overseas vote where president obama would love to see an anti-incumbent backlash -- those stories filled our sunday trip around the " inside politics " table
" wisconsin gov. scott walker and former florida gov. jeb bush tend to be at the top of gop presidential polls these days , and a good deal has been written of late about a growing rivalry
but haberman of the new york times took us inside some recent big - money conversations during which scott walker took a more diplomatic approach when asked about his potential nomination rival
scott walker was in new york city last week for fund - raising meet and greets , and he met with some hedge fund executives who were very impressed by him
" he was asked how he would beat jeb bush , and he surprised a bunch of people by saying jeb bush is the front - runner , " said haberman
" " but that is his sell to people who could give him money , which is : ' no , no , ( jeb bush ) is the front - runner but i 'm the slow and steady guy who 's going to come up behind , just like when i ran track when i was younger

jeb bush 's aggressive entry into the race raised some questions about whether there would still be space for marco rubio to tap florida 's deep fund - raising well
then came the scott walker boomlet , and talk among some conservatives that the wisconsin governor -- not marco rubio -- might be the best pick for a new generation gop standard - bearer
but marco rubio has continued to build his team and travel to the early states on the nomination calendar , and costa of the washington post shared news of a developing relationship between the senator and the party 's 2012 nominee , mitt romney
" he 's spoken with mitt romney twice since mitt romney decided not to get in the race , " said costa
" and he has had meetings this week with people like lanhee chen , mitt romney 's former policy director , and texts often with spencer zwick , mitt romney 's former finance director
