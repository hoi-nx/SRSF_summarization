where there is muck there really is brass with scientists claiming that millions can be made by extracting gold from human waste
in fact as well as gold , faeces contains platinum , silver and other metals along with rare elements such as palladium and vanadium
scientists have discovered a literal goldmine of precious metals in human poo.the americans researchers are investigating ways of flushing out the valuable minerals , including gold , silver and rare elements such as palladium and vanadium
pictured are microscopic gold - rich and lead - rich particles in human waste taking a lesson from industrial mining , the scientists are experimenting with chemicals called leachates that are used to pull metals out of rock
in the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum , silver and gold observing microscopic - sized metal particles in biosolids
previous research estimated the waste from one million americans could contain as much as $ 12 million ( Â£ 8.7 million ) worth of metals
if britain 's waste was mined it could be worth $ 762 million ( Â£ 510 million ) a year
dr smith of the geological survey said : ' if you can get rid of some of the nuisance metals that currently limit how much of these biosolids we can use on fields and forests , and at the same time recover valuable metals and other elements , that 's a win - win
in the americans alone seven million tons are leftover each year with half used as fertiliser on fields and in forests and the other half incinerated or sent to landfills
