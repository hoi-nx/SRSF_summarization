riding the crisp green waves that break into a whirl of foam on costa rica 's pacific shore , hill looks like he could surf before he could walk
he first paddled out to the big blue when he was a teenager , but his professional life took a different turn when he embarked on a fine art degree in london
in the end , the pull of the waves was too strong and hill decamped to costa rica with a goal to create a surfing school with a difference
hill 's fine art credentials have not gone to waste though , as his creative training helped him design the website as well as the resort logo
while following his passion for surfing was important , hill stresses that figuring out how to make money out of it was equally significant
" the business side of it has to work , the numbers have to make sense
