in a radio interview set for broadcast on sunday , mason complains that obama ' does n't see that hamas is a problem
' ' i 'm not saying he is on the side of the people who literally want to wipe us out , ' mason cautioned , ' but if he 's not on their side , it 's certainly hard to tell which side he 's on
' mason phoned the tel aviv - based aaron klein investigative radio program from his home in new york
scroll down for an audio clip biting : comedian mason lashed out at obama , saying ' you do n't hear him attacking hamas half as much as he is attacking netanyahu ' finger pointing : obama has been on a streak of aggressive reactions to israel prime minister netanyahu 's come - from - behind re-election on tuesday the sharp - tongued comedian focused on the white house 's continued objection to settlements build by the israel government in places the palestinian considers ' occupied ' territories
' how often have you heard him say " we have to do something because we have to put a stop to hamas 's aggressions " ? to hamas bombing israel every day ? to all the bombs that are falling ? ' mason asked
radio host aaron klein scored the interview with mason , who called the tel aviv - based program from his new york home ' i never heard him complain
... he wants a peace - making process that will leave hamas intact and [ so ] that the enemies of israel should n't be too disturbed
