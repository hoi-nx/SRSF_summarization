poyet has hit out at the premier league for the scoring system used in the fair play table in which sunderland are rock bottom
the sunderland boss is currently contesting an fa charge of improper conduct after he kicked over a drinks bucket and was sent to the stands during the 1 - 1 draw at hull earlier this month
sunderland 's poyet has hit out at the premier league for the scoring system used in the fair play table but poyet is at a loss to explain why his side are considered the least sporting in the top flight
â i do nât know how they get the points - it âs so superficial , â said poyet of the table which takes into consideration factors such as positive play , respect towards opponents and behaviour of the coaching team
â until two months ago we had nât had a sending off , so how can we be bottom ? poyet and bruce argue during their two sides ' clash on wednesday evening at the kc stadium bruce ( left ) had to be held back by the linesman as the row between the pair escalated â maybe when i wave my arms , that âs minus one
â i do nât care who âs in charge of the fair play rules , but they âre not fair
â referencing newcastle âs cisse and united âs evans being banned for spitting , poyet added : â how many points is it for someone spitting at someone ? three million ? newcastle 's cisse and united 's evans squared at st james ' park cisse has been banned for seven games , while evans has received a six game suspension â me , i âd use common sense
â meanwhile , poyet âs side â without a win in five â have another fight at the wrong end of the premier league table and face relegation rivals villa this afternoon
