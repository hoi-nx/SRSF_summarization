a group of friends and their children who are living together in a nine - bedroom home in connecticut could be forced out because they are n't all related
the three couples , their three children and two single friends face being separated because the city of hartford says the living arrangement violates its historic district 's zoning code , which says that no more than two unrelated people can live in one of its homes , cbs reported
but the group , who moved into the spacious home in the west end neighborhood last august , said they believe they are promoting great values
' the values i 'm speaking of are sustainability , cooperation , living more , living well but within your means
but last year , a neighbor complained to the city , which determined they were violating the zoning code , which was historically set up to avoid people turning their homes in the beautiful district into boarding houses
all together : the residents , who laughed as they said they were not a cult , share responsibility for chores working as one : the group members showed cbs this morning how they list projects needed to be carried out at the house ; everyone chips into the cost of repairs on the home , they said the group appealed but lost and now have to decide on if they should go to court or go their different ways
