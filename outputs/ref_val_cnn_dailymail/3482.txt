researchers have uncovered the mystery of mercury 's ' stealth ' colour scheme
the say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted mercury black over billions of years
it solves the mystery of mercury 's unusual colouring - which has baffled scientists
the say a steady dusting of carbon from passing comets has slowly painted mercury with a dark ' stealth ' coating over billions of years
cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight , so mercury would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets
using a model of impact delivery and a known estimate of micrometeorite flux at mercury , researchers calculated suggest that after billions of years of bombardment , mercury 's surface should be anywhere from 3 to 6 percent carbon
' it 's long been hypothesized that there 's a mystery darkening agent that 's contributing to mercury 's low reflectance , ' said bruck syal , a postdoctoral researcher at lawrence livermore national laboratory who performed this research while a graduate student at brown
as comets approach mercury 's neighborhood near the sun , they often start to break apart
cometary dust is composed of as much as 25 percent carbon by weight , so mercury would be exposed to a steady bombardment of carbon from these crumbling comets
using a model of impact delivery and a known estimate of micrometeorite flux at mercury , bruck syal was able to estimate how often cometary material would impact mercury , how much carbon would stick to mercury 's surface , and how much would be thrown back into space
her calculations suggest that after billions of years of bombardment , mercury 's surface should be anywhere from 3 to 6 percent carbon
' and that paint has been building up on mercury 's surface for billions of years
