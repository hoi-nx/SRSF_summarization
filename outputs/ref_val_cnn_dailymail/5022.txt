but this nondescript garage in sunnyvale , california , is where apple is believed to be building its self driving ' titan ' cars
the building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named sixtyeight research
claims that apple is building a car may seem like a leap , but it is n't the first time such projects have been discussed by the california firm
in an interview last year , apple board member mickey drexler said that before his death in 2011 steve jobs had considered building a car
' ' two people with knowledge of the project say apple has been working on it and receiving shipments related to its development at a building just minutes from 1 infinite loop , in the town of sunnyvale , ' wrote appleinsider
' we can confirm that apple does indeed have a large presence at the location , and that numerous automotive - related renovations , including an ' auto work area ' and a ' repair garage , ' have been constructed on the premises
' the building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named sixtyeight research
aside from a sparse website registered through godaddy less than a year ago that reveals virtually no information about the company , sixtyeight research has no discernible online presence
the building is apparently known as sg5 within apple , and issues visitor passes identical to apple 's - minus the logo
apple could have an electric car ready to go on sale by 2020 , putting it in direct competition with rivals tesla and gm , according to an industry expert
evidence is mounting that the tech giant is gearing up to revolutionise the automobile market , just as it did with smartphones and tablets
images taken over the past few weeks have shown a prototype car that suggests apple is testing the water - ahead of a release in as little as five years
when appleinsider visited sixtyeight research 's headquarters at building ' 175 ' earlier this week , its windows were a ' frosted ' opaque , and security cameras were visible outside
bloomberg has claimed that apple could have a car ready by 2020 , based on images of a test car
after the first mysterious camera - mounted car was spotted in california last week , further sightings of apple 's minivans have been posted online , with equipment on top ( shown here ) according to tim higgins from bloomberg , automakers ' typically spend five to seven years developing a car '
and a 2020 timeframe would underscore apple 's ' aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with tesla and gm ' both of those are planning to release a sub- Â£ 26,000 ( $ 40,000 ) electric car in 2017 that can travel more than 200 miles ( 320km ) on a single charge
steve levine , author of ' the powerhouse , ' a book about the automotive battery industry , said on bloomberg tv thursday : ' was gm really going to be able to match tesla ? apple can
' this latest speculation follows sightings of mysterious camera - mounted cars registered to apple in the us last week
the latest vans have n't officially been confirmed as belonging to apple , but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are
the far - reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims apple is developing a mapping service
in an interview last year , apple board member mickey drexler said that before his death in 2011 , steve jobs had considered building a car
an unnamed apple employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that ' will change the landscape and give tesla a run for its money
' it followed sightings of an apple - owned car fitted with cameras ( pictured ) in california in particular , apple may be working on an electric car to rival tesla 's range ( the tesla p85d is pictured ) or the email could be referring to an advanced iphone in - car control system that would rival tesla 's software the head of self - driving cars for google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years
with 12 cameras on top of the mysterious apple car , some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like google 's street view ( pictured left )
