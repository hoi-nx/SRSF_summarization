i can remember so clearly visiting the hospital to see kell brook the day after that horrific knife attack in tenerife
as soon as i walked in i looked into his eyes and i knew exactly what he was thinking - is it all over ? the wound was horrific , some 38 staples virtually holding his thigh together
