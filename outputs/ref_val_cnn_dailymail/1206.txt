homeland will not be featuring any stories based on isis because its producers think the group are too barbaric and too ' evil ' to appear on their show
the showtime series has dealt with terror cells and double agents across the world , but dramatizing isis and one its leaders jihadi john is not on the agenda
executive producer alex gansa revealed that writers have been asked to steer clear of the subject matter as he can not see any way of humanizing their vile actions
he confirmed that the show will not be ending anytime soon and leading star claire insisted that she is committed long term too

radically different : season five ( pictured ) will be set in europe with carrie out of the intelligence agency reinventing : alex gansa insists the show has the potential to change rather than sticking with middle eastern terror claire announced she is staying on as the lead character , adding that it is her ' dream job ' ' and once we stopped doing that then we will stop
' i am never bored the writers are relentless in redesigning the show every season and she 's naturally dynamic but they put her in such different circumstances and environments that she had different facets of her revealed and to me even
