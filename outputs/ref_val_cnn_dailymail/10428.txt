health secretary jeremy hunt is to issue a humiliating apology after mail on sunday exposed him for misleading the house of commons over who will foot the huge compensation bill for victims of savile
in a statement to the house of commons last week , mr jeremy hunt pledged that savile âs charities are responsible for paying up to Â£ 40 million due
but this newspaper can reveal that the charities are exempt â and that it is the nhs which is liable
the mail on sunday has also learnt that a further bill , which may eventually be as large , will be met by bbc licence fee payers
she said the nhs had not set aside a â specific pot â of money , but added : â we are committed to picking up any claims the estate can not cover
â the savile estate is already effectively bankrupt
mr jeremy hunt addressed the commons after the publication of reports which detailed savile âs abuse of victims at stoke mandeville hospital in buckinghamshire and elsewhere
he told mps that a total of Â£ 40 million was still â under management â in two charities savile established and â that money will be made available to meet claims made by savile âs victims â
â savile founded the charities , mainly to fund healthcare , they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate , which is already effectively bankrupt however , although savile founded the charities , mainly to fund healthcare , they were run by independent trustees and formed no part of his estate
summers , the charities â solicitor , said : â there is no way funds in a charity can be used to pay compensation to victims , as this is not permitted by charity law
the only funds that can be used to pay compensation are the estate funds
â the bbc has also agreed to pay the legal costs and damages for those abused on its premises
yesterday a spokesman refused to reveal how much the corporation had earmarked , saying only : â the terms of the scheme were agreed with lawyers for the victims , as well as the nhs and the savile estate
