four a&e consultants who resigned from the hospital in redditch last month , have written an open letter to the trust branding it a ' disgrace ' and claiming they were put under ' unbearable pressure ' ' this is a disgrace and a patient safety issue which causes serious harm to many patients and intolerable stress on all a&e staff
' we can no longer see a way forward to secure safe and sustainable a&e services at the hospital especially whilst the current senior management and senior clinical leadership remains in place
' the consultants also say they invested years of work into maintaining patient care but felt decisions made by the trust 's management had ' undermined ' services at the hospital
they added that they feared resources were ' heavily weighted ' in favour of people in worcester at the expense of patients in nearby redditch who use the hospital
the letter is not signed by the fifth consultant , who worked at the worcestershire royal hospital
a statement read : ' we are disappointed that our ed colleagues have not acknowledged the serious challenges to nhs services in this area that drove the need to review and reconfigure key medical services â changes that are essential to improve patient care across the entire county and beyond
the trust said it is disappointed the doctors did not recognise the pressure the nhs services in the area were under it added : ' unfortunately , recruitment efforts for years have failed to improve the shortfall of medical staff at the hospital , and this is predicted to cause potential risks for patients in the future
' change , even when essential for patient care , can be difficult and inconvenient for staff , but facts need to be faced and will not be altered if we fail to confront them
' the consultants ' letter praised the team they worked with in the emergency department at the hospital
' we have built a unit which is recognised for good patient care and excellent training , ' they said
venables , the trust 's chief executive said : ' we are disappointed that a number of our a&e consultants have decided to leave us in order to work for another trust
