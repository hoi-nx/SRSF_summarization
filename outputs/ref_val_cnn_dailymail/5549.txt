despite the unpopularity of an snp - labour alliance , mr alex salmond - who has taken to drinking pink champagne in the afternoon - has revealed that the party will do whatever it can to make mr ed miliband prime minister in order to wring as many concessions out of him as possible
the revelation comes after david cameron said mr ed miliband had given up trying to win the election outright and was pinning all his hopes on the snp helping him over the line
labour has ruled out a formal labour - snp coalition but not the prospect of working on a vote - by - vote basis if it fails to win enough seats to govern alone
david cameron said alex salmond had taken the entire labour hostage and was using ed miliband as his poodle just under half the public think a labour majority government is the worst possible outcome - compared to 45 per cent who said a tory majority was the worst result
a quarter said they would be ' delighted ' or would not mind a labour - snp alliance , compared with a third broadly positive about lab - lib dem coalition , 37 per cent positive about another tory - lib dem pact , 41 per cent backing a labour majority and 46 per cent a tory majority

today 's yougov poll of 8,271 uk voters , including 633 in scotland , suggests the snp could be on course to take about half of former lib dem and labour voters in scotland , and even a fifth of former tory voters
the tories have released a campaign video showing alex salmond ' calling ed miliband 's tune ' half of 2010 lib dem voters said they will definitely or may possibly vote snp in may while 44 per cent of former labour voters and 20 per cent of former tory voters said the same
two - thirds of people in scotland would be dismayed by another tory - lib dem coalition while 52 per cent would not like a lab - lib dem democrat coalition
