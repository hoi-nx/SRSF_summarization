and her popularity has taken an especially hard hit since the public became aware that she operated a private email system while serving in president obama 's cabinet
a cnn / orc international survey taken last weekend , after clinton held a press conference at which she tried to explain away her secret server , found that clinton 's high approval ratings as an obama administration official had entirely eroded

throughout her time as the country 's chief diplomat clinton generally enjoyed favorability ratings in the ' 60s
her last known paid speech is this week a total of 51 percent of respondents to cnn 's poll said they believe the email system revelations to be either very or somewhat serious in nature compared the combined 48 percent who said the controversy was not too serious or ' not a problem at all
still , 52 percent said clinton 's actions do n't disqualify her from serving as commander in chief , and 57 percent said they 'd be ' proud ' to have her in the oval office - up from 50 percent the last time cnn 's pollsters asked potential voters the same question in march of 2014 .
