hate preacher choudary has been invited to speak at the union despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group hate preacher choudary has been invited to speak at the union despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group
the notorious rabble rouser received his invitation from the debating society a day before home secretary theresa may announced a crackdown on islam extremists
the letter said it would be a ' great privilege ' to have choudary appear as the star guest
choudary , who once said that woolwich terror victim fusilier lee rigby would ' burn in hellfire ' , was even offered a choice of days on which to attend the debate entitled : this house believes that radicalism is born at home
britain 's most notorious hate preacher proudly showed off his invitation after launching a hate - filled rant against western society outside the houses of parliament yesterday
he said : ' i am still on police bail after being arrested by scotland yard in september last year
they ca n't stop me from going to the union where i 've been invited to speak
choudary , 47 , was arrested at an unknown location after fleeing his home in the middle of the night in the wake of threats from far - right groups
choudary , who founded the radical islam group al-muhajiroun 20 years ago which was later banned , is seen as a recruiting sergeant for britain 's radical islam
he has played a cynical cat - and - mouse game with britain authorities and has been careful to keep his incendiary speeches on the right side of britain 's hate law
the union is famous for its normally high - minded debates , in which britain 's academic elite and their often very distinguished guests discuss the key issues of our time speaking after a home office banning order , the preacher said : ' if they arrest me and put me in prison , i will carry on in prison
' despite this , the union are willing to invite him to take part in a debate alongside impressionable young undergraduates
yesterday choudary launched a tirade of venom at the britain establishment after mrs may said the home office is drawing up a blacklist of extremist individuals and organisations with whom the government and public sector should not engage
choudary also said he would be happy to travel to syria to live with the terror group if the police gave him his passport back
' there is nothing anyone can do to prevent it , ' choudary said
i have no doubt that one day the whole of the world will be governed by sharia and the flag of islam will fly over big ben , when justice prevails
last night it declined to comment on choudary 's invitation .
