more than 200,000 britons second home owners are celebrating a decisive victory over french tax laws
the european court of justice has ruled that president franã§ois hollande 's eye - watering charge targeting second homes violated europe law , the telegraph reported
victoire : britons citizens who own second homes in french , like this attractive stone manoir in sarlat-la-caneda , southern french , left , will no longer have to pay the large ' social contribution ' charge levied by french president franã§ois hollande , right , and can apply to the french government for a payout in 2012 , franã§ois hollande 's socialist government introduced painful new charges on second home owners , which hit hundreds of thousands of britons
tax on rental income from second homes was raised from 20 per cent to 35.5 per cent , while capital gains tax was increased from 19 to 34.5 per cent
a mandatory , 15.5 per cent ' social contribution ' was introduced on both capital gains and rental income , raising an additional â¬ 250 million a year for the french welfare system
moreover , since the charge was categorised as a ' contribution ' rather than a tax , it did not qualify for britons 's double - taxation treaty with french , meaning that britons second home owners were effectively being taxed twice
according to calculations by the telegraph , this meant that a britons couple who bought a french home for â¬ 200,000 20 years ago and sold it for â¬ 750,000 would be forced to pay a painful â¬ 60,000 ' social contribution ' on top of standard capital gains tax , which would not be acknowledged by the britons tax system
but now the european court of justice in luxembourg , the eu 's highest court , ruled that the ' social contribution ' charge violated eu law because it is illegal for eu citizens to contribute towards the social security systems of two member states at once
