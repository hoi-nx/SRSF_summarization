the state department only last month started automatically preserving dozens of high - level officials ' emails , according to a department spokeswoman , a revelation that comes amid the controversy surrounding former secretary of state hillary clinton 's own email use
this is key because hillary clinton , in her news conference on tuesday to answer questions about why she exclusively used a private email address to communicate during her tenure , told reporters she 'd thought her communications to senior department officials were always saved
" in meeting the record - keeping obligations , it was my practice to email government officials on their state or dot - gov accounts so that the emails were immediately captured and preserved , " she said
the news about the state department 's archiving practices -- and the change that started in february -- could refuel the furor of republican over hillary clinton 's choice to not use her government email account , to have a private server in her family home house her emails , and to decide ( with her staff ) which emails to delete and which to turn over to the state department for review
rep. susan brooks , a member of the select committee investigating the 2012 benghazi attack , said in the republican ' weekly media address saturday , " you see , right now there is no way for us to know whether we have all of the state department communications that rightfully belong to the american people
" " the only way to truly know is by having access to secretary hillary clinton 's personal server , " the indiana republican added
" so far , brooks ' committee had gotten just under 300 of hillary clinton 's emails from the state department
the fact that all emails from senior officials were n't automatically saved until recently does n't mean they are gone , according to the state department
at the same time , psaki said the state department chose to change its approach -- by automatically saving all emails -- " because it 's an imperfect system
even before last month 's chance , emails of current secretary of state john kerry , who uses a government address , were already being saved automatically
