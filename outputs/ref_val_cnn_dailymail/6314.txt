the atf says the agency received more than 80,000 public comments on the proposal to outlaw some types of 5.56 mm rounds â also known as .223 caliber ammunition
the ammunition targeted by the atf is commonly known as ' green - tip ' because of its distinctive appearance
green - tip : the popular rifle ammunition is no longer being targeted for extinction by the atf hunters and target shooters use the bullets , primarily in ar-15 - style rifles like this one , but the ammo could travel fast enough from a handgun to pierce a police officer 's body armor uncle : the atf decided tuesday that it could n't withstand an onslaught from legislators and the public ' although atf endeavored to create a proposal that reflected a good faith interpretation of the law and balanced the interests of law enforcement , industry , and sportsmen , the vast majority of the comments received to date are critical of the framework , and include issues that deserve further study , ' the agency said in a press release
the atf had proposed banning the ammunition , most commonly used in the popular ar-15 - style rifles , because they could potentially penetrate a police officer 's protective vest if fired from a handgun instead
the law enforcement officers protection act banned armor - piercing handgun ammunition in 1986
green - tip ammo has long been exempt because it 's primarily used in hunting and target - shooting rifles
the atf 's proposal would have removed that exemption , effectively banning its sale in the america
' last week goodlatte and 238 other house members , including seven democrats , sent a verbal stop sign to the atf
' under no circumstances should atf adopt a standard that will ban ammunition that is overwhelmingly used by law - abiding america for legitimate purposes , ' the lawmakers wrote to atf director jones
on monday a group of 53 gop senators complained in a similar letter to jones that efforts to respect the second amendment to the u.s. constitution â which protects the ' right to bear arms ' â ' require not only access to firearms , but to bullets
' vast majority of the comments ... are critical ' : atf 's message to america admitted that hardly anyone supported them the atf ( atf ) is a justice department agency in charge of regulating access to a wide variety of materials rifle owners complained that without the green - tip ammo , their guns could become useless overnight ' today 's announcement proves what we have said all along â this was 100 % political , ' national rifle association executive vice president wayne lapierre said in a statement
that bill proposed to generally limit the atf 's power to regulate ammunition
