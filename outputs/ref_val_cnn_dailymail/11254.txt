a woman who negotiated a year - long ' open marriage ' with the husband she 'd been with for 17 years and took the chance to sleep with 12 strangers has opened up about her wild year

' wild oats ' : robin wright , 50 , negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years , which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship but during her year of abandon , she bedded ten men and two women , whom she picked up online , in bars and at sex classes
she made the life - changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008 - and has written a book about her exploits called the wild oats project
struggle : wright said her husband , scott mansfield , right , was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children , driving her to want lovers instead reliving the fraught decision in her book , she wrote : ' i refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers ... if i ca nât have one , i must have the other '
under the terms of her new deal , rinaldi took out an apartment , where she lived from monday to friday and would bed her conquests
