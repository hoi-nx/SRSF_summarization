on a damp day at white hart lane just over 50 years ago we gathered to report on mackay making his comeback from a broken leg
we were about to witness the amazing proof of what many us believed , that mackay was the hardest man of all in an era of footballers who tackled like tanks
the short , stocky , powerful wing - half who is enshrined in spurs folklore as â the heartbeat â of the first team to achieve the league championship and fa cup double after the second world war had sustained a left leg fracture in a collision with manchester united âs noel cantwell at old trafford

typically , mackay went thundering in for the ball
the pain must have been excruciating but mackay insisted on checking the diagnosis personally
that was why he disliked that iconic photograph of him grabbing a startled billy bremner by his leeds shirt neck at wembley

yet he regretted that the iron man image tended to obscure his remarkable ability
â i can pass the bloody ball , you know , â he would rasp in that scottish brogue brought down from hearts
danny blanchflower , the thinking man âs footballer , was esteemed as the brains of the team but mackay was very much more than the brawn
conscious of his role as a spurs figurehead mackay always dressed â properly â and his one sortie into commerce was to join his lifelong friend and tottenham fan jimmy burton in a tie manufacturing business
