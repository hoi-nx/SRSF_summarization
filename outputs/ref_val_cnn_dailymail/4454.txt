yet celtic are closer to their promised land after routing the arabs in scottish football âs answer to the six - day war
exhausted â mentally and physically â by three losses in a week to a side with more depth , energy and firepower
the tayside team fancied their chances after holding on for a 1 - 1 scottish cup draw with nine men a fortnight ago
then celtic won the final
and followed it with a thumping 4 - 0 victory in last wednesday âs scottish cup replay
jason denayer celebrates with his team - mates after giving celtic a three - goal lead before half - time jason denayer taps home from close range as celtic record comfortable victory against dundee united battered and bruised , dundee united were gone then
long before they found themselves three goals down in the first half of this league match
all told , celtic and dundee united met four times in two weeks
proof , if it were needed , that this was celtic âs week
â john guidetti struck to make it 2 - 0 to ronny deila 's side after 33 minutes at celtic park on saturday the scottish cup looks the last substantial hurdle
â celtic are playing at a top level
john guidetti is congratulated by his team - mates after doubling the home side 's lead â we have a huge squad and everyone is in their best form
it âs difficult for the manager to pick his starting line - up
for the fourth meeting with dundee united in a fortnight , ronny deila replaced his entire front four
leigh griffiths , kris commons , james forrest and anthony stokes made way for john guidetti , stefan johansen , armstrong and gary mackay-steven
gary mackay-steven and armstrong were dundee united âs star players until they were sold to celtic for Â£ 2million in january
gary mackay-steven opened the scoring against his former club to set up victory for celtic once again , tannadice chairman stephen thompson had cause to ponder if it was worth it when gary mackay-steven smashed a superb opening goal in 16 minutes , accepting a simple ambrose pass and winding up for a swerving left - foot shot from fully 25 yards
why john guidetti did likewise after doubling the lead in 33 minutes with a looping , deflected shot into the top corner was harder to work out
by then , celtic were playing a training game
there was a brief flash of the old enmity when paul paton was lucky to escape a red card for a wild , scything tackle on gary mackay-steven on the stroke of half - time
if a yellow was a lenient punishment , celtic added to the penalty by scoring a third when van dijk thumped stefan johansen âs low free - kick towards goal before jason denayer intercepted and cheekily back heeled into the net for 3 - 0
gary mackay-steven ( left ) celebrates his goal with stefan johansen during the scottish premiership match the belgian has found a rich vein of form and , as with van dijk , the celtic support should enjoy him while they can
dundee united came close just once , when substitute ryan dow had a dipping , long - range effort tipped over the bar by craig gordon
i was a bit angry at half - time about belief and not just pride , but in terms of doing things and not feeling sorry for themselves
we rolled up our sleeves , though it could be argued that celtic took their feet off the gas
only three times in celtic âs 127 - year history have the club won a treble and they are now tantalisingly close to a fourth
everyone wants to beat celtic
the green brigade sang his name on saturday , prompting a wry chuckle from a player who seems a little safer at right - back than centre - half
â the celtic supporters are the best in the world , â said the defender , â i will give them credit for that
â of late , ronny deila âs celtic have managed not only to correct their early season mistakes , but eradicate them
