doctors who measured how much energy three couples expended during day - to - day activities found large differences between the amounts men and women used
no time to relax : women burn far fewer calories watching tv on the sofa than their partners do all six ate a 600 - calorie fry - up before each couple was assigned a different activity : an hour in the gym , three hours of cleaning , or lounging about
the results are to be shown in a bbc1 programme , the truth about calories
presenter dr van tulleken said women tended to burn fewer calories at rest than men because they did not weigh as much and had less energy - hungry muscle mass. â bigger people burn more calories than smaller ones , â he said
dr van tulleken said : â moderate continuous activity uses more calories , and body size and lifestyle â what you do with your day â also play a much more important part than you might think when it comes to calorie consumption
