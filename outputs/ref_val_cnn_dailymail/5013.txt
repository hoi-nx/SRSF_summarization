a natural reaction for a mother is to want to alleviate their child 's pain but just two doses of a mainstream painkiller saw a seven month old baby almost lose her short life
shaw , from toowoomba , about 120km west of brisbane in queensland , is no stranger to motherhood , having had six children in 13 years
what started out at as a head cold quickly left doctors completely baffled as precious little chasely rapidly deteriorated with her skin burning , swelling and blistering so much that she became unidentifiable to her mother
' ms shaw , a whole food chef who blogs on health and wellbeing , gave chasely two doses of nurofen on tuesday february 26 as she was miserable after battling the head cold for the past week
this was the first time that the seven - month - old had ever taken any medication before but ms shaw thought nothing of it as all of her other five children had taken nurofen in the past
' ms shaw immediately had a gut feeling that her little girl has reacted to the medication and read the back of the bottle for potential side effects
' i remember scouring the nurofen bottle for a list of symptoms that might signal an allergic reaction , but could n't find much at all , ' she said
' the nasty blister on her ear ( left ) and her precious skin shedding off all over her body ( right ) the seven - month old became unidentifiable to her own mother who was told by doctors to expect the worst casely needed to be given the powerful painkiller endone to ease her excruciating pain after a very restless night with her unhappy little one - ms shaw knew they had to go to the hospital
' ' i hugged her , i whispered in her ear that i needed her to fight on , ' ms shaw said to her sick little girl finally a specialist paediatric doctor suggested it may have been an extremely rare condition called steven johnson âs syndrome - a potentially deadly skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction
' when ms shaw woke on friday morning , she said she could n't even recognise her own baby
' it was at this point that ms shaw broke down unable to comprehend a life without her beautiful little girl
' but ms shaw decided they were not giving up without a fight
ms shaw cried when she saw chasely catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror and start laughing by monday chasely 's fluid infusions were removed and she was becoming increasingly more like herself numbing gel was used in chasely 's mouth so she could continue feeding and breast milk was used on her wounds along with lukewarm baths with paraffin and later with paw paw
the pain was so bad that she had to be given endone which ms shaw said was extremely frightening as it 's such a heavy duty pain killer but knew she had no choice
the following day , her swelling started to go down and parts of her body that had blistered first started to heal and ms shaw began to recognise her little girl again
chasely must now avoid all steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ms shaw says that they still have a long journey ahead to learn more about her daughter 's condition
' ' nurofen is very sorry to hear about chasely shaw âs condition and are glad to hear she is recovering
sjs ( sjs ) is an extremely rare but known reaction to a multitude of triggers such as infections , medications or illness
the exact cause for the reaction is currently unknown and the reaction is unpredictable although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , a group of medicines that includes ibuprofen , have also been associated with rare cases of sjs , there is no confirmed causal link allergic skin reactions of this type are extremely rare
all nurofen for children packs include warnings for consumers to stop taking and see a healthcare professional immediately if an allergic reaction occurs
' ' we are absolutely blessed - it puts everything into perspective and everything else just drops away - nothing else in the world matters , ' ms shaw said
