on arrival ritchie , the manager , tells me his philosophy is â to give guests more than they expect â , and at first glance it âs hard to tell who âs happier â the 350 guests or the 500 staff

marcus hands me a mobile telephone and says : â anything you need , i âm a phone call away
â from my private infinity pool , i look out over the fort , and reflect on what i know about grenada
