taken at the atmen refugee camp on syria 's border with turkish last december , the image shows the young girl frozen in fear with her arms raised and her lips tightly pursed
the child has been identified as adi hudea , whose father died in the 2012 hama massacre and who has been living with her traumatised mother and three siblings at camp atmen ever since
palestine - based photojournalist shaban tweeted the image along with the caption : ' thought he has a weapon not a camera so she gave up '

but bbc trending have subsequently spoken to osman sagirli himself who confirmed the image shows a little girl
