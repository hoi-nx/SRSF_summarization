" a man at the pool had started hurling insults at him , " douglas writes
" douglas went to talk to the man -- " it was not a pleasant discussion , " he writes -- and the incident has stayed in his mind
the 70 - year - old actor , who was raised by a jews father , kirk douglas , and a non-jewish mother , said he did n't identify as jews while growing up but noticed anti-semitic remarks others made
" douglas , who is also a united nations messenger of peace , observes that anti-semitism has been on the rise due to a number of factors , including income inequality , religious extremism and hatred of israel
" if we confront anti-semitism whenever we see it , if we combat it individually and as a society , and use whatever platform we have to denounce it , we can stop the spread of this madness , " he writes
he is fortunate to live in a country where anti-semitism is rare
" douglas received the 2015 genesis prize for " exceptional people whose values and achievements will inspire the next generation of jews
