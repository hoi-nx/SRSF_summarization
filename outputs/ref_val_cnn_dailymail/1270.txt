as the clock ticked down on celtic âs league cup final win , goalkeeper gordon looked in a world of his own as he glanced around hampden park , savouring every last moment
when the final whistle confirmed his first winners â medal since the scottish cup victory over gretna on penalties with hearts in 2006 , the goalkeeper immediately searched out the twin lights who had inspired his incredible comeback story
over the course of his two long years out injured , four year old daughter freya and then the arrival of little emma , now 22 - months old , provided both fortitude and hope in what was a seemingly endless dark tunnel for gordon
scott brown lifts the scottish league cup alongside keeper gordon ( right ) on sunday once britain âs most expensive keeper , his girls now found their daddy a house - husband , unemployed after being released by sunderland in the summer of 2012 due to knee tendon and anterior cruciate ligament injuries
neither daughter knew him as gordon , scotland hero and scottish cup - winning goalkeeper ; the man who had once been voted as having made the best save in the 20 - year history of the english premier league
and the longer his spell out of the game continued , the more the 32 - year - old âs retirement looked a weary inevitability

â i took a moment or two towards the end to think about things , â admitted gordon , his lips visibly quivering with emotion after the 2 - 0 win against dundee united

gordon pumps his fists in celebration as celtic defeated dundee united in the scottish league cup final â when i was injured , i just wanted to play a game of football again
when i first signed for celtic last summer , fraser forster was still here as no 1 goalkeeper
â we âve got a difficult game on wednesday night against dundee united in the scottish cup quarter - final replay and this result today might give dundee united an added incentive to come out and have an even bigger go at us
â i thought dundee united played pretty well today even with 10 men
