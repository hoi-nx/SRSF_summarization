face - off : kenyan president kenyatta has met philip hammond kenyan is threatening to tear up a 40 - year military co-operation deal with the uk amid claims that uk soldiers â who have allegedly committed serious crimes in the country â are escaping justice
the british army could lose some of its best training facilities worldwide if it does not agree that any soldier accused of crimes should be dealt with under kenyan law , rather than returned to the uk
uk soldiers have been accused of crimes while serving in kenyan , but none have been prosecuted , despite allegations of serious assault and affray , alleged rape and murder , and protests by dozens of women that they were abandoned by soldiers who fathered children with them
kenyan president kenyatta has now made the ultimatum to foreign secretary philip hammond during tense diplomatic negotiations over a long - standing deal which has allowed up to 10,000 uk troops a year to carry out exercises in kenyan âs harsh terrain before deploying to active operations in theatres such as afghanistan and iraq
brigadier duncan francis , defence adviser to the british high commission in nairobi , claimed uk soldiers had always been accountable for any crimes committed in kenyan â under kenyan or uk law â , and pointed out that uk was kenyan âs â most steadfast ally on defence and security matters â
but presidential adviser manoah esipisu said the country âs new constitution required that uk soldiers accused of offences in kenyan must be prosecuted under kenyan law
â the current deal is worth an estimated Â£ 58million a year to the kenyan economy , and also involves uk troops training the kenyan armed forces in reciprocation
