but a new study shows that while large ears may catch the eye , the trait does nât carry a social stigma
in fact , an experiment showed that adults tended to rate children with larger ears as being more intelligent and likeable upon first impressions
a desirable attribute : an experiment showed that adults tended to rate children with larger ears as being more intelligent and likeable upon first impressions
a stock image is shown dr litschel , lead author of the study published in the journal jama facial plastic surgery , told livescience : â protruding ears catch the eye , but not necessarily the imagination in a negative way
â the facial plastic surgeon at cantonal hospital st gallen in switzerland said that protruding ears may make children seem particularly cute
it âs thought that around five per cent of people have large ears
the experts used an eye - tracking device to measure which facial features caught the attention of the volunteers and asked them to guess each child âs personality
the study showed that protruding ears do n't carry a social stigma and it 's unknown why it 's been thought that they may lead to a biased perception of personality
dr litschel said they were surprised to find that the volunteers did not see the protruding ears as an undesirable feature
it âs unknown why it has been thought that protruding ears may lead to a biased perception of a person âs personality , but it could hark back to a 1876 study by an italian criminologist called cesare lombroso , who identified criminals by unusual facial features , such as their ears
