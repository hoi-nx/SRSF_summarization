a former england beauty queen who was born following ivf treatment has waded into the row against dolce and gabbana
model charlotte holmes , 26 , from plymouth , was crowned with the national title in 2012 but has hit back after the designers labelled babies born as a result of ivf as ' synthetic '
the row was sparked after comments were made in italian magazine panorama about the use of ivf treatments
angry : former england , whose parents underwent ivf to have her , says fertility treatment should be celebrated and calls for dolce and gabbana and gabana to apologise but the devon model has added her voice to stars including john who have been angered by the comments
' according to dolce and gabbana i 'm a synthetic human - ironic for a company who charge Â£ 1,500 for a nylon jacket , ' she said
' ivf treatment allows people who are unable to conceive in the traditional manner the chance of parenthood
john and david furnish with their two sons ( left ) and the designers dolce and gabbana ( left ) with dolce and gabbana ' to me and my family ivf is of the utmost importance
it is wrong for high - profile celebrities to make comments like this when it is crucial for families who ca n't have children
' it 's rare to get such negative comments too
' charlotte won the coveted miss england crown in 2012 however , italian fashion designers dolce and gabbana have insisted they ' respect all the world ' after their controversial remarks on fertility treatments infuriated sir john
that 's why i 'm not convinced by what i call chemical children , synthetic babies
