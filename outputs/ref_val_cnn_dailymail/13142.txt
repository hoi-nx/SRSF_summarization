growing up in german , everything felix von der osten learned about native americans came from the books of 19th - century german writer karl may
may 's most beloved characters , a noble apache leader named winnetou and his cowboy blood brother old shatterhand , are said to be more popular today in german than the works of thomas mann , the 20th - century nobel prize - winning author of " death in venice
" it was n't until von der osten drove through south dakota last year , bearing witness to modest homes and trailers on tribal land in the majestic black hills , that he realized how one - dimensional his perceptions were
intrigued , the 25 - year - old photographer began researching native american history
what he learned about its brutal conquest and fraught modern existence inspired him to return to indian to capture the good , the bad and the ugly
" i wanted to show a slice of life ( through ) the beauty and richness of the culture , " he said
" by chance he landed in montana 's fort belknap , home to 7,000 members of the gros ventre ( aaniiih ) and the assiniboine ( nakoda ) tribes on 675,147 acres of land near the canadian border
with their approval , he spent his first week walking around without his camera , introducing himself to tribal members and building relationships
" by revealing just a slice , he hopes to arouse curiosity in viewers and inspire them to learn more " to connect the dots
