a high - flying academic who travels the world as a government adviser is set to be deported from uk under ' barmy ' new visa laws - because she is out of the country more than 180 days a year
dr miwa hirono , 38 , is originally from japan but has been living in the uk since becoming a lecturer at the university of nottingham seven years ago
the world - renowned academic 's work - which helps the uk government to set foreign policy - requires her to spend long spells working in china and africa
set to be deported : miwa hirono with her husband , peter trebilco , 61 , and one - year - old son tada , must leave uk under ' barmy ' new visa laws in 2009 and 2010 she spent around 200 days abroad researching china 's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations
but home office immigration laws now state that people working in the uk on a migrant visa can not be out of the country for more than 180 days each year
and despite the fact dr miwa hirono does research for a government - funded organisation and her baby son was born in uk , the home office has decided to deport her
today , dr miwa hirono , who lives in beeston , notts. , with her husband peter trebilco , 61 , and their one - year - old son tada , said : ' it came as a massive , utter shock
battle : dr miwa hirono 's university colleagues have slammed the decision as ' vindictive and bone - headed ' ' it is idiocy
they changed the visa rule in 2012 and have applied it retrospectively to my travel in 2009 and 2010
' dr miwa hirono , an expert in international relations , has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it ' impractical '
' dr miwa hirono came to the university of nottingham in 2008 on a prestigious five - year research council uk fellowship , which then became a permanent role
in december , dr miwa hirono won an appeal against the home office with a judge suggesting it would not be in the national interest to deport someone who had ' made a significant and profound contribution to the academic framework of higher education in this country '
professor mathew humphrey said dr miwa hirono 's research had had a significant impact on policy towards china , including on the uk 's co-operation programme with the country
a home office spokesperson said : ' ms miwa hirono 's application for indefinite leave to remain was refused in july 2014 because she had spent more than 180 days outside the uk
dr miwa hirono said she believes her case will have a wider impact on the uk 's ability to hire foreign professionals
