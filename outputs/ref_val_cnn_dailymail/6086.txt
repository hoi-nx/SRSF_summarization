warriors head coach gregor townsend said : ' we 're looking forward to returning to action after our recent break and we 've been boosted this week by the return of our scotland internationals
' we 've had some great battles with leinster over the past few seasons and we 're expecting another one ( on friday evening )
mark bennett goes over against england at twickenham to score his second try of the tournament ' it 'll be the first time we 've returned to the rds since last season 's guinness pro12 final and we know we 'll need to play our best rugby if we 're to come away with a positive result against the defending champions
