technology that might have averted the germanwings tragedy by remotely seizing control of the plane has existed for years â but has been resisted by the aviation industry , it emerged last night support for real - time monitoring of jets from the ground has stalled amid airline fears of the dangers of eliminating pilots and the possibilities of a so - called cyber-hijack by terrorists
unions representing pilots are also against the move
he told the independent : ' the ill - thought reinforced cockpit door has had catastrophic consequences
' mr baum said thinking about airline safety had been skewed by the 2001 terror attacks , adding that there had been ' excessive attention given to terrorism ' and a ' failure to address other threats to aviation security '
manufacturers in european and us have worked on ways of creating a â hijack - proof â aircraft
in 2006 , boeing was awarded a us patent for an â uninterruptible autopilot system â
this would allow pilots , ground controllers or security agencies such as the cia to activate an automatic flight mode that can not be turned off by anyone on board
the system could also switch itself on if terrorists tried to fight their way into the cockpit , with pressure sensors on the door responding to excessive force
october 31 , 1999 : 217 people died after egypt air flight 990 from new york crash - landed in the sea
the aircraft âs flight path could be radioed to it by ground control , and it would be brought safely down at a nearby airport using existing automatic landing aids
but this has failed to happen amid safety concerns from pilots and airlines , and the technology remains unproven
the ability to direct pilotless aircraft from the ground is well established â military drones have long been used for surveillance and targeted missile attacks
in 2013 , a 16 - seater jetstream airliner became the first passenger plane to fly â unmanned â across uk civilian airspace
it was controlled remotely from the ground for the 500 - mile journey , though a pilot on board handled the take - off and landing
uk âs civil aviation authority said there was no remote control system currently available that could cope with navigating the country âs crowded skies
a spokesman added : â there are companies working on it , but the technology does nât exist in a practical or useable form yet
â pilots â union balpa fears using pilotless planes or allowing authorities to remotely take control of a stricken or hijacked aircraft â and believes it could leave planes in danger of being â hacked â from afar
â aviation safety analyst yates said there had been frequent calls for remote - controlled aircraft takeover systems since 9/11
but he also argued that this could pose more risks to passengers , with ground controllers unable to see all that a pilot on board could see
mr yates added : â there has always been a desire to have the ability to control planes from the ground â¦ but the ground element of that was entirely pooh - poohed by the aviation industry for a whole variety of reasons , not least of which is aircraft safety
â questions will always be posed as to whether pilots should be taken out of the equation in the event of something like this so ground control would take over â¦ i personally would not feel comfortable getting on any airliner where control could be taken away from the pilots and co-pilots
â youngest victim : seven - month - old julian pracz-bandres , pictured with his mother marina bandres ( also right ) , died when the airbus crashed 9/11 rules allowed tragedy to happen the disaster was made possible because of rules introduced after the 9/11 attacks to keep hijackers out of aircraft cockpits
in general both pilots must remain in their positions at the controls of at all times , and on short - haul flights they generally do not budge
what screening did lubitz undergo before being allowed to fly ? top airlines use psychological testing to check that would - be pilots are able to cope with stressful situations as well as possessing the skills needed to fly a large aircraft
aviation psychologist professor robert bor said : â every time they arrive at an airport they have to check - in and meet with other staff â to not spot a pilot with mental health problems would be rare
