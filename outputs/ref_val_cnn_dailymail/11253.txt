a family has been left devastated after their pet cat was put down without their consent by a vet who thought it was a stray
neeson was worried when the cat , who was called babies , did n't come home after being let out in newtownabbey , co antrim
she went looking for the animal with daughters tia , 13 and kiana , 10 , but a worried passer - by had already taken him to a local vets
vets presumed the animal was a stray when it was handed in without a collar or microchip tia and kiana ( pictured with their other cats ) wrote a letter to babies after discovering he had been put down with no microchip and his collar already removed by the time he was brought in staff presumed babies was a stray and gave him a lethal injection after detecting signs of illness
speaking of the loss , mrs neeson said : ' i am devastated , my daughters are devastated
the vet who gave babies the lethal injection has since apologised for the confusion
' this poor cat was suffering from chronic renal failure and had been for some time
babies did not return home after being let out one evening the animal was so well liked by neighbours he would often spend the night at their homes , said mrs neelson ' the cat was presented to us as a stray by a concerned member of the public who felt sorry for him and took it upon herself to bring him to the vets
' the cat was in the end - stages of chronic renal failure
' he was not wearing a collar , and was scanned for a microchip but none was found
' the animal was put down by vets at a pets at home store near her home
