hawking has made a heartfelt plea to stop fellow motor neurone sufferers dying without a voice
physicist hawking , whose inspiring story is the subject of the oscar - winning biopic the theory of everything starring eddie redmayne , lost the ability to speak in 1985
hawking said not being able to communicate is ' one of the most frightening and isolating aspects of living with motor neurone disease '
â their campaign " do nât let me die without a voice " highlights how not being able to communicate is one of the most frightening and isolating aspects of living with motor neurone disease ( mnd )
â everyone with mnd should be able to access speech and language therapy and the range of communication equipment technology which is out there
â figures show at least two out of five mnd patients wait more than six weeks to get the communication equipment they need , which can range from simple alphabet charts and speech therapy to high - tech support such as text - to - speech devices , eye gaze systems and voice - banking
between 80 - 95 per cent of people living with mnd experience some loss of speech before they die
up to 5,000 people are living with mnd at any time but 30 per cent die within a year of diagnosis , and over 50 per cent within two years
the scientist , whose inspiring story is the subject of the oscar - winning biopic the theory of everything for which eddie redmayne won an oscar , lost the ability to speak in 1985 the rapidly progressive nature of the disease can result in patients dying even while waiting for the initial assessment of their needs
he said : â it is hard enough being trapped in a failing body but not being able to communicate is one of the most frightening and isolating aspects of this disease
â everyone with mnd should be able to access speech and language therapy and the range of communication equipment technology which is out there
