illegal immigrants would be put on a plane before they get the chance to appeal under conservative plans to rip up deportation laws
home secretary theresa may wants to implement a new regime of ' deport first , appeal later '
the rules , to be brought in if the tories are re-elected , would apply to anyone with an expired visa or those living in britain without permission
the only exceptions would be asylum - seekers or migrants who could suffer ' irreversible ' harm if sent back to a dangerous country
the move seeks to end the racket of thousands of illegal immigrants being able to prolong their stay in britain for months or even years by lodging a string of appeals and judicial reviews
the only exemptions to the new rules would be asylum seekers or migrants who could suffer ' irreversible harm ' if sent back to their home country
migrants will still be able to appeal â but must do so from their country of origin
by increasing the number of illegal immigrants who are removed from the country , it makes it easier to hit the target
home secretary theresa may wants to implement a new regime of ' deport first , appeal later ' should the tories gain re-election mrs may , hinting at the plans earlier this month , said : ' i think we will keep the target
' tory insiders are satisfied the so â called ' non-suspensive appeals ' policy is legally water - tight and will not be derailed by labour 's human rights act
on a smaller scale , mrs may has for the past year been deporting foreign criminals under an identical ' deport first , appeal later ' regime
so far the move has seen 600 offenders sent home before their appeals were exhausted
