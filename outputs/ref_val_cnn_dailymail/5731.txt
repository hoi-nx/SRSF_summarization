a mother jailed for allowing her children to â pick and choose â when they went to school because she thought they would learn â more on a beach than in a hot stuffy classroom â now admits she was wrong
claudia ward , 42 , said prison was the wake - up call she needed and that her children all now had 100 per cent attendance records
miss claudia ward said she initially wanted her six children to have â an amount of choice themselves â
but their schools and her local education authority disagreed with her flexible approach and she was prosecuted five times before being jailed for five months
great outdoors : miss claudia ward let her children play truant because she thought they would learn more on day trips
pictured above are two of her six children - riley ( left ) and nia ( right ) â i accepted that my views on education were not correct and everyone must adhere to the same rules , or there would be anarchy
â miss claudia ward , who is single , has six children : jack , 24 , amos , 21 , rudy 17 , annie , 16 , nia , nine , and riley , six
â if it was a sunny day and i thought one of my children would have been bored and sat staring out the window of the classroom wishing they were at the beach â i could not see the merit of them not being on the beach looking at rock pools , â said miss ward , a freelance creative writer from falmouth , cornwall
i thought they would be far better actually there experiencing it rather than sat in a stuffy classroom
riley and nia : the children were looked after by other family members while miss claudia ward was in prison â my ideas for education were always more outside the box and free - thinking , â she added
â reflected in her cell : miss claudia ward was jailed for five months in 2013 at truro magistrates â court during the 2012 court hearing â which miss claudia ward failed to attend â magistrates were told that three of the children âs education was suffering through their absences and one had missed a gcse exam
education welfare officer john heath told the court : â claudia ward is a capable woman but has a very odd outlook as far as education is concerned
miss claudia ward served ten weeks of her 20 - week jail term
