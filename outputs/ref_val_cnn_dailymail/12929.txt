three major characters -- superman , wonder woman ( both of dc comics , a time warner company , like cnn ) and archie -- came out with new looks ( and costumes in two cases ) thursday
superman and wonder woman are no stranger to change over time , but these are pretty different from what we 're used to
it 's been a whirlwind time for comic book fans , and there will be a lot to get used to .
