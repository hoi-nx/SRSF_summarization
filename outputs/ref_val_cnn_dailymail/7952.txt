the lib dems are to unveil a rival budget tomorrow in an unprecedented statement to parliament which will signal the end of the coalition
alexander , the chief secretary to the treasury , will hold up a yellow budget box - mimicking the red leather case used by the chancellor - before setting out what his party 's tax and spending priorities after the election
he will promise to make tax dodging as unacceptable as drink - driving , increase the personal tax allowance to Â£ 12,500 and targeting the wealthy instead of cutting spending
alexander will hold his yellow budget box aloft tomorrow before delivering an unprecedented statement to the commons it is understood the unique statement from the despatch box had to be agreed with commons speaker john bercow , and is likely to infuriate labour for using government time to make a highly political speech
chancellor george osborne is using his budget statement today to set out the official coalition government position for the last time before the election
but he has made clear that in a conservative government he would eradicate the deficit through spending cuts alone , without tax rises
this would include Â£ 12billion of cuts from the welfare budget , including a ban on under - 25s claiming housing benefit , restricting child benefit to three children and cutting the amount families can claim in handouts from Â£ 26,000 to Â£ 23,000
but all the changes to benefits have been blocked by the lib dems , and are instead expected to be included in the tory election manifesto when it is unveiled next month
it was later auctioned off to a lib dems activist for Â£ 1,500
the yellow box is designed to echo the red leather case used by george osborne before travelling to the commons to deliver his budget today mr alexander will rule out any extra increases to vat , income tax or national insurance , but demand tax rises on the wealthy
a senior lib dems source said : we are going to set out what our spending plans will be for the next parliament
' in a speech at the lib dems conference , mr alexander set out some of the measures which would be in a lib dems budget
' mr alexander joined mr george osborne and other tory treasury ministers outside number 11 this morning a lib dems budget would include the party 's flagship policy of raising the income tax personal allowance to Â£ 12,500 and would involve ' balancing the books fairly , not on the backs of the working people on low pay '
