washington a huge obama foreign policy decision , a big immigration question and interesting steps related to hillary clinton , john boehner and marco rubio filled an informative sunday loop around the ' inside politics ' table
at issue is sen. marco rubio of florida , who remains a single - digit blip in republican polls
but a new hire sends a signal
his hiring is seen as a signal in republican circles that marco rubio is close to launching
for those of us who lived through the clinton white house years , and especially the monica lewinsky scandal , it was interesting to say the least listening to hillary clinton a few days ago wax nostalgic about her relationship with newt gingrich
and the former house speaker shared similar fond memories in a conversation with kucinich of the daily beast
but do n't break into " kumbaya " or order the marshmallows
" he said , if she becomes president , she 'll be a hard worker ; she 'll be pretty practical , " said kucinich
" it 's been a rough start for the republican congress and house speaker john boehner
but john boehner sees a chance to get two big - ticket items on their way to passage , and through those debates to get the house back on a more productive track
" one is the republican budget : he wants to just get it through the house , get a compromise with the senate
john boehner wants to solve that long - term and it looks like he is going to have the votes to get it done
