first it was smoked salmon and caviar , followed by champagne and lobster
now lidl , the bargain supermarket chain the middle class love , is trying the luxury - on - the - cheap approach with something rather different : lingerie
the collection , entitled see you in venice , is part of the esmara clothing range , and consists of four bra designs in cup sizes 34b , 36b , 38b and 38c
the bras are available in polka - dot , slate grey , black trimmed with pink or nude and black , and cost Â£ 3.99
the matching briefs come in small , medium and large , which covers a generous range of sizes between a ten and 20 , and a pack of two costs Â£ 3.99 â a fraction of the amount we usually spend on smalls
all the lingerie is made in china from polyester , lycra and nylon , and is available in lidl stores while stocks last
if the range proves popular , more sizes will follow , says sophie lambert russell , from the lidl fashion team
so , can these supermarket smalls compete with our high street favourites ? to find out if the see you in venice collection is catwalk chic or bargain bucket , we asked independent lingerie expert becky john and the mail âs senior stylist amy kester to cast their critical eyes over them , checking for size , fit and comfort
the briefs are ultra-thin and i do hope they maintain their shape when they are washed
there are seams up the middle of the briefs on the front and back , which might be uncomfortable under tight jeans due to chafing
slate grey padded push - up bra , matching briefs
it is only sewn on to the bra at the top and bottom rather than all the way round
the briefs are a good size â not too grannyish but not too skimpy either

â the briefs have no centre seams , which will ensure a smooth contour
black padded push - up bra with pink lace trim , matching briefs
â and the half - seam up the front of the bra cup might show under a t - shirt

but the reason they can retail at such a low price is that the manufacturers need only a few templates as the bra sizes on offer are so limited
â a survey conducted by debenhams in 2014 found the average bra size of women in england and ireland is 34c , while in scotland it âs 34dd . only welsh consumers â whose average size is 34b â would fit into the lidl range
