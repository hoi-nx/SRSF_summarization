louis van gaal has filled his players â heads with so much information this season they look shackled
manchester united against arsenal is a game to inspire any player and , with a potential trip to wembley , you can see players like wayne rooney falling back on their natural attacking instincts
wayne rooney and his manchester united team - mates have looked shackled under louis van gaal 's regime playing at pace manchester united have dominated possession recently but arsenal wo nât be troubled if manchester united play keep - ball
with alexis sanchez , danny welbeck and theo walcott , they have pace to burn and with no jonny evans it means another change in the manchester united backline , which will only increase uncertainty
arsenal speedsters such as theo walcott can cause manchester united 's defence all sorts of problems at old trafford watch out for danny welbeck danny welbeck would have been smarting when he was sold by van gaal
danny welbeck will be looking to prove a point to louis van gaal who moved him on from old trafford the fortress is crumbling when arsenal last played manchester united in the fa cup , sir alex ferguson âs side won 2 - 0 in 2011
in a season and a half , manchester united have lost nine league games at home
old trafford has not quite been the fortress of old since sir alex ferguson 's departure van gaal 's side have played 33 games this season , nine fewer than arsenal , so should be fresher
minutes played per mertesacker , arsenal : 3150 santi cazorla , arsenal : 3121 alexis sanchez , arsenal : 3081 david de gea , manchester united : 2970 calum chambers , arsenal : 2392 wayne rooney , manchester united : 2383 kieran gibbs , arsenal : 2287 wojciech szczesny arsenal 2279 nacho monreal , arsenal : 2266 laurent koscielny , arsenal : 2194 my memories of a classic rivalry there has always been a great rivalry between these sides , but i never played at old trafford with any fear
we were a physical team but we could play , and it was almost a compliment when manchester united tried to match our physicality
arsenal could have won the double but manchester united went on to win the treble
