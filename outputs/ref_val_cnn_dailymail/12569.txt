there were the teletubbies and spongebob squarepants a decade ago
now , as these views thankfully get more fringe , the theories are becoming increasingly bizarre and awesome
among the homo nouns , there 's the common core , according to a florida lawmaker ( education policy is super gay , obviously ) ; taylor swift , who an op - ed writer for the christian post , larry tomczak , claims is being used by ellen degeneres to " attract young girls " to her show ( uh-huh ) ; the disney princess movie " frozen , " according to radio hosts in colorado ( that dress ! ) ; and now , according to a potential 2016 gop presidential contender , carson , there 's prison
carson , who , let me reiterate , is a potential presidential candidate from a major america party , and a neurosurgeon to boot , told cnn 's chris cuomo in an interview that aired wednesday that " a lot of people ... go into prison straight -- and when they come out , they 're gay
" asked if being gay was a choice , carson replied in a word : " absolutely
but no one who holds these beliefs belongs in a race for the 2016 white house
) these views belong in another decade , not modern america
yet the america offers certain protections based on religion
carson , meanwhile , opposes same - sex marriage
it 's also an issue that , along with transgender rights and employment discrimination against lgbt people , should be a focal point in the 2016 campaign cycle
i hope that america is evolved enough not to elect a candidate who opposes lgbt rights
it 's a country that mostly laughs at someone saying prison would " turn " someone gay
being around a bunch of dudes -- or ladies -- in prison does n't change a person 's innate sexual attractions
and the america people damn sure should n't have to listen to it
especially coming from a 2016 presidential contender , it 's almost laughably irrelevant
