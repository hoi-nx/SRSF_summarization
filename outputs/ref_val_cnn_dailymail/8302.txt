when rachel abbott sold her successful media company for Â£ 5 million , she set herself two goals : to embark on a new career as a novelist and to find a dream home in italy
despite viewing countless properties in tuscany , she and husband john were left disappointed until they discovered a ruined 15th century monastery in neighbouring le marche
dream home : rachel abbott and her husband viewed countless properties in tuscany before discovering the monastery in neighbouring le marche resurrected : the couple paid just Â£ 150,000 for the monastery in 2000
pictured : the ruins of the monastery â when we went to italy we knew what we wanted â an ancient building that had been completely modernised , â says rachel abbott , 62
â then , finally , an estate agent took us to this place and we just knew â¦ â all that remained of the monastery was the chapel â minus the roof â and the oratory
whereas tuscany is teeming with wealthy second - home - owners from britain , le marche is the â real italy â â a place where they could mix with the locals
back in its glory : after a two - year restoration project , which set the couple back a further Â£ 1 million , the monastery was transformed into a modern eight bedroom home luxurious : the property also boasts seven en suite bedrooms , a swimming pool and a five - hole golf course

luckily , the old building had survived until the 1960s , so they were able to find photographs , enabling their architects to recreate the style of original
they covered two layers of stone used for the walls in terracotta tiling , just as would have been done in the 15th century , and windows were installed exactly where they were in the pictures
behind the facade , the couple built a modern eight - bedroom home with seven en suites , a swimming pool and , for john âs benefit , a five - hole golf course in the five acres of grounds

rachel abbott did not fancy the anguish of rejection , so her solution was to self - publish on amazon instead
all three have been no 1 bestsellers on amazon âs kindle store , and rachel abbott now outsells many well - established authors
price tag : the couple have now put the property on the market for â¬ 2.5 million ( Â£ 1.8 million )
but now they have put their home on the market for â¬ 2.5 million â about Â£ 1.8 million â and want to move to the channel island of alderney
