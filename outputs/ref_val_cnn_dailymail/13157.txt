before he was jihadi john , he was little jihadi john -- a young version of the same emwazi who authorities say later became the english - speaking face of isis terror
it shows a teenage boy in the schoolyard of a west london secondary school
the boy in the video is emwazi , his former headmaster at quintin kynaston community academy told cnn
" he was working hard , he achieved great grades for him , and he went to the university of his choice , " shuter told cnn this week , referring to west london 's westminster university , from which emwazi graduated in 2009
he starred in grisly isis videos depicting the beheading of hostages , punctuating his horrific actions with taunts at the u.s.
a man who says he is emwazi 's father told the kuwaiti newspaper al qabas that " there is nothing that proves " the man known as jihadi john is his son , mohammed
they say that the kuwaiti - born emwazi went from being a typical " boy next door " type growing up in west london to being one of the most high - profile recruits of isis , the islamist extremist group behind a campaign of terror and conquest in syria and iraq
more than a dozen british administrative court documents obtained by cnn indicate that , as far back as 2009 , british security services believed emwazi was part of a radical west london recruitment network for terrorist groups in east africa
and in late february , two u.s. officials and two u.s. congressional sources confirmed reports in british and other media that emwazi went on to join isis and is the man known as jihadi john .
