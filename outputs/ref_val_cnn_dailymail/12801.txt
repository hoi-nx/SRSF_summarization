a year - and - a - half ago , when the jesus edition of o'reilly and martin dugard 's ongoing book series about the deaths of famous people was released , o'reilly did the talk show circuit to promote the book
to " 60 minutes " o'reilly professed that his " killing jesus " is not a religious book
when asked why jesus was killed , o'reilly said , " he was upset that the jew were taxing -- and overtaxing , extorting -- the folks
" jesus was executed , according to o'reilly , not because he claimed to be god , but because he interrupted the " money flow " of taxes to the romans and the jew temple leaders
as a theologian , i must say that o'reilly buried the lead
five things o'reilly flubs in ' killing jesus ' jesus ' death was unique because of its theological and religious import
jesus was most definitely an outsider -- on this o'reilly and i agree
" so it 's pleasantly surprising that the tv movie based on o'reilly 's book casts a muslim actor , sleiman , as jesus
for a long time , the actors chosen to play jesus have looked more like o'reilly and me than like a judean
when o'reilly portrays jesus as a champion of low taxes and an opponent of big government , he 's not committing a mortal sin
he 's doing what so many have done before : seeing in jesus what they want to see , and making jesus into someone who looks , talks , and thinks like they want him to
so maybe the best thing that christians can do during this holy week is to watch a muslim portray jesus
we live in an uneasy time between christians and muslim , between christianity and islam
now a muslim actor is bringing him to life , and that is no more scandalous than jesus ' own life .
