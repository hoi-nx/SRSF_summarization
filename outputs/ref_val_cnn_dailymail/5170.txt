while many of us will try and catch a glimpse of the solar eclipse tomorrow morning , the striking astronomical phenomenon may confuse animals
experts have warned that darkening skies could make nocturnal animals such as owls more alert and cause creatures that are usually awake during the day , such as sheep , to find a place to sleep - as well as possibly silencing songbirds
while animals may not react as strongly as during a total eclipse , zoos are still preparing for the partial eclipse that will see skies darken slightly across the uk at around 9.30am tomorrow morning
the right - hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 march will travel over europe dave clarke , head of invertebrates at london told mailonline : â a solar eclipse , especially a full eclipse , could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies - who use the light for navigation
â an expert from london told mailonline that the eclipse could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies ( an owl butterfly is shown ) tomorrow , the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun , casting a shadow over earth
the proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near - total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the uk , so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in london , manchester will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in glasgow , aberdeen and edinburgh , meaning that animals in scotland may react more strongly than those in the south of england
the most â complete â eclipse in the uk will be seen from lerwick in the shetland isles
robin scagell , vice president of the spa ( spa ) told mailonline : ' it will still be broad daylight and no darker than if there were some cloud in front of the sun , â but anecdotes from past partial eclipses hint that animals will still notice the change
. ' farm animals out in the fields might stop grazing and move to a more sheltered place as they do at night , ' he said , before adding that because all animals have 24 hour body clocks , they know it is not night time but that something unusual is going on
professor broom also said that pet dogs and cats will probably be ' sightly disturbed ' by tomorrow 's eclipse
' dogs , for example , will probably be more alert and pay more attention to what 's going on around them more then usual because they will be ' sightly surprised '
for example , sheep ( stock image ) may find a place to sleep tomorrow projection : place a pinhole or small opening in a card , and hold it between the sun and a screen â giant sheet of white paper works â a few feet away
she said : ' diurnal animals - those that are awake during the day - do what they usually do at night : sleep ! â dragonflies hide under a leaf , ants return to their nest , sheep walk back to their sleeping place , cattle egrets ( heron - like birds ) return to their nocturnal roost , diurnal grasshoppers chirp more slowly and then stop
â â nocturnal animals become active : owls hoot , bats fly , blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning , cocks crow , nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping , and so on
during a partial eclipse in 2001 , desert cicadas in arizona fell silent in a break from their normal calling , suggesting similar insects such as crickets may do the same in the uk
on the morning of the 20 march the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over earth - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 august 1999 ( pictured over germany ) â nocturnal animals become active [ during an eclipse ] : owls hoot , bats fly , blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning , cocks crow , nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping , and so on , â one expert said experts think this may have happened because of a drop in temperature under the eclipse âs shadow and because calling takes a lot of energy , it was impossible for the insects to keep up their method of communication
in 1973 , researchers found that captive squirrels became restless in the run up to and during an eclipse , indicating that native squirrels may notice tomorrow âs unusual astronomical spectacles
it is guesswork as to how some birds may react tomorrow
some evidence points to blackbirds ( stock image ) singing during the astronomical event , while other other birds have fallen silent when the moon has blocked out the sun the eclipse could disrupt solar power supplies across europe , energy experts have warned
the eclipse is not expected to cause blackouts in uk because so little of our power comes from solar power
this observation may suggest that birds could cease singing in parts of the uk tomorrow during the partial eclipse , while frogs may call loudly .
