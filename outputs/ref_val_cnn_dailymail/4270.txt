' all delighted : an elated arthur has now left quarantine to start his new life with the lindnord family friends : lindnord adopted arthur after meeting him when his team took on the 430 - mile adventure racing world championship in ecuador last november
as the group of four navigated the gruelling final two stages of the 430 - mile adventure racing world championship , the dog befriended them and was eventually given the name arthur
at the time , lindord said : ' i came to ecuador to win the world championship
the world championships held in ecuador covered three diverse geographical regions - the andes , the pacific and the amazon rainforest
the fifth member : team peak performance met arthur during the gruelling race and he refused to leave their side all terrains : despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of arthur , primarily for his own safety , he refused to go
it meant when he got stuck in the knee - deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted , they stopped to take a break support : at one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle , so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food loyal : arthur became a loyal member of the team and refused to leave their side on their trek before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organisers warned the team that taking arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety
lindord , heartbroken by the site of arthur struggling in the water , picked him up , put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey
the team agreed with the decision to keep arthur in quarantine and also praised the quarantine 's staff for doing an ' amazing job ' with their new best friend
today , as the family welcomed arthur to his new home , lindnord said : ' he is really happy to be with us
' he will be loved by our small family and all of our friends
but arthur swam alongside the boat and ended up being pulled in by lindord greeting : arthur offers out his paw to one of the vets as the team wait in the clinic for him to be checked over when he was in quarantine
