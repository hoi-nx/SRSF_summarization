froch is challenging ward to cross the atlantic for the first time in his career and face him at nottingham forest âs city ground
ward earned recognition as the world âs supreme super-middleweight when he defeated froch in the final of the super six tournament in atlantic city
but the america has fought only twice in the three years and three months since that points victory and the wba are now ordering a mega rematch between him and froch with both their belts on the line
froch wants a fight with ward to take place at the home of nottingham forest froch was last in the ring when he defeated george at wembley last summer ward is that organisation âs â super â champion , froch the holder of their â regular â world title
the cobra is daring the man who calls himself ward to nerve himself for a first fight outside the americas
â i fought him in the america , â froch says
â ward needs to be forced to travel out of his comfort zone
â froch would love the fight with ward to take place at the city ground where his team nottingham forest play froch clearly has n't been slacking off since last summer as this picture posted on twitter shows ward ( left ) signed with jay z 's roc nation sports promotional company earlier this year that evening of december 17 , 2011 represented ward âs only fight in more than six years outside his native california , where the overwhelming majority of his bouts have taken place
froch suspects ward believes he will relinquish the wba belt , as he did his ibf world championship last month
but i âm not giving up the wba title
â froch is aware that without him bringing a belt to the table there would be little incentive for julio cesar chavez jnr to go ahead with a fight in las vegas , which is one of the cobra âs two remaining ambitions
froch lost to ward on points back in december 2011 in atlantic city , new jersey that defeat for the cobra was one of only two in his career as a professional the other is to box at the ground of his beloved nottingham forest , which was the potential venue for a clash with america âs veteran idol bernard hopkins
froch accepts that the wba mandatory ruling means ward must now take the place of bernard hopkins in those talks
froch had been due to face julio cesar chavez jnr ( left ) but was forced out with an injury froch is also keen to fight ring legend bernard hopkins ( left ) who lost to sergey kovalev last year â i will only get back in the ring for a fight that really floats my boat , â says froch
in fact , the timing would offer froch his best chance of avenging one of the only two losses on his record â as well as inflicting a first defeat on ward
froch says : â the nine months since i knocked out george is the longest i âve been out but ward has to be really rusty
