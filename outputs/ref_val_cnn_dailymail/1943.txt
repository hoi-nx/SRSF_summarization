the london mayor suggests it would be ' fatal ' for the tory to give any suggestion that it is in the market for a fresh power - sharing deal with the lib dem or another smaller party
' we should say " stuff coalition with anyone " , ' mr johnson told the daily mail
' we are there to win , we are there to offer leadership , we are there to be a tory government
' if we go into this thing issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party , it would be absolutely fatal
' asked whether the prime minister should rule out a second coalition altogether , mr johnson replied : ' yes
' lord steel says there is no appetite among lib dem for another coalition â or among the two big parties
' a lot of cameron 's tories want a tory - only government , even if it 's a minority one , and similarly on the labour side , ' the former lib dem leader told the bbc
mr johnson , who is mr cameron 's chief leadership rival , criticised the fixed - term parliaments legislation introduced by the coalition â suggesting it should be repealed
' former conservative minister sir alan duncan has led the calls for a cross-party deal to repeal fixed - term legislation , branding it a ' recipe for political horse - trading and coalition manoeuvrings '
johnson - considered mr cameron 's main rival for the tory leadership - said he should rule out any coalition deal after the election it means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the queen to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable
