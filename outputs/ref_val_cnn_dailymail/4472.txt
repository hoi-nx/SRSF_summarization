changes : b&q is to close as many as 60 of its 360 stores over the next two years as part of a restructuring of its uk and ireland business parent company kingfisher , which also owns screwfix , plans to axe about 15 per cent of surplus space as a result of the review of its 360 - strong b&q estate
the move was announced as it posted a 7.5 per cent drop in annual profits to Â£ 675million after sales fell by 1.4 per cent to Â£ 11billion in the year to january 31
the planned store closures form part of a plan by new chief executive laury to shake - up the 360 - store b&q business

kingfisher said the impact on jobs from the b&q store closure plan will be broadly neutral as it is opening about 60 outlets under the screwfix brand , while it will also look to redeploy positions to other parts of the business
she added that it had long been clear that b&q had too many stores in its estate
b&q uk & ireland 's total sales were up 1.9 per cent to Â£ 3.7 billion in the financial year , with sales of outdoor seasonal and building products up 4 per cent
