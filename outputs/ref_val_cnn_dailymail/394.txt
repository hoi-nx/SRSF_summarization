cosby has released his first video message since nearly three dozen women accused him of sexual assault and has insisted : ' i 'm far from finished
' in the 10 - second video , which abc news showed on monday morning , the embattled comedian can be seen speaking on the phone as he encourages someone to come to one of his shows
' you know i 'll be hilarious , ' he says in the clip , in which he wears his pajamas
he made no direct reference to the accusations or the scores of women making them , but the 77 - year - old comedian has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing
it comes as cosby continues to tour the u.s. with his stand - up comedy show
among the demonstrations , 100 people stood outside a denver theater in january shouting : ' rape is no joke ! ' cosby has also canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances amid the allegations , many of which exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution
when ms thompson 's story was originally revealed in november 2014 , cosby 's lawyer marty singer called it ' absurd ' to publish an ' unsubstantiated story from this anonymous person '
promotion : cosby , pictured on stage in florida last november , promoted his live shows in the video speaking out : last week , jewell allison , pictured left with cosby and right today , wrote in an op - ed for the washington post how she felt pressure as an african american not to tell anyone about the abuse and in an op - ed published on friday , former model jewel allison detailed how cosby invited her to dinner and slipped something into her wine , before grabbing her hand and putting it on his genitals
last month , cosby 's lawyers asked a federal judge to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women - tamara green , therese serignese and linda traitz - accusing him of sexual offenses
tamara green , a 56 - year - old southern california lawyer , says cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in her los angeles - area apartment in the early 1970s
therese serignese says cosby drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in las vegas around 1976 , while linda traitz alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a southern california beach in about 1970
support : cosby 's wife camille , pictured in november , is standing by her man amid the multiple accusations but cosby 's lawyers said the actor was merely acting in self - defense as his character was under attack
