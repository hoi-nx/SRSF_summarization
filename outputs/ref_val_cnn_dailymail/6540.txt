we 're all guilty of putting an instagram filter or two on our pictures from time to time to try and make ourselves look better
from supermodel miranda kerr to pop princess britney spears it appears some of our favourite stars have been using photo editing tools to make themselves appear thinner
of course , people like beyonce and kim kardashian are no strangers to being accused of altering their photographs
these two photos were taken just two days apart whilst charlotte holidayed in perth in february , in the picture on the left she looks rounder than she does in her instagram snap on the right holly hagan has lost a lot of weight over the last year , however , she looked like her waist was slimmer in this picture posted to instagram ( right ) around the same time that she attended the ntas ( left ) when kim kardashian took a trip to the versace house in march 2014 she faced criticism for the picture on the right , in which she appeared to have slimmed her waist and hips some users like lauren goodger , who posted this picture before attending the clothes show live last year , may have used filters to smooth out their pictures even though she is already incredibly slim when miranda kerr attended a michael kors event in japan last year she raised eyebrows for this instagram snap in which it looked like she had slimmed down her waist jennifer lopez has beautiful skin already but it looks as though she used a filter to make it completely flawless in this picture taken as she promoted the boy next door in january beyonce is no stranger to controversy , she has previously been accused of slimming down her pictures and in this snap , taken whilst she was holidaying in the south of france , it looked like her waist was slimmer this week 's heat is out now when singer beyonce posted photographs of her summer holiday to instagram last year she was accused of slimming down both her waist and legs
