the high court in london heard the couple , who separated in the summer of 2011 , had signed a ' post-nuptial ' agreement under which mrs hopkins would receive two properties , Â£ 350,000 and a share of her ex-husband 's pension
but mrs hopkins , 62 , complained that the agreement had been breached after she was put under ' undue pressure ' and exploited - and argued that she should be awarded a further Â£ 2million

he rejected her claim of ' undue influence ' and cleared mr hopkins of ' badgering and harassing ' her
mrs hopkins had claimed her ex-husband was worth Â£ 54.3 million , although he put the figure at Â£ 38.4 million
the court heard mr hopkins and mrs hopkins had written lists of ' how things could change ' to each other shortly before separating
but just over a year after their wedding , mrs hopkins went to see a divorce lawyer to seek advice about her entitlements â and the post-nuptial agreement was signed in august 2011
under the deal , mrs hopkins got the family home - ' lynwood ' , in wincanton , which is valued at more than Â£ 530,000 as well as an investment property worth about Â£ 250,000
deputy high court judge nicholas cusworth qc ( pictured ) said mrs hopkins had ' sought to underplay ' the agreement however , mrs hopkins had claimed liabilities , including legal costs bills , and said she would be left with less than Â£ 430,000 , before pensions
mrs hopkins had never contended for more than a ' needs - based award ' following her divorce , and the judge said that was what the post-nup gave her
even after receiving the Â£ 200,000 lump sum , mrs hopkins would still owe over Â£ 120,000 in legal costs
the cost of the case to mr hopkins came to Â£ 638,097 - including the lump sum awarded to mrs hopkins .
