selma , it seems , is everywhere
the ava duvernay film of that name continues to draw audiences and plaudits , while this month marks the 50th anniversary of three pivotal civil rights marches from the alabama city -- the first two stopped by brute force , the third a triumphant procession to the state capital of montgomery led by martin luther king jr. , ralph bunche , maurice davis and other activists
now , the events that seared those marches into the american consciousness are the subject of a photography show at the steven kasher gallery in new york
" selma march 1965 " brings together -- for the first time , anywhere -- pictures by three essential witnesses of the civil rights era : james barker , spider martin and the man kasher calls " the single greatest civil rights photographer " -- charles moore
the pictures in the gallery above include charles moore 's work in selma and from other parts of the south , including some of the riveting , award - winning photos he made in birmingham , alabama , in 1963
" ) " the quality , the depth , the sense of reality that he brings to the work is unparalleled , " kasher said of charles moore 's civil rights shots
kasher 's own bona fides on the topic , meanwhile , are well - established : he 's mounted photography shows on the civil rights movement in 30 different public venues since the mid- 1990s
whether he was chronicling the overt , graphic suppression of human rights or framing a profoundly human moment -- as in his unforgettable shot of bloodied poet galway kinnell in selma -- charles moore 's photographs often feel as if he was shooting with robert capa 's famous dictum ringing in his ears : " if your photographs are n't good enough , you 're not close enough
" there 's no question that charlie made some phenomenal pictures , " said loengard -- who , incidentally , took one of the most memorable photos of the civil rights era : a life cover of medgar evers ' weeping widow and son at the slain activist 's funeral in june 1963
" what 's especially significant to me about charles moore ' civil rights work , " kasher said , " is his clear affinity with nonviolence at the same time that he 's depicting the irrationality and brutality of the segregationists
" charles moore was an american photographer known for his images documenting the civil rights movement in the 1960s
some of his photos are included in " selma march 1965 , " a photography show taking place at new york 's steven kasher gallery from march 5 to april 18 .
