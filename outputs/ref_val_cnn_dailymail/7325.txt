wales recorded their second biggest six nations victory under warren gatland but - after bolting ahead in the three - horse race thanks to a george north hat - trick - they watched the trophy painfully slip out of their one - handed grasp
it was a scintillating second - half display at the stadio olimpico
italy were chewed up and spat out , while wales feasted like old emperors of rome
warren gatland âs side will take face from the performance and , looking ahead to the world cup , the kiwi rounded off the competition with no anxieties about september âs pool of death

they provided easy pickings in the second half , although that should not detract from wales ' ambition and enterprise shown after the half - time break
it was a stark contrast to the opening 40 minutes , when the visitors â inexperienced front - row were shown up by the italy pack
all the talk in the roma bars had been about not whether wales would win in rome , but how many points they could put on their second - rate opponents
there was an instant italian retort and â after wales were penalised for using blockers to help luke charteris at the kick - off â haimona kicked the hosts to an unexpected lead

jamie roberts and giovambattista venditti exchanged scores and wales went into the break with an unconvincing one - point lead
italy capitulated and wales turned up the heat
within 10 second - half minutes , north had completed his hat - trick , drawing on his pace to finish two out wide and his power to finish a third through the middle

finishing off a break from just outside the welsh 22 , warburton darted under the posts to move his side past the half - century mark , before scott williams finished off another fine move to leave the organisers questioning their decision to send the trophies to twickenham and murrayfield
iâit was probably a 14 - point swing in terms of the points difference , â said warren gatland
