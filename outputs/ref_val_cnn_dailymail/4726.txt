' it 'll be hell with a baby ' , said my friend , mother - of - two , a little bit too cheerfully as i stuffed another wad of nappies into the side of a duffel bag
why do you think i have n't been on holiday abroad for the last four years ? ' and with those encouraging words ringing in my ears , my husband , 18 - month - old daughter and i were off for our first family holiday ... to costa rica
we spend our days between the kids pool , which is of course necessary if you want to avoid a heart attack every few minutes , and the beautiful beach tal gottesman braved a long - haul flight to costa rica with baby in tow for a family holiday at the andaz peninsula - but once she arrived , she did n't regret it for a moment the journey was long , and not direct , and if i 'm honest , a little bit painful at times but we miraculously managed to avoid full on meltdowns and a long weekend stopover in new york was lots of fun
before we knew it , we were disembarking in liberia , off to the papagayo peninsula on the northern pacific coast of costa rica
any relatively new , tired parents will know that once you 've packed the seven thousand items you now seem to need at all times , and faced the joys of a long flight , you may not have the mental or physical capacity for much else
good food ( and lots of it ) , cocktails , beautiful spa facilities and incredible views were all on tap - and despite the fact children are brilliantly catered for and more than welcome , the resort really prides itself on peace and tranquillity
costa rica 's ' pura vida ' catchphrase resonates throughout the andaz experience - a hybrid of ' take it easy ' , ' hakuna matata ' , and ' do n't worry , be happy ' , we are told that it is a term that means a lot to the people of this country who try to live by it

costa rica 's ' pura vida ' catchphrase resonates throughout the andaz experience - a hybrid of ' take it easy ' , ' hakuna matata ' , and ' do n't worry , be happy ' nothing is too much trouble at andaz nothing is stressful , nothing is formal
the staff are miles ahead of other places we 've visited in their genuine friendliness , desire to help and can - do attitudes
we actually managed to drink entire hot cups of coffee while watching her wander around - and as any parents of young children will know , that is a privilege not to be sniffed at
there is also an adults only pool , obviously a necessity for those travelling sprog - free because , let 's face it - there are only so many times you can enjoy being hit in the face with an inflatable ball
standard rooms at andaz peninsula papagayo resort start from 400 $ usd , on a room only basis , excluding taxes
the resort 's local and celebrated architect , ronald zã¼rcher , stayed true to the costa rica philosophy when realising his vision for the resort and the end result is that you feel like you are always in outdoors , even when you 're not
