a federal judge blocked nebraska 's gay marriage ban on monday , but the decision will not take effect for a week and the attorney general 's office immediately appealed to the 8th u.s. circuit court of appeals
the aclu of nebraska sued the state in november on behalf of seven same - sex couples challenging the ban , which passed with the approval of 70 percent of voters in 2000
in addition to prohibiting gay marriage , the ban also forbids civil unions and legalized domestic partnerships
the ban means that same - sex couples miss out on medical and financial benefits available to heterosexual married couples , u.s. district judge bataillon said as he issued the injunction
