on the eve of bobbi kristina âs 22nd birthday yesterday gordon , whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted , â i âm so hurt i wan na do myself in , i know i have to strong [ sic ]
â through it all , he has not been allowed to visit with her , as tensions between gordon and the brown family have escalated on the edge : gordon was seen on outside north fulton hospital near atlanta , where bobbi kristina was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub a helping hand : dr. phil is concerned about gordon and his on his way to offer assistance it is five weeks since bobbi kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the roswell , georgia , home she and gordon , 25 , shared
the only daughter of whitney and brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother âs death in eerily similar circumstances
but unlike marion â pat â houston âs death that was ruled accidental , police are treating bobbi kristina âs near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21 - year - old as a criminal investigation
while bobbi kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with gordon , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged
it was gordon who found bobbi kristina and who was administering cpr when first responders arrived on the scene
gordon and bobbi kristina in happier times
gordon has been banned from seeing her by the brown family in addition to this she had been using cocaine , heroin and xanax in the months before the january 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to people
just two weeks ago gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the bobbi kristina and his georgia home â a home owned by whitney until her death â as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining cctv footage from security cameras located at the roswell residence
lawyers for gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on february 12 was an infringement of their client âs privacy but they subsequently dropped the case
meanwhile the nature of gordon and bobbi kristina âs union has come under intense scrutiny
both have referred to each other as â husband â and â wife â in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that gordon â who was unofficially adopted into the family by whitney when he was 14 â has married the girl who he once knew as a â sister
â in his most recent tweets gordon who had previously called bobbi kristina his â wife â refers to her as his â fiancÃ©e
he said : â gordon has a short temper and bobbi kristina can be difficult
â against this backdrop , hostilities between gordon and bobbi kristina âs father , brown , and other family members have publicly exploded with gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure
gordon has accused brown of only being after his daughter âs money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return
bobby kristina âs aunt marion â pat â houston is the executor whitney âs estate estimated at between $ 12 and $ 20million trust she took out a restraining order against gordon in march citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in bobbi kristina because of her money
pat , who was one of whitney âs managers , has made no secret of her disapproval of bobbi kristina and gordon âs â sibling â relationship having turned into something romantic
in increasingly erratic tweets gordon has raged against singer brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years
