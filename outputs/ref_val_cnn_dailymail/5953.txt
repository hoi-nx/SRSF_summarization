wales coach mcbryde has warned fans that attractive and entertaining rugby is low on the agenda ahead of saturday 's rbs 6 nations test against ireland
recent comments from new zealand boss steve hansen about the game being ' geared towards defences that inhibit attack ' have sparked debate around the sport 's marketability , with mcbryde predicting another war of attrition at the millennium stadium
ireland are on course for a grand slam and just to get away from cardiff with a win , that 's all they will be looking to do
wales coach mcbryde insists that winning rather than attractive rugby will be their main priority jamie roberts ( right ) in action for wales during the six nations match with france at the france new zealand 's steve hansen recently suggested that rugby is being geared towards a more defensive style ' with regards to playing any attractive rugby , that will come second
' wales have beaten ireland just twice in cardiff over the last 32 years and mcbryde is expecting one of the toughest challenges to date against the championship favourites
' they are on a bit of a roll at the moment â 10 wins on the bounce , ' said mcbryde
this is quite a formidable ireland team and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them

warren gatland was said to have ' the intellectual properties of a tub of flora ' , although ireland captain paul o'connell holds the kiwi in much higher regard
' at the start of the championship , joe schmidt said the wales - england game was going to be the standard - bearer
two years ago ireland beat ( wales ) in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against england

wales , however , have one of the best defensive back - threes in the world and halfpenny is a master at limiting the space to kick into
set - piece at 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in , luke charteris of wales and devin toner of ireland are two of the tallest players in the competition
their long limbs are used to try and steal ball , although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul , where both wales and ireland are particularly effective
however , they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against ireland , who won 23 turnovers to nine against england in round three
warren gatland 's game - plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and ireland will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of jamie roberts and george north
