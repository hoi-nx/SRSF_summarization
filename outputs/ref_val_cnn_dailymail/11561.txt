rob draper picked his south xi on monday , and you can read that here
here 's how we split the clubs : north vs south arsenal , aston villa , chelsea , crystal palace , leicester city , qpr , southampton , city , spurs , west brom , west ham united north vs south burnley , everton , hull city , liverpool , manchester city , manchester united , newcastle united , stoke , sunderland north vs south
and would n't it be fascinating if the premier league adopted a similar event ? yesterday , rob draper selected his south xi. here , joe bernstein reveals his north xi - plus seven subs
then on wednesday , we 'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at football manager
and , as always , we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team ... goalkeeper : joe hart ( manchester city ) tough call between david de gea and joe hart , but the city stopper is better at organising his defenders and more commanding in the air
janmaat can also play in the centre of the defence but he 's most threatening down the right where his crosses would cause havoc to any rearguard
joe hart has been superb in the league and showed against barcelona he can do it in europe too janmaat has been outstanding this season and newcastle united fans will have an anxious wait this summer shawcross pictured scoring for stoke against manchester united at the britannia stadium centre half : skrtel ( liverpool ) totally fearless , he keeps putting his head and body in the way of danger - just what you want from a centre - half
has got over the disappointment of not joining manchester united and it 's no coincidence everton hit their dodgy patch when he was out of the team injured
right wing : sterling ( liverpool ) showed at the last world cup he has now taken over wayne rooney 's mantle as the best player in the england team and it 's hard to believe he is still only 20
the one player in roy hodgson 's squad that you think could actually make it with real madrid or barcelona , he is quick , skilful , has natural balance and courage on and off the ball liverpool 's totally fearless defender skrtel ( right ) squares up to david de gea at anfield recently everton 's baines just seems to get better and better with age in the demanding premier league sterling has become an brilliant performer for liverpool this season as they look to tie him down central midfield : michael carrick ( manchester united ) people ask why manchester united 's form has improved in the last couple of matches
simple , michael carrick is back from injury and making the team tick
always seems to know when to play the right pass , and makes average players around him look good and the good players look great central midfield : james mccarthy ( everton ) if this team has steel down the middle in skrtel and shawcross , and stealth in michael carrick , james mccarthy adds speed
michael carrick has returned from injury and is making manchester united tick for manager louis van gaal james mccarthy , pictured scoring for everton against newcastle united at goodison park , makes the xi silva ( above ) and manchester city team - mate sergio aguero make it into our north xi striker : sergio aguero ( manchester city ) has taken over luis suarez 's mantle as the best player in the league
striker : wayne rooney ( captain ) ( manchester united ) wayne rooney has often formed good strike partnerships with players who are of similar build and technique , henrik larsson springs to mind in his brief spell at manchester united , so i have no doubts he would be prolific with sergio aguero
i can see them being on the same wavelength and wayne rooney would spot the argentine 's runs early
wayne rooney captains our north xi for his outstanding form for louis van gaal 's manchester united subs begovic ( stoke ) : another in the joe hart mould ; big , commanding , wo n't leave his defenders alone
subs : green , ivanovic , koscielny , delph , bolasie , costa , giroud ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : joe hart ; janmaat , shawcross , skrtel , baines ; sterling , michael carrick , james mccarthy , silva ; sergio aguero , wayne rooney subs : begovic , zabaleta , phil jones , yaya toure , young , sturridge , van persie
