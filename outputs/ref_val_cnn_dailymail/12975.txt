tina fey 's follow - up to " 30 rock " is getting a lot of attention , not all of it good
her new netflix series , " the schmidt , " is being criticized online for dealing in offensive humor and stereotypes
the show , which had been picked up by nbc but ultimately dropped , stars ellie kemper ( " bridesmaids , " " the office " ) as an upbeat woman stuck in the 1990s after being kidnapped by a doomsday cult leader : not exactly fodder for humor , on its surface
after she 's released from an indiana bunker , kimmy moves to new york to start a life , and much of the humor comes from her misunderstanding of the modern world , her seventh - grade education and her relationships with a diverse cast of pals
slate says that the critics " are n't wrong ... but they are missing the point
" " tina fey 's high - wire act is all about the alchemy of making it ok to laugh at big , heavy issues -- like kidnapped women , the experience of undocumented vietnamese immigrants , and people with native american ancestry passing as white -- by skimming over them with a light touch , " arthur chu wrote on slate
the daily dot 's jacqueline wrote that she once hid her native american past , just like kimmy 's employer , a wealthy woman played by jane krakowski
jacqueline said that watching the show made her uncomfortable but at the same time praised tina fey 's " genius " writing
but tituss burgess , who plays kimmy 's black gay roommate , titus ( whom some have called a stereotype ) , says the whole controversy is " ridiculous
" the show is certainly not afraid to go right up to the edge with jokes about race , age , class , gender and sexuality
" kimmy 's wealthy employers , julian and jacqueline voorhees , consider their marital difficulties
" jacqueline 's father , virgil , explains how he and jacqueline 's mother , both native americans , traveled to new york to see their daughter
" xanthippe voorhees , the spoiled teen stepdaughter of kimmy 's wealthy employer , offers up a cynical take on the new nanny 's pollyanna-ish ( or emotionally stunted ) attitude
" such is the life of titus , kimmy 's roommate , a gay black man from mississippi , trying to make an acting career in new york
" charles , kimmy 's colleague and potential love interest , defends his diet in the most awkward way
" yeah , it 's real popular now , like taking pictures of your food or being biracial
" cyndee , kimmy 's closest friend from her days in the bunker , offers swift commentary on how the world has changed in the 15 years she was away
he 's good at math. " titus : " that 's racist ! " kimmy : " but he is good at math. " titus : " i do n't make the rules
