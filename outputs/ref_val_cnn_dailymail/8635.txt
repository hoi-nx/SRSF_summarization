friday âs solar eclipse across europe could signal darker times and the â day of judgement , â a pastor has warned
on friday morning , europe will be treated to a partial solar eclipse ( 1999 eclipse shown )
but a pastor has warned that it coincides with a so - called ' blood moon '
this lunar eclipse , when the moon appears red , occurs a few weeks later
he said the chance alignment could be a sign of the end of times the claim was made by pastor mark blitz for the christian website root source in an interview with wnd ( wnd )
the partial solar eclipse on friday 20 march is itself fairly rare , as the last solar eclipse in europe occurred back in 1999
however , a few weeks later on 4 april , the third of four â blood moon â lunar eclipses will take place , while it is also the first day of spring and the first day of the jewish religious calendar
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of earth , and appears red due to light refracting differently and hitting its surface
this gives rise to its â blood red â appearance during a total eclipse , when the entire moon is in shadow
â he also said it was â likely a message from god to the entire world
â there will also be a partial solar eclipse on 13 september 2015 , followed by the last of the four blood moons - known as a tetrad - on 28 september
the so - called â blood moon prophecy â is apparently a sign that the world is coming to an end
a few weeks after friday 's eclipse , on 4 april , the third of four â blood moon â lunar eclipses will take place , while it is also the first day of spring and the first day of the jewish religious calendar
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of earth â an event of this magnitude at the very beginning of the religious new year demands attention , â mr mark blitz told wnd
