lord lord warner , pictured , has accused the labour leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care miliband âs pledge to rein in nhs â privatisation â by capping profits of firms providing care has come under fierce attack from a former labour health minister
as labour made the nhs the central issue of its election campaign launch , lord lord warner accused his party leadership of scaremongering and risking patient care
kicking off his campaign at the site of the 2012 london olympics in east london , mr miliband said the election â may come down to the wire â , though his deputy harriet harman insisted labour was already â within touching distance of victory â
his main policy announcement was that labour would halt what he called a â tide of privatisation â in the nhs
labour said the cap would apply to all nhs contracts worth Â£ 500,000 or more
any company that made more than five per cent from the contract would be forced to reimburse the nhs for any returns above the level of the cap
local nhs commissioners would have the power to allow higher profits in exceptional circumstances , if approved by nhs england or the health secretary
claiming another five years of conservative government would mean â the disintegration of our public services â , mr miliband added : â we âll scrap david cameron âs market framework for the nhs and stop the tide of privatisation
because the money we pay for our health care should be invested for patient care , not for excess profits for private firms
â miliband kicked off his campaign at the site of the 2012 london olympics in east london critics accuse party of hypocrisy , since expenditure on nhs services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before , when labour was in power
overall , around just six pence in every pound is spent in the nhs with the private sector , compared to just under five pence under labour
labour insists that the government âs nhs reforms have accelerated the number private firms winning nhs contracts , with around one in three now going outside the health service
lord lord warner , a health minister between 2003 and 2007 , pointed out labour had expanded the use of private sector providers in the nhs â and insisted it could not now survive without them
is that a profit ? miliband 's main policy announcement was that labour would halt what he called a â tide of privatisation â in the nhs ( file picture ) â if you want to scare people , you can scare people
' the labour peer said some senior people in his party appeared overly â preoccupied â with the issue of private sector involvement in the nhs , insisting : â it rather misses the point
â health secretary jeremy hunt said : â if you bankrupt the economy like labour did last time â then you âll put our nhs at risk
we can only have a strong nhs if we have a strong economy , but miliband does nât have an economic plan
â we all know labour want to â weaponise â the nhs but this is another policy from miliband that looks ill - thought through
â the real issue for the future of the nhs is how to fund the growing needs of an ageing population , and by tearing up an economic plan that is working labour would threaten the real increases in funding that conservatives are promising
â lord lord warner , a health minister between 2003 and 2007 , pointed out labour had expanded the use of private sector providers in the nhs â and insisted it could not now survive without them dr leonard shapiro , a consultant cardiologist at papworth hospital nhs trust , said of the profit cap : â practically implementing something like this is going to be virtually impossible
â liberal democrats health minister liberal democrats said : â liberal democrats in government put an end to labour 's sweetheart deals with the private sector , while the independent king 's fund has poured cold water on labour 's claims about privatisation
â the bottom line is that labour 's policies will leave the nhs under - resourced and open to continued privatisation , which will make it impossible to provide a comprehensive , high quality , efficient and safe health service , â she added
