prince andrew âs chances of appearing in a us court over â sex slave â allegations receded last night , after authorities mounted a legal challenge against the woman who claims she slept with him
prosecutors have asked a judge in florida to reject roberts âs plea to join a seven - year legal battle being waged by two other women
they are suing the us government over the lenient treatment of convicted paedophile epstein , jailed for 18 months in 2008
the chances of the prince having to appear in court over her allegation she was forced to sleep with him look to be receding the women , identified as â jane does 1 and 2 â , claim their rights as victims were breached when they were not consulted over a controversial deal signed by prosecutors with billionaire epstein , which granted him and others immunity from prosecution over dozens of cases of underage sexual abuse
if the us authorities win the case , andrew will be spared having to give evidence or make a witness statement
â the andrew was named in papers filed by roberts earlier this year
andrew has strenuously denied any sexual relationship with roberts , who was 17 when they met
