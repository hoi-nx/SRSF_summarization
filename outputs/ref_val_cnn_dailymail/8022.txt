new york city 's storied yellow cabs are taking a back seat to black cars
it was a changing - of - the - guard moment that passed with little fanfare this week in figures released by the city 's taxi and limousine commission : 14,088 registered uber cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs
uber cars , which are hailed by an app , now outnumber the yellow taxis in new york city , a place famous for its classic yellow cars ( file photo ) but it hardly means yellow cabs are out of favor
in fact , there are about 440,000 yellow cab rides a day , compared to just 20,000 to 30,000 uber rides
' uber was introduced in new york city in 2011 and has grown steadily in popularity , particularly among tech - savvy customers who are comfortable hailing rides through an app that shows when a car is on the way
figures released by the new york city 's taxi and limousine commission shows that 14,088 registered uber cars compared with 13,587 yellow cabs in the city ( file photo ) ' i absolutely do love the convenience , and if it 's not surge pricing i find the costs very comparable and in some cases cheaper than yellow taxis , ' said kerry farrell , a paralegal who uses uber about three times a week
uber spokesman matt wing declined to comment on the significance of the numbers of uber cars surpassing yellow cabs
' new york city 's 13,587 yellow cabs are in competition with smartphone - driven newcomers on city streets , especially the 14,088 registered uber cars that now outnumber cabs
