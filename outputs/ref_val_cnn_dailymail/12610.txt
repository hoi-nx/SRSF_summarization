nasa astronaut scott kelly has started a trip to the record books
he plans to spend 342 days on the international space station -- the longest stretch of time any u.s. astronaut has spent in space
scott kelly lifted off friday aboard a russian soyuz rocket that launched from kazakhstan
the rocket docked at the international space station at 9:33 p.m. et , according to a tweet from nasa , with hatches between the soyuz and the space station scheduled to open about 11:15 p.m. et. scott kelly will stay twice as long as any u.s. astronaut has ever stayed on the space station , giving scientists a chance to study how the human body responds to long - duration space flights
on earth , scientists will perform parallel studies on scott kelly 's identical twin brother , retired astronaut mark
" it 's a lot of fun , " scott kelly said at a media briefing in january
" two cosmonauts are riding up with scott kelly : kornienko and gennady padalka
gennady padalka will only stay up for six months
the trio will join three crew members already on the space station : u.s. astronaut terry virts , russian cosmonaut anton shkaplerov and italian astronaut samantha cristoforetti
other crew members also will rotate in and out during their year in orbit so it will never be just scott kelly and kornienko on the station
scott kelly , 51 , hopes to break the record for the longest mission on the space station set by nasa astronaut michael lopez-alegria and russian cosmonaut mikhail tyurin
while scott kelly shoots to set space station and other u.s. records , gennady padalka is on schedule to set a record for the most total time in space for a human
he 's already spent more than 710 days in space , including stays on russian 's mir space station and three previous stints on the international space station
why do it ? why stay up on the station so long ? nasa wants to know more about the impact of long - duration spaceflights on the human body to help plan missions to mars and deeper into space
