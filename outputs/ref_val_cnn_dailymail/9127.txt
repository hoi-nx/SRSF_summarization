instead , beaming broadly and waving at the crowds outside the lindo wing were michael and carole middleton - better known to george as ' michael ' and ' carole '
almost two years on and with the birth of a little brother or sister less than two months away , the middletons have become a fixture in little george 's life - with prince charles left to complain that they ' never let me see my grandson '
by contrast , william and kate regularly take their son to the berkshire village of bucklebury where the middletons live in a Â£ 4.5m georgian pile ringed by neat gardens and surrounded by open countryside
indeed , it was to bucklebury that the couple decamped a day after leaving the lindo wing , with george 's first photo shoot a month later taking place on the lawn and overseen by proud grandfather michael
carole , who to her credit provided a happy and secure childhood for her three children , was always determined to be a hands - on grandmother - and so it has proved
first visitors : carole and michael middleton were the first people to meet the newborn george sign of things to come : his first official photo was taken on the lawn of the middletons ' bucklebury home but the carole middleton matriarch 's determination to be involved in her grandson 's life has n't always gone down well with the rest of the family
' carole has rather taken over , dictating when george naps , when and what he eats , ' confided a source to the daily mail 's sebastian shakespeare
just a few weeks ago , carole enjoyed an unbroken fortnight of quality time with her grandson in mustique , where the clan had gathered to celebrate her 60th birthday
holiday : george and his parents often holiday with the middletons , seen here en route to mustique ' queen carole ' : sources say carole is taking an increasing amount of control over george 's life involved : carole , seen here with the duchess of cornwall , is said to be a hands - on grandmother to george and that is far from the only occasion that carole has enjoyed one - on - one time with george
just before the trip to mustique , the proud grandmother was spotted at a farmer 's market with the third - in - line , who was , say witnesses , ' trying all the food '
carole 's influence could also be seen in the plans for george 's first birthday celebrations which , in a break with royal tradition , included a peter rabbit themed party
not amused : charles is said to dislike what he sees as his ' peripheral ' role in george 's life loving : this framed photograph of charles and george has pride of place at clarence house contrast that with prince william 's own first birthday which was spent alone with his nanny barbara barnes because his parents were on tour in canada
something similar to his fractured childhood , which despite the best efforts of both his parents , was blighted by their divorce and , later , his mother 's death , is not what he wants for george
when he does see the baby prince , charles is by all accounts a hands - on grandfather - not just to george but to camilla 's grandchildren as well
different : william is said to want a less formal childhood for his son than the one he enjoyed happy : william has a close relationship with the middletons , in particular with father - in - law michael for evidence of that , look no further than the touching photos that emerged of charles last summer , where the heir to the throne was pictured with one of camilla 's grandchildren clinging to his leg during a visit to the highland games
more evidence of charles ' hands - on approach to grandparenting came when photos of a meeting a in clarence house drawing room showed a picture of george given pride of place on a sideboard
