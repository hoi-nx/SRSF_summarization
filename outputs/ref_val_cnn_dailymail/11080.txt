for groom neil mcelwee and his bride yanan sun , their white wedding was to be their best day ever
chinese - born yanan sun â six months pregnant with their first baby â had splashed out Â£ 1,000 on a stunning dress
and the happy couple had invited over 70 guests to celebrate at a Â£ 6,000 hotel reception
but their perfect day turned into a nightmare when moments before they were due to say ' i do ' , they were both arrested â after suspicions they were having a sham marriage
neil mcelwee and his chinese fiancÃ©e yanan sun saw their painstakingly planned wedding day transformed into a nightmare when they were arrested in front of 50 guests and accused of embarking on a sham marriage the besotted couple , who had spent months honing the details of their special day , were forced into separate prison vans and held for five hours this week the couple from derry , northern ireland , were awarded Â£ 21,000 compensation over the blunder â which also led to four police officers being disciplined
but although they have since wed , yanan sun , 22 , said last night : ' a wedding day is supposed to be the best day of any woman 's life
but this turned out to be the worst day of mine
' all the money in the world can never make up for spoiling my wedding day
' and her husband neil , 28 , a chef , said : ' while we feel justice has been done we ca n't ever erase the memories of that terrible day
' the mcelwees , who now have two daughters , isabel , three , and sybil , one , first met through friends in 2010 when yanan sun came to the uk from shenyang , chinese to study english
there was an immediate attraction between us and when neil asked if i wanted to go to the beach for a day out i said yes
' within weeks we were a couple and talking about spending the rest of our lives together
' but in february 2011 yanan sun discovered she was pregnant and the couple decided to bring their wedding forward
' they were released without charge , and eventually the couple were able to join the rest of their party - whom they had instructed to carry on without them - and bravely smile for photos a registry office ceremony was booked at the guildhall in derry for july 19th 2011
yanan sun said : ' i spent around Â£ 1,000 on a beautiful long white wedding dress and had my hair and make up professionally done for my special day
we arranged for a wedding cake to be made , caterers to prepare a buffet â which included champagne and strawberries - hired a bmw and taxis to drive the ourselves and the wedding party to the reception , paid for flowers with a florist , hired a photographer and a dj. ' neil and i spent hours choosing place mats and table decorations , agonising over tiny details such as which tables guest would sit on
we even had our wedding rings personally engraved with matching love hearts
' as she was about to walk up the aisle , yanan sun gave a little wave to neil who 'd been waiting
i could n't wait to marry neil and get on with enjoying the day we 'd spent months planning
' and when one of them said we were both being arrested on suspicion of carrying out a sham wedding i was stunned
' yanan sun recalls : ' when the officer said i had to accompany them to the station and change out of my dress i burst into tears
' the couple were taken to the local police station where they were kept in separate cells
' as they sat in their separate cells , and the hours ticked by , both realised their wedding day was not going to happen
' they later discovered police found out after only 40 minutes they 'd realised the arrests were a terrible mistake â but it was to be four hours before their solicitor managed to get them released
' the couple eventually married the next day , in an understated ceremony in casual clothes when the following morning the registrar rang them to apologise and asked if there was anything she could do , they asked if they could still marry
yanan sun says : ' the registrar said we could go in later that day
' three of the four officers who arrested the couple were disciplined and magistrates awarded yanan sun Â£ 12,500 and her husband Â£ 9,000 after the mcelwees sued the psni for unlawful arrest
but he had failed to check the neil mcelwee 's documents before making unlawful arrests and detaining them unlawfully
three police officers were disciplined over the arrests and the pair went on to take civil action against the chief constable of the psni for their unlawful arrest
this week derry magistrates court ordered that yanan sun should be awarded Â£ 12,500 and neil should get Â£ 9,000
neil admits : ' most couples will reminisce about their wedding day but we never talk about it
' and yanan sun says : ' no amount of money will truly compensate for my ruined big day
