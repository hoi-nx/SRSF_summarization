comedian john oliver could nât resist ridiculing starbucks ceo howard schultz over the introduction last week of his controversial â race together â initiative
schultz and the coffee chain have faced an avalanche of bad publicity and public derision over a well - intentioned initiative for its baristas to strike up a conversation about race relations in the u.s. with customers
â i think it âs pretty clear that no one has said â no â to this guy in 25 years , â said john oliver as he could hardly contain his glee at the comedic material the announcement has created
comedian john oliver could nât resist ridiculing starbucks ceo howard schultz on sunday over the introduction last week of his controversial â race together â initiative speaking on his hbo show on sunday , the british comedian said a conversation about race is â clearly important but there is a time and a place â â but it is not the length of time it takes to whip up a tiramisu frappuccino , â he joked
others questioned how starbucks workers could spark productive conversations about race while serving drinks
' still let 's give howard schultz credit for starting a conversation across the racial divide with a white billionaire pitching an idea and any number of american customers telling him how stupid it was , ' said john oliver
one user tweeted : ' i do n't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train
' â hey how âs that conversation on race going starbucks ? lots of fun right ? what if this could be every morning ? â joked john oliver on his hbo show on sunday another added : ' # racetogether is what happens when a 1 % - er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life ' white man 's burden ' crisis

' ' just stay in your lane ! ' in the face of the backlash , starbucks announced over the weekend that baristas will no longer be encouraged to write ' race together ' on customers ' cups
the initiative ended on sunday , but spokesperson jim olson denied that the phase out was a reaction to the push back the chain has received
' in a statement on sunday , schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was ' just the catalyst ' for a larger conversation ridiculed : after the campaign was announced , twitter users slammed the idea as naive in a statement on sunday , schultz acknowledged the naysayers and skeptics as an anticipated part of the outreach
' while there has been criticism of the initiative - and i know this has n't been easy for any of you - let me assure you that we did n't expect universal praise , ' his statement said
starbucks will still hold forum discussions , co-produce special sections in usa today and put more stores in minority communities as part of the race together initiative , wrote schultz
an executive on starbucks ' communications team , corey dubrowa , even blocked people on twitter before temporarily taking down his account after being bombarded with criticism over the campaign
during starbucks ' annual shareholders meeting in seattle on wednesday , he said the company was simply trying to use its massive reach for good
a letter from howard schultz to starbucks partners regarding race together : dear partners , i want to offer my heartfelt thanks to every one of you for your fearless and energetic support of the race together initiative
our objective from the very start of this effort -- dating back to our first open forum in seattle last december -- was to stimulate conversation , empathy and compassion toward one another , and then to broaden that dialogue beyond just our starbucks family to the greater american public by using our scale for good
this phase of the effort -- writing ' race together ' ( or placing stickers ) on cups , which was always just the catalyst for a much broader and longer term conversation -- will be completed as originally planned today , march 22
with great respect , howard schultz source : starbucks
