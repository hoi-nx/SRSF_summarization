about 15 years ago , i was doing research on inheritance laws in malawi and their impact on women
i was horrified to learn that malawi has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world
it is ranked eighth of the 20 countries that are considered to have the highest rates of child marriage by the u.n. population fund
on average , one out of two girls in malawi will be married by their 18th birthday , according to the united nations
in 2010 , half of the women ( 50 % ) aged 20 -- 24 years were married or in a union before age 18 ( compared to 6.4 % of boys ) , while 12 % of women married before they were 15 compared to only 1.2 % of men
child marriage is in both rural and urban areas
the constitution of malawi , which is the supreme law of the land from whom all legal authority is derived , has provided for some measures of protection for all children
the constitution also allows marriages of persons aged 18 and below and it does not have a cut - off point where marriage is actually prohibited
in february , malawi 's parliament passed the marriage , divorce & family relations bill of 2015 into law
this law was born amid the outcry against girl - child marriage , as the country had realized the dangers of girl - child marriage
so , does it mean that the constitutional provisions fall away ? the spanner in the works is that since the constitution allows marriage below the age of 18 , the new law to the extent that it prohibits child marriage is invalid
so whilst many have celebrated the new law , i have n't , as girls remain shackled by a constitutional provision that basically allows child marriage
so until the constitution changes and recognizes children as those aged 18 and above , and therefore puts marriage age at 18 giving many girls the opportunity to go to school and get educated , i will remain sad as i was 15 years ago
further to this , girl - child marriage inevitably means early parentage and higher risks of maternal mortality
as if this is not enough , studies have shown that girl - child marriage is a risk factor in the transmission of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections , as young wives do not have much bargaining power to negotiate safe sex with older men
what i know for sure child marriage is a guarantee for poverty among girls in my country and i want it to end
