nervous postmen are refusing to deliver to a block of flats unless they are escorted by a band of female pensioners
royal mail will only bring post to the 100 flats on three days a week â instead of the usual six â and even then , will only deliver through letterboxes if a 69 - year - old female councillor is stood at the postman âs side
his van downstairs , meanwhile , is watched by two ageing female residents of the block in case its tyres are slashed
a postman begins his round near waterloo while elderly residents stand and guard his delivery van councillor linforth-hall , 69 , escorts the postman around the building after royal mail refused to make deliveries at the block of flats the bizarre arrangement began six months ago after a 34 - year - old woman living in the flats was accused of assaulting a postman , as well as sending threatening emails to royal mail
ironically , the building â rowland hill flats near waterloo in central london â has the same name as the man who invented the penny black stamp and effectively created the modern postal service
royal mail initially refused to deliver there at all , forcing residents to take a bus to the nearest sorting office
linforth-hall , a local lib dem councillor , complained â and eventually offered to act as a guard three days a week along with volunteers from the flats
â the arrangement of being chaperoned began when a 34 - year - old woman living in the flats was accused of assaulting a postman , as well as sending threatening emails to royal mail her husband tony , a former advertising boss who is also 69 , sometimes helps with the escort
