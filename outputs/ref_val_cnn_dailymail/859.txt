i understand the angst that many arsenal supporters feel over the future of the club under wenger
i understand why a swathe of the club âs support has started to give up hope that wenger can recreate the success he brought to the club more than a decade ago
i even started to inch in that direction myself last autumn after arsenal made a poor start to this season
sometimes , it feels like wenger is the problem , not the solution
wenger is facing increasing calls for his resignation from arsenal fans after an undulating season wenger look despondently as monaco tear arsenal side apart in the last 16 first - leg champions league tie after the desperately dispiriting defeat by monaco , wenger will come under fierce scrutiny again when arsenal visit manchester united to contest an fa cup quarter - final
lose and people will say that their season is over
lose and the â wenger out â bandwagon , which is already accelerating , will move up another gear
well , maybe they should be thinking about slamming the brakes on it instead
because in the last five months , arsenal have taken great strides forward
put it this way , if you are an arsenal fan , which team in the premier league would you swap places with today ? look around
which team looks more upwardly mobile or better set for the future than wenger âs side ? city ? i do nât think so
manchester united may have spent lavishly under louis van gaal but they are beset by doubts about radamel falcao , angel di maria and robin van persie
despite all their lavish investment , city do not look like defending their premier league crown angel di maria has been a disappointment since joining manchester united for Â£ 60m from real madrid spurs ? well , tottenham might well be advancing under mauricio pochettino but they âre still a way away from the level they achieved under harry redknapp
and everybody would swap with chelsea at the moment , but the point is that arsenal âs future looks bright again
it is easy , and valid , to point out the occasional failings of per mertesacker , but why not consider arsenal âs array of attacking talent instead ? alexis sanchez , alex oxlade-chamberlain , santi cazorla , danny welbeck , mesut ozil , theo walcott and , yes , olivier giroud are formidable forward - thinking players close to their prime
per mertesacker winces during the defeat by monaco , but arsenal will surely strengthen their defence alexis sanchez is surrounded by an embarrassment of attacking riches in the arsenal ranks there is no reason why he should not bolster arsenal âs defence next season
if wenger signs another central defender in the summer and perhaps a more experienced central midfielder , there is no reason why they should not challenge for the title next season
it would be a shame if arsenal lost their nerve on wenger now just when it feels as if they are on the verge of being real contenders again
arsenal are the fa cup holders , let âs not forget
defeat by manchester united wo nât change that even if it will , inevitably , lead to renewed calls for wenger âs head
it has got to the stage now where some arsenal fans behave as if wenger is the only thing standing between them and the premier league summit
wenger celebrates breaking his trophy drought last may ... and more could follow if arsenal hold their nerve wenger last won the premier league title in 2004 , and his side may well challenge for the title next season there is another inconvenient truth here : even in the last 10 years under wenger that fans like to characterise as a desert of achievement , arsenal have played at a higher level than they had in the 30 years before he arrived
it may come as a surprise to some of those arsenal fans who think that football began in 1992 but in the period from 1966 to wenger âs arrival in 1996 , arsenal âs average position in the league was between sixth and seventh
he has got arsenal moving forward
