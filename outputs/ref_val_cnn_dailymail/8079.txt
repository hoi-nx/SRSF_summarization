when a regime starts to unravel at liverpool , there is usually only one way it will end
after failing to build on a challenge for the premier league , liverpool would slip away
liverpool fell short in 1997 , then 2002 and again in 2009
rodgers talks with lallana ( right ) as liverpool train ahead of sunday 's clash with manchester united rodgers and his players and staff appeared in good spirits ahead of a crucial premier league clash rodgers has managed to turn around liverpool 's season after a stuttering start to the campaign so , as liverpool suffered one setback after another at the start of this campaign â and expensive new signings failed to produce what was expected of them â i was concerned that my old club were heading down a familiar , bleak path
putting it bluntly , i feared for rodgers
gerard houllier celebrates winning the league cup in 2003 - but he left liverpool a changed man rafa benitez was another manager who carragher believes was changed by his experiences at liverpool credit , then , must go to rodgers for how he has arrested the slide and propelled liverpool back into the race for the top four
it was against manchester united , sunday 's opponents , that rodgers first unveiled his 3 - 4 - 3 formation on december 14
they arrived as players with talent and rodgers has given them a platform to show what they can do
he did it last year , too , when accommodating suarez and sturridge in the same team â a lot of his counterparts , remember , struggle to fit two top - class forwards in the same line - up but rodgers made liverpool one of the most exciting sides in europe
lallana is one of liverpool 's summer signings who has flourished under rodgers ' new system lazar markovic , who has impressed in recent weeks , takes time out of training to watch friday 's eclipse liverpool are two points behind manchester united going into sunday 's huge game at anfield we associate radical systems and the ability to think on their feet with foreign managers but that is exactly what rodgers does
rodgers was said to be lucky to have suarez and sturridge but do nât forget he banished suarez to the reserves in august 2013 , and he had the season of his life
well , one has left for barcelona and the other is nowhere near his best following a series of injuries , but liverpool are the form team in the premier league and playing some of the most exciting football in the country
steven gerrard , who is leaving for the mls , will play his last game against manchester united on sunday gerrard scores the opening goal from the penalty during liverpool 's 3 - 0 win at old trafford last season negativity has long since been dispelled and liverpool now have an opportunity to enjoy what i believe would turn out to be a better season than last year , if they are to achieve both their remaining objectives
rodgers is aware that no liverpool manager in modern history has gone three years without winning a trophy and his time will ultimately be measured by silverware , but he is on the right lines
only kenny dalglish , after all , has taken more points from his first 104 league games
it has been interesting to see his name being talked of as a potential replacement for manuel pellegrini , should manchester city make the decision to dispense with him at the end of the season , but that is nât something by which i am overly concerned
rodgers ( centre ) addresses his squad during training and has proved his managerial credentials this season whether you are a player or a manager , leaving liverpool for domestic rivals is not something you do easily and rodgers said recently he could not see himself managing another english club
what about managing england ? once the time comes for the football association to look for roy hodgson âs successor , rodgers would tick all the right boxes : he works with young players , promotes an attractive style and has experience of competing in europe
he has been bold , brave and the way he has changed liverpool âs fortunes has proved one thing beyond doubt : rodgers is a top - class manager
lionel messi proved he is the best around against manchester city ... he has eclipsed cristiano ronaldo this year it was a privilege to watch lionel messi on wednesday when he produced a performance that will live long in the memory
lionel messi was in inspired form against manchester city and proved he is still the best around cristiano ronaldo has struggled of late and lionel messi may have jumped back above the real madrid star i am hoping that the champions league will produce the dream final of barcelona versus bayern munich â i will be in berlin on june 6 â and it would be fascinating to see lionel messi in this form in a showdown against his mentor
james milner slides as lionel messi nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their champions league match lionel messi slips the ball through manchester city midfielder james milner 's legs at the nou camp james milner approaches barcelona star lionel messi during their champions league tie on wednesday bayern munich , after all , have been in outstanding form , scoring goals for fun , but his reaction was telling
â if i have to face lionel messi , i want it to be in one game rather than two ! â if they do happen to face each other in berlin â and after friday 's draw it is not wrong to expect barcelona and bayern munich to reach the semi-finals at least â we could safely say we will be in for a rare treat
bayern munich manager pep guardiola ( centre ) reacts to the ridiculous skill from lionel messi during the match this week i 'm looking forward to ... advocaat âs debut in the premier league so how will the veteran former holland manager fare in the unforgiving arena of english football ? his task is basically to finish above burnley in a nine - game mini-season with a one - point start as i fear the bottom two clubs , queens park rangers and leicester , are already doomed
