a group of belgian holidaymakers who were heading to the alps for a few days of skiing wound up being taken on a major detour thanks to their coach driver âs sat - nav mistake
instead of entering la plagne into his sat - nav , the driver entered plagne , located in the french pyrenees , putting the group of 50 holidaymakers on a nearly 800 - mile detour , belgian media reported
he turned around and drove to the correct destination , and the holidaymakers arrived 24 hours behind schedule
the coach driver realised his mistake and turned around in toulouse , nearly 425 miles from la plagne the ski tourists were driven towards the french pyrenees after their driver picked the wrong destination despite the disruption â and lost time on the slopes â some of the tourists took it all in stride and were happy they were taken on a detour
