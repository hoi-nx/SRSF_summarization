but democrats do n't actually have the luxury of standing by and seeing how this all plays out
" their only viable plan is to make her the best candidate possible , " says one senior democrats strategist
over the past six years , there 's been a sharp structural decline of elected democrats everywhere below the presidential level
sure , we all know about how the gop regained control of the senate in 2014 , but what about the fact that blue - state governors fell like tent poles ? or that gop governors now outnumber the democrats by almost two - to - one , 31 to 18
or that gop have complete control of nearly three times as many state legislatures as the democrats , 30 to 11
so , the conventional judgment that the clinton behemoth is just too big â too well funded , too well supported , too historic â all helps account for the paucity of alternatives , to be sure
the gains at the presidential level have not been cost - free : the country is polarized , the democrats are often on defense and they 're losing ground
one result : a thin presidential bench , which is painfully evident
clinton asks state to release emails : what you need to know and if you take a peek at those blue - state governors who might be president , consider this : at 76 , jerry brown , an able leader , is probably past his sell - by date for a presidential bid
and democrats governors are very thin on the ground in the heartland
any time you have gop winning the gubernatorial races in massachusetts , illinois and maryland , democrats should pay attention
and so when hillary clinton runs into some trouble , the democrats ought to worry
the gop have a deep and varied field ; the democrats have one real horse in the race no matter how much she stumbles out of the gate
next , while clinton may have considered the upside of waiting to announce her candidacy ( why not let the gop battle it out ? no need to give the gop early target practice ? ) , the downside is now obvious : how do you mount a defense with no real or organized apparatus to respond ? if you 're out there making personal appearances , it looks odd to ignore the elephant in the room
clinton 's stumbles fuel democrats critics bottom line , there is no organized pushback and there is no plan b. ( ok , jim webb , martin o'malley and bernie sanders , we know who you are , and that you 're probably running , but still
) or at least no big plan b. the pre-presidential league on the democrats side is not exactly overflowing with big - time candidates
