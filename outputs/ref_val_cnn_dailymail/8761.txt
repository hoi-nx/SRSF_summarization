order and progress â ordem e progresso â read the brazilian flags adorning the stands at the emirates on sunday , and the samba stars have certainly made some decent headway since their unceremonious exit from their home world cup eight months ago
there was little of the free - flowing football we have come to expect from brazil
head coach dunga , himself a world cup - winning defensive midfielder , has implemented a defence - first policy , with long balls up to the strikers very much the order of the day as far as attacking play was concerned
brazil are the pioneers of the attacking full back , but much - coveted porto defender danilo , despite his excellent through - ball for fermino âs opener , was relatively reserved on the right side of defence
brazil forward luiz adriano struggles to keep his balance as medel challenges his opponent for possession barcelona star neymar keeps his eye on the ball as he tries to control and begin another attack barcelona star neymar is evidently in pain after medel 's cynical stamp at the emirates on sunday predictably , neymar drew the majority of attention â both from his baying supporters and his on - pitch adversaries â and he was by far brazil âs biggest threat in attack

on the whole , we witnessed a complete change in brazil âs philosophy since the world cup , which is not necessarily a bad thing
a lengthy mexican wave in the first half told the story of brazil âs performance , but in sacrificing an emphasis on attack dunga looks to have addressed brazil âs major defensive defects
