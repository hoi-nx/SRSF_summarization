the last time lynette austin saw the afghan children , they were weak , wounded and broken
but when the nurse was reunited with them on friday at shriners hospital for children , she found two cheerful 8 - year - olds who had learned to speak english and to walk and even paint with artificial limbs
shah bibi tarakhail lost most of her right arm and her right eye when she mistook a discarded grenade outside her home for a rock , and it exploded , ripping her body with shrapnel and killing her brother
austin , who at the time was a u.s. army civil affairs officer , saw them there
doing better : the nurse was happy to see the children who were once badly injured by an explosion were now happy and smiling and nearly fully healed after the explosion : austin is pictured here with one of the children she helped in the explosion injured : the victims say they were happy to see austin who is pictured here right after the blast in their village on friday austin , who is now an operating room nurse in virginia , finally saw the children again
' all smiles : the children are doing much better and once they are fully healed they will be able to return to afghan where they are from austin remembered abdul wahid as ' unwaveringly smiling and singing ' in the afghan hospital but he had a surprise for her
' as for shah bibi tarakhail , she was traumatized and could barely talk , austin said
now , austin marveled , the girl not only spoke but has learned to skillfully paint with her prosthetic arm
lucky to be alive : this child lost his leg in the afghan explosion but says that now he is doing much better both children have completed their treatments and are scheduled to return soon to their afghan homes
shah bibi tarakhail went home briefly last year but word of her painting aroused the wrath of militants
word spread to her family that she would be killed for adopting western ways , and for a time the family had to flee its small home on the pakistani border
