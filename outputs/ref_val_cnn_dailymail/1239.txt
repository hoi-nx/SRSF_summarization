durst spent the night before his arrest wandering around new orleans ' french quarter with his loaded .38 - caliber revolver in his pocket , claims a nightclub doorman ' i asked him to come into the club , but he said in a female - ish soft voice , " i would like to come in , but i ca n't right now , " ' john phillips told the new york post
durst , 71 , then pulled open his brown - tweed suit jacket to reveal the butt of the gun in a belt holster , john phillips said
' john phillips said that ' the whole exchange took less than a minute ' outside the club and durst ' just stumbled a little as he walked down the block
' durst , 71 , was arrested on the eve of sunday 's final episode of ' the jinx : the life and deaths of durst , ' and he agreed on monday to face trial for the murder of berman , who had vouched for him in public after his wife vanished
the final episode ended with the whispered words of durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom
you 're caught ! ' durst whispered before the sound of water running can be heard
' john phillips , 32 , a doorman at the mahogany jazz hall burlesque and absinthe house said durst revealed to him that he was carrying a weapon the whispered words of durst recorded in an unguarded moment in a bathroom could come back to haunt him - or help him - as he faces a murder charge now those words could come back to haunt him â or help him â as he faces his murder charge
jackson 's lead defense attorney thomas mesereau jr. said the so - called incriminating material from the durst documentary could backfire as interview footage did in the jackson molestation trial in 2005 in the durst case , prosecutors could seek to play portions from the jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live
he claimed self - defense and was acquitted of murder but convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man 's body , which was found chopped up and floating in galveston bay
actor blake , left , talks with his attorney , m. gerald schwartzbach : prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with barbara walters because it contradicted other evidence while legal experts said durst 's remarks off - camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible , prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing
' it did a great deal both to humanize him and so he was n't just seen as a celebrity , ' said m. gerald schwartzbach , who won blake 's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife
' prosecutors are not commenting on the berman case while durst is still held in louisiana , where he also faces firearms charges .
