albert kelly scored two sensational 90 - metre solo tries to help hull kr shatter st helens ' 100 per cent record in super league
albert kelly scored two sensational 90 - metre solo tries st helens , who trailed 24 - 12 with with five minutes to go , could have snatched a point had former hull kr co-captain burns been able to convert turner 's last - minute try but it would have been tough on the impressive robins
it was saints for the opening quarter but roby was held up over the line and albert kelly twice punished their casual play to put his side in front
rovers had a try disallowed when slow - motion replays indicated a knock - on by hooker lunt after he re-gathered terry campese 's kick but when st helens winger swift again demonstrated his fallibility under the high ball his opposite number ken sio struck with the home side 's third try two minutes before the break
albert kelly could have doubled his try tally following breaks by lunt and kris welham but rovers could not apply the finishing touches , and they had to settle for two successful mantellato penalties to edge them 20 - 12 ahead
hull kr thought they had sealed it when full - back kieran dixon went over for a fourth try on 64 minutes but saints staged a tremendous late fightback which caused some anxious moments for chris chester 's men
