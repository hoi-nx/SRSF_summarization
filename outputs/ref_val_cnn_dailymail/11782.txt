streaking ahead : a sprinting alexandra leaves the competition trailing in her wake well ahead : alexandra charges down the final furlong followed by second - placed camilla good work : alexandra enjoys her trophy and a special rendition of the national anthem should the new royal baby prove to be a boy , it is james that is the hot favourite followed by arthur , henry , charles and thomas
