european union member states have blocked plans to ban so - called â roaming â charges for people using data on their smartphones and tablet devices
most mobile companies slap the sky - high fees on people âs bills whenever they use their email , search the web , or use an online map to navigate , whilst they are overseas
customers can pay a small amount for special roaming packages , but people who fail to do this face eye - watering charges , even if they have used their mobile phone sparingly
the european commission had promised to axe the controversial fees by the end of 2015
the move has sparked outrage amongst brussels
guy verhofstadt , leader of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe , said he would fight â vigourously â to end roaming charges this year , and that â european union member states should hang their heads in shame â
angered : guy verhofstadt , leader of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe , said he would fight â vigourously â to end roaming charges however , all mobile phone operators charge each other for this service , meaning that the whole industry is effectively taxing customers for using their phones overseas , and passing the money between them
â a few mobile phone companies have taken steps to reduce so - called â bill shock â for customers returning home from overseas
