an 85 - year - old man has been plagued by non-stop egg attacks on his house for an entire year
albert clemens senior âs home first became a target in march 2014 , and the attacks have yet to stop , confounding neighbors , local government officials and even the police in euclid , ohio
clemens â wife has passed away , but he continues to live in the house with his 51 - year - old son and 49 - year - old daughter
â the accuracy is phenomenal , because almost every time when it 's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time , they almost invariably hit the front door , â says clemens
the police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home the frequency is troubling too , as the house is pelted with eggs several times a week , occasionally more than once a day
the egg offensive always begins after dark and lasts about 10 minutes
albert clemens sr , 85 , lives in the house with his 51 - year - old son and 49 - year - old daughter the police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home and other than one or two mis - aimed eggs , few hit neighboring homes
local police are not taking the investigation lightly , trying undercover stakeouts , canvassing the neighbourhood , installing surveillance cameras , and even sending eggshells to a crime lab for testing
clemens was once confronted by a young man across the street who asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighbourhood â suspected drug activity
the eggs have been traced back to a nearby amish farm , but that yielded no further clues
the attacks are ruining the elderly man âs green two - story house on the corner of wilmore avenue and east 210th street which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago the attacks have been so frequent that clemens has been unable to keep up with the clean up officers visited local restaurants and outlets to ask about missing eggs
clemens ( pictured ) is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving : â i like the neighbourhood
i would live and die in this house â but it 's been kind of a nightmare â clemens used to clean up after each attack but has nât been able to keep up
the harsh winter has offered some respite for the family , as the egg attacks became less frequent
however once warmer weather comes , both clemens and euclid police expect the eggings to start again
clemens is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving from his beloved home despite the onslaught of eggs
i would live and die in this house â but it 's been kind of a nightmare
