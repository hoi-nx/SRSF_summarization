in 2011 , journalists flocked to kinshasa , the capital of the democratic republic of the congo , to cover the presidential election and the violence leading up to the vote
photographer leonard pongo had different plans
" i could have focused on the election , but i chose to follow people around , " leonard pongo said
" i wanted to experience what life in the country was like ... to understand another side of those events -- not those usually reported , but one that was much more personal
" it was leonard pongo 's burning personal quest that brings us " the uncanny , " a black - and - white series that helps us experience the democratic republic of the congo in flesh and blood
these rich portraitures and compositions of leonard pongo 's family members give us a vivid emotion of what it is like to be human as your country spirals into chaos
it is also a photographic detour from the cliche images of the democratic republic of the congo -- a subtler but deeply psychological representation of how war affects daily lives
war is something only experienced marginally by leonard pongo , who was born and raised in belgium to a belgium mother and a democratic republic of the congo father
stories of the democratic republic of the congo were narratives whispered into his european upbringing
" connecting with his family in the democratic republic of the congo , the photographer attended baptisms and weddings , exorcisms and political rallies
" leonard pongo went back in 2013 and said his journey through the country is not over yet
" i think i reached my objective , to embed into the daily life in the democratic republic of the congo , which clearly transformed me , " he said
" i was allowed into the life of people who were former strangers ... and got a deeper understanding of what daily life in the democratic republic of the congo could feel like
