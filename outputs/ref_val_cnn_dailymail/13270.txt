organized labor is up in arms about president obama 's effort to obtain fast - track authority to finalize a free trade agreement in the asia pacific that involves 11 nations
the agreement , union leaders argue , threatens to take even more jobs away from americans
afl-cio president richard trumka sent a clear message to members of congress , warning , " there is such a dramatic impact on the standard of living and lowering of wages and a loss of jobs -- this will have a major impact , and then we will not forget this vote for a long time
the tension between organized labor and obama is not new
the struggles have been going on since 2009 when the president allowed the employee free choice act to wither in congress
the president avoided making any strong appeals for the bill , though it was greatly desired by labor organizations as a way to increase membership
when democrats chose charlotte , north carolina , for their 2012 political convention -- a city not friendly to labor -- unions were livid
" even though unions were crucial to administration victories such as the affordable care act , president obama has often been extremely tepid when it comes to the rights of unions
organized labor has not been that surprised
in the 1970s , president jimmy carter treated unions like one more special interest in washington that needed to be brought down while president clinton demonstrated lukewarm support to these organizations as he aggressively pursued global free trade policies that labor opposed
if we do n't stand up for the working people in this country , who is going to ? " in the past few decades , many democrats politicians no longer believed that organized labor was a major player within their party , as they had been during the creation of the new deal and great society
as organized labor became a smaller part of the americans workforce , democrats politicians were not as determined to court their vote
shoring up the strength of unions is one area where the government can help protect jobs for middle class americans
they need to push back against president obama , even if this creates political opportunities for republicans , so that the party does not abandon what has been at the heart and soul of their agenda
