' another flap on the baby grow 's front ' prevents the baby from playing with the zips , and means that when a parent is carrying their child , the zips wo n't dig into the carrier 's skin ' , said mrs chignaki
' although she replaced leg zips with poppers , mrs melanie chiknagi decided to keep poppers on her baby grow 's front to enable parents to fully open it if they wish - or keep it shut during nappy changes
on her website , mrs melanie chiknagi reveals she named her baby grow design the picklesuit because she affectionately calls her children ' pickles '
