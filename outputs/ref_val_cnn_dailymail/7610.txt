a new test that can identify whether long - dead ancient humans had suffered from malaria could help scientists trace how the disease has evolved
archaeologists at yale university in new haven , connecticut , have developed a way of diagnosing the disease in skeletons thousands of years old
scientists have used the technique to reveal that infants and toddlers found in a cemetery within an ancient roman villa in italy had died of the disease
inwood , an archaeologist at yale university who led the research team , said : ' the data set we build with this will be revolutionary for establishing the epidemiological curve for malaria in ancient societies
attempts to develop a vaccine against malaria have been frustrated by the parasite 's highly variable nature
scientists at the us national institutes of health claim to have created a potential vaccine that can protect against lethal strains of malaria
the vaccine , developed blood samples taken from tanzanian children naturally resistant to the disease , works by imprisoning the malaria - causing parasites inside the red blood cells they infect
scientists found that an antibody produced by the immune children hits the malaria parasite at a critical stage in its life - cycle by taking action against this protein
' miss inwood and her colleagues developed the test by identifying specific chemical signals and molecules that are found in the bones of people infected with malaria
they found that a large molecule called hemozoin , which is expelled as a waste product by the malaria plasmodium parasite
using x-ray defraction , miss inwood and her team found they were able to identify black crystalline lumps of the molecule in the bone marrow of bone samples
' with the help of dr david soren , an archaeologist at the university of arizona , miss inwood was able to identify hemozoin in femur and humerus bone samples from the site - confirming they had been infected with malaria
the malaria parasite has a life cycle ( above ) that requires female mosquitoes to pass it between human hosts plasmodium falciparum is known to have been in existence for up to 100,000 years , but the population size did not increase until around 10,000 years ago
