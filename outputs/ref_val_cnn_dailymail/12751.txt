the bars ' total weight in gold is worth about $ 4.8 million
but what about the story of how they got swiped on sunday from a truck alongside interstate 95 in north carolina ? investigators are trying to figure that out , including how two armed security guards could have been so quickly pounced upon , bound and then robbed so soon after pulling over in wilson county , as they 've told authorities
he showed reporters a photo of the white van they allegedly got away in , as well as an image of the traffic cones they used -- which came from a florida company that does n't do business in north carolina
authorities say the initial statements from the two guards who work for transvalue , a florida - based company that transports valuables , were a bit confusing due to the guards ' spotty english , though woodward said police now have a clearer picture after bringing in spanish - speakers to translate
these two men , both of whom have worked for transvalue for several years , set off early sunday morning from miami with a truck full of gold protected by a padlock and presumably their firearms
the guards later told police they smelled gas , with one of them getting sick
that leads to the first big question about the men 's story : did something happen to their vehicle to cause the gas smell ? not according to a wilson county mechanic , who " did not determine any type of issues " with the truck , according to woodard
he encounters the same men -- one of them wearing a red traffic vest -- who repeat that they are police
and did anyone see them get bound and led into the nearby woods ? no , at least no one who has contacted police
but people called authorities around 6:49 p.m. sunday after they spotted the men , still bound , coming out of the woods , according to woodard
they 're all working to get information out of places between florida and north carolina , to try to corroborate the guards ' stories and uncover any evidence that might identify the suspected thieves
" right now , ( the guards ) are still considered victims , " woodard said , declining to answer whether or not authorities believe this was an inside job
