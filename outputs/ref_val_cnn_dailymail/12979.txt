four years ago i was laughed out of the room when i said to a group of friends : " pretty soon guys are going to decide their lives are more important than playing in the nfl
today , i 'm certain they are not saying those things about the talented 49er linebacker chris borland , the latest nfler to quit
he 's 24 years old and the first player to retire directly because he wanted to avoid the traumatic brain injuries that have been linked to playing football
chris borland played just one nfl season
" i just honestly want to do what 's best for my health , " he told espn 's " outside the lines
" " from what i 've researched and what i 've experienced , i do n't think it 's worth the risk
" he added : " i just thought to myself , ' what am i doing ? is this how i 'm going to live my adult life , banging my head , especially with what i 've learned and knew about the dangers ? ' " his teammate , pro bowl linebacker patrick willis , made the decision to walk away last week , and you ca n't help but think his decision might have influenced chris borland
patrick willis says he is n't really sure what he 'll do next , but he knows he wo n't play another game in the nfl
although fans around the globe are begging the 30 - year - old , seven - time pro bowler to " unretire , " patrick willis said his nagging foot and ankle injuries , and a desire for a happy life are why he walked away
... honestly , i pay attention to guys when they 're finished playing , walking around like they 've got no hips and they ca n't play with their kids
" but they do n't realize it 's because he played a few extra years
and while many sports fans are in shock that any guy lucky enough to play in the nfl would just walk away from fame and wealth , it sounds to me like patrick willis has his priorities right
at a time of year when most football fans are consumed by trade rumors and free agency moves , several other high - profile players have decided to hang up their cleats
and what 's surprising is how young they are : at 27 , steelers linebacker jason worilds was soon to step into the crazy world of free agency , where he was sure to be in demand by many teams
but instead , he 's leaving the game
unlike patrick willis , worilds had n't been plagued by injuries , at least not yet
young , intelligent and charismatic , " mjd " was adored by fans until , like so many other elite players , he was slowed down by injuries
jones - jones-drew , whom i worked with a lot when he was starting out in the league , is a smart and personable guy
" who knows , maybe mjd is the next strahan ? that former new york giant 's successful exit from football has inspired so many younger players
strahan 's path has empowered others to value themselves beyond football
just maybe all the debates about the ugly side of football -- concussions , brain injuries , depression and suicides -- have done some good , after all
