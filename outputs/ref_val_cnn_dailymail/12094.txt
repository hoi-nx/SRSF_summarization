a virus that starts off like the common cold could be responsible for leaving more than 100 children with paralysis
last summer , more than 1,000 children and teens across the country were hospitalized with symptoms that appeared to be caused by a particularly nasty strain of enterovirus
a new study published on monday has strengthened the connection between enterovirus d68 and the sudden paralysis of more than 100 children in the last year a new study published monday in the journal lancet infectious diseases backed those initial opinions , after following the progress of 25 children in california and colorado who experienced paralysis
researchers now suggest that the children were infected with a mutated form of d-68 , which first appeared four years ago
b1 has five to six coding differences that make it different from other strains commonly found in the u.s. , and that these differences cause nerve - damaging symptoms similar to polio
and like polio , the nerve damage appears to be permanent - since none of the children have fully recovered
however , the study has not definitely proved the connection between b1 and the paralyzed children , since researchers could not find the strain in the patients ' spinal fluid
researchers were also not able to answer another mystery of the enterovirus - why some children only came down with minor symptoms and others lasting paralysis
included in the study were two siblings that both came down with an 100 per cent genetically - identical strain of the virus in the past year
with enterovirus season just a few months away in late summer , researchers are saying it 's extremely important that more work be done to unravel the b1 mystery and make grounds to develop a vaccine to fight the dangerous virus
