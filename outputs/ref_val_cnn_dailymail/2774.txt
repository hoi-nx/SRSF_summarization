princeton seniors michael pinsky and vaidhy murti say their new app , called friendsy , could change the way students make new friends
rather than simply swiping right to match with someone , users select if they want to friend , date or hook up with another college student
through the app , users can chat anonymously , compliment each other , and make friendly and romantic matches when feelings are mutual
