why is the sun âs corona - the aura of plasma that surrounds it - so much hotter than its surface ? that is one of greatest solar mysteries , but astronomers will be hoping to find an answer on friday - by observing the total solar eclipse from the north pole
the plasma of the sun is only visible during a total eclipse , so the scientists will use this unique opportunity to try and solve the puzzling phenomena
and in an amazing coincidence , the eclipse will occur over the north pole on the same day the sun comes into view after six months of polar night - an event which happens only once every 500,000 years
they will use an array of instruments to look at the sun 's corona
this is plasma around the sun that can only be seen during a total eclipse
shown is an image of 1999 's solar elcipse from france , with the corona visible around the edges the team of scientists will be working at an old observatory on svalbard , midway between continental norway and the north pole
they are travelling to this region to ensure they see totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse
for observers in other regions , such as the uk , less than 90 per cent of the sun will be covered
the team at svalbard , led by professor shadia habbal , professor of solar physics at the university of hawaii , will include scientists from aberystwyth university in wales
up to 14 specially adapted cameras will be used to photograph the sun in different frequencies during the eclipse , capturing images of the plasma from the corona
this factor of 300 difference would be akin to the flame of a fire being 300 times colder than the air around it - but why this is occurring is unknown

they are travelling to this region to ensure they see totality - 100 per cent of the sun being covered by the moon during the eclipse astronomer gemma lavender from all about space magazine do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse ? ' it âs all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening , but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes , binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight
' dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk
' they work by employing a mylar film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun âs light , allowing you to view the eclipse safely
' if you do nât own them already , it is possible for you to buy a solar filter , which covers the aperture of your telescope to ensure that you can observe the sun safely
for observers in the uk , the eclipse starts at 8.30am , peaks at 9.35 am and ends at 10.41am , so you should make sure that you know where the sun rises from your location
' the total solar eclipse - that âs 100 per cent of the sun âs surface covered by the moon - is visible from the faroe islands and svalbard but if you are unable to get to these locations , many are able to see a substantial partial eclipse - for instance , scotland will see around 90 per cent of the sun âs disc covered by the moon
' how dark will it get in the uk ? ' in london and even in places where there 's 90 per cent sun coverage , we 're not really going to notice any changes in brightness because there 's still a portion of the sun 's surface uncovered
' the difference between the temperature of the sun and that of the sun âs corona is one of the great mysteries of astronomy , â said dr morgan , a reader at the solar system physics group at aberystwyth university , who is overseeing the team âs work from the uk
â a total eclipse gives us an unique opportunity to measure the corona of the sun is so much detail and collect data that will enable us to better understand this difference
' the temperature of the sun 's surface ( shown ion this nasa image ) is known to be around 6,000 Â° c ( 10,800 â° f ) , but for some reason the corona is around 1,000,000 â° c ( 1,800,000 Â° f ) , and even reaches 2,000,000 â° c ( 3,600,000 Â° f ) in some areas , a factor of about 300 he also added that studying the corona could help protect satellite - based communication systems from solar storms , which can be affected by coronal mass ejections - huge eruptions of material - from the sun. but he noted that the conditions were ' cold ' - and also potentially dangerous
