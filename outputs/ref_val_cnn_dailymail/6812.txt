for the first time this century , the skies over britain will grow dark during the day next friday with a thrilling eclipse of the sun. with some parts of the country experiencing 97 per cent darkness , outdoor events will be held nationwide as people gather to gaze heavenwards
here , guy walters presents a family guide on how to get the most out of an event that will not happen again for more than a decade
get out your glasses : special shades like this are a good bet for watching britain 's first great eclipse this century , with the next partial eclipse of this magnitude not set to take place until 2026 who turned the lights out ! shortly after 8am next friday , the skies above britain will start to grow dim
at first , the change will be slight , but little more than an hour later about nine - tenths of the sun will be blocked out
not until nearly 11am will the sun finally be restored to its full glory
the event taking place will , of course , be a solar eclipse , when the moon passes between the sun and the earth and casts a deep shadow over the earth âs surface
it will affect the entire country as the eclipse travels from the isles of scilly and all the way north to the orkneys
unlike in 1999 , none of the britain will be covered by a total eclipse
instead , we will witness only a partial eclipse
the total eclipse will be taking place over the north atlantic â it will start from a spot 400 miles south of greenland , skirt the south of iceland , pass over the faroe islands and the norwegian territory of svalbard , and finish over the north pole
but even though we will not be plunged into total darkness , the effect should still be spectacular â especially if the skies are cloudless
with the next partial eclipse of this magnitude not taking place over britain until august 12 , 2026 , and the next total eclipse not happening in our skies until 2090 , friday marks an incredibly rare opportunity to witness a phenomenon that has been a source of wonder and fascination for centuries
a solar eclipse in the faroe islands , where hotel rooms have been booked far in advance for this latest event so where can i catch it ? it âs probably too late to travel to the faroe islands to see the total eclipse , as by all accounts hotel rooms and berths on ferries were fully booked months if not years ago
however , if you can travel within britain , it âs best to head north â the farther north you go , the closer to the path of the total eclipse you get and the more the sun will be obscured
what 's the best way to view it ? you should never look directly at the sun with the naked eye , even if it is largely obscured
however , there are numerous ways to view the eclipse without going blind in the process : eclipse glasses : there are many available online , on sites such as amazon and ebay , and they typically cost less than Â£ 10
left to right : binoculars , a bucket of water and a colander can all be used to get a safe look at the eclipse colander : no , that âs not a misprint
if you hold an ordinary kitchen colander up to the sun and cast the colander âs shadow onto a light surface , such as a white piece of card held about 20 in away , you will notice that the holes project an image of the sun complete with a corresponding chunk taken out of it by the moon
this is a fun and safe way to watch the eclipse without having to look directly at the sun. bucket of water : this is perhaps the simplest method â fill a bucket with water and look at the sun âs reflection on the surface
binoculars or telescope : though you should never use binoculars or a telescope for looking at the sun , you can still use them to watch an eclipse
after setting them up on a stand or tripod , point them towards the sun â without looking through â until the light from the sun is cast directly down their length and out through the eyepiece
then , place a piece of white card or paper behind the eyepiece , and an image of the sun will appear
when the eclipse is taking place , hold the paper with the hole in it towards the sun and project the light onto the second sheet by holding it behind the first
the further north you go the more complete the eclipse will be - hence stornoway in the outer hebrides of scotland is the place to be on this list the dawn chorus â twice over if the skies are clear , the effect should be dramatic â akin to a sunset in mid-morning
will it affect our power supplies ? in 1999 , during the total eclipse over britain , almost none of the country âs electricity was generated by solar power
on august 18 , 1868 , the french astronomer pierre janssen observed that day âs total eclipse through a spectrometer , which measures light waves
but the most crucial scientific finding made during an eclipse was the confirmation of einstein âs general theory of relativity , which predicted that light from stars would bend as it passed the sun. in 1919 , britain astrophysicist arthur eddington photographed the positions of the stars around the sun during an eclipse and then photographed them at night
