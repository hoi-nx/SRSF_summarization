a woman who lost half her leg to bone cancer had her foot reattached backwards - and it was n't a mistake
shanna decker , 24 , was seven when she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma after complaining about a pain in her leg
but instead of an amputation , shanna decker opted for a ' rotationplasty ' : when the foot is attached to the thigh and rotated backwards
it means shanna decker , from minnesota , has more control over her prosthetic calf
more control : the decision shanna decker and her parents made when she was seven ( left ) means that she now has more control over her prosthetic leg and can manoeuvre it better than if she had undergone an amputation delighted : seven - year - old shanna decker was amazed at how quickly she learned to walk again after surgery due to her age , shanna decker was not eligible for ' limb salvage ' , where the missing tissue is replaced with transplanted or artificial tissue , as her legs were not fully developed
instead , she opted for rotationplasty , which removes the tumor and the knee and rotates the foot 180 degrees
' no regrets : shanna decker has now set up a foundation to help children who are considering rotationplasty too aside from the difficulty overcoming the appearance of her new leg , shanna decker said she never thought twice about it
