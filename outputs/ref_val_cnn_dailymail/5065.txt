greaves did not attend wembley on sunday
the one who does nât is greaves
if he wanted to go , as a guest of either chelsea or spurs , his former clubs , he could have secured a ticket , no problem
greaves was a great player , and does n't need a fuss around him when he decides not to attend games this can happen when you âre 75
greaves thinks of wembley and , as much as the match â which he would enjoy â he imagines the queues of traffic on the north circular , the hassles of parking and of spending the hour before kick - off having a big fuss made about his presence when he would rather be sat with a pot of tea in front of liverpool and manchester city and then the rugby
greaves ' interests were always broader than just football , and he should be left to enjoy his retirement he liked playing , and was quite brilliant at it , but since retiring he âs as likely to be engrossed in a test match as a cup final , and he has nât the ego to wish to be feted wherever he goes
we should wish every former athlete the quiet contentment of greaves
