it was a deeply disturbing homecoming for shreya singhal , then 21
she had returned to indians from her astrophysics course at the uk âs bristol university in 2012 , when news of a series of netizens â arrests spurred by powerful politicians started making headlines
behind these arrests lurked a relatively young dark law : section 66a of the information technology act
shreya singhal decided to file a public interest litigation
a little over two years later , justice rohinton nariman of the supreme court got up from his chair after announcing , â section 66a of the information technology act ( it ) act , 2000 , is hereby struck down in its entirety
â petitioner shreya singhal and her mother manali singhal were thrilled with the ruling a packed courtroom noisily greeted the landmark judgment upholding online freedom of speech and expression
the two - judge bench headed by the son of legendary jurist fali s. nariman had struck down as â unconstitutional â and â vague â the draconian provision which gave â sweeping and unbridled power â to the police to arrest anyone for offensive posts on social networking websites or sending messages through mobile phones and tablets
for shreya singhal , daughter of supreme court lawyer manali singhal and granddaughter of delhi high court judge sunanda bhandare , a long battle against the might of the state had just ended
shock and anger â i was shocked by the arrests , including of a jadavpur university professor , for circulating a picture spoofing west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee and her party colleague mukul roy ; imprisonment of puducherry businessman ravi srinivasan for allegedly posting offensive messages on twitter about congress leader p. chidambaram âs son karti chidambaram , â she said
but the trigger for her pil was the arrest of two girls in mumbai for a critical online post about the shut - down in the city for bal thackarey âs funeral
no definition the court found merit in shreya singhal âs argument that the language used in section 66a is so vague that the accused would not know what the offence was , and nor would the authorities be clear on the charges
shreya singhal is still in her third year of law at the delhi university , with an accomplishment even those with 30 years in practice would cherish .
