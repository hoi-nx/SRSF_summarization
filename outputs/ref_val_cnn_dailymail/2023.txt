taylor kicked down miss jodie emery 's front door on september 22 last year , and began fighting with mr wilson ( pictured ) , fatally stabbing him in the thigh ' you persistently badgered her to the extent that you became a nuisance
' the court earlier heard that taylor , a slaughterhouse worker who spent his days deboning animal carcasses , had been in an eight - month relationship with miss jodie emery
the pair had shared a caravan holiday together in scarborough , but after they returned home miss emery secretly terminated a pregnancy
unable to accept the break - up taylor began texting and calling miss jodie emery on a regular basis begging for them to get back together , and often went to her house to watch her , often coming up to look through the windows
louise blackwell qc said on the day of the killing taylor texted miss jodie emery saying : ' i miss you
' miss jodie emery was trying her best , obviously unsuccessfully to break apart and stop the defendant being able to get at wilson but it did not stop
wilson was on the bottom , jodie emery had got herself between him and the defendant lay on top but she described the repeated blows being struck to wilson
during his trial at preston crown court , taylor ( pictured right ) had tried to claim there was no innocent reason for mr wilson to be with miss jodie emery , and denied intending to kill him , but a jury ruled otherwise the court heard that after miss jodie emery split from taylor following an eight - month relationship he became jealous , constantly texting and calling her , and often going to her house ( pictured ) to spy on her ' she did not initially realise there was a knife involved but after a period of time during which blows were being reigned down , the defendant then stood up
' taylor fled the scene and dumped the knife as miss jodie emery rang for ambulance
mr wilson was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from the 6cm long and 7.5cm deep fatal wound which was to the inner right thigh
on the night of the killing taylor text miss emery saying '' ast chance , otherwise things are going to turn sour , tell me who is there ' before kicking in her front door while her two young daughters were asleep upstairs when taylor was arrested he said : ' no you are not serious are you , you are joking , he is dead ? he attacked me i have done nothing wrong '
in a video interview miss emery said wilson was ' just a friend ' whom she had known for a couple of months
