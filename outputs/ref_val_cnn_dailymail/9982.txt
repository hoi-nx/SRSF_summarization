the nfl sent a tough message to browns general manager ray for texting
however , the league did n't delete any of browns 's precious draft picks
farmer has been suspended without pay for the first four games of the 2015 regular season for sending text messages to the sideline during games last season
the league announced its punishment on monday , ending an investigation that hung over the franchise during yet another turbulent offseason and threatened to undermine the browns ' upcoming draft
the league said his ban begins on midnight of the sunday preceding the browns ' first regular - season game and will end immediately after the fourth regular - season game
farmer can not be involved in any club matters and is prohibited from being at the team 's offices , practice facility or games , the league said
ray sent text messages to the sideline last season during games and has been suspended ' i respect the league 's decision and understand that there are consequences for my actions , ' farmer said in a statement released by the browns
' the browns were also fined $ 250,000 , but that 's pocket change considering what they could have lost
the browns , who went 7 - 9 last season , could be positioning themselves to make a run at one of the top quarterbacks , and losing any assets would not only have weakened their bargaining power , but prevented a team with several holes from adding young talent
manziel 's first nfl season was plagued with doubts about his lifestyle and ability to knuckle down during its investigation , the league said it found no evidence that haslam or other team executives knew about the texts
along with manziel 's trip to rehab , offensive coordinator kyle shanahan had a messy departure and troubled wide receiver josh gordon was suspended by the league for at least one season for multiple drug violations
' we accept the league 's ruling , ' haslam said
