new york korean air 's " nut rage " case has made its way back to new york , with the flight attendant who served the offending macadamia nuts filing a lawsuit against the airline and a former executive
heather cho , a korean air executive and daughter of the airline 's chairman , is serving a one - year prison sentence in korea after throwing a fit on a new york flight because her nuts were served in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl
in a civil suit filed this week in state supreme court in queens , new york , cho -- whose name is listed as heather hyun a-cho in court documents -- is accused of " verbally and physically " attacking flight attendant do hee kim - hee in december on a seoul - bound flight departing from john f. kennedy international airport
at the time , cho , who was seated in first class , demanded that the plane go back to the gate so do hee kim could be kicked off the flight , according to the lawsuit
the suit describes cho as the " princess " of the " so - called royal " family that controls korean air , and says the executive screamed obscenities at do hee kim before hitting , shoving and threatening the flight attendant
on her return to korea , the lawsuit states , do hee kim was " pressured to lie to government regulators in order to cover up the incident , and to appear in public with cho as part of an orchestrated effort to try and rehabilitate cho 's public image
park chang-jin , the chief steward who was booted from the flight instead of do hee kim , has said the former executive treated crew members like " feudal slaves
" park and do hee kim , the flight attendant who served the nuts , had knelt in front of cho in apology
when the flight arrived in korea , the flight attendant said another airline manager , yeo woon - jin , pressured her not to talk to investigators about cho 's physically abusing her and park
in a statement , do hee kim 's lawyer , andrew weinstein , called heather cho 's behavior " humiliating , degrading , and damaging to ms. do hee kim , but ... also emblematic of ms. heather cho 's unbridled arrogance and disturbing sense of entitlement
