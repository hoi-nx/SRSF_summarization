homeowners should consider fitting cctv to trap burglars , the country 's most senior police officer declared yesterday
sir bernard hogan howe said police forces needed more crime scene footage to match against their 12million images of suspects and offenders
and he called on families and businesses to install cameras at eye level â to exploit advances in facial recognition technology
' the proposals on increasing the amount of privately owned cctv cameras are quite frankly orwellian and risk turning members of the public into an extension of the police , ' said renate samson of big brother watch
recommending greater use of cctv to gather more images of people 's faces â often innocent people 's faces â undermines the security of each and every one of us
labour mp andrew miller said : ' we were alarmed to discover that the police have begun uploading custody photographs of people to the police national database and using facial recognition software without any regulatory oversight
some of the people had not even been charged
' sir bernard hogan howe said most cameras were mounted high to keep them out of harm 's way and to give an overview of a crime area
he was speaking after turner , wife of olympic rower james cracknell , challenged him on lbc radio on whether cctv could be used to catch burglars
her house was burgled while she and her children were sleeping and footage from a neighbour 's cctv camera was too grainy to identify the thieves
the metropolitan police commissioner said britain needed more cameras to help fight crime and urged people to think about installing them when miss turner asked if more cameras were needed in homes and businesses , sir bernard hogan howe replied : ' yes
we 've got a strategy to encourage people to move their cameras down to eye level
' facial recognition software has got better , and we can now apply it to images of burglaries , and then compare them with images we take when we arrest people
' what we need to be able to do is to be able to compare that photograph with the images we have of people committing a crime
' taking the tops of their heads is not that helpful for facial recognition which relies on the eyes and the configuration of the area around the nose and the mouth
so we 're trying to get people to , ideally , add a camera at face level
if you ca n't buy one , could you think about moving it ? ' covert cameras disguised as clocks , clothes hooks , mirrors and even thermometers can be bought for as little as Â£ 40
' it threatens to undermine people 's confidence and inject fear in the place where they should feel most secure , ' she said
this is the moment that a thief was caught on camera as he came out of the wardrobe he had been hiding in for 13 hours , armed with a poker
but what he did not know is that ms potter had installed cctv cameras after being victim to burglaries in the past
' the cameras filmed him as he tried to make a getaway with a laptop and camera , brandishing a poker at 4am once his victim had gone to bed
' mr gittins said cctv of the break - in had shown bradford wearing a hood and entering the house on april 7 , and leaving it on april 8
