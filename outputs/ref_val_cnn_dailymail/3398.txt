death by drugs : goodman , 23 , died in colorado over the weekend after he took too many marijuana edibles and shot himself in the head a popular college graduate died this past weekend in colorado , after his family say he took too many marijuana candies and killed himself
goodman , 23 , of tulsa , oklahoma ate four times the prescribed amount of a peach tart marijuana edible candy in addition to a thc - laced red velvet cookie and proceeded to shoot himself in the head with a gun he brought on the trip for protection
goodman 's family say he was a charismatic and outgoing young man who never showed signs of depression or suicidal thoughts before
goodman was on a two - week ski trip with his family and friends when his parents dropped him off at the bus stop saturday to go snowboarding with his cousin , fowler
goodman 's parents were on their way back to tulsa , and their son was going to spend the rest of the trip with his cousin
during their day out , goodman and fowler went to silverthorne where the two purchased $ 78 worth of pot and edibles
when goodman did n't immediately feel the effects of the drug , he took two more and also ate red velvet cookie baked with marijuana ( his cousin had three cookies )
goodman 's mother fears her son did n't read the warning label on the candies , which say the effects can take hours to kick in
it 's unclear the specific brand goodman ingested several hours later , goodman 's behavior changed drastically and he became jittery , incoherent and started talking nonsensically
apparently unaware of his serious condition , fowler left goodman in the condo to hop in the hot tub with other members of their vacation party
only his cousin 's mother was in the apartment , when goodman grabbed his handgun , which he traveled with for protection , and shot himself
the single shot was fired just five minutes after fowler left goodman to use the hot tub
the summit county coroner says toxicology reports due back in a few weeks will shed more light on the edibles impact on goodman 's death
