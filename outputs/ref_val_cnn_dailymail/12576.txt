the country 's largest presbyterian denomination has changed its definition of marriage to include gay couples -- though not explicitly
presbyterian church ( usa ) approved an amendment to its constitution after most of its 171 presbyteries -- or governing bodies -- voted for it , pc ( usa ) said tuesday
" the new definition says , in part , that " marriage involves a unique commitment between two people , traditionally a man and a woman , to love and support each other for the rest of their lives
" already , pc ( usa ) ministers can perform same - sex marriages in states where such marriages are legal , the group said
in a post on pc ( usa ) 's website , jean and robert gorney accused the church of going against the bible and threatened to leave
" the amendment will take effect on june 21
