daley blind 's only previous visit to anfield came as a wide - eyed 10 - year - old when his footballing father danny secured tickets for a game against arsenal from jari litmanen , a former team - mate who had signed for liverpool
' it left a great impression on me , ' said daley blind
' at lunchtime on sunday , blind will return to anfield for the first time with his new manchester united team - mates
this year 's clash carries even greater significance than usual with a champions league place at stake and for blind it carries on the family tradition of being involved in big matches
daley blind ( right ) will play at anfield for the first time with manchester united on sunday afternoon daley blind is enjoying his time in manchester but admits he had to adapt to the pace of the premier league the 25 - year - old scores his first goal for manchester united to salvage a 2 - 2 draw against west brom in october last year his father played 42 times for holland and was captain of ajax 's legendary 1995 champions league - winning side alongside patrick kluivert , edgar davids and edwin van der sar
it was a first major triumph for an emerging manager called louis van gaal who clearly likes the blind family
almost two decades later , he selected daley for holland 's world cup team last summer and then signed him for manchester united in a Â£ 14million deal from ajax
it has been an eventful debut in the premier league for both of them
manchester united 's results have been far better than last season when they finished seventh under david moyes
they visit anfield having lost just twice in 19 league games
at the same time , their performances until last weekend 's 3 - 0 victory against tottenham had been patchy with new signings like angel di maria and radamel falcao struggling
blind has been a steadying influence , his versatility useful as van gaal has tried to juggle injuries and suspensions
the 25 - year - old has been used mostly as a holding midfielder but with michael carrick returning last weekend , he switched to left back as manchester united turned in their best performance of the season
daley blind says his manager is essentially the same person in england as when he took holland to the world cup semi-final
blind talks with his dad , holland coach danny , during a training session at last summer 's world cup in brazil the holland international believes he is similar to his dad when out on the football pitch blind , pictured alongside radamel falcao , was one of a number of summer signings made by louis van gaal blind screams with delight after curling the ball into the bottom corner of boaz myhill 's net at the hawthorns ' people only think he 's intimidating because he is honest
he is honest to people , ' explained daley blind
' in keeping with manchester united 's season , blind has experienced highs and lows
it was seen as a return to the old , swashbuckling manchester united
blind does n't think it 's that simple
he believes manchester united did n't change their approach much , the major difference was getting two early goals
manchester united boss louis van gaal has tried to implement his own philosophy at old trafford this season louis van gaal is pictured with danny blind and ajax chairman michael van praag back in 1994 blind , pictured in action against tottenham , has proved his versatility under van gaal this season danny blind leads his son out during his ajax days ( left ) and lifts the champions league trophy in 1995 the dutchman looks dejected alongside wayne rooney and tyler blackett during defeat by leicester ' everything came together
' the cries of ' attack , attack ' heard from manchester united fans this season are meant to lift the players
but daley blind says the team have to use their heads in matches , too
every game is difficult in the premier league , you have to be also smart in the games
' that adaptability is one of the reasons van gaal signed blind rather than any other member of his dutchman world cup squad
he has proved invaluable in a season where manchester united have suffered an unprecedented number of injuries and said : ' i think i am a player who can switch really fast in my mind
' blind has been particularly impressed with manchester united 's travelling support since joining the club blind ( back row , second from right ) left ajax for old trafford in a Â£ 14million deal late last summer the former ajax man was a key part of van gaal 's squad as holland reached the world cup semi-finals danny blind and his son pose in front of christ the redeemer in rio during the 2014 world cup in brazil van gaal described daley 's father as the best leader he 's ever had â some claim when he has managed at bayern munich and barcelona
daley says he has inherited characteristics from both parents
' i was five when my dad won the champions league
' i guess i must have seen louis van gaal as a boy when i 'd go to watch my father train but i ca n't remember anything specific
' when louis van gaal tells me things , i think it might be the same advice he used to give my father ! ' daley and danny also work together with their national team where danny is a coach and tipped to be manager
' danny is also a regular visitor to watch his son play at old trafford but wo n't be at anfield on sunday afternoon
daley blind netted another late equaliser for manchester united in their 1 - 1 draw at west ham in february marouane fellaini celebrates with his team - mate blind after his crucial strike at upton park daley blind only knew compatriot robin van persie and andreas pereira before he joined manchester united last summer off the field , daley has settled in well and chosen to live in a city - centre apartment rather than a sprawling footballers ' wives pad in cheshire
for someone who knew only two of manchester united 's players when he arrived â national team - mate robin van persie and youngster andreas pereira , who started his career in holland â blind has acclimatised well
and the result when daley blind visited anfield just over 14 years ago ? liverpool lost 2 - 1
a repeat on sunday would leave manchester united with one foot firmly in the champions league
