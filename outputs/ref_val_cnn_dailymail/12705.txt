has taken delivery of the izumo , the largest japan military vessel to see service since second world war the warship was unveiled at a ceremony at the yokusuka naval base near yokohama , also home to the u.s navy 's seventh fleet
the izumo has a crew of 470 , and with a standard displacement of 19,500 tones ( 24,000 tonnes at full load , according to military publication jane 's ) , it is as large as the storied yamato - class battleships which fought u.s. naval forces in the pacific theater of second world war the wreck of one of the two yamato - class battleships , the musashi , was discovered early in march 2015 by microsoft co-founder paul allen
at 241 meters ( 791 feet ) in length , the izumo is 51 meters ( 167 ft ) longer than the hyuga , another helicopter carrier which was , until now , the mdsf 's largest vessel
regional neighbors and rivals questioned the legitimacy of such a ship for purely defensive purposes , pointing out that , due to its size and deck configuration it could be repurposed as an aircraft carrier -- a class banned under japan 's pacifist constitution
it 's also possible that japan may explore the possibility during the izumo 's service , " li jie , a beijing - based military expert , told the china state - backed global times newspaper
he insisted that the new addition to japan 's maritime forces was designed for peaceful purposes
japan , along with the philippines and vietnam , is engaged in territorial disputes with china over the sovereignty of islands in the south china sea , and kazuhisa ogawa , a defense analyst at the strategic research institute of international change in japan , says that , in combination with japan 's other helicopter carriers , the izumo could be used to " regain remote islets
" he also downplayed china 's suggestions that the size of the izumo represented an escalation of japan 's military ambitions , telling cnn that although it is the biggest japan military ship since second world war , it is only a fifth of the size of the uss george washington
japan prime minister abe allowed for a reinterpreting of japan 's constitution , paving the way for more active military engagement overseas
" japan chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga has previously said that china should work on developing a future - looking cooperative relationship with japan , rather than highlighting japan 's previous , 70 - year - old indiscretions
