david cameron has said he will only take part in one election debate david cameron could be given his own election programme if he refuses to show up for televised leaders debates , it was claimed today
broadcasters last week insisted they would push ahead with plans for three debates in april â including a face - off between the prime minister and miliband
but the bbc is understood to have backed down from threats to ' empty chair ' mr david cameron if he refuses to show
if the corporation pushes ahead with its planned cameron vs miliband debate without the prime minister it risks being accused of giving an unprecedented platform to the labour leader , just a week before the election
to meet strict impartiality rules during election campaigns , the bbc is considering giving mr david cameron his own show in return , the independent on sunday claimed today
labour have accused the prime minister of ' ducking and weaving ' to get out of the debates and called for new laws to make sure leaders debates always take place
a labour government would set a deadline of 2017 for changes to be put in place , giving more than enough time to plan the debates for a 2020 election
mr miliband told the observer : ' in recent days the british public has been treated to the unedifying and tawdry spectacle of a prime minister seeking to duck out of the tv debates he once claimed to support with great enthusiasm
mr miliband added : ' it is time to ensure , once and for all , that these debates belong to the people , not the prime minister of the day
' the four broadcasters - the bbc , itv , sky and channel 4 - have said they will stick to their previously - announced plans for three debates during the election campaign , and urged the prime minister to ' reconsider ' his refusal to take part in these shows , including a head - to - head showdown with mr miliband
education secretary nicky morgan ( left ) said the broadcasters had made a ' mess ' of the election debates , but harriet harman accused david cameron of trying to scupper them mr david cameron , nick clegg and gordon brown faced off in tv debates ahead of the 2010 general election but mr david cameron 's chief spin doctor craig oliver said their response was ' disappointing ' and restated the prime minister 's ' final position ' was for a single debate to take place in the week starting march 23
the broadcasters said they would stick to plans for a seven - way debate involving mr david cameron , mr miliband , nick clegg of the lib dems and the leaders of the greens , ukip , scottish national party and plaid cymru on itv on april 2 , followed by a second show on bbc featuring the same line - up on april 16
a final one - on - one clash with the tory and labour leaders invited is scheduled to be broadcast on sky news and channel 4 on april 30 - exactly a week before the may 7 election
she said : ' the prime minister has made a very clear offer
the prime minister has made a very clear offer - get seven parties in the same place , have a 90 - minute debate before the campaign starts
she told sky news ' murnaghan : ' i think the debates are an important part of our democracy , in which case let 's not have the prime minister of the day ducking and weaving because he is afraid of actually justifying his record
