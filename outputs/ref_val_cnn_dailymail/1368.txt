landmarks by macfarlane at university college london in the sixties , one door in the english department was marked the english place name society
during my three years as a student i never saw anyone enter or leave that room , and imagined mountains of dusty books and documents , rambled by spiders , forgotten maps of a dead world
because the original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills , streams and bogs have fallen out of use , macfarlane performs a miracle of resurrection in his new book
original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills , streams and bogs have fallen out of use for years he âs been passionately engaged with the work of men and women who have written about the natural world , such as richard jefferies , barry lopez , jacquetta hawkes and roger deakin
so , each chapter describes the work of one or two writers who have shaped macfarlane âs thinking , and takes us on an imaginary walk into their worlds
macfarlane says : â this is a book about the power of language â strong style , simple words â to shape our sense of place
that âs why macfarlane ends by describing a thrilling project with primary school children given free access to explore a park in winter
to deprive children of that natural birthright macfarlane celebrates in all his work is to cut out an essential part of their hearts .
