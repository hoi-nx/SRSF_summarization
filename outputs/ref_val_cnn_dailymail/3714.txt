whether it be in the boardroom or on the hunting ground , male competition can cause a sudden spike in testosterone levels
now a new study has found a link between testosterone and the caring side of men when they return home from the ' hunt '
the study revealed that the higher a man 's testosterone has risen during the day , the more the ' love hormone ' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home
the study was based on tsimane people , who are an indigenous population of forager - farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of bolivia 's amazon basin
researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle the researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer the study was based on tsimane people , who are an indigenous population of forager - farmers and hunters who live in the lowlands of bolivia 's amazon basin
researchers claim the human hormone system is particularly well adapted to their lifestyle which revolves around small , tight - knit communities that produce their own food
the study revealed that the higher a man 's testosterone has risen during the day , the more the ' love hormone ' oxytocin he tends to produce on his arrival home
the researchers also found that the increase in oxytocin was greater for those men who were absent longer , and linked with changes in testosterone ( pictured ) ' hunting for subsistence and sharing meat is something people have done for hundreds of thousands of years
' previous studies have shown that oxytocin makes people more cooperative while testosterone has the opposite effect
a study found that a whiff of the â love chemical â oxytocin made men rate their partners as being more attractive
and german researchers recently said that oxytocin may also play a key role in monogamy , a trait that is rare among mammals , other than ourselves
lead author dirk scheele said : â when the men received the oxytocin instead of placebo , the reward system in the brain was very active when viewing their partner and they perceived them as more attractive than other women
â according to jaeggi and co-lead author trumble , high testosterone while hunting could be attributed to a ' winner effect ' experienced by men making a kill
it could also be related to the status competition that hunting represents for traditional societies such as the tsimane
' these men are coming home , they 're finished with work for the day , and they 're about to eat and share food , ' jaeggi continued
' reconnecting with their families after a day of separation would have been a very common challenge for men throughout evolutionary history , and oxytocin could help with that
