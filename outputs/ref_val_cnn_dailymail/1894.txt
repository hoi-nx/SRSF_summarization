louise whitaker lost 9st but was left with huge saggy breasts resembling ' coal sacks ' after losing a staggering nine stone , louise whitaker expected to be brimming with confidence
but her joy at dropping four dress sizes and shrinking from a 22 to a size 14 was shattered every time she caught sight of her chest in the mirror
the 41 - year - old said despite shedding the weight she was left with huge saggy breasts resembling ' coal sacks '
she said she regularly had to ' tuck in ' her 48ee breasts , leaving her feeling more embarrassed of her body than ever before
after being denied a reduction operation on the nhs because her body mass index still deemed her to be obese , the support worker turned to a private clinic in desperation
and today , after having half her breast tissue removed in a three - hour operation , ms whittaker said she feels as though she has been freed
they were like giant coal sacks and i spent all my time trying to tuck them into place to stop them escaping from my bra
' but she was rejected from the nhs waiting list for a breast reduction because after losing weight her bmi crept back up to a fraction over the 30 limit - at which point a person is thought to be obese
ms louise whitaker has three children aged 20 , 17 and 14 and lives in bradford , said : ' i was on the waiting list for a reduction for two and a half years after i lost weight then one day i got a call telling me i would have to come off it because of my bmi
' she was estimated to be carrying at least 6lbs in breast tissue and without it her bmi would have fallen into the healthy range
her bust was reduced to a more manageable 40d thanks to the removal of half of her breast tissue
i could n't believe the coal sacks had finally gone
the 41 - year - old was denied a breast reduction operation on the nhs because her body mass index was just over 30 - the limit where a person is classed as obese - after losing weight but today , after having half her breast tissue removed in a three - hour operation at a private clinic in manchester , ms whittaker said she feels as though she has been freed ' the surgeon was amazing and really did a wonderful job
