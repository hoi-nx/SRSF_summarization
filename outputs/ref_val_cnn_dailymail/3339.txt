need some inspiration deciding who to back at cheltenham ? sportsmail 's marcus townend and scudamore reveal their favourites ... scudamore - eight - time champion jockey and rider of 13 festival winners hargam no secret that this is regarded as one of ap mccoy âs best chances of the week
he was recruited from france , where he showed decent form on the flat , and although he was beaten by a good rival on his hurdling debut , has won his two races since
best odds : 6 - 1 ap mccoy and hargam won the jcb triumph hurdle trial at cheltenham in december holywell ( gold cup , 3.20 ) rain would admittedly diminish confidence in jonjo oâneill âs runner but he has all the credentials to run really well
best odds : 9 - 1 current event ( foxhunters â chase , 4.0 ) owned , but not trained , by paul nicholls and prepared for this race by one of his long - time staff , rose loxton
paul nicholls is pictured with sir alex ferguson and owns current event best odds : 9 - 1 next sensation ( grand annual chase , 5.15 ) fourth in this race last year after trying to make all the running and only being overhauled after the last fence
best odds : 10 - 1 captain heath - marcus townend on the best each - way bets karezak ( triumph hurdle , 1.30 ) alan king âs entry has been locking horns with the best juvenile hurdlers all season and , while a sequence of four second places might seem off - putting , he does not lack heart
best odds : 20 - 1 karezak ( pictured right ) is a decent each way bet in the opener on the festival 's final day tea for two ( albert bartlett novices â hurdle , 2.40 ) romped home in january âs lanzarote hurdle at kempton and subsequently beaten at ascot
best odds : 33 - 1 the giant bolster ( gold cup , 3.20 ) has become a regular in this race having finished second , fourth and third in the last three runnings
