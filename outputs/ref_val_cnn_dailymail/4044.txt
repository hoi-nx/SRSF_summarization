rooted to the spot , horror etched on her face , she looks as though she âll never get over the shock
my face is the stuff of nightmares
i âm swaddled like this because , according to a new bestselling book , the skincare revolution , steaming your face by covering it in clingfilm is the secret to beautifully smooth and rejuvenated skin
a new bestselling book , the skincare revolution , says that steaming your face and covering it in clingfilm is the key to rejuvenated skin japanese women are renowned for their beautiful skin but , until now , no book in english has revealed the secrets of their beauty routines
now , we can discover the joys of massage to tone the muscles of the face and natural remedies for wrinkles , sagging , oiliness , pimples and blackheads â including a step - by - step guide to the clingfilm mask
the idea is that the heat created by your breath and body warmth will encourage pores to open , so that the moisture from any water , creams or serums applied to the face will soak into the deeper layers of the skin , boosting collagen
â moisture content is the most important factor in a rejuvenated complexion , â says the book âs author saeki , a celebrity beauty guru in japanese
â if skin is hydrated , it will look younger , firmer and fresher
frances childs ( pictured ) gave the bizarre technique a try and wrapped her own face in clingfilm to see what the results were like â we use clingfilm in severe cases of psoriasis to encourage cream to work at a deeper dermal level , â says dr chopra , director of the london dermatology centre in wimpole street , london
dr chopra says healing cream is applied to the skin , then wrapped in clingfilm before being left overnight in a process called occlusion therapy
the heat from the body encourages pores to open and the cream to absorb , rather than just sitting on the skin âs surface
so if wrapping my face in clingfilm helps me retain some semblance of youth , i âm willing to give it a try
frances childs ( pictured ) bought cosmetic facial mask sheets and first soaked them in water before applying nars hydrating fluid to the mask having bought a cosmetic facial mask sheet â a thin piece of cotton in the shape of a face with the eyes , nostrils and lips cut out â ( Â£ 2 for 40 , amazon.co.uk ) , i set to work
it gathers water on and below the skin âs surface and retains it , plumping out fine lines and smoothing the complexion
â the book also recommends that you do a quick lymphatic drainage massage to clear toxins and reduce puffiness with the mask drenched , i pat it on to my face , where it sticks like a damp cloth
now to wrap my face in clingfilm
beneath the mask , my skin feels smooth and slippery and i âm clouding up from the humidity
already , my skin looks smoother and plumper
after taking off the mask , frances childs ( pictured ) tries to follow follow saeki âs instructions on the art of water massage by spritzing water along the â muscles of facial expression â she recommends a quick lymphatic drainage massage
this , in turn , will help reduce puffiness in the face and lead to a clearer complexion
after slathering on the cream , it âs time to steam my face again â only this time , i use a wet towel heated in the microwave for 30 seconds
i can almost feel the moisturiser seeping into my pores and , i hope , filling out the lines across my face
frances childs ( pictured ) was pleasantly surprised by the results of the clingfilm facial and says she thought her complexion looked instantly softer onto the final leg of this marathon , and it âs time to massage serum into my face
then i massage it into my damp skin , concentrating on smoothing out the lines around my mouth and on my forehead , and pressing it into my face with upward strokes
â you wo nât get lasting rejuvenating effects from this facial because it wo nât increase collagen , which is the key to younger skin
