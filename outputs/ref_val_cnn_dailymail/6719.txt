councils across the country are rushing to snap up the new high - tech manhole covers as they try to curb the theft of the old , low - tech versions , according to the people 's daily online
the seemingly drastic measure was taken after previous anti-theft measures - chaining the manhole covers to street lamps - left officials red - faced , turning for sale in various places around the world
high tech : the new manhole covers are fitted with tracking devices to help authorities find the thieves problem : more than 240,000 manholes were stolen in beijing over a 10 year period , thanks to metal values the chains also proved unpopular , with many pointing out they could easily be cut , and were dangerous for people walking along the street
it has been estimated that more than 240,000 manhole covers were stolen from beijing 's streets in the 10 years to 2013 alone
measures : previous attempts at curbing thefts - like tying the manholes to lamp posts - have not worked the new covers , designed to have shock absorption and noise reduction features , are made out of a metal with a far lower value , as a further deterrent
