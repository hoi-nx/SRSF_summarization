england boss hodgson has criticised tottenham , claiming they should not be taking kane on a 21,000 - mile post-season trek to australia if they think he needs a rest
kane gushed with pride on thursday after being rewarded for his fine form with a maiden england call - up
the 21 - year - old is in line to make his international debut against lithuania on march 27 or in italy four days later
kane has been called into the england squad for the first time by hodgson kane is set to play for the under 21 side in summer ' it is an honour to be called up to the senior side , something i always dreamed of as a kid , ' kane told spurs
' having started the season as spurs ' third - choice striker , few expected kane to score 26 goals for the club
but now he is the club 's poster boy and , for that reason , the north londoners are determined to take him on their post-season jaunt to australia , where they will play sydney fc in a friendly on may 30
kane will , more than likely , be included in the england under-21 squad for the european championship - which takes place from june 17 to june 30 - as hodgson wants him to experience international tournament football
hodgson has noted mauricio pochettino 's concerns about kane 's potential tiredness , but he thinks spurs have a perfect opportunity to rest the striker by leaving him out of the squad for the 42 - hour round trip to australia
' personally speaking , playing for england at under - 21 level at a tournament is more important than a friendly in australia
