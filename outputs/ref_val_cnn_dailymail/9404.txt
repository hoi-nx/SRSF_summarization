how did iron become scattered throughout earth 's 2,000 - mile thick mantle more than four billion years ago ? that 's a question that has puzzled scientists , with most thinking asteroid impacts were the cause , but now a new theory has been presented - iron rain
by re-analysing the vapourisation point of iron , a study has determined that conditions on early earth would have caused iron to rain down on the ground
scientists in new mexico have a new theory for the origin of earth 's iron
research suggests iron would have turned into vapour when meteorites hit the young earth , as shown in the artist 's impression above
the vapour would then have drifted up in plumes , condensed and then rained down on the surface of our planet the research was conducted with the z machine at sandia national laboratories in albuquerque , new mexico
astrophysicists say this lower pressure - 507 gigapascals ( gpa ) compared to 887 gpa - was easily achieved during the latter stages of earth 's formation
' because planetary scientists always thought it was difficult to vapourise iron , they never thought of vapourisation as an important process during the formation of earth and its core , ' said principal investigator dr kraus
' this changes the way we think of planet formation , in that instead of core formation occurring by iron sinking down to the growing earth 's core in large blobs ( technically called diapirs ) , that iron was vapourised , spread out in a plume over the surface of earth and rained out as small droplets , ' said dr kraus
' the small iron droplets mixed easily with the mantle , which changes our interpretation of the geochemical data we use to date the timing of earth 's core formation
this would have happened in earth 's late formative stages more than four billion years ago , with the iron being sent bullet - like into the region between the core and crust - the mantle
