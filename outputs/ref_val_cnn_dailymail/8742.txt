lord bates said too many babies are born to immigrant mothers in the uk too many babies are being born to immigrant mothers in the uk , a government minister said last night
in controversial remarks , lord bates said that a quarter of children born in the uk each year now had a mother who was herself from overseas
in 2001 , prior to labour presiding over a decade of wide - scale immigration , only 16 per cent of uk births were to foreign mothers
home office minister lord bates reeled off a series of statistics to demonstrate the significant impact mass immigration is having
lord bates , who was previously mp for langbaurgh in the north east , was responding to a lords question from migrationwatch chairman green of deddington
lord bates said : ' we are absolutely at one on needing a firm but fair immigration policy to protect the public services of this country and provide opportunities for those who want to come here to work
' however , he was criticised by members of the labour and lib dem benches for his comments
labour 's lord soley said the children of migrants ' have made an immensely valuable contribution to the uk '
a quarter of children born in the uk each year now had a mother who was herself from overseas baroness hussein-ece , a lib dem , said political leaders ' need to make a case for the positive impact that immigration has had on this country '
the study claimed the true impact of immigration has been ' substantially understated ' because the office for national statistics did not count 1.3million children born to foreign parents as part of the impact of immigration on population growth
not including children born in the uk meant net migration was recorded at a much lower 2.5million
in separate exchanges with the labour benches , lord bates defended the prime minister 's failure to hit his ' tens of thousands ' target
