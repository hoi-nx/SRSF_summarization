but at least my mother , the writer jocasta innes , was in her right mind until pancreatic cancer ended her life two years ago , aged 78
writer daisy goodwin used an america dna mapping service to discover whether or not she carried the mutated genes likely to raise your risk of breast and ovarian cancer , parkinson âs and alzheimer âs disease my poor grandmother eileen did nât have that : she died in a fog of mental confusion , looking at her children as if they were strangers
is there ever a â good â way to go ? most of us have no idea how we are going to shuffle off this mortal coil â it âs probably the only thing that keeps us sane
it âs done by mapping your genome , that unique sequence of 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up your dna , pinpointing the mutations that determine if you âre likely to go gracefully or whether you âre likely to develop the kind of disease that âs a living death
dna mapping has been brought to public attention after angelina jolie âs discovery that she carried the genes that would seriously increase her chances of ovarian and breast cancer
she âs since had a double mastectomy , and this week announced she âd had both ovaries removed , too
is this a useful guide as to how to live your life , or simply too much information ? daisy goodwin 's grandmother eileen , pictured here ( left ) with daisy goodwin 's mother , the writer jocasta innes ( centre ) , started to suffer from dementia aged 70 i âd sent off my sample to the company , 23 and me , last year because i was thinking of doing a television show about british âs genetic make up
then , at the beginning of the year , i was sent an email which said my â health overview â was available on the company âs website
but did i want to know if i carried the genes that put me at a higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer , parkinson âs and alzheimer âs , i wondered ? with one click i would have a glimpse of how my life might end â or face terrifying decisions about preventative surgery
' i spent weeks deciding whether i should find out or not , ' says daisy goodwin ( pictured left ) , who eventually decided to learn the truth about her test results after a conversation with her 14 - year - old daughter lydia ( pictured right ) the results are split into two sections : first are the innocuous ones , then you can click on another button for your genetic risk factors
the thing i really dread is alzheimer âs
my grandmother developed a form of dementia in her early 70s and it was awful to watch a woman who had gained a double - first from cambridge lose her razor - sharp wits
daisy goodwin 's mother jocasta innes , pictured here with husband richard goodwin , was the author of 70s bestseller , pauper 's cookbook at first , all i saw was the good news â i do nât have the mutations that cause breast and ovarian cancer
parkinson âs did nât show up either
but then i looked at the alzheimer âs results â and my complacency fell away
it took a few minutes to realise i was not being given the all - clear , that it said i have one of the genetic variants that is a marker for late - onset alzheimer
i began shaking and thinking about my grandmother âs last days : i do nât want to be somebody who âs lost all sense of who they are , being cared for in an anonymous home by strangers , but those visions kept coming into my head
' although there is part of me that wishes that i had nât clicked that button , now that i have , there is no excuse not to make the most of every healthy day left to me , ' says daisy goodwin my memory is probably my greatest gift ( my children call me the human google ) , so the thought of losing it makes me shiver
what i really wanted was a stiff drink , but the one thing i do know about alzheimer âs is that alcohol is not good for potential dementia sufferers â my grandmother âs short - term memory got a lot worse after her nightly gin
and if you âre reading this and panicking because you have a relative with alzheimer âs â do nât
' my memory is probably my greatest gift ( my children call me the human google ) , so the thought of losing it makes me shiver , ' says daisy goodwin , pictured here aged 8 my mother was still in sound mind when she died two years ago , and my father is extremely spry at 80 , so i probably have 25 years or so before i need to worry
and who knows , by the time i reach 70 â the age my grandmother began getting symptoms â there may be some way of treating alzheimer âs
sergey brin , one of the geniuses behind google who is married to the founder of 23 and me , discovered through his dna test that he had a genetic risk of parkinson âs
dna mapping has been brought to public attention after angelina jolie âs discovery that she carried the genes that would seriously increase her chances of ovarian and breast cancer although i hesitated about taking the test , now that i know there is a chance i might spend the last years of my life without the mental capacity i currently have , it makes me very determined to use my brain while it is still in good nick
