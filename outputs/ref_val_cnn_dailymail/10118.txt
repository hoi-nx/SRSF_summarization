making cocktails in space is a difficult business , but now there âs a specially designed â glass â in the pipeline that promises to force liquid to stay put
grooves in the 3d printed vessel will let astronauts enjoy the aroma of a beverage and keep the fluid in place so they can drink in a way they are used to on earth
nasa once developed â parabolic sherry â and astronauts have been known to have a swig of vodka , but drinking from a conventional glass is difficult
to solve this problem , liquid is typically kept in bags with attachment for straws , but while this is practical , it âs not an elegant solution and means astronauts ca nât smell the liquid , which is naturally less pungent and tasteless in zero gravity
the start - up chose to 3d print the cup so the complicated design can be refined quickly â with each design taking around 15 hours to print
because there is already a printer on the international space station , the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away , without the need to transport the delicate vessels
the ultimate goal is to 3d print a â glass â on the international space station â the zero gravity cocktail project is a fluid dynamics and lifestyle experience design experiment , â the company said
â the â glass , â which is said to â combine the beauty of a classic martini glass with the physics of space science â has grooves that force liquid to flow towards the drinker âs mouth , in one direction

because there is already a printer on the international space station ( international space station ) , the idea is that glasses could be printed off straight away , without the need to transport the delicate vessels
it hopes that products including the glass could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists in the future researchers at the maseeh college of engineering and computer science at portland state university recently unveiled a zero gravity espresso cup , which has a series of channels to simulate pouring
this image shows a pouch of coffee attached to the international space station ' new espresso machine the 3d - printed espresso cup is designed to cheat low - gravity by channeling liquid along a specifically - calculated contour in the vessel to exploit capillary forces that simulate the action of pouring
it âs one of several projects planned by the group who envisage its lifestyle products could be used by astronauts as well as future space tourists and colonists
it has created a kickstarter campaign to continue developing the cup and raise $ 30,000 ( Â£ 20,000 ) to eventually print it on the international space station â this campaign will help us test the glass in real weightless environments , which is very difficult to simulate on earth , â clc said
here , astronaut greg olsen uses a hose to blast droplets of water into his mouth the ' glass ' can be pre-ordered from the crowd funding website for $ 400 ( Â£ 263 ) and $ 500 ( Â£ 329 ) for a colourful version , and is due to ship in february next year
earlier this year , researchers revealed a 3d printed design that will let astronauts sip coffee from a strangely - shaped cup
