sae , the fraternity at the center of the racist oklahoma video , has its roots in the south
' we came up from dixie land , ' says a ditty from an old songbook , boasting about sae 's success
now , nearly 160 years after its founding at the university of alabama , another song - this one chanted by members of the frat 's oklahoma chapter and containing racial slurs and lynching references - hearkens back to the bad old times in the land of cotton and puts a new spotlight on the group 's activities over the years
sae officials insist the chant is neither a sanctioned song nor is it taught to fraternity members
this is believed to be a portrait of the original founding members of the sae fraternity in 1856 at the university of alabama chappell cook ( bottom row , second from right ) objected to the fraternity expanding north because he believed ' agitation ' over slavery would make it impossible for ' harmony ' though the fraternity has its own fraught racial history
when the question of ' northern expansion ' was brought up , one charter member - later a confederate army surgeon - said he did n't think heading north was wise because ' the constant agitation of the slavery question ' would make getting along impossible
it is claimed that the fraternity did not invite a black member until 1966 - and it took one activist brother seven ballots and a threat to ban every other new pledge before the other brothers assented
in more recent years , fraternity chapters across the country have gotten into trouble over racial incidents - including a hip hop - themed ' cripmas party ' at clemson university and an entire chapter being suspended at washington university at st. louis in 2013 over allegations of racial insensitivity
if there are any other chapters that use the song , ' we need to address that with those chapters and stop it immediately to stamp out this type of behavior , ' said sae spokesman brandon weghorst
the lyrics ' are so hateful and spiteful that it 's embarrassing to think that sae members would even know the chant or how it goes , if they 've heard it
' the fraternity was also investigating reports of other sae incidents that may have been tainted with racism , brandon weghorst said
right , pettit - an accomplished golfer at his former school highland park - is pictured putting in a 2013 photo parker rice , a oklahoma freshman from dallas , has been identified as the conductor leading the ' there will never be a n * * * * * in sea ' chant on saturday sae began on the tuscaloosa campus on march 9 , 1856 , a few months after noble leslie devotie outlined his vision to a close circle of friends during a stroll along the banks of the black warrior river
' when a north carolina chapter member raised the topic of a ' northern extension , ' charter member thomas chappell cook - who later served as a surgeon in the confederate army - responded that ' the constant agitation of the slavery question was a barrier to northern chapters , as it would preclude the possibility of harmony
sae would not return to its birthplace until 1886 , after the reconstruction - era ban on ' secret societies ' was relaxed and the school 's trustees , in the words of levere , repealed ' its obnoxious anti-fraternity laws
the editors of the new encyclopedia of sae ' the first greek - letter society founded in dixie to take permanent root ... ' even in those early years , the fraternity sought to prove that it 's more than just a provincial organization
the organization re-located to illinois after being founded in pre-civil war alabama sae was proud to claim president mckinley as a member at ohio 's mount union college â even though it was an honorary initiation that came long after mckinley 's college days
in his 2013 book , ' the people 's advocate , ' attorney sheehan claims credit for championing the bid of williamson , who he wrote was ' the first black man to ever receive a nomination for membership in sae in the entire history of that old , traditional southern fraternity
' according to sheehan , he was social chairman of sae 's harvard chapter in 1966
it took six more ballots for a member to admit that he was voting against williamson because he 'd heard that the piedmont , california , native ' dated white women
the fraternity was founded on this campus - though forced to shut down after the civil war ' i did n't want to be the sort of obsessive token negro that , wherever you could be the first black person to do something , you would do that just because you thought white people thought that would help move their organization ahead , ' he said
' brandon weghorst , an sae spokesman , was unable to say whether williamson was indeed the first black man formally invited to join a chapter
sae has had its share of controversy in more recent years
