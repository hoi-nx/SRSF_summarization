england âs victory over france was brilliant to watch , even if they did fall just short of winning the title
lancaster ( second left ) consoles his players after falling six points short of a six nations title england captain chris robshaw ( left ) and his team - mates came second for the fourth year in succession ben youngs celebrate his try during england 's storming 55 - 35 six nations victory against france more importantly , his words undermine lancaster
if this had happened to me , i would be in ritchie âs office demanding an explanation
if lancaster has called the result unacceptable , fair enough , but ritchie has no qualifications to talk about the team âs performance
this year is all about preparing for the world cup and england put 55 points and seven tries on the board in style
ritchie appointed lancaster after an interim period , which was a brave decision when he had the opportunity to put in far more experienced coaches
coming in with no international coaching experience , lancaster has done a very good job
ritchie ( right ) should be backing lancaster ahead of the eagerly - anticipated world cup in september i âm sure ritchie had good intentions , perhaps wanting to be seen to be saying the right thing after another title miss. but he will regret what he said as england are in a very good position
if england are going to win the world cup , they have to have everybody together as one team , everybody âs noses pointing in the same direction from the chief executive down to the water boys
we should all be feeling positive after such a brilliant display against france and looking forward to the world cup
