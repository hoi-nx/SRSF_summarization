buoyant : osborne on a visit to a building site in essex yesterday families will be better off this year than they were when the coalition came to power , independent experts said yesterday
in a boost to osborne , the ifs said it was â very likely â that household incomes would be higher this year than in 2010
the chancellor âs claim that families would be Â£ 900 better off in 2015 was one of the key tory messages in wednesday âs budget
the ifs also raised serious questions about miliband âs much - repeated counter-claim that families are Â£ 1,600 worse off than they were in 2010
in its annual post-budget briefing yesterday , it suggested the labour âs figure was out of date and failed to take account of rising pensioner incomes , surging employment or changes to the tax and benefit system
the think - tank âs verdict potentially deals a fatal blow to mr miliband âs claims of a cost of living â crisis â
it also said labour âs plans were so lax that mr miliband might borrow up to Â£ 25billion a year more than the tories â piling up britain âs Â£ 1.5trillion national debt indefinitely
mr osborne seized on the ifs verdict last night as evidence that the government âs plans are starting to deliver higher living standards for families despite the years of austerity needed to deal with the huge budget deficit left by labour
the chancellor said : â this is a very significant moment for our economic debate : on the day after the budget , the independent ifs have confirmed the obr forecast that living standards are set to be higher in 2015 than in 2010
â this is more evidence that our plan is delivering for britain âs families , and it demolishes miliband âs central claim in this election
the ifs said labour âs claim was based on figures from the annual survey of hours and earnings , covering the period 2010 - 2014
and he warned the labour statistics give only a partial view of total household income
â the chancellor âs claim that families would be Â£ 900 better off in 2015 was one of the key tory messages in wednesday âs budget he did not directly endorse mr osborne âs Â£ 900 figure , but said it was based on a â quite reasonable measure of living standards â
ifs director johnson said that real incomes were â very likely â to be higher this year than in 2010
â the ifs also assessed mr miliband âs claim that the coalition has produced a â recovery for the few â
but , if labour raids on the rich before 2010 are stripped out , it is the poorest 10 per cent who have lost the biggest proportion of their income , because of cuts to benefits
miliband claimed that families are Â£ 1,600 a year worse off compared to 2010 in the aftermath of wednesday âs budget , the tories and labour have clashed bitterly over what will be a key general election battleground : are households better off now than in 2010 ? here , the daily mail sorts the claim from the reality ... what miliband says : in his budget reply , the labour leader repeated his claim â made ad nauseam in recent years â that : â this chancellor has failed the working families of britain
people are Â£ 1,600 a year worse off
â reality : the figure â the foundation of labour âs â cost - of - living crisis â â is based solely on gross earnings , not net incomes
to reach the figure of Â£ 1,600 , labour compares a person âs gross income with the retail price index measure of inflation , which is discredited and has been replaced in the national accounts by the cpi , which produces a significantly lower annual rate
what osborne says : on wednesday , the chancellor declared : â the facts show households on average will be around Â£ 900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 â and immeasurably more secure for living in a country whose economy is not in crisis any more
balls rubbished osborne 's suggestion that families are Â£ 900 better off than they were in 2010 however , a recent ons research paper found that if they were removed from the figures , the measure would have delivered a marginally more positive result for ordinary households and mr osborne â not less so , as mr balls implied
verdict : the hammer was brought down in favour of mr osborne by the hugely respected ifs , which said average household incomes â are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010 â
labour will point to the qualifying remark by the ifs that this â still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history
having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration â
during an interview on good morning britain yesterday , labour âs shadow chancellor confessed he was relieved he had not been asked any maths questions live on tv
â later , on bbc radio 4 âs today programme , mr balls admitted it was â good â that mr osborne announced help for savers with the Â£ 1,000 tax - free savings allowance
he also said the help to buy isa was an â interesting idea â that would not be scrapped if labour wins in may and that he would keep the rise in the personal tax allowance â to go up from Â£ 10,600 to Â£ 11,000 by 2017 - 18
