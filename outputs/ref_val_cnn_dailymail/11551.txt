freeman , one of britain âs most bankable hollywood stars , was last night unveiled as the first big celebrity backer of labour âs 2015 general election campaign
the millionaire actor , who has enjoyed a dizzying rise to international superstardom with the hobbit trilogy , was the focus of a glossy three - minute film in which he insisted mr ed miliband âs party would â make sure the economy works for all of us , not just the privileged few â
millionaire actor freeman ( pictured ) is the focus of a glossy three - minute film in which he insists mr ed miliband âs party would â make sure the economy works for all of us , not just the privileged few â but last night , the labour leader faced embarrassment after it emerged that freeman is a former supporter of scargill âs far - left socialist party which openly refused to vote labour at the 2005 general election
freeman himself also faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported that he sends his son to a Â£ 12,000 - a - year private school
not only that , but his long term partner once declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid Â£ 120,000 tax bill â despite freeman having an estimated fortune of Â£ 10million
in last night âs three - minute broadcast , freeman , who found fame in the satirical britain sitcom the office , said : â i do nât know about you , but my values are about community , compassion , decency ; that âs how i was brought up

â at first glance , it appeared to represent a much needed boost for mr ed miliband as freeman is a good deal more famous than some of labour âs other celebrity backers â such as baldrick actor tony robinson
but last night it emerged that mr freeman spent years supporting a far - left socialist labour party that was set up by the militant miners â union boss scargill in protest at labour
freeman faced accusations of hypocrisy after it was reported he sends his son to a private school the conservatives said freeman âs decision to switch his support to labour showed how far mr ed miliband had dragged the party to the left
despite his socialist outlook , freeman is reported to send his son to a school which charges up to Â£ 12,669 a year
it was a major coup for labour leader ed miliband ( pictured ) but he faces embarrassment after it emerged freeman is a former scargill supporter the star also hit the headlines two years ago after it emerged his long - term partner abbington had declared herself bankrupt over an unpaid Â£ 120,000 tax bill , despite living with freeman , who is worth more than Â£ 10million
tory mp nigel adams said : â labour is trying to whitewash ed miliband from their campaign â his mps do nât want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast does nât even mention him
