cancel your plans to journey through the centre of earth or , at least , adjust your arrival time at the other side
research has found that it would only take a person 38 minutes to make it from one side of the planet to the other - not 42 minutes , as previously calculated
the hypothetical scenario finds that when the different densities of earth âs layers are taken into account , the trip is four minutes shorter than predicted
a student from mcgill university in canada examined the hypothetical scenario of falling through earth ( graphic shown )
originally it was thought the journey from one side to the other
when earth 's density is considered , the new estimate is 38 minutes and 11 seconds the latest time estimate was calculated by alexander klotz , a graduate student of physics at mcgill university in montreal , canada and published in the american journal of astrophysics
using these numbers it would take 38 minutes 11 seconds to fall through earth - four minutes and a second quicker than thought
the original theory goes like this : if a hole was dug from one point on earth to the other on the opposite side , it would take 42 minutes and 12 seconds to fall through
for example , if a person fell from london to the antipodes islands - which are roughly the other side of the world - it would supposedly take that long to travel the whole way
the original theory goes like this : if a hole was dug from one point on earth to the other on the opposite side , it would take 42 minutes and 12 seconds to fall through - but the new estimate is four minutes and eleven seconds quicker
so , you would speed up as you approached the centre ( illustrated right ) , and begin to slow down again as you made your way to the other side wish you were here ? if you fell from london ( left ) to the antipodes islands ( right ) - which are roughly the other side of the world - it would supposedly take 38 minutes and 11 seconds to make the journey last week it was announced a new ' superviscous ' layer in earth âs lower mantle had been discovered
the research was carried out by scientists at the university of utah by crushing minerals between diamonds to replicate conditions in earth 's interior
but mr alexander klotz said previous calculations did not take into account the densities of earth âs layers
using these new numbers in , mr alexander klotz found that the time to fall through earth was actually 38 minutes and 11 seconds - four minutes and a second quicker than thought
