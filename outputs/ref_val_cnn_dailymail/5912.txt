o'brien has insisted he will still be riding on the flat this season despite riding over hurdles for the first time at limerick on saturday
the 21 - year - old jockey rides egyptian war , trained by his father aidan and owned by jp mcmanus , in the family fun day rated novices â hurdle , at the same time , the mounts on seven runners also trained by his father at curragh are shared between moore and o'brien âs apprentice jockey younger siblings ana and donnacha
oâbrien , who is almost six feet tall , has admitted his time riding on the flat is likely to be limited by weight issues
should o'brien have to turn his back permanently on the flat , moore , the three - time british champion , would be favourite to take more rides for his father âs stable
