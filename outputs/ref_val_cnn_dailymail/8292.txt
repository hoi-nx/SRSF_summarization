pharmacists will be drafted into gp practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors , under plans to be unveiled today
the proposals could see pharmacists stationed in surgeries to help meet the day - to - day needs of patients with long - term conditions , including diabetes and asthma
instead of seeing a gp , those patients could be given an appointment with a pharmacist
they would also liaise with hospitals , community pharmacists and care homes to ensure patients received seamless care
experts said the move would cut the time patients have to wait for appointments , while also addressing the chronic shortage of gps at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists
pharmacists are to be drafted into gp practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors in the nhs , under new plans many gp surgeries already work closely with pharmacists , and the proposals would see them working as part of the general team , in a similar way to practice nurses , the rcgp ( rcgp ) said
she said : ' waiting times for a gp appointment are now a national talking point - and a national cause for concern , not least amongst gps themselves
' practice - based pharmacists , working as part of the clinical team , would relieve the pressure on gps and make a huge difference to patient care
' gp surgeries are predicted to make 370 million patient consultations this year - 70 million more than five years ago
an ageing population and an increase in those patients needing treatment for long - term and complex conditions , including diabetes and heart disease , is , in part , the cause of the mounting pressure
as such , the rcgp , which is being backed by the royal pharmaceutical society , has argued they are ideally placed to treat patients directly within gp practices
experts said the move would cut the times patients have to wait for appointments , while also addressing the chronic shortage of gps at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists ' having a pharmacist as part of the team can make a huge difference to both patients and clinical colleagues
