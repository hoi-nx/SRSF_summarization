the mother of a man who stands accused of murdering 12 people in a movie theater gun rampage has begged prosecutors to stop pursuing the death penalty , terming their legal case a ' quest for death '
holmes , whose son james , 27 , opened fire at a busy screening of batman film the dark knight rises in aurora , colorado , also insists that she and her husband robert ' were good parents '
the holmes family claim that mental illness is to blame for the murder spree , which left 70 injured as well as the 12 fatalities
mrs holmes begged the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty in an entry in her prayer book , which she published earlier this month and is selling for $ 15

' mrs holmes also defended herself and her husband from charges that they contributed to the massacre
she said : ' because so many people like to blame the parents if a child is mentally ill , we have to reaffirm to ourselves every day that we were good parents and good people , and this still happened anyway
