englishman 's fisher faces a completely different challenge as he looks to successfully defend a european tour title for the first time in his career in this week 's tshwane open
fisher ended a four - year victory drought with his win 12 months ago at the els club at copperleaf , which , at 7,964 yards , was the longest course in european tour history
this year the tournament , which is the sixth and final event co-sanctioned with the sunshine tour this season , has been switched to pretoria country club , which measures 7,063 yards and has had the par - five fourth and 18th holes reduced to par fours , making it a par 70
fisher says it will be tough for him at the tshwane open this year but that he is looking forward to it the englishman plays a shot during a practice round at the pretoria country club fisher poses with the trophy last year ' it 's a lot shorter and a lot more fiddly , ' said fisher of the course , which was redesigned in 2004 by gary player , who calls it a ' hidden gem '
' i 'm looking forward to the challenge and hopefully the game can live up to that
