miliband has vowed to adopt a â turing âs law â to allow the pardoning of tens of thousands of men convicted of gay sex when it was illegal
turing , the ww2 codebreaker , was convicted of homosexual activity in 1952 but given a posthumous royal pardon 15 months ago
since then his relatives have campaigned for the 49,000 men convicted under gross indecency laws to be similarly pardoned
mr miliband has said he will extend this to the families and friends of gay men who received convictions in their lifetime but died before they could apply to have the records changed
the campaign to parden gay men convicted of ' gross indecency ' has been backed by celebrities including hollywood star benedict cumberbatch , who played mr turing in the oscar - winning drama the imitation game he said : â i think it âs worth saying that we do want to extend the principles being applied to turing and his family , to be able to say to others who were convicted of a criminal offence simply because of the person that they loved â whether they are alive or no longer alive â that we can get a pardon for them
i think it âs right what âs been done in relation to turing and his family , but there are also other families that will have had relatives who were convicted , as i say , simply because of the person they love
â turing died after eating an apple laced with cyanide on 8 june 1954 , turing 's cleaner found him dead
several scholars , and even his family , have suggested turing 's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy
some more peculiar theories suggest turing was ' obsessed ' with fairytale snow white and the seven dwarfs and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story
last week relatives of the mathematician and codebreaker delivered a petition to downing street calling for all those convicted under anti-gay laws to be pardoned
celebrities including benedict cumberbatch , who played turing in the oscar - winning film the imitation game , have also backed the campaign
during the ww2 , turing was pivotal in cracking the german enigma codes , which gave vital information about hitler âs forces
in 2013 turing was granted a royal pardon after a request from justice secretary chris grayling
benedict cumberbatch said : â turing was not only prosecuted , but quite arguably persuaded to end his own life early , by a society who called him a criminal for simply seeking out the love he deserved , as all human beings do
