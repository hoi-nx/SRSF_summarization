within weeks of samsung releasing its waterproof galaxy s5 last year , apple filed a patent that took its rival âs technology a step further
called â methods for shielding electronic components from moisture â , the filing awarded today describes a way of making the inside of a phone waterproof rather than the outside
individual components would be covered in a thin film designed to stop liquids damaging the phone , even if it manages to penetrate the outer casing
the patent said protective cases have â little value â once water has entered the phone and details a system of adding â hydrophobic coating to components â
this coating would be applied using plasma - assisted chemical vapour deposition in which thin films are applied from a gas , or vapour , states to a solid state samsung âs galaxy s5 is ip67 rated thanks to a hydrophobic coating and cover that clips into place to protect the handset
apple âs patent would instead involve coating individual components inside a phone , and within an already assembled circuit board
this coating would be applied using a method called plasma - assisted chemical vapour deposition ( pacvd ) , which desposits thin films from gas , or vapour , states to solid states
in the case of the fully - assembled circuit board and its electromagnetic interference ( emi ) shields , apple proposes perforating â portions of the shields that overlay water sensitive electronics
samsung âs galaxy s5 ( pictured ) is ip67 rated thanks to a hydrophobic coating and cover that clips into place to protect the handset
as a result , the galaxy s5 can be submerged for up to 30 minutes at 3ft ( 0.9 metres ) in the case of the fully - assembled circuit boards and electromagnetic interference ( emi ) shields , apple proposes perforating â portions of the shields that overlay water sensitive electronics
â the coating would be applied through these perforations , and the board - to - board connectors would be covered by a silicone seal â many electronic devices are susceptible to water damage because they are not fully sealed and include various openings for charging , connecting peripherals , and inputting and outputting audio
despite adding waterproof features to its galaxy s5 , samsung removed this for its latest galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge handsets unviled at mobile world congress on sunday ( right )
