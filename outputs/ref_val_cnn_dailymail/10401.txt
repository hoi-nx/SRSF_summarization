a 19 - year - old man has been indicted on murder and other charges in the shooting death of a las vegas mother of four in a neighborhood gunbattle
the indictment filed friday accuses defendant nowsch of murder , attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle
her husband , meyers , says she took their daughter home after a late - night driving lesson and fetched her 22 - year - old son with his gun to find a driver who frightened her earlier
the 19 - year - old 's defense team hope the request to the coroner 's office will be able to determine whether meyers , 44 , or somebody next to her fired a gun before she died police say the son fired several shots at nowsch during the fatal shootout in a cul - de - sac outside the meyers home
nowsch 's defense team said in court today they are trying to obtain surveillance video from johnson junior high school , where meyers was allegedly teaching her daughter to parallel park the night before the shooting
following nowsch 's arrest late last month , his lawyers said he was high on marijuana while he was being questioned , and police knew it
claus said he plans to argue in court that anything nowsch told investigators after he was taken into custody can no longer be used in the impending murder trial
nowsch has been accused of shooting 44 - year - old tammy meyers dead during an act of road rage
it has since been revealed that the meyers family knew the suspect the meyers family initially claimed that meyers had gotten into an argument with nowsch while giving her daughter a driving lesson on the night of the february 12 shooting
last month , it was revealed that the meyers family actually knew nowsch .
