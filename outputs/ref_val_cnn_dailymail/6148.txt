i just concluded i was not the best person to carry forward the gop torch , ' romney told her romney would n't endorse one of the many possible gop presidential candidates in his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster but spoke sharply of democratic front - runner hillary clinton former florida gov. jeb bush , wisconsin gov. scott walker , florida sen. marco rubio and kentucky sen. rand paul would all make tremendous presidents , he indicated
jeb bush , who was widely considered romney 's biggest hurdle toward securing the gop presidential nomination for a second consecutive time due to their similarity in background and policy positions , romney described as a ' sound , effective governor
' romney also voiced approval of a possible marco rubio candidacy , saying the freshman senator ' has really distinguished himself ' on foreign policy
and while he and rand paul , whose father ron competed against the massachusetts governor for the party 's blessing in both 2008 and 2012 , do n't often see eye to eye , particularly on foreign policy issues , romney said he understands the draw to the non-traditional gop lawmaker
' clinton , on the other hand , is in quite ' a mess ' over her secret server and will have to defend what he called ' the hillary clinton / barack obama foreign policy
' ' i mean , it âs always something with the clintons , ' he said , responding to a question about the former secretary of state 's email debacle
' they have rules which they describe before they get into something , and then they decide they do nât have to follow their own rules
he added , ' she did nât follow the rules and regulations of the federal government

' reacting to former barack obama senior adviser axelrod 's claims in his memoir that romney suggested in his election night , congratulatory call to the president that he won reelection because blacks in urban cities voted for him , romney said a ' misunderstanding ' must have occurred
