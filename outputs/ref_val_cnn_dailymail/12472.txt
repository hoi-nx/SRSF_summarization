" but if i find he has the disease , do i have to report him to the faa ? and if so , should i call him first and tell him that ? would he lose his job ? " she was totally unsure what to do
the case raised several specific quandaries about what the responsibilities of medical professionals are and should be -- legally or ethically -- in evaluating pilots
the faa requires that pilots self - report any diagnoses
they may know that a pilot has a medical problem that is poorly or not treated and may endanger passengers , but these providers have no obligation to do anything about it
the germanwings disaster has demonstrated that current standards of medical and psychiatric evaluation are inadequate
the faa requires only that pilots fill out a psychological questionnaire , asking whether they have had psychological symptoms
but pilots are not assessed in person by a psychiatrist
such face - to - face assessments can provide crucial information that self - report forms might miss , partly because pilots might answer inaccurately
moreover , the faa requires only that 25 % of pilots have a single random drug screen per year
pilots may pass drug tests in january and realize that the odds of undergoing subsequent tests that year are nil
the faa should consider requiring far more drug testing -- for all pilots , perhaps every few days
other possible reforms pose difficult ethical dilemmas , and thus need broad , careful discussion -- e.g. , what role providers should play and how much privacy pilots should have
medical exams and records over time can indicate key problems that a single visit to an faa doctor may miss. but requiring more information from pilots diminishes their rights to privacy
critical dilemmas arise , though , of what threshold should be used concerning which diagnoses and how much their successful treatment should matter
early in the hiv epidemic , for instance , some critics argued that hiv - infected pilots should be barred from flying , since the virus could cause neurological problems
fortunately , the faa decided that evidence of actual neurological deficits -- not infection alone -- should ground these employees
physicians arguably should consider reporting pilots who have , for instance , epilepsy , manic - depression or diabetes that leads to coma if these conditions are not well controlled with medications
yet stigma can make pilots fear job loss and thus hide diagnoses and not seek treatment
the faa could require that pilots seek treatment in order to fly , but some pilots may still simply cover up problems
ideally , the clinician should be able to talk with the pilot about the need not to fly and arrange a leave for a few months to improve treatment
in addition , we need research to find how much physician reporting would reduce risks or lead pilots to camouflage problems
careful , transparent discussion , involving medical experts , pilots , policymakers and others , to establish policies with clearly established cutoffs are thus vital
