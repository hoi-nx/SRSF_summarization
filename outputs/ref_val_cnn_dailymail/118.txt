dustin ellermann wraps the suppressor of his m16 rifle in bacon ( left ) before securely covering it in tin foil ( right ) this time smoke billows from the tip of it and the sizzling of the bacon cooking can be heard even more clearly
the competitive shooter fires one last time and the vibrations caused by the bullets leaving the gun cause the tin foil to fly from the suppressor
dustin ellermann fires around 90 rounds with the intention to heat the suppressor so much that it will cook the bacon the competitive shooter laughs at the camera as the bacon wrapped around his gun 's suppressor begins to sizzle once there , dustin ellermann uses a pair of tongs to remove the bacon and utters in excitement as it unravels looking , if anything , slightly overdone
