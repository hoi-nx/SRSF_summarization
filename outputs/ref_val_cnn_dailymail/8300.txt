toy giant lego has come under fire from parents after publishing an article in its own - brand magazine which offered a range of ' insulting ' beauty tips to young girls
the march / april edition of the lego club magazine included a feature called ' emma 's beauty tips ' , which suggested that young girls who are ' ready to change up their looks ' should consider opting for a more flattering haircut that would better suit their face shape
' you , yes you , are beautiful , but if you 're ready to change up your look , read on for some tips and tricks on how to get the best haircut for the shape of your face , ' the article reads
outrage : this ' beauty tips ' feature in the march / april edition of the lego club magazine has caused fury among parents the feature then lists five different face shapes , from ' heart faces ' to ' oval faces ' , suggesting which type of hair cut would be bested suited to each shape
unsurprisingly , the article has hit a nerve with parents of the young girls reading the magazine - with one mother , cleveland - based writer holbrook , writing a piece for the new york times slamming the magazine 's ' insulting ' feature
' my little girl , the shape of her face , and whether her haircut is flattering are none of lego âs concern , ' it was nât even her concern until a toy magazine told her to start worrying about it
unnecessary : the ' overtly girly ' lego friends line , including this heartlake hair salon , has previously come under fire from parents for suggesting that young girls should not be playing with traditional lego models calling for change : writer holbrook ( pictured ) wrote a piece about the lego feature in which she insisted that children as young as five should not be worrying about whether they have a flattering face shape the online article has prompted a flurry of furious activity on social media , with parents across the country calling for lego to abandon its ' sexist ' marketing campaigns and ' overtly girly ' toy ranges in favor of returning to the ' powerful messages ' it once offered to young girls who were so eager to play with their products
' go back to this [ message ] of 1981 instead of " beauty tips for 5 - 12 year - olds " c * * p , ' one person wrote on twitter , alongside a picture of a 30 - year - old lego ad campaign which encouraged young girls to ' build for fun '
' why ca nât girls and boys both play with traditional lego ? when i was little , lego used to even market them to all children , magnificently so ... ' go back : parents are calling for lego to return to the positive messages it once sent out to young girls , such as the one in this ad campaign from 1981 fury : many parents have taken to social media to express their outrage and disappointment at the overtly ' sexist ' lego friends line in a statement provided to mashable , lego spokesman mcnally insisted that the copmany was taking onboard all of the feedback offered by ' readers ' , adding that the brand ' sincerely regrets ' any offense caused by the feature
shortly after the range debuted in 2011 , many people spoke out to express concern about its seemingly sexist suggestion that young girls needed their own line of feminine toys , rather than being able to play with the traditional building blocks also used by boys
