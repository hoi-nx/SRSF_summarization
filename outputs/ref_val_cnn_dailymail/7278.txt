an aspiring transgender hip - hop artist who bragged of carrying out black - market ' body sculpting ' on thousands of women has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed a british dancer
windslowe 's testimony during her philadelphia trial included claims she was ' the michelangelo of buttocks injections ' and model amber rose was ' a walking billboard ' for her work
today , she was found guilty of third - degree murder after one of her ' patients ' , claudia aderotimi , 20 , a london break - dancer and college student , died from an illegal silicone injection in her buttocks
it was later revealed the silicone in her buttocks had moved to her lungs and stopped her heart
during her murder trial , windslowe said of her ' body sculpting ' : ' i was the best , and i do n't mean that to be cocky , ' explaining why celebrities would have sought her out over a licensed plastic surgeon
she has been in prison since 2012 after an 18 - month inquiry led to a homicide ruling and an arrest warrant
they were choosing between third - degree murder - not premeditated but involves malice - and involuntary manslaughter , involving reckless disregard for a person 's life
