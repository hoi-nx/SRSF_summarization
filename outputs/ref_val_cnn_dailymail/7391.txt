updated guidance published yesterday insists that calls last for at least 30 minutes if they are offering personal care such as washing or dressing
the advice , published by nhs spending watchdog nice , said 15 - minute drop - ins should only be considered in certain cases such as checking if someone has taken their medication
better care : health watchdog nice has published new guidelines in bid to stop ' drive - by ' visits of carers ( stock photo ) in a sign of how bad things have become , guidelines have to spell out the care offered to the elderly â telling home helps to leave enough time to â talk to the person â
the move marks a victory for the daily mail , which has highlighted care visits lasting as little as five minutes as part of our dignity for the elderly campaign
last month a daily mail investigation revealed that 70 per cent of councils are still allocating visits of just 15 minutes â with six authorities offering 200,000 slots of just five minutes
however , the local government association , which represents councils , said money was just too short to end 15 - minute care visits once and for all
