babies conceived through ivf may be twice as likely to develop autism , according to new research
children conceived using assisted reproductive technology were more likely to develop autism than babies conceived naturally
assisted reproductive technology ( art ) includes any type of fertility treatment where the egg and the sperm are handled outside of the body , including ivf , artificial insemination and surrogacy
during ivf - the most popular art treatment - more than one egg is harvested and fertilised , which can lead to multiple births
babies conceived through ivf ( pictured ) are more likely to develop autism than those conceived naturally , a study found
but this could be due to the complications of ivf , such as multiple births researchers explained they found an association between ivf and autism - but they did not prove that the treatment cause the disorder , according to healthday news
the higher risk of the disorder could be explained by factors such as multiple births and other risks associated with ivf , not the treatment itself , they said
after taking into account factors such as the mother 's education and multiple births , researchers found the increased risk was only seen for mothers under 35 years old
and they found there was no extra risk of autism for women who gave birth to one child
this means ivf using a single - egg transfer rather than multiple eggs lowers the chance of a baby developing autism , experts said
he added : ' there is an association between ivf and autism , but when we control for the characteristics of women who are more likely to use ivf , for example , age and social status , this association is lessened significantly , ' the remaining increased risk is due to factors such as multiple births and complications of pregnancy and delivery associated with ivf , he said
