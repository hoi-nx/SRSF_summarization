for one final time , the greatest ever jump jockey will grace his sport âs most spectacular and exciting stage
ap. nineteen - time champion jump jockey and the most recognisable initials in sport
the 2015 cheltenham festival boasts a glittering cast of equine and human stars but the spotlight is on one man
walsh ( right ) will ride willie mullins - trained faugheen in the champions hurdle at cheltenham festival the one who will finally walk away from the sport by the end of this season after announcing his abdication following an unchallenged 20 - year reign
but both sides of that age - old skirmish will probably be praying that the 40 - year - old from county antrim has a final festival to remember
the next four days for ap mccoy are not the last time he will ride
it will probably not even be the last time he rides at cheltenham festival
ap mccoy celebrates winning the gold cup with synchronised in 2012 but it seems like the equivalent of roger federer âs last game on wimbledon âs centre court , ronnie oâsullivan playing his final frame at the crucible and â should liverpool make it through â steven gerrard stepping on to the wembley turf in an fa cup final
but none of those icons can boast the domination of their own sport like ap mccoy has ruled racing
he is arguably the best pound - for - pound sportsman around â something crucial in a sport where weights and measures equate to short - head victories or defeats
champion jockey ap mccoy will be competing his his last cheltenham festival before retirement there was a seventh place finish on veteran beech road behind master oats in the gold cup and his best was sixth place on brave tornado in the triumph hurdle
that first experience of the cheltenham festival probably taught the young ap mccoy that cheltenham festival is great when you are successful but miserable when it goes wrong
it is a feeling i know well and ap mccoy probably enjoyed that nottingham winner far more than merely being able to play a bit part at the cheltenham festival
jump jockey ap mccoy has always been a fans ' favourite at cheltenham festival as he has got older , he has become better equipped to cope with the cheltenham festival roller - coaster of emotions
there will be plenty who point to the tally of 41 cheltenham festival wins for walsh â a total fuelled by his alliance with irish powerhouse trainer willie mullins and his former tie - up with british champion trainer paul nicholls â and ask what the ap mccoy fuss is all about ? who is the better jockey ? who has the best technique ? these are subjective assessments which will never be finally settled
over the next four days , the chances are walsh will ride more winners than ap mccoy , who is 10 - 1 to be top jockey at the meeting
