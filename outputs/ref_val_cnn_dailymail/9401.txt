a review of the six stations by the trust has raised concerns that they are failing ethnic minority audiences
â popular : clara amfo presents the radio 1 chart show which attracts 23 % of black , asian and minority ethnic people aged 15 to 24 bame stands for black , asian and minority ethnic
it pointed to statistics that show only 34 percent of bame adults tune in to one of the six music radio stations - radio 1 , 1xtra , bbc radio 2 , radio 3 , 6 music and asian network â each week
it is a problem also faced by bbc television , with the latest figures revealing it reached 74 percent of bame adults each week , compared with 86 percent of all adults
radio 2 has a target audience of the over 35s but even in among this group , it failed to attract ethnic minority listeners
â in the trust âs previous review of music radio , radio 1 was flagged up as of particular concern , reaching only 17 percent of bame people aged between 15 and 24
struggling : bbc radio 2 , which has presenters chris evans ( left ) and jeremy vine ( right ) , was highlighted as having particular difficulties in attracting non-white listeners by its own watchdog this time , the youth - oriented station has been praised for its progress , with the figure rising to 23 percent
this is not the first time in recent months that the bbc has been accused of failing ethnic minority au - diences
' whilst listening to our music radio stations amongst bame audiences has grown in recent years , we will continue work hard to make sure our stations represent and reach all audiences
