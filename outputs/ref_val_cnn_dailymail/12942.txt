its famous yellow wall -- the largest free - standing grandstand in europe , with a capacity of 25,000 -- has helped enable german football club dortmund achieve the rare feat of transcending the relationship between a club and its fans
so special is this club that 3,000 of its own supporters dipped into their pockets as part of a crowdfunding exercise , started in 2013 , to help finance a new documentary based on one of dortmund 's founding fathers
these dortmund fans , along with sponsors , raised â¬ 250,000 ( $ 265,000 ) in the process -- the biggest sum at the time ever raised for a film through crowdfunding in german
one of those fathers , and seen as the most important , was jacobi , who in 1909 along with 17 others helped found the club -- and it is " am borsigplatz geboren : jacobi und die wiege des dortmund " ( " born at the borsigsquare : jacobi and the cradle of dortmund " ) that tells his story
for it was those brave 18 that gathered inside a pub called wildschutz just off dortmund 's borsigplatz , with the aim of establishing their own football club in response to the catholic holy trinity chaplain dewald 's refusal to allow his youth group members the chance to kick a ball around
" a legacy jacobi 's dna today still runs through the club that he helped to establish
dortmund president from 1910 to 1923 , jacobi laid the foundations of a club which prides itself on harboring a real sense of involvement and belonging for its supporters
heinrich unger , dortmund 's maiden president and jacobi 's best friend , was one of those fighting , and he would go on to write what turned out to be the club 's first ever song during his time in the trenches -- part of that song is still included in one of dortmund 's official anthems , " wir halten fest und treu zusammen " ( " we are standing together " )
" the borussia family jacobi 's " borussia family " is not a term used officially by the club and its supporters now , but its meaning continues to resonate
with dortmund dangerously close to bankruptcy just a decade ago , fans came together to do all they could for their club , while as well as donating to fund the new film , supporters also contributed old photographs to help shed light on jacobi 's story
" we 've had so many more new members in recent years and it 's great to bring them our history because what is the future without the past ? " the film remembers many , many people , where we came from , which way we 've grown up -- it made me proud to be a part of it and it shows fans and supporters stand behind the club
all the money raised from the film will go into social projects in dortmund -- historically an industrial and working - class area -- where the club was founded
" today 's fan engagement has partly come about from all those years ago with jacobi , but also because dortmund is located in a city that is very emotional when it comes to football , " quambusch says
" espn fc german correspondent and dortmund fan stephan uersfeld adds : " the core of the fans are very close still and the club as well is close to the fans
" ' struggle to survive ' boasting the highest average attendance in the world , as well as the yellow wall , there are not many more awe - inspiring sights in football than the westfalenstadion when dortmund fans are in full voice
in an age when one bad performance from the likes of barcelona or real madrid can bring with it a chorus of boos from its supporters , dortmund fans have stood by their team for the most part this season , despite relegation from the bundesliga having threatened a club that was german champion in 2012
" pride that sentiment most likely applied to jacobi himself , whose body today lies buried in dortmund following the club 's decision to move it into the area after originally being located 300 kilometers away in salzgitter
