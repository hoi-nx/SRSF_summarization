ant smith says telling the truth about the size of his manhood was ' liberating ' new statistics reveal that the average sized penis is only 5.16 inches , smaller than originally thought , but what 's it like if you do n't measure up to the norm ? one man with a with a small member recently blogged about the perils of having a tiny todger - and his post went viral
here , writer ant smith , a 47 - year - old engineering manager from london , explains why he decided to share his vital statistics and explains what it 's like to be a few inches short
' last year i wrote a poem and blog post about penis size anxiety
' i 'm 48 now , and i 've been struggling with this anxiety for decades , even though i 'm very happily married
' men have a great capacity for emotional deniability
' it was a drunken evening talking to a new , but good friend , when somehow or other the question of size came up and i admitted i had such worries
a comrade in arms i thought , as we sheepishly swapped statistics - he went first and admitted to only possessing 6 "
this is when i realised how pervasive , and pointless , size anxiety is
' so i published the blog in the hope that if more smaller guys were open and honest we could establish a more realistic view of what average is - rather than only ever seeing the behemoths that porn and advertising presents to us
ant smith says men should be more open and honest to establish a more realistic view of what average is ' for the next few months i performed the poem at various venues around london
there was always at least one warm handshake afterwards from a guy who seemed particularly glad that i 'd openly discussed the question of size , from my perspective
suddenly everyone was talking about my small , but perfectly functioning , willy ! ' and i was personally responding to thousands of men ( by twitter and e-mail )
i felt tremendously proud to have achieved this through poetry , to be able to make poetry relevant in the mainstream
' with the promise of being able to make something enduring i was able to garner the support to organise small penis party
ant smith says he first experienced penis size anxiety while getting changed for sports at school ' first i remembered a time , age 13 , in the school changing room putting my shorts on while i was still wearing my long winter coat
i did n't even know what penis size anxiety was then , or why i was doing that , but i did
' i do believe , in some small way , small penis party has made the world a little better place
