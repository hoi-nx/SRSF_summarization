england went olomouc on monday to familiarise themselves with the place they will call home and under - 21 head coach gareth southgate was thrilled with how the experiment went
he was even happier , then , after carroll âs goal in prague chiselled out victory for a much - changed side
having flattened inferior opponents in qualifying for euro 2015 , gareth southgate was keen to see how his squad will fare against better nations and so far , it has gone how he wanted
carroll celebrates his goal during the international match between czech republic u21 and england u21 though this performance against the host nation was not the flashiest but it had showed qualities that england will need if they are to go all the way
â i thought we did some very good things , â gareth southgate noted
â there were four debutants in this experimental line - up , most notably arsenal defender calum chambers , and for periods in the first half england lacked the cohesion of a team that has played regularly together
nobody embodied the spirit more than carroll â whom gareth southgate called a ' super footballer ' â who was well placed in the 29th minute to kick a header from watford striker matej vydra off the line
gareth southgate anticipated this being a game when england would have a lot of the ball and be on the front foot but the opposite was true ; the physically strong czechs kept pushing england further and further back and the visitors â passing was not sharp as it can be at their most fluent
it was clear from looking at gareth southgate âs demeanour he was not happy with what he was seeing

chambers surged forward and zipped in a cross that tomas kalas â the chelsea defender on loan at middlesbrough â failed to clear and carroll took advantage , sweeping in from eight yards
here was another indication of his tenacity : he took a heavy blow to the ankle when scoring his first international goal since august 2013 and hobbled away as his team - mates raced over to him ; the swansea midfielder managed just another five minutes before his night ended
â we think he will be ok for monday , â said gareth southgate
â gareth southgate described england 's win as ' real football ' following their narrow victory on friday night
