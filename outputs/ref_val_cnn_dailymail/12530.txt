hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in cities across brazil this weekend , incensed by serious economic woes and a massive scandal involving the country 's oil company
the demonstrators have called for president rousseff to be impeached
cnn correspondent shasta darlington , who lives in sao paulo , explains who the demonstrators are , why they 're mad and what could be in store for the president and the country
what do the protesters want ? they 're angry about the country 's economy being in shambles at a time when political corruption at the highest levels of government is alleged
if it were just one of those things , maybe we would n't be seeing this kind of turnout because brazil have lived with corruption for decades and the economy was not doing well before the presidential election in october
but it 's all come to a head
political corruption -- let 's break that down
what 's the scandal about ? petrobras is the national oil company
it 's one of the most powerful , richest companies in the country -- and has been counted among the largest in the world
she was chairwoman during much of the time that former oil company executives have told investigators that bribes were paid to petrabras executives and politicians in order to secure contracts from petrobras
protesters ' call for impeachment -- the formal process of accusing , because she 's not been accused of anything -- looks very unlikely
as proof , she contends , she 's given her attorney general free rein to investigate who is stealing from the state oil company
it 's important to know that the petrobras scandal has been known publicly for at least a year and during rousseff 's election campaign , she said over and over that she would root out corruption
it 's also interesting that she is n't lashing out at protesters
it had been slowing down , and traditionally the wealthier parts of the country like sao paulo have n't voted for rousseff 's party , the workers ' party
