the icc has described the remarks of its own president mustafa kamal as ' very unfortunate ' , and insists its umpires ' ' integrity can not be questioned '
mustafa kamal put himself at the centre of a row over umpiring decisions which went the way of india in their world cup quarter - final victory over bangladesh in melbourne on thursday
india opener rohit sharma was reprieved as he neared his century when a no - ball was called because of the height of the delivery ; then bangladesh batsman mahmudullah had to go when a marginal call came down in favour of boundary fielder shikhar dhawan , whose foot was ruled to be just clear of the rope when he took a catch at fine - leg
shikhar dhawan 's catch of bangladesh 's batsman mahmudullah during their quarter final proved controversial bangladeshi politician mustafa kamal 's icc role is largely ceremonial since cricket 's world governing body updated its constitution a year ago
he has nonetheless threatened to resign over the decisions taken by umpires aleem dar and ian gould in the match which finished in a 109 - run win for india
mustafa kamal implied the result was a foregone conclusion , and that world cricket is being run for the benefit of its superpower india
