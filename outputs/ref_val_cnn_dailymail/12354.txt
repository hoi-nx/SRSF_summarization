manila forty years ago , one of the greatest boxing matches in history took place in an unlikely setting : the capital of the philippines
" four decades later , and a crowd is gathered at the same venue in this sweating , sprawling city -- known as the araneta coliseum -- for a very different contest : a basketball game between two of the country 's pro teams
the most famous athlete on court today just happens to be a boxer
pacquiao is the coach , as well as one of the shortest players on the roster at just five foot , six inches ( 168cm ) tall , of team kia carnival
but the philippines is best known around the world as one of the greatest boxers of his generation , the first fighter to win championship belts in eight different weight divisions
but despite his on - court distraction , he 's not finished in the ring
on may 2 , he will finally go toe to toe with u.s. welterweight boxing champion mayweather in vegas -- the fight most boxing fans have wanted to see for years
in the locker room , pacquiao , who only played for a few unremarkable minutes in the second quarter , gives a short half - time speech to fire up his players
he speaks mostly in tagalog , the main language of the philippines , peppering his locker room speech with english expressions like " offense " and " man - to - man defense
" seemingly inspired , the team charges back on court shortly after
surprisingly , pacquiao says he gets more nervous on the basketball court than when he faces a barrage of punches in the ring
" i believe in my heart that my second sport is basketball , " he says later , explaining that it is a vital part of his cross-training for boxing
but he adds that he 's choosing to spend fewer minutes playing in professional basketball games these days to avoid injuries ahead of the mayweather showdown
" i can say [ this will be ] one of the most important fights in my career , " pacquiao says , during an exclusive interview with cnn
we speak at his cavernous home in a wealthy , gated community in manila
he is dressed in shorts , flip - flops and a red nike t - shirt with his photo on it accompanied by the slogan " spirit
the mayweather fight " has been five years in the making , " he says
" in fact , if it was n't for a chance encounter at another basketball game , the mayweather and pacquiao camps may never have agreed to a fight
in doing so , the 36 year old says he 's fulfilling the wishes of the two eldest of his five children
" three years ago [ they said ] ' daddy , i want you to fight mayweather
i want you to fight mayweather
the pacman is believed to be earning around $ 80 million for the fight , while mayweather -- who is undefeated -- is expected to earn 20 % more
" the philippines ' most famous son has come a long way from a childhood mired in poverty and hunger
" he is a receptacle of hope , " says trinidad , a veteran columnist at the philippines daily inquirer
when pacquiao travels through the perpetually grid - locked traffic of manila , he moves in a black armored escalade with the license plate " 8 " on the front
" cameras from more than a dozen philippines television crews click and whir as pacquiao spars in the ring for an hour with fernandez , the stocky trainer who winces when he occasionally takes hits to his round belly
this will begin in the next few days when team pacquiao flies to los angeles to work with roach , the u.s. coach who helped the philippines achieve global stardom over the last decade
as for pacquiao , he has at least one more professional basketball game to coach in manila before he flies to the u.s. since his rise to superstardom , pacquiao 's activities and interests have multiplied
in addition to basketball and scuba diving off the beaches of mindanao , he has dabbled in singing , acting and politics
pacquiao proudly points to legislation he says he helped pass aimed at curbing the scourge of human trafficking in the philippines
but the journalist fears pacquiao may not be able to break through mayweather 's much - vaunted defense
he can not rely on what we call an explosive , kamikaze style , " trinidad tells cnn
the boxer stalks the sidelines , watching closely , exchanging high - fives when his players come on and off the court
when the final horn sounds , pacquiao 's underdogs have beaten their better - ranked opponents -- an upset unlikely to be lost on him as he plots his own success against a more fancied opponent in the ring .
