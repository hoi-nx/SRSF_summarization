israeli prime minister netanyahu 's speech to congress on tuesday threatens to undermine the nearly 67 - year tradition of bipartisan support that has endured since president harry truman became the first head of state to recognize israeli
yet netanyahu 's speech , while possibly giving him a short - term boost at home , will harm jerusalem 's relations with washington , not iranian 's nuclear program
speaker boehner 's late - january invitation to netanyahu to address a joint session of congress was coordinated with neither the white house nor the state department
in defiance of the obama administration , and rejecting advice from leading figures in israeli and key supporters of israeli in the u.s. , netanyahu accepted the invitation
by antagonizing the white house , boehner and netanyahu have put democratic party members of congress in a bind , forcing them to choose between two unenviable options : either attend the speech out of respect for a close ally , but in so doing flout the president -- their party leader -- or demonstrate loyalty to obama by snubbing the leader of a major u.s. ally
two senior democrats with sterling pro-israel credentials , richard durbin and feinstein , tried to diffuse this latest crisis between washington and jerusalem by offering to meet with the israeli premier behind closed doors but were rebuffed by netanyahu
yet netanyahu 's move is counterproductive
in a rare move , five former israeli ambassadors have publicly called on netanyahu to cancel his speech
netanyahu 's foray into partisan politics is hardly a new phenomenon
that july , netanyahu 's senior adviser , ron dermer , helped orchestrate romney 's visit to israeli in what amounted to an implicit endorsement of obama 's rival
dermer , a former u.s. citizen who once worked for republican pollster and political consultant frank luntz , is israeli 's current ambassador to the u.s.
national security adviser susan rice did not mince words when she called netanyahu 's latest move " destructive to the fabric of the relationship " between the u.s. and israeli
although the u.s. - israeli relationship is strong and resilient , rooted in common values and shared interests , netanyahu is subjecting it to an unnecessary test with unknown consequences by choosing to play partisan politics .
