adelaide man gautam is the brains behind the new venture that started off as a laugh on facebook , but has since become a huge fashion sensation
adelaide 's gautam wants single thongs to find the perfect partner facebook page is trying to get the right match for thongs who are now on their own thanks to mr gautam all you have to do is upload a photograph or write a description of the required thong onto his facebook page and wait for a match
i did n't want to throw them out as they were in too good a nick , ' mr gautam told daily mail australia
' so i went on my facebook page and asked if anyone had any thongs that could match up with any of them
these single thongs were washed up on an adelaide river bank
facebook is hoping to stop this and make a difference environmentally ' one of my mates got back to me with one which was the right size
i told my mates about this and they got on facebook asking me if i could find them one
' he set up the facebook page 11 weeks ago and now has more than 1,100 followers
what started out as a bit of fun suddenly exploded into life and it soon became clear that the facebook page was n't the right platform for the endeavour
it soon became clear that there was a market for people looking for replacement thongs ' for this reason i have some it people in melbourne working on a dedicated website that will make it really easy to look for a thong , ' he said
mr gautam believes that even wearing odd thongs is better than having just the one
