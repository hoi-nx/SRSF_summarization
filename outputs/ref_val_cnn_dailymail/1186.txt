india on wednesday joined countries like iran , saudi arabia , china and pakistan to support a proposal moved by russia denying staff benefits to gay couples at the un
the move was defeated as 80 votes were polled against it while 43 countries , including india , backed it
speaking against the proposal , us ambassador to the un samantha power said : â we must speak plainly about what russia tried to do today â¦ diminish the authority of the un secretary general and export to the un its domestic hostility to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) rights
( file picture ) india went with the russia proposal as it was based on its domestic laws on same sex relations
but last year , secretary general ban ki-moon had moved a proposal to extend the benefit to all gay couples irrespective of their domestic laws
this is also perhaps the reason for india to back the russia proposal
