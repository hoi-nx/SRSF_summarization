the gulf stream , the ocean current that brings mild weather to northern europe and balmy conditions to the south east of the us , is slowing at its fastest rate in 1,000 years
new research has revealed that the enormous currents that circulate warm and cold water around the north atlantic ocean has slowed by 15 - 20 per cent over the past century
scientists say that the increasing flow of fresh water from melting greenland ice sheets may be driving the slowdown
the graphic above shows the sea in the north atlantic ocean is cooler than the surrounding ocean due to the influx of fresh water from the melting of the greenland ice sheet , which has slowed the gulf stream , say scientists professor stefan rahmstorf , an oceans physicist at the potsdam insittute for climate impact research , said : ' it is conspicuous that one specific area in the north atlantic ocean has been cooling in the past hundred years while the rest of the world heats up
the findings suggest that as global temperatures rise due to climate change , areas that are warmed by the gulf stream could see temperatures fall , particularly in the winter
in the arctic , cold salty water sinks to the ocean depths , driving deep sea currents down to the equator where warmer water then rises to the surface and feeds the gulf stream
it makes winter conditions in much of northern europe far milder than they normally would be , keeping britain and the west coast of norway largely snow and ice free through the winter months
the researchers , whose study is published in the journal nature climate change , found that the sea in the northern north atlantic ocean is colder than predicted by computer models
they estimate that 8,000 cubic kilometres of fresh melt water haver flowed into the northern north atlantic ocean from greenland 's icesheets between 1900 and 1970
the north atlantic ocean meridional overturning circulation is the northwards flow of warm surface water ( shown in red by in the graphic above ) and the southwards flow of cold water in the deep ocean ( shown in blue ) they say between 1970 and 2000 an additional 13,000 cubic kilometres of fresh water has poured into the north atlantic ocean from greenland
using recent sea surface and atmospheric temperature data , along with data from ice - cores , tree rings and sediments , they found that the changes in the ocean currents are unprecedented since the year 900ad
however , the researchers also found that the cooling above the north atlantic ocean may also help to slightly reduce the effect of warming on the continents due to climate change
the melting of greenland 's ice sheets ( above ) is leading to an influx of freshwater into the north atlantic ocean they warn , however , that if the circulation weakens too much it could even break down completely
' professor jason box , from the geological survey of denmark and greenland , said it appeared man - made climate change was responsible for the slow down of the gulf stream and may worsen as global temperatures increase
