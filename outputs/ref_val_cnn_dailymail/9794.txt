twitter has ruthlessly mocked starbucks campaign for the company 's new anti-racism campaign in which baristas talk to customers about race issues while serving their coffee
one user tweeted , ' i do n't have time to explain 400 years of oppression to you & still make my train ' , while another pointed out , ' y'all realize there are no coloured hands in the press photos right '
a third speculated , ' maybe starbucks actually wanted to get people of all races & ethnicities to join hands and make fun '
but twitter has branded the campaign ' cringe - inducing ' and ' patronizing ' humiliation : corey dubrowa , starbucks ' senior vice president of global communications was forced to delete his account due to ' a cascade of negativity ' corey dubrowa , the company 's senior vice president of global communications , was forced to delete his twitter account , before re-activating it the next day
' i got overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion , and i reacted '
staff at the 4,700 cafÃ©s across u.s. now have the option to write ' racetogether ' on cardboard cups , which is the slogan of a starbucks anti-racism campaign
but many customers found the campaign ' patronizing '
' # racetogether is what happens when a 1 % - er without any actual anti-racist education or training has a mid-life " white man 's burden " crisis , ' one user tweeted
' the campaign was the brainchild of howard schultz , 61 , the company 's boss , who has a track record of speaking out about contentious topics , from gay marriage to gun control
mr schulz met about 2,000 starbucks staff on the tour , and made contact with the rest of his 200,000 employees - 40 per cent of whom are from ethnic minority backgrounds - via a video address
the campaign will continue on friday , when every copy of usa today will carry an insert about racism , which will also be stocked at branches of starbucks
it is not known whether starbucks is considering pulling the racetogether campaign
