what 's for dinner ? how about leftover cartilage of skate with herring - head tartar sauce , cured tuna blood line aioli or a meat loaf of offal and slightly past - its - prime cow usually reserved for dogs ? those and two dozen other dishes using scraps and usually ignored bits comprise the menu at chef dan barber 's wastedny , a pop - up project at one of his blue hill restaurants in new york intended to shed light on the many tragedies of food waste
the farm - to - table guru , a multiple james beard award winner and author of the third plate : field notes on the future of food did n't have a hard sell on his hands when he invited 20 of his heavy hitter chef friends to join him in turning out $ 15 a la carte plates made from day - old bread , bruised beets , brine from the olive bin and the peels of pineapples
grub 's up : in this thursday , march 19 , 2015 photo , a waiter serves a couple at wasted in new york - the menu includes dishes using scraps and other ignored bits diners have n't been put off by the idea of ' dumpster dining ' and there is currently a waitlist for wastedny
even dan barber 's tabletops and cocktails tell the story
the restaurateur had his manhattan tables redone with tops from agricultural byproducts and mushroom mycelium for his two - and - a - half week pop - up
and chefs like dan barber , who has a second restaurant on a farm north of the city , are far more efficient than they 're given credit for
' to do that we need chefs and restaurants to start the conversation , ' dan barber said during a recent busy night of service at wastedny , capitalized to emphasis his hope of educating the unenlightened
fine - dining restaurants are just a fraction in the food waste equation , however
dinner is server : fried skate wing cartilage with smoked whitefish head tartar sauce novel idea : chef ( above ) dan barber 's wastedny , a pop - up project at one of his blue hill restaurants in new york , is intended to shed light on the many tragedies of food waste with nearly one billion people starving or food insecure around the world , much of the waste is generated by america households and farms themselves , said bloom , an activist in durham , north carolina , and author of american wasteland : how america throws away nearly half of its food ( and what we can do about it )
' dan barber sees his pop - up as an extension of his ' third plate ' philosophy that challenges america to radically rethink what is acceptable and unacceptable to eat while becoming better stewards of the land
that goes a long way in explaining the ' wasted special ' served up by one of dan barber 's guest chefs , bill telepan of the upper west side restaurant telepan
' advocates like baldwin , dan barber and bloom applaud the higher visibility in recent years of sustainable farming techniques , as well as locavores who prefer eating food grown close to home
he 's the president of baldor specialty foods , a distributor and processor of produce in the south bronx serving high - end hotels and restaurants like those of dan barber and telepan
he signed on to supply wastedny , providing the peels of pineapples , for instance , for a dessert served with candied mango skin and an ice cream flavored with lime leaves
baldor - as a middleman - has made strides in re-purposing his own food waste , using natural enzymes to dehydrate byproduct before it hits landfills
the company is also a major contributor to city harvest , which feeds the hungry in new york using rescued food
' will there be 100 chefs tomorrow saying i want to follow dan barber 's lead ? i hope so , ' he said
