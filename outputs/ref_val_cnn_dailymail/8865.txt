with a professional career under her belt and financially stable , the photographer decided she wanted a baby of her own - and decided to adopt. after sailing through the process , she was shown a video of a little boy who melted her heart
claire was delighted when she was told she could adopt a baby boy â i did nât want any child with a disability as i was a single adopter and i could nât facilitate that
â it said in his child performance report that he was a healthy , babbling baby boy and i was thrilled when i was told i could collect him
â it was such a special day and he was going to be my very special boy , i was very excited
she said looking back , alarm bells should have rung sooner that there was something seriously wrong with her son
â the look of love : claire plays with the little boy she handed back to social services after the tot started suffering as many as 36 seizures a day she took him to speech therapy and would encourage him constantly , but said he never missed her if she went out of the room and did nât speak at all , other than one word , â mummy â
having adopted him in 2011 , claire had persevered and the little boy learnt to walk
â i âd just pulled into a petrol station in preston when i turned around and he was in the back of the car and started to jolt - he was having a seizure
â claire took many photographs of the little boy in the two years he spent with her , including this one unfortunately , it was the first of many seizures which eventually resulted in him going to great ormond street hospital in london
â he had neurological damage , or brain damage , and had been born that way , â claire said
â he was having 36 seizures a day and his epilepsy was a symptom of something much bigger
â it âs certainly not something i took lightly at all , but i had nothing more to give and had to hand him back
â however , claire said that although social workers had agreed she could nât care for him , a legal â care order â is needed to hand a child back which she says implies the parents are at fault as they can not look after it
claire is hoping her website will provide support to anyone else going through adoption disruption
picture posed by models now claire has launched a website called adoption disruption to provide support for others for whom adoption breaks down
â more needs to be done around care orders as it âs not always the fault of parents that they have to hand their children back
