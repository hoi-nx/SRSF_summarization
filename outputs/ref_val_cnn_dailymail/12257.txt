one of the most pernicious phrases in the debate over how to counter extremist use of social media is " whack - a - mole
" in national security circles , many believe that suspending social media accounts used by violent extremists is a pointless endeavor
they argue that , as in the children 's arcade game " whac-a-mole , " suspending accounts is a fruitless endeavor because , they claim , new accounts are created for every account that is suspended
to examine this assumption , technologist jonathon morgan and i collected data on millions of twitter accounts , including tens of thousands used by isis supporters , and found substantial evidence to the contrary
in september 2014 , twitter began to crack down on isis supporters who used its platform , suspending tens of thousands of accounts over the course of several months
the size of isis 's support network on twitter is shrinking as a result
additionally , we found that the suspensions targeted some of the most active and effective users in the network , the professional activists who empowered isis to broadcast its propaganda to unsuspecting audiences by spamming hashtags such as # worldcup and # cakeboss
not only has isis suffered a blow to its ability to spam others , its supporters on twitter are so weakened that they are now hoist by their own petard
but their audience is shrinking and their ability to game twitter with manipulative tactics such as auto - tweeting " bots " has been significantly diminished
an estimated 10 % of tweets sent by isis supporters are directed at rebuilding their social networks rather than disseminating propaganda , and that does n't account for the additional impact of time lost to the process of creating new accounts and waiting for followers to find them
these are worthy goals , and they detract from isis 's ability to accomplish its online strategy of intimidation , provocation and recruitment , which is discussed at more length in my new book with jessica stern , isis : the state of terror
our analysis suggested that the social network of isis supporters on twitter is becoming more insular , with users following each other more and becoming less and less exposed to outside influences
