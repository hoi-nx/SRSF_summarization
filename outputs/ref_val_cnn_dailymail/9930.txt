young teenagers are happier and healthier now than teenagers were a decade ago , a new study said yesterday
it found that the â facebook generation â of youngsters are less likely than their predecessors to drink alcohol , smoke tobacco or cannabis , or get bullied
a growing proportion of 11 to 15 - year - olds , the study said , engage in behaviour that would make their parents proud
they eat fruit and vegetables , take exercise , clean their teeth , and talk to their mothers and fathers
adolescents are more likely to eat fruit and vegetables , take exercise , talk to their mothers and fathers however the study , assembled by academics at st. andrew , complained that despite the increasing levels of health and well - being , adolescents now are just as likely to be fat as the generation of the 2000s
