a woman who uploaded a brutally honest ' marriage cv ' to the internet after discovering her parents had posted a profile of their daughter on a dating site has become a feminist hero
indhuja pillai , 23 , from bangalore , could n't believe her eyes when she saw the account that her well - meaning parents had created in order to find her a husband
indhuja pillai , who works at the internet company tripigator , decided to build her own description , with a no - holds - barred description of her likes , dislikes and general demeanor and posted it on a blogging site
indhuja pillai , 23 , from bangalore , created a marriage cv online after her parents tried to find her a husband through a dating site speaking on her blog about the profile her parents created , indhuja pillai said : ' [ the ] details were , name : indhuja pillai , profession : software engineer
' i went like , " wtf is happening here , " because , i am no g * * * amn software engineer and i 'm only 23 ! ' i am [ not a ] woman desperate to get married , and that matrimony profile made me look like one
' indhuja pillai took the profile down and told her parents that she was going to build her own dating profile , telling them to , ' send this to anyone who has the nerve to ask my hand in marriage
' the so - called ' cv ' is nothing like any dating profile you would find on a wannabe bride 's page and even states that she is interested in men who hate children
the profile reads : ' i wear glasses and look dorky in them
indhuja pillai 's marriage cv ' not a womanly woman
' indhuja pillai then went on to describe the sort of man she would be interested in hearing from
if you are sure , i suggest you show this website to your parents
indhuja pillai says that the response to her piece has been overwhelming indhuja pillai is now being hailed as the face of modern india - a woman who 's not afraid to challenge traditional perceptions of femininity and womanhood
and her blog post has touched a nerve in the same week the bbc plan to air india 's daughter , a documentary exploring the attitudes to women that formed the background for the brutal gang - rape and murder of a student on a delhi bus in 2012
' yet despite this , indhuja 's gutsy marriage profile was met with widespread support
' and it 's clear from comments on the site that indhuja pillai articulated the frustrations held by modern women in india trying to juggle their hopes and ambitions with the expectations of their traditional parents
