all those who deplore the supreme court âs decision , however , are wrong
the supreme court ruling that prince charles ' 27 ' black spider ' memos should be released marks not only a great day for the freedom of information , but also one for the monarchy one tory bigwig recently told me that the charles âs letters would reveal him to be â barking mad â , but when i questioned him , he admitted he had not read a word of them
i thought this was a good example of how much damage the secrecy over his letters has done the charles
we remember some of the charles âs strong turns of phrase , as when , in his leaked diaries , he described senior members of the communist china government as â appalling old waxworks â
he is bursting with ideas on subjects as varied as the environment , architecture , town planning , shakespeare , agriculture , the king james bible and much else besides
contrary to popular belief , the queen has not always been completely above the political fray for decades , he has been a sort of one - man opposition to many of the idiotic or ugly things going on in our country
this , they claim , could not be more different from the approach which has been so successfully pursued by the queen â who is believed not to express opinions to individual ministers
but the queen has not always been completely above the political fray â and for all we know , she might have made any number of interventions and recommendations to ministers of which we know nothing
how else , for instance , did we all come to be told the story that she deeply disagreed with mrs thatcher about the pm âs refusal to impose trade sanctions on south africa during the apartheid years ? the queen certainly had a vested interest â as she feared for the future of her commonwealth and even lined up with her commonwealth leaders against the british prime minister
the story was impeccably sourced â to the queen âs press secretary of the day , michael shea â yet it was denied by no. 10
yesterday âs judgment makes plain that charles can not hide the contents of the 27 letters to labour ministers
