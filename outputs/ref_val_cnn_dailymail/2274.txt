chelsea clinton and kimmel teamed up monday to help announce a new program called serve a year that asks college and high school grads to spend a year contributing to their communities rather than immediately moving into college or the work force
chelsea clinton and late night host kimmel teamed up monday in los angeles to push for serve a year -- an initiative that urges high school and college graduates to serve their communities for a year after graduating ' we know that the millennial generation wants to serve if they are given the right information and opportunities , and so i think that gives particular urgency to our efforts today , ' clinton said ' it 's great to see so many people , especially young people , dedicating yourselves to public service because you care about people and not because a court ordered you to , ' kimmel joked at the serve a year launch in los angeles on monday
their hope is that , with the help of partners like comcast , airbnb and the clinton foundation , non-profits like habitat for humanity , teach for america and americorps will have both added resources and new recruits after word spreads about the merits of serving a year
leveraging hollywood : the initiative seeks to make a year of service with organizations like americorps , habitat for humanity and others the norm for graduates with the help of the entertainment industry , where some major players have pledged to insert positive messages about a year of service into programming aimed at millennials ' we know that the millennial generation wants to serve if they are given the right information and opportunities , and so i think that gives particular urgency to our efforts today , ' clinton told the hollywood reporter
