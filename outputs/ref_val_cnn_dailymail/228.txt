of course , as space is a vacuum it is impossible to hear sound in space , but the discovery reveals a new way that fluids can interact to produce a sound - one with an extremely high frequency
a team of scientists that included york university made the discovery
they fired an ultra-intense laser on fluids in a laboratory
when they did this , the plasma in the fluid produced a sound wave
this process is thought to also be taking place in stars ( sun pictured ) they found that , when material - dust or gas from nearby - falls onto a star , it can produce an extremely high pitched sound in the plasma
it would be less common in more mature stars , like our sun. to make the finding , the team studied fluids in motion in a laboratory and found that , when plasma is hit with an ultra-intense laser , it produces some strange effects
in so doing , the plasma between the regions of different density produces pressure pulses , or a sound wave
however , with a frequency of nearly a trillion hertz , the sound wave produced is six million times higher in frequency than anything that can be heard by a mammal
the process is thought to be taking place on stars like the sun , pictured , where plasma is in abundance
in fact , plasma is thought to make up 99 per cent of matter in the universe â when they are accumulating new material , stars could generate sound in a very similar manner to that which we observed in the laboratory - so the stars might be singing - but , since sound can not propagate through the vacuum of space , no - one can hear them , â said dr pasley
