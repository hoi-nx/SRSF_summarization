ever wondered why we go grey or most men 's beards have a reddish , ginger tinge ? or why a young child 's golden locks often disappear before the age of 10 ? here , one leading expert , rodney sinclair , professor of dermatology at the epworth hospital and university of melbourne , explains the science of hair colour - and why some of us are cursed with more greys than others ... what determines the colour of hair ? hair colour is produced by cells known as melanocytes , which migrate into the hair bulb as the hair follicles develop in utero
the melanocytes produce pigment that is incorporated into the growing hair fibres to produce hair in a bewildering array of natural shades
hair colour depends on the presence and ratios of two groups of melanins : eumelanins ( brown and black pigments ) and pheomelanins ( red and yellow pigments )
while variations in the ratio of these pigments can produce an large number of colours and tones , siblings often have strikingly similar hair colour

genetic factors appear to be important in determining when we turn grey , rather than lifestyle , says professor rodney sinclair most of us find our first ' greys ' by the time we turn 30 , usually at the temples , then later , across the scalp how hair colour varies according to body site for example , eyelashes are the darkest because they contain high levels of eumalanin
scalp hair is usually lighter than pubic hair , which often has a red tinge , due to the presence of more phaeomelanin pigments
a red tinge is also common in underarm and beard hair , even in people with essentially brown hair on their scalp
why do blonde children often go dark ? blond children tend to see their hair darken around the age or seven or eight
it is not until this first hair is shed and replaced , at around eight to 12 months of age , that you get a clear indication of their hair colour
blond children tend to see their hair darken around the age or seven or eight.the mechanism for this is unknown and probably not related to hormones , as the darkening precedes puberty by a number of years , says professor rodney sinclair how much does hair grow ? human hair growth is cyclical
anagen can last three to five years on the scalp and produce hair that grows to between 36 to 60cm in length
the grey hair ' rule of thumb ' is that by the age of 50 , half of the population have lost the colour in 50 per cent of their hair
when researchers tested this rule , they found that 74 per cent of people aged between 45 and 65 had grey hair , with an average intensity of 27 per cent
by the age of 50 ( ben affleck , 42 , is pictured left and colin firth , 54 , right ) , half of us will be 50 per cent grey , says professor rodney sinclair
early greying occurs in premature ageing syndromes such as hutchinson 's - progeria and werner syndrome , where every aspect ageing in the body is accelerated
premature greying can also be seen in people affected by pernicious anaemia , autoimmune thyroid disease or down syndrome
contrary to popular belief , there is no evidence to link the onset of greying to stress , diet or lifestyle how can we prevent hair changing colour ? scientists have long known that in order to prevent hair from going grey they would need to either prolong the life of the melanocytes in the hair bulb â by protecting them from injury â or expand the melanocyte stem cell reservoir in the upper or top region of the hair follicle so they continue to replace lost pigment cells
but they wo n't re-colour grey hair or bring back the dead cells that produce hair colour
