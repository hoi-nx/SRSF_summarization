luke gale scored twice in a man - of - the - match performance as castleford made it back - to - back wins for the first time this season with a 20 - 14 success over hull at the mend-a-hose jungle
luke gale 's converted effort gave the castleford a deserved lead but hull responded positively and went into the break with just a two - point deficit after lineham marked his 50th outing for the club with his fifth try of 2015
lynch took centre stage at the start of the second period as his break laid the platform for luke gale to cross for his second and stretch castleford 's lead
james clare eased castleford 's nerves after benefiting from talanoa 's shocking error and they were celebrating their fourth successive win over hull at full - time
castleford continued to do most of the running and finally broke hull 's resistance in the 24th minute as luke gale showed a good turn of pace to score to the right of the posts after taking millington 's brilliant offload 40 metres out
hull came storming back and , just after former castleford half - back sneyd had been denied by a last - ditch tackle by carney , crossed for their first try of the evening through lineham
sneyd missed the conversion from the right touchline so castleford went into half - time 6 - 4 to the good
clare touched down after talanoa made a meal of luke gale 's kick and the castleford held on despite a late hull onslaught .
