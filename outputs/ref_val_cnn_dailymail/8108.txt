the nichol family had never been on holiday to turkey before , nor had we previously experienced an all inclusive package
so as my wife suzie , nine - year - old daughter sophie and i arrived at the marti myra resort on the mediterranean coast , the place was facing a tough test
john nichol with his wife suzie and nine - year - old daughter sophie at the marti myra resort in turkey to sophie 's delight , plenty of kids were lounging around on giant sofas availing themselves of free wi - fi and watching giant tvs
as the adults sipped cocktails at the lobby bar , the hotel appeared bustling but by no means overcrowded - probably because marti myra is a huge , rambling resort with seemingly endless facilities
this may well be because the site is set in 100 acres , has seven pools , water slides , beaches , an amphitheatre , five bars and seven restaurants
this is a resort completely geared towards family satisfaction and we were totally happy for the children to play in the pools , visit the various restaurants and go to the arcade unsupervised
for a small supplement , guests can also choose from Ãƒ la carte restaurants
marti myra is in the kemer region , which is dominated by the towering presence of mount tahtali , the highest peak in southern turkey
the pool complex at marti myra was a hit with the nichols family in true nichol-clan style , this was our only excursion from the resort as we were more than happy to luxuriate on the beach or by the pool
marti myra really did offer a fabulous holiday experience for the whole family
