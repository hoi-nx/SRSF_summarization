icelandic photographer sigga ella wanted to show that people with down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality
sigga ella 's series , " first and foremost i am , " consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old
sigga ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at the school of photography in reykjavik
the inspiration started with a radio interview sigga ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects
she hopes her photos shine a light on " the beauty and diversity of mankind " and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable
... it 's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about down syndrome
parents of children with down syndrome ... would n't exchange them for anything in the world
" the title of the series , " first and foremost i am , " comes from a newspaper article by jonsdottir , a 30 - year - old woman who is also featured in sigga ella 's project
" jonsdottir goes on to say , " who is perfect ? who can say , that we who have down syndrome are worth less that anyone else ? we are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike ? " sigga ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects " to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together
