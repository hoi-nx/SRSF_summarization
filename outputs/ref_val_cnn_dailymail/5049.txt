a&e departments across england are ' near breaking point ' experts have today warned , as they called for an end to the fixation with the four - hour waiting target
a new report by the nuffield trust said an ' undue ' focus on the national target can ' distort ' behaviour inside hospitals ' in ways that are not in the interests of patients or staff '
the think tank 's critique what 's behind the a&e ' crisis ' ? comes as england reveals emergency departments have not achieved the benchmark in england since july 2013
it comes as the latest figures , published today , show performance is getting worse
in the week ending march 1 , 91 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in a&e before being discharged or admitted to a hospital ward - short of the 95 per cent target
the nuffield trust think tank today warned a&e departments across england are ' near breaking point ' , as they called for an end to the fixation with the four - hour waiting target it marks a slight fall from the previous week , when performance was 92 per cent
but authors of the nuffield trust report argue that while the four - hour target has ' played an important part in improving patients ' experiences ' , it is just one part of a complex system of urgent care
the report argues a set of ' richer performance indicators ' should be considered alongside the weekly waiting time performance figures
nigel edwards , chief executive of the nuffield trust , and the report 's co-author , warned : ' england 's a&e system is near crisis
the chair of the british medical association , dr mark porter , agreed , adding the four - hour wait has become ' disproportionate '
responding to the nuffield trust briefing , he said : ' doctors want to treat patients on the basis of their individual need , rather than an arbitrary target
95 per cent â the national target specifying the proportion of patients that should spend four hours or less in a&e before being sent home or admitted elsewhere in the hospital
92 per cent â average performance against the four - hour target by major a&e departments in 2014
three hours 43 minutes â the average time spent in a&e by a patient who is admitted to hospital after leaving a&e
two hours 17 minutes â the average time spent in a&e by a patient who is sent home after leaving a&e
' focus on a&e performance has intensified since the start of the year , as ' unprecedented ' winter pressures saw medics face a worsening situation
in january figures revealed a&e waiting times had plummeted to the lowest level in a decade
but the authors of the nuffield trust report point out a&e is only part of a broader urgent care system
the four - hour target counts the patients who spend a total of less than 240 minutes between arrival and leaving the department , having been either discharged or admitted to an inpatient bed in another part of the hospital
' before the target was introduced , 12 - hour waits were not uncommon
in 2005 - 06 the target , then of seeing 98 per cent of patients within four hours , was met for the first time
the number of patients waiting on trolleys for more than four hours before being admitted to hospital has almost trebled , and delayed ambulance handovers at the doors of a&e have risen by more than 70 per cent
instead , the most significant issue facing a&e units across the country ' is not the numbers of people presenting at a&e , but the ability to discharge patients safely and quickly from the hospital as a whole '
the authors recommend policy makers should take a longer - term and broader view of performance in a&e , introducing a more complex set of indicators to sit alongside the four - hour waiting target
' we are already undertaking a number of the actions that the nuffield trust suggest - for example improving access to care outside hospitals , encouraging local health leaders to identify where to focus investment and using a richer range of different data indicators so we better understand how pressures are affecting different parts of the system
