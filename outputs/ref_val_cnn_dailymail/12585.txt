many of indiana 's businesses fear that the law could be used to allow store owners to deny service to gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender ( lgbt ) persons
but , when pushed on the issue , pence insisted that the law is " not about discrimination " but instead is " about protecting the religious liberty of every hoosier of every faith
" when asked whether he would allow an amendment to clarify that the law will not preclude anti-discrimination protections , the governor doubled - down , noting that " we 're not going to change this law
" but members of the indiana legislature beg to differ with the governor , pledging to " fix " indiana 's rfra
under rfras like indiana 's , people are not free to disobey any law in tension with their religious convictions
under indiana 's rfra , the government must show that its policy interest advances a compelling state interest and is the least restrictive means to address the problem at issue
the adoption of such laws have long been viewed as advancing compelling state interests , and the only way to eliminate discrimination is to ban it , so they are the least restrictive means
at present in indiana , there is no state - level law that protects lgbt persons from discrimination by private parties
given the wishy - washy answer that gov. pence provided when asked whether he thought discrimination against lgbt persons was appropriate , the likelihood of indiana adopting a comprehensive nondiscrimination statute seems remote at best , eliminating this fix as an option
importantly , federal law does not protect lgbt persons from discrimination by private actors , and neither does indiana state law
in essence , this would preserve much of the law as it existed before the rfra : absent local nondiscrimination laws , persons are free in indiana to discriminate against lgbt persons on any basis
what are the odds of this second fix ? well , that precise amendment was proposed -- and adopted -- in the georgia legislature as it considered a rfra comparable to indiana 's
