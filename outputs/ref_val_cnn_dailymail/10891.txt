a pub landlord has been fined Â£ 15,000 for employing an ' illegal immigrant ' - despite the barman having a british mother and having lived in the british for more than 50 years
hill , 50 , had been paying 56 - year old former postman jordan - a family friend over 30 years - to serve drinks and collect glasses at his manchester pub since 2009
but unknown to mr hill , mr jordan had been living in the british ' illegally ' since 1962 as he was born in the us and moved to british with his british mother when he was just three
jordan , 56 , ( right ) has lived in british since he was three years old but could be now be deported after it emerged he does n't have british citizenship
his employer , landlord hill ( right ) , has also been fined last december , eight immigration officers acting on an anonymous tip off swooped on mr hill 's pub the bay horse in denton , manchester and arrested mr jordan as he was working behind the bar
father - of - three mr jordan , known to his friends as carl , was warned he would be deported back to his birthplace , licensee mr hill was meanwhile shocked to be issued with a civil penalty notice by immigration officials for ' employing an illegal immigrant '
he has lived here for 53 years and worked and paid his taxes since he was a teenager
' you hear stories of illegal immigrants being allowed to stay in the british under some crazy human rights law yet carl who has been paying his taxes all his life has been told he has to go
mr jordan ( pictured in blackpool aged six ) was born to a british mother and an us father in the us - but after his parents split up , his mother brought him back to the british now - 56 - year - old mr jordan ( pictured , centre , in blackpool aged 10 ) has lived in british ever since mr hill added : ' when you have known someone 30 years you do n't think they 're us or whatever country they come from
' mr jordan had been born in 1959 as the son of an us soldier and a british ' gi bride '
but when his parents split up three years later , he and his mother moved back to her native manchester
he was later given an us passport but did n't realise he needed british citizenship to stay in the british
after previously working as a railway guard , he has been working in mr hill 's pub since 2009
it was just a bit of a joke between people that he had an us passport
' i have known him for 30 years and no - one ever thought anything of it
he explained he had an us passport because he was born over there and that 's it
' he has been left facing potential deportation after immigration officials told him he has no right to live here his employer , pub landlord hill , is furious after he was hit with a Â£ 10,000 bill for employing him mr hill added : ' i was at the bank on the day carl got arrested and got phonecall off immigration saying i needed to go back to the pub. ' when i got back there were eight immigration officers there and four of them were interviewing carl
it 's pathetic when you realise he has paid all his taxes all these years and in two weeks time they could send him back to us where he does n't know anybody
i went to school here , i 've worked here for 40 years - but now i 've been told i 've been working illegally all that time , even though i 've got a national insurance number and paid my taxes
a home office spokesman said : ' people born overseas to a british parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the british , and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions
