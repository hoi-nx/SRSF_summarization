every mp in the country is to get a brand new ipad after the general election , costing the tax payer Â£ 1million
the house of commons commission claimed that offering all 650 ministers a new laptop or ipads air 2 , would actually save money
caught in the act : tory mp mills was caught playing candy crush on his taxpayer - funded ipads last december but shadow cabinet office minister chi onwurah criticised the decision to lock mps into the apple operating system and told computerworld uk she would have preferred a ' device agnostic ' policy
' locking some of the most powerful people in the country into a platform that most of my constituents ca n't afford seems like a mistake
in 2013 , the house of commons commission agreed to a recommendation from the administration committee that ' a tablet and a laptop should be the first pieces of equipment offered to all members after the 2015 election '
the house of commons commission assessed a range of tablets with prices ranging from Â£ 100 to Â£ 600 and where they decided on the ipad air 2
the cost of supplying the new ipads would be Â£ 200,000 a year over the life of the next parliament
mr thurso said the decision to buy the new gadgets was to avoid spending more money on training staff to use non-apple systems and to reduce hard copy printing in favour of online publication which was already saving more than Â£ 3 million annually
the house of commons commission said that buying the 650 mps an ipad air 2 each , worth Â£ 499 , will save money ' having been in use across parliament since 2012 , ipads are integrated with current business processes and infrastructure , ' he said
