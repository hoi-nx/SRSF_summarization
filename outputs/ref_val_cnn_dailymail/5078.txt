scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive â and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them
the discovery was made after tests on the arabidopsis plant found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool
' professor appel exposed a group of arabidopsis , which is part of the cabbage family , to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms
she predicted that as the insects eat the plant , arabidopsis could tell by the chewing motion and the drool whether the creature was a butterfly or a worm
appel ( left ) and rex cocroft ( right ) previously conducted a study that found plants can identify sounds nearby , such as the sound of eating , and then react to the threats in their environment she also believed that the plant could tell several different insects apart , even when they were eating the leaves simultaneously
researchers in bonn , germany , found plants give off a gas when under ' attack '
there were also different genetic responses to each worm , showing that the plant knew what was eating it
the research builds on a study last year that found plants can identify sounds nearby , such as the sound of eating , and then react to the threats in their environment
in this study , caterpillars were placed on arabidopsis
using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant , scientists measured the movement of the leaf in response to the chewing caterpillar
when caterpillars later fed on both sets of plants , the researchers found that the plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils , a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars
' what is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations , including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defences , ' co-author rex cocroft , said
