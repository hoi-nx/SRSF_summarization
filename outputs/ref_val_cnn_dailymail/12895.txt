the iran nuclear negotiations in lausanne , switzerland , reportedly have made substantive progress , inching closer toward a provisional agreement between the p5 +1 and iran
" the question is , however , what can israel really do once a deal is signed ? in recent days , notable conservatives in the united states have attacked president barack obama 's handling of the negotiations with iran , arguing that a bad deal will force israel 's hand , leaving it with no choice but to attack iran targets
but is this a realistic conclusion ? israel 's stated " all options are on the table " policy toward iran has been in place for years and is based on the assumption that if a diplomatic solution to the nuclear problem can not be reached or is not to its liking , israel can decide to opt for a military strike on iran 's nuclear facilities
nevertheless , if it remains keen on pursuing a military option , the israel leadership will have to consider the following set of consequences that will likely result from such a decision : a successful military strike on iran installations may degrade iran 's nuclear program , setting it back several years , but it would not completely eliminate iran 's nuclear capabilities
iran would likely be able to resume activity in new facilities soon after such an attack , with more international legitimacy to embark on a military nuclear program , in the face of future military challenges to its sovereignty and stability
a deal between the p5 +1 ( the united states , china , france , russia , united kingdom and germany ) and iran is expected to include a 10 - year ( or more ) " sunset provision " that is much longer than the period it will take iran to get its program back on track in case of an israel attack
finally , an israel attack would spark a direct iran military reaction against israel , as well as an indirect reaction against israel in the region by iran 's proxies hezbollah ( from southern lebanon and war - torn syria ) and hamas ( from gaza and perhaps the west bank ) and against israel targets abroad
in the aftermath of a deal with iran , israel 's response is expected to be harsh
these israel public diplomacy measures will be complemented by continued intelligence monitoring of iran 's activities in the nuclear sphere as well as its involvement in regional conflicts
