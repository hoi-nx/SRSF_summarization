the number of days missed by holidaying pupils decreased by almost a third in the past year after a ban on taking children out of lessons for trips
drop : figures reveal just 3million school days were missed by pupils last year - down 1.4million on 2012 - 13 yesterday , department for education figures showed 3million days were missed for holidays in 2013 - 14 , down from 4.4million in 2012 - 13

under the changes , heads are now only able to grant leave in â exceptional circumstances â and parents can be fined Â£ 60 per pupil for taking term time holidays without permission
fines : the drop is being credited on the new fines system , which sees parents landed with a Â£ 60 penalty if they take their children out of school for an ' unauthorised ' absence those who fail to pay can face prosecution , with a maximum fine , if convicted , of Â£ 2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months
campaigners have said the rules impact the hardest on poorer families who can not afford high travel costs during school breaks , and families with parents that work shifts on or rosters
