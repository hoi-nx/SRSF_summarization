gartside , 40 , had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney had become available
but he faced a dilemma after learning the donor organ could be infected with hiv mr gartside , 40 , was born with type 1 diabetes , and his kidneys began to fail by the time he was 32
he said : ' they showed me into a room and told me the donor organs had come from a death by drug overdose and asked if i still wanted to go ahead
' because the person died by drug overdose , they would n't know whether the donor had hiv for two weeks
' the kidney transplant surgery took 10 hours and left mr gartside with 32 staples in his stomach
mr gartside said : ' my diabetes has completely changed - it 's amazing - and even that does n't describe how good i feel
