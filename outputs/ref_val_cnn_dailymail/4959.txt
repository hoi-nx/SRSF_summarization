my visit to kimberley in australia was my first â big â trip down under
i was there to film part of my new series for more4 called australian food adventure
my tour involved seeing local producers , meeting the farmers and looking at what they are doing â to get a picture of the whole food culture
i wanted to understand what it was like when the first settlers arrived , to talk about aboriginal dishes , and how all of that has had an effect on the country âs modern cuisine
during his tour , jimmy went to crocosaurus cove in darwin , where there are lots of different species of crocodiles , including the large , troublesome saltwater crocs food in australia has been greatly influenced by the second wave of immigrants : the greeks , the italians and , more recently , those from various parts of asia
until fairly recently , australia was best known for pies and barbies â but now it âs at the forefront of international cuisine
the other interesting thing is that australia can produce all the vegetables needed to make vietnamese and sri lankan dishes , for example
australia was best known for pies and barbies â but now it âs at the forefront of international cuisine , and also produces some of the world âs leading wines there are some fantastic chefs and some very interesting restaurants
jimmy was in australia was to film part of his new series for more4 called australian food adventure however , i âm not sure this is actually a â problem â
for example , in south australia i met an italians market gardener who had emigrated and i was amazed at the variety of vegetables he was growing
at my farm in suffolk , we have a farm shop , we run a farmers â market , and we have a restaurant â we âre part of a food culture that can perhaps be accused of being slightly elitist
but in australia , that attitude does nât exist because if people are snobby , they soon get shot down
he did great fine dining , but following aboriginal cooking styles and using native herbs and spices
