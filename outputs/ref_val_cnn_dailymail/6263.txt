thicke âs monster hit blurred lines has made a profit of more than $ 16 million since it became the biggest song of 2013 , an los angeles court heard on tuesday
the song , also created to pharrell and t.i. , is currently at the center of a legal battle over copyright infringement and the song âs alleged similarity to marvin gaye âs 1977 funk / disco classic got to give it up
during opening arguments in the case , richard busch , the attorney representing marvin gaye 's children frankie and gaye had tallied the alleged damages at approximately $ 40 million
besides seeking profits â including a claimed $ 4 million from 50 percent of the publishing earnings of blurred lines â the gayes are seeking damages for a reduction of the fair market value of the worth of licensing got to give it up , reports the hollywood reporter
the singer âs children frankie and gaye are also targeting touring money too , with about $ 11 million attributable to the song 's success
strangely , the gayes filed the claim to counter a suit filed in august 2013 by thicke , t.i. and pharrell in which they asked a judge to declare that the song did not infringe on gaye 's copy written work
