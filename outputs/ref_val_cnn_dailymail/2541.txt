motorists face a new speed camera blitz and Â£ 100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of uk âs busiest roads motorists face a new speed camera blitz and Â£ 100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of uk âs busiest roads
until now , lower speed limits have been restricted to smaller roads in residential areas or near schools
but in a major policy shift , 20mph limits are to be introduced on major arterial roads â and policed by the latest digital speed cameras
campaigners say it is the start of a radical new nationwide attempt to slow traffic down
london mayor boris johnson yesterday revealed that eight pilot schemes will be run on â red routes â â the main arterial roads that carry a third of the capital âs traffic
motorists caught breaking the 20mph limit face a minimum Â£ 100 fine and three points on their driving licence
the aa says the new limits are being driven more by â dogma â than road safety
â there is a lot of fear among drivers that , with 20mph being a relatively unfamiliar speed , widespread speed camera use will make them look more at their speedometers than at what is happening on populated streets in front of them
mayor of london boris johnson , pictured , wants to introduce new 20mph speed limits across the city upper street in islington , pictured , is also going to be hit by a 20mph limit as part of the 18 - month trial â it âs pioneering
for the first time 20mph limits are being imposed on main arterial roads â not just quiet residential roads where there is little traffic
â but the aa says while 20mph limits have their place , they should not be introduced where they will increase traffic jams and pollution â and where residents want them , not imposed in a â blanket â fashion
motorists caught on speed cameras going over 20mph will be fined a minimum of Â£ 100 , and get three points on their licence
the aa says it does not oppose 20mph limits where appropriate and where they are supported by residents , but it fears many councils and campaign groups are being driven by â an inherent or institutional prejudice against the motor car â
transport for london said : â safety cameras across london are being upgraded to new digital cameras which will have the capability to help police enforce 20mph speed limits â , adding that it hoped the new limits will reduce the number of pedestrians , cyclists and motorcyclists killed or seriously injured by 40 per cent by 2020
