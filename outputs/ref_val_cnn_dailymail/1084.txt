an australian wildlife warrior has gone where most people would not dare by filming himself swimming alongside deadly saltwater crocodiles
greaves has tried to show off the ' sensitive side ' of the predators and released extraordinary footage of him up close and personal with the reptile on his youtube channel
the 24 - year - old crayfish diver took a dip in the great barrier reef , in queensland 's far north , to capture hours of video , exploring the wildlife it had to offer - including stingrays and wobbegongs , commonly known as the carpet shark
when asked if she and her family even feared for mr greaves ' safety , his sister answered : ' absolutely
' the 24 - year - old is seen swimming alongside crocodiles in the great barrier reef in queensland 's far north at no point in the video does the crocodile appear to behave aggressively towards the sunshine coast man he said he had ' absolutely no fear ' but he respected crocodiles and does not touch them with hands ' to be honest , he 's an extreme person
' mr greaves told the sunday mail it was ' unbelievable ' to be able to swim so closely with the crocodiles , an act which wildlife experts warned was detrimental to his safety
' they 're just a big old dinosaur , and they 've got big teeth too , ' the wildlife warrior said
this is a carpet shark , also known as a wobbegong , which mr greaves also dares to interact with here he is seen swimming with his head resting underneath the carpet shark , which looks to be unfazed with this mr greaves also dares to give the shark a pat as he continues to explore the great barrier reef mr greaves is also a reptile carer on the sunshine coast and works for nine months of the year diving the coral reefs in remote cape york for crayfish on a trawler
mr greaves believes he had a ' primal connection ' with the dangerous beasts , which he helps them remain calm around him
' at one point in the video , the 24 - year - old is seen swimming near a stingray with its tail facing the diver
a barb through the chest was what killed mr greaves ' idol , steve irwin , who was known as ' the steve irwin '
the 24 - year - old also dares to swim close to stingrays - which killed crocodile hunter steve irwin he daringly reaches out and prods the stingray 's tail with a rod in a terrifying moment but professor webb , from wildlife sanctuary crocodylus park , said mr greaves was reducing his life expectancy by swimming so closely with crocodiles
according to news corp , 10 per cent of the 111 attacks that have happened since crocodile hunting was banned in australia in the 1970s involved scuba divers , snorkellers or spear fishermen - putting mr greaves in the ' very high - risk category ' .
