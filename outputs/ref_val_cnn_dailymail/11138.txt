a maryland mother and father under investigation for letting their two young children walk a mile home from the park alone have been found responsible for ' unsubstantiated ' child neglect
danielle and alexander meitiv , who believe in a so - called ' free - range ' approach to parenting , were thrust into the national spotlight just before christmas when police found rafi , 10 and dvora , six , wandering the sidewalk on their own
the decision by cps means that the cps will keep a file on the alexander meitiv 's open for at least five years but danielle and alexander meitiv have said they will continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences
the maryland child protective services have deemed them responsible for ' unsubstantiated ' child neglect for allowing their kids to walk home alone from the park before christmas unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge , but is in most cases a prelude to them
free - range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so - called ' helicopter parenting '
free - range parents advocate a more hands - off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own
it usually comes when the cps has deemed parents to have neglected their children , but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action
incensed by the ruling of the cps , the alexander meitiv 's have said they will continue to allow their two young children to walk unsupervised and reject any suggestions they are bad parents - claiming that giving their children independence is their right as parents
' we do nât feel it was appropriate for an investigation to start , much less conclude that we are responsible for some form of child neglect , ' said danielle meitiv , who confirmed to the washington post that she and her husband are to appeal the decision
' indeed , the alexander meitiv 's confirmed that they will ignore the cps and carry on allowing their children independence that most parents would be terrified to grant their own kids
back on december 20 , police in silver spring picked up rafi and dvora walking home on a saturday afternoon from the park after a member of the public reported it
guarantees : as part of their free - range parenting philosophy , the alexander meitiv 's make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street defiant : danielle and alexander meitiv have said that they will continue to bring up their children as she sees fit the alexander meitiv 's told police they often let their children walk on their own and that the kids knew the area well
the meitivs describe themselves as ' free - range parents ' who encourage their two children to take journeys without supervision in order to build confidence and teach them about the outside world
alexander meitiv is a research fellow at national institutes of health and danielle is an oceanographer
