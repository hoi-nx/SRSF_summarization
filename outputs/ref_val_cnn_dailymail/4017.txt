dicko burst down the right and skipped past one sloppy wednesday tackle but then went down under a soft challenge from claude dielna in the area and referee simon hooper gave a penalty
the forward looked to have fallen easily but bakary sako sent kieran westwood the wrong way from the spot for his 12th goal of the season
bakary sako ( centre ) was a danger throughout and scored the opener from the spot but could have had more matt doherty wriggled free on the right and crossed for the unmarked afobe to thump a volley in off the post from 12 yards
