do you love rice but are worried about your weight ? the good news is scientists have now discovered a way to reduce the calorie content by 60 per cent - simply by the way it is cooked
however , doctors have previously warned that eating reheated rice can cause food poisoning , and so advise making sure the rice is steaming hot all the way through before eating it
their recommended method of preparing the rice increases the amount of resistant starch inside it , which is indigestible to the human body
therefore this resistant starch is not absorbed and turned into energy or fat , and has no calories
the scientists found a two - step process that was able to increase the amount of resistant starch in rice by 10 times
lead researcher james , of the college of chemical sciences , sri lanka , said if the best variety of rice is prepared using this method , ' it might reduce the calories by about 50 - 60 per cent
' we discovered that increasing rice resistant starch ( rs ) concentrations was a novel way to approach the problem , ' he said
the coconut oil enters the starch granules in the rice during its cooking , changing its architecture so it can no longer be digested , experts explained a cup , or 210g of rice , contains around 240 calories
so , the researchers reasoned that if they could transform digestible starch into rs , then that could lower the number of calories of the rice
the cooling for 12 hours is essential , but reheating the rice for consumption does not affect the rs levels , he said

uncooked rice can contain spores of bacillus cereus , a bacterium that can cause food poisoning
