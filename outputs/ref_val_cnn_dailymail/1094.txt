the problem with his attempt to allay fears of the modern day media is that metadata was hardly a player when tony abbott was reporting in the 1980s and early 90s , before the advent of the internet
' in the days when i was a journalist there were no metadata protections for journalists , ' he stated to a gathering of reporters on wednesday
i was perfectly comfortable as a journalist , i believe that australia police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner , ' the prime minister said
his writing career ended before the internet began while metadata does include some traditional methods of investigation ; including phone numbers and length and time of calls , the overhaul 's main thrust is aimed at computer based functions , particularly the online and email world

' i was perfectly comfortable as a journalist , i believe that australia police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner , ' the prime minister told the canberra media gallery metadata is the footprint left by electronic communications
