motorists in essex have been left bemused by ' britain 's most pointless lane ' - a bizarre road layout which is not even long enough for the buses it was built for
residents in north stifford , essex , say the ' pointless ' bus lane on high road - which at 50ft long is not big enough for a double - decker - should never have been built
residents in north stifford , essex , are asking why the ' pointless ' bus lane on high road ( pictured ) which is just 50ft long and is not long enough for a double - decker bus , was built
they claim it is a ' hazard ' every week thousands of drivers have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled to come along the route each day
following a series of accidents , the lane has now been branded a ' hazard ' with motorists questioning what its purpose is
the quirk in the road means cars are forced onto a narrow ' chicane - like ' bend in order to avoid the lane ' the bus lane is so short that it is pointless and i nearly bashed the alloys on my audi when i went around the traffic islands
' people living near to road say there have been a series of accidents which they believe have been caused by cars struggling to get through the narrow layout as they avoid the bus lane
following a series of accidents the lane has been branded a ' hazard ' by motorists who use it every day ' i have shown pictures of it to my friends and they were all laughing and wondering what on earth its there for
