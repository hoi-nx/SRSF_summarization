the 40p tax rate is hitting too many people on â middle incomes â , david cameron said yesterday â as he hinted at fresh action on the issue in next week âs budget
the prime minister said it was wrong that millions of people doing normal jobs like teaching are now paying a tax rate that was â only ever meant for the better off â
mr david cameron announced last year that a future conservative government would raise the threshold for paying 40p tax from Â£ 41,865 to Â£ 50,000 by 2020
but chancellor george osborne is expected to set out the aspiration during next week âs budget , including laying out the timetable for raising the threshold
the number of people paying 40p tax has risen by about two million to five million since 2010 , as a result of coalition decisions to cut the threshold to help pay off the huge budget deficit left by labour
â the prime minister made the comments during a visit to the green school for girls in west london ( above ) mr david cameron ( pictured during his trip to west london ) also confirmed that the tories will press ahead with plans to raise the starting threshold for paying income tax to Â£ 12,500 â an ambition shared by the lib dems despite the pledge , the number of people paying 40p tax is expected to rise , albeit at a slower rate
