when reporter lauren vargas was sent to cover a bee swarm , she knew there was going to be a buzz about it
however when the abc 15 correspondent arrived at the scene in phoenix , she did n't realize she would be the one to get stung
the journalist was filming a segment for the arizona station about a swarm of the insects which had caused a neighborhood to virtually lock down on saturday when the pest got into her hair
one person who was caught up in the swarm was reportedly stung eight times
reaction : vargas said it was initially painful , but now sees the funny side of it story : the correspondent was sent to the neighborhood because a hive had developed on the roof of a house in phoenix
