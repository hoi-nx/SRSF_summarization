two extremists who attacked a landmark museum in tunisia , killing 23 people , got weapons training at camps in libya , an official said friday
the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in tunisia , security minister rafik chelly said
like tunisia , libya saw its longtime leader moammar gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the arab spring
such violence has been rare in tunisia , at least on the scale of what happened wednesday at the bardo museum in tunis
still , it is not a total shock , given that up to 3,000 tunisia have left to fight as jihadists in iraq and syria , according to the international centre for the study of radicalization in london , not to mention others who have joined radical groups closer to home
already , authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to a statement from tunisia president beji caid essebsi
that bloodshed is " just the start , " the isis message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for tunisia investigators
the nation 's security forces are working to break up other cells like those behind the recent bardo museum attack
as investigators continued their work , tunisia turned out friday to mark the north african nation 's independence from france
" i 'm here to celebrate 59 years of our independence , " said adib adela , 38 , a school inspector in tunis
" tunisia has been shaken by the terrorist attack , though it was foreigners -- 19 of them tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis -- who made up the vast majority of victims
already , the parent companies of the two ships that had most of the victims , costa cruises and msc cruises , have announced the cancellation of all scheduled stops in tunis for 2015 and substituted them with other ports
