the bi-racial granddaughter of a nazi concentration camp leader has revealed the horrifying moment she discovered the truth about her ancestry after she was given up for adoption
teege was 38 when she came across a book in a hamburg library written by her mother - a name she recognized - and learned that she was the granddaughter of ss commander goeth , who was portrayed by ralph fiennes in the 1993 oscar - winning movie ' schindler 's list '
' teege was the result of a brief relationship between her german mother and nigerian father ; by the time she was born , her mother was in another relationship and she was given up for adoption
by the age of seven , she had been taken in to a foster family but she reconnected with her mother , hertwig , when she was 20
by nearly two decades later , she came across her mother 's book , ' i have to love my father , do n't i ? the life story of monika goeth ' and recognized the author as her mother
she learned that her grandfather had ran a concentration camp in plaszow , poland in world war ii. family : teege , who was adopted , made the discovery when she found a book about her biological mother , hertwig ( pictured ) , in a library
she had had contact with her mother , who never told her the truth ancestors : teege 's mother hertwig is pictured right in the 1940s with her own mother ruth irene kalder , who had an affair with goeth while working as a secretary in his factory goeth was known for shooting jewish inmates for sport at the concentration camp and for training his large dogs to attack them , and was a central character in the film ' schinder 's list '
compelling : teege has penned a book about the discovery , due out next month the german industrialist oskar schindler saved more than 1,200 jewish by bribing goeth and other nazis to have them work in his factories rather than be sent for extermination in death camps
after learning about her grandfather , teege was overwhelmed with emotions , knowing that her mother had gone public with her story while failing to tell her own daughter the truth
' through the years : teege 's mother is left aged 18 , while her grandmother is right at plaszow concentration camp
teege said one of the hardest parts was wondering how her grandmother loved such a man killer : goeth , seen in 1943 , was known for shooting jewish inmates for sport at the concentration camp on trial : goeth , who was known as the ' butcher of plaszow ' , is pictured at his court trial in krawkov in 1946 where he was convicted as a war criminal and later hanged
teege 's grandmother later killed herself she has now written a book about her experience entitled ' my grandfather would have shot me ' and said she plans to tell her own two young sons about their heritage when they are older
