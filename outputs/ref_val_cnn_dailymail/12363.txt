sony pictures is expanding its " ghostbusters " movies with ghost corps , a collective headed by original " ghostbusters " director reitman and star dan aykroyd , that will oversee the expansion of the movie franchise beyond a cinematic universe into television and merchandising
the first order of business will be to develop a new male - oriented " ghostbusters " that will be released after the much ballyhooed female - centric movie being put together by paul feig
new all - female ' ghostbusters ' cast chosen g.i. joe and anthony russo , the duo behind " captain america : the winter soldier " and who signed a first - look deal with sony pictures last week , are being tapped to produce and direct the new movie
drew pearce , who penned " iron man 3 " , will write the script while channing tatum , another sony pictures favorite after the 22 jump street movies , will also produce with his partners reid carolin and peter kiernan
