the chameleon âs ability to change colour and blend into the background is famous
the incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand , by bending it
engineers have created artificial â skin â that could one day be used to make soldiers â uniforms , giving them the ability to blend into their surroundings like a chameleon researchers say the new material offers intriguing possibilities for an entirely new class of display technologies , colour - shifting camouflage , and sensors that could detect otherwise imperceptible defects in buildings , bridges and aircraft
â this is the first time anybody has made a flexible chameleon - like skin that can change colour simply by flexing it , â said professor connie chang-hasnain , a member of the university of california berkeley team that developed the material
they made the material by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair
engineers made the material ( illustrated ) by etching features smaller than a wavelength of light onto a silicon film one thousand times thinner than a human hair the incredibly thin camouflage material can be made to change colour on demand like a chameleon ( stock image ) , by applying a minimal amount of force chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival
while autumn leaves change colour because of a shift in their chemical make - up , the researchers say they can transform the shade of their material by controlling the surface features on the tiniest of scales so they interact and reflect particular wavelengths of light
to make the material , the university of california berkeley team etched rows of ridges onto a thin layer of silicon , which was set into a layer of silicone for flexibility
other applications for the new material include new types of advertising boards , active camouflage coatings for cars and sensors that could chnage colour to indicate structural fatigue in bridges , for example
â she said the chameleon material to make a new type of billboard as well as create an active camouflage on the exterior of vehicles that would change colour to better match the surrounding environment
it could also be used to make sensors that would change colour to indicate that structural fatigue was stressing critical components on bridges , buildings , or the wings of airplanes
â this is the first time anyone has achieved such a broad range of colour on a one - layer , thin and flexible surface
