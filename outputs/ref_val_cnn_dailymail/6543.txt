the photograph , which dates from a trip to tripoli , libya in september 2011 , was even adopted by the former secretary of state herself for her twitter profile picture
however , it seems that the picture which inspired hundreds of comedy memes could be no laughing matter for clinton as it emerges the photograph could be a figurative smoking gun
indeed , clinton herself has removed the image removed from her twitter account because it could show her using her controversial personal email account to conduct diplomacy in libya
but the picture , regularly seen by her 2.9million followers , was removed sunday - ostensibly to promote a political campaign for gender equality , timed to coincide with international women 's day
switcheroo : clinton swapped out a picture of her using a blackberry on her way to libya for a silhouette promoting a gender equality initiative however , the change also comes at a time when senior figures in congress are intensifying scrutiny of clinton 's communications from 2009 - 13 , which it was recently revealed were not conducted via official state department accounts
the image was mentioned by the chairman of a house committee into the 2012 attack on u.s. diplomats in benghazi to suggest that vital communications from clinton 's involvement in libya were being kept from public view
rep. trey gowdy ( r - south carolina ) , today told cbs 's face the nation that he has been provided with no emails from the september 2011 trip - despite clinton being clearly pictures communicating while aboard the plane
proof ? the chairman of the house committee on benghazi mentioned that he has seen no emails from clinton 's time in libya , despite pictures such as this one from 2011 , showing her using a blackberry he said : ' there are gaps of months and months and months
' so , it 's strange credibility to believe that if you 're on your way to libya to discuss libya policy that there 's not a single document that has been turned over to congress
' trey gowdy also said the records do n't include anything from around the dates of the benghazi attack itself , in which the u.s. ambassador to libya was killed
suspicions : rep. trey gowdy ( r - south carolina ) mentioned the pictured of clinton while contending that emails from her time in libya had not been handed over as of sunday evening , clinton 's profile still featured the blackberry image , but as the ' header photo ' displayed at the top of the twitter page
