labour 's strategy to cast ed as an ordinary family man escalated tonight as his wife justine gave her first major tv interview ahead of the general election
in a surprise move , she has spoken of her husband 's regret at not seeing enough of their sons and the pressure of political attacks on their family life
the child actress - turned - barrister is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run - up to polling day , but it is likely to draw comparisons with failed attempts by gordon brown and iain duncan smith to use their other halves to bolster their poll ratings
miliband has spoken of her husband 's regret at not seeing enough of their sons daniel ( right ) and sam ( left ) and the pressure of political attacks on their family life at the weekend mr ed spoke of the strains his political role puts on family life , claiming missing his wife and sons daniel and same is the ' hardest thing ' about his job
in a rare interview with bbc news , she repeated the line that her husband 's regret about the job of leading labour is ' not seeing the children enough or worrying he does n't see the children as much as he 'd like '
asked about dealing with the attacks on her husband she added : ' i think it 's going to get worse , i think over the next couple of months it 's going to get really vicious , really personal , but i 'm totally up for this fight
' probably like most women , being a working mother and having a husband who 's ed , i 'm definitely on a 48 - hour timetable , so i have n't really thought about it
' mrs miliband , a child actress - turned - barrister , is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run - up to polling day mrs miliband said her husband showed he had ' guts ' when he decided to take on murdoch and news international over phone - hacking in 2011 , though she admitted she was ' nervy ' about it at the time
mr ed repeatedly said he would not copy david cameron 's habit of eye - catching photo opportunities while opposition leader , and would instead focus on policies
but labour strategists plan to use his wife more in the run up to the election , in addition to appearances at party conferences
she added : ' the only reason i first gave a speech to labour members at labour conference was because i was so worried that by about three years in all they knew about me was a dress i wore to ed 's speech and i thought i really want to reassure people that i am in fact more than a dress
