hoyle , 48 , is on trial accused of killing a former royal marine who died when an alleged stunt in a vintage tiger moth aircraft went wrong a former royal marine pilot killed his passenger after crashing his aircraft while performing a ' foolish and dangerous ' loop - the - loop at a low height , a court has heard
hoyle , 48 , allegedly carried out the acrobatic manoeuvre in his tiger moth plane , despite passenger rogers being too big for the move to be carried out safely
the court heard how hoyle , described in court as a novice , was ' reckless ' for attempting to perform the stunt at a height ' at which recovery was improbable '
hoyle 's ' risk - taking ' allegedly caused the plane to nose - dive into a field near witchampton , dorset , killing mr rogers
hoyle , from broadstone , dorset , also suffered serious injuries during the crash , from which he has since recovered
he denies manslaughter and endangering the safety of an aircraft
opening the case at winchester crown court , michael bowes qc , prosecuting , said : ' the prosecution case is that the fatal crash was caused as a result of conscious risk - taking by hoyle , in that he flew the aircraft in a way which created an obvious risk of serious injury to rogers , and hoyle either chose to disregard it or was indifferent to it
' mr bowes told the jury of six men and six woman that , at 18st 7lbs and 6ft 2in , mr rogers ' size placed restrictions on how the aircraft should be manoeuvred , something hoyle should have known and made the flight unsafe
he said hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft , making him a ' novice ' in it , and that he was not trained to perform the loop - de - loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting
the jury was told the flight was the second hoyle had flown from the compton abbas airfield in dorset that day , having taken another friend up in his plane earlier
the plane crashed into a field near witchampton , killing mr rogers
the 26 - year - old was a former royal marine who served in afghanistan and northern ireland and ran a maritime security company hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft , making him a ' novice ' in it
hoyle , who had a private pilot 's licence , had flown 184.8 hours at the time of the crash , but only 35 hours in the tiger moth , making him ' inexperienced ' in it
mr rogers was sat in the front seat of the plane , with hoyle behind him ' the prosecution say eye - witnesses saw the aircraft entering a loop , ' said mr bowes
the plane , built in 1940 , then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first , the court was told mr bowes said hoyle had ' no formal training in aerobatics
hoyle told investigators who launched a probe into the flight that he pulled back on the stick in an attempt to regain control of the aircraft , which may have made it appear as though he was performing a loop
the court heard from an expert , who told the court it was ' reckless ' of hoyle to attempt a loop manoeuvre at the height he was flying
hoyle had previously ' dangerously ' performed loop manoeuvres far below the height a novice should have been doing them
he died later that day at dorchester hospital the jury has been told inexperienced pilots , such as hoyle , should be no lower than 3,000ft after completing a loop - the - loop
aviation expert connolly told the court that the heights at which he was performing the acrobatic stunts were described as unsafe and ' plainly not simply foolish , but dangerous '
reading his expert report , mr bowes said mr connolly believed it was only ' a matter of luck ' that hoyle had previously performed loops successfully
mr connolly said it was ' beyond belief ' that hoyle was unaware of the guidance on the height at which aerobatic manoeuvres should be performed
he said : ' to attempt a loop at such a low height with his limited level of experience was quite simply reckless in my opinion
mr bowes said : ' he was clearly aware of the recommended height limitations for aerobatic manoeuvres and yet chose to disregard them , possibly encouraged by previous experience , having done it at that very low height
according to the gps data , hoyle performed loop-the-loop manoeuvres in his three previous flights before the fatal crash - twice on february 12 and once earlier that day
