an unruly wind swirled around haifa on friday , whipping the palm trees and sending sand on the beach by the mediterranean flying
it seemed a fittingly uncomfortable middle eastern welcome for wales ahead of what promises to be a match of feverish tenor and great significance
here in the holy land , wales want to take a step closer to their long - sought grail : qualification for a major tournament
not since the 1958 world cup have they been to a finals competition
wales midfielder bale stretches during a training session in israel on friday wales ( probable , 5 - 3 - 1 - 1 ) : hennessey ; gunter , collins , williams , davies , taylor ; aaron ramsey , joe allen , ledley ; bale ; vokes
israel ( probable , 4 - 3 - 3 ) : marciano ; orel dgani , ben haim i , tibi , ben harush ; yeini , natcho , refaelov ; ben haim ii , zahavi , omer damari
israel host coleman âs team in an encounter that could go some way to defining both sides â aspirations of reaching euro 2016
it is first against second in group b coleman took his players through their final paces in the freshly - built sammy ofer stadium , which will this evening be filled with around 30,000 fanatical israel supporters , as well as 900 from wales
those travelling fans have not seen their side beaten in this campaign , two wins and two draws , the last point in belgium a hugely encouraging display and result
israel have three wins from three , and beat bosnia 3 - 0 in their last home game
bale holds off his team - mates in training as wales hope to maintain their unbeaten start in group b this is an opportunity that needs to be seized by wales , though
victory would crystalise the promise shown so far and catapult the finals in france nearer into view
defeat would undermine that promise to the same extent
coleman is aware of the importance of this tie , calling it wales â biggest since the euro 2004 play - off against russia
he hopes to be saying the same when belgium come to cardiff in june , but that can only be the case with a positive result here
the wales manager has twice been involved in campaigns that came close but failed , at either end of his wales playing career
in 1993 a missed spot - kick against romania proved decisive , in 2003 it was an inability to score past russia over two legs
but israel will start right back orel dgani for the first time and coleman said he would explore bale âs position as the match took shape
coleman acknowledged israel âs potency in attack , with rb leipzig âs omer damari leading the line looking to add to his five goals in qualification , level with danny welbeck
tal ben haim , once of chelsea , manchester city and bolton , is the most recognisable name in israel âs line - up
