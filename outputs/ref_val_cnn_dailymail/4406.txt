teacher davies , pictured , vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog a teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave
davies , who has taught english for the past 28 years , faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct
a general teaching council for wales ( gtcw ) hearing in cardiff was told mrs davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board
the 56 - year - old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress
caerphilly county council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother - of - two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the information commissioner 's office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance
however , she was still hauled before the gtcw - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making ' vexatious ' complaints
among the penalties available to the body included striking mrs davies ' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home
mrs davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was ' fighting injustice ' after her complaint about a pupil 's behaviour was not taken seriously
it is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom
' even though they decided the allegations against were proven , i always believed what i was doing was right
during her period of suspension , it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school 's internal disciplinary processes and made ' vexatious allegations ' to exam board wjec in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute
ms reynolds added : ' she felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay , because she felt a sense of injustice
' ms davies had raised issues at pontllanfraith comprehensive school , pictured , about a ' problem pupil ' however , while the row rumbled on it emerged that caerphilly council paid private investigators Â£ 3,600 to tail mrs shaw for three days - a move the information commissioner 's office later called ' unlawful '
quite clearly , she 's a good teacher
