former liverpool defender riise has picked his # one2eleven of stars he has played alongside throughout his career , on the fantasy football club
it is no surprise that riise 's team is dominated by liverpool players past and present , as the left back played in the side that won the 2005 champions league
but world cup winner and roma 's long - standing captain francesco totti gets a worthwhile mention with team - mate daniele de rossi , and fulham 's kieran richardson also gets a look in too
watch # one2eleven every friday evening on the fantasy football club , sky sports 1 or catch up on demand
riise - riise said his former liverpool team - mate pepe reina ( centre ) was ' always trying to make jokes ' goalkeeper : pepe reina ' he 's the funny one
he 's always trying to make jokes and has so much confidence in himself , which to be a goalkeeper you really need to have
' right - back : steve finnan ' the most calm person i 've ever seen ; never stressed
not the most defensive right back but i really enjoyed playing with him and never seemed to make any big mistakes
' ex-fulham team - mate kieran richardson took up a place as left back as javier mascherano also featured left back : kieran richardson ' he was a machine
' defensive midfield : daniele de rossi ' sees openings and passes that maybe not many other players could see
he will go down as one of roma 's greatest players
' riise ( second right ) described his 2005 champions league winning skipper steven gerrard as ' the perfect captain ' defensive midfield : xabi alonso ' probably the pass master
' roma legend francesco totti ( left ) was one of three non-liverpool players to be named in riise 's dream team striker : francesco totti ' the god of rome
as a football player he 's not quick and he 's 38 - years old now but he has his technique and ambition , and a touch that 's god 's gift
' striker : fernando torres ' he has got a bit of stick since he left liverpool and still has to come back to his best form , but while i was there he was a scoring machine
