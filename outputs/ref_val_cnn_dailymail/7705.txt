former australian netball captain ellis has championed a controversial netball ad after critics claim it draws uncomfortable parallels to a domestic violence ad
the fox sports ad , which is promoting the upcoming anz netball championships , depicts diamonds star layton with a badly blackened eye
an injury ms ellis claims she earned ' giving her all ' in training earlier that week
ms ellis penned a column for the age defending the controversial ad after critics claimed ms layton âs bruised and bloodshot left eye was distasteful
respectfully disagreeing , ms ellis said it would be a mistake to see elite female athletes , playing with the ferocity that men would , and assume it 's an act of violence
netball is a tough game and that âs what it portrays
star player layton sustained the controversial eye injury in a training session and was offered to cover it up with make up before shooting the ad
ms ellis says people do n't want to emphasise the level of physicality involved in netball ms ellis said she was elated to see a role model for young girls who can say ' look at what i can do , not at how i look '
how high can you jump ? how fast can you run ? how far can you throw ? ' ms ellis wants young girls to focus less on what they look like on court and more on what their body can actually do the ad highlights the athletes physical prowess but has been heavily criticised while ms ellis is adamant this particular ad does n't trivialise domestic violence , she said can see why people would assume ' that when a woman is bruised she is a victim
' ms ellis said the notion of domestic violence is becoming ' all pervasive ' due to the unfortunate fact that it is far more likely for a woman to suffer injuries at the hand of a partner than on a netball court
