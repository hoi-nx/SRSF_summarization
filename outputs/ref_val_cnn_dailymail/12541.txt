london cabinet - maker michael ibsen has just put the finishing touches to a coffin ; built of highly - polished , honey - colored english oak and yew , it has been a labor of love , pondered over and painstakingly crafted
" it is a unique privilege , " says canadian - born michael ibsen , whose dna was used to establish the identity of the king , found buried beneath a car parking lot in the city of leicester in august 2012
" when you 're working away you just focus on joining two bits of wood , but at the end of the day when you stand back and think ' i 'm building richard iii 's coffin , ' it 's incredible
back then even the man in charge of the dig , archaeologist buckley , did n't expect to find anything -- he told colleagues he 'd " eat his hat " if they turned up the long - lost king 's remains
" call it a fluke , or call it fate , but as it turned out they hit the right spot almost immediately : richard iii 's skeleton was found on the very first day of the dig , in the first trench dug by the team
for philippa langley , founder of the " looking for richard " project , who stood watching with bated breath as the bones were uncovered , the discovery was a vindication of the years she had spent trying to get people to search for the king 's remains -- and to look again at his reputation
years of research had convinced langley of two things : firstly , that his remains lay underneath a car park , in what had once been the grey friars ' monastery , and secondly , that he was much - maligned , the victim of bitter tudor propaganda after his death
two - and - a - half years on , langley believes the discovery -- which proved her first theory to be correct -- and the scientific research carried out since , have forced a rethink of richard iii 's story
this weekend , richard iii 's skeleton will leave the laboratory at the university of leicester , where it has been kept since it was found , and be taken back to bosworth , scene of his death in 1485 , for a commemoration ceremony , before being returned to leicester ahead of its reburial next week
inside , the smaller bones from his hands and feet will be tucked into linen bags -- each one decorated with a rose , representing the yorkist , richard iii 's family -- sewn by children from leicester 's richard iii infant school
historian ashdown-hill , who discovered the genealogical link between richard iii and michael ibsen , says it is important that the king 's catholic beliefs are recognized in the ceremonies
ashdown-hill , who shares richard iii 's faith , has had a rosary , featuring the white yorkist rose and a crucifix like one thought to have been owned by richard iii 's mother , made to be placed inside the coffin
