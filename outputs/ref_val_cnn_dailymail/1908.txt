starbucks baristas will no longer be encouraged to write ' race together ' on customers ' cups , the coffee chain 's ceo howard schultz has said today
the last day workers will write the messages is on march 22 as the initiative , which was accused of using racial tensions to boost its bottom line , will continue more broadly without the handwritten notes
starbucks spokesman jim olson said the phase out is not a reaction to the push back the chain has received over its campaign
' it 's all part of the cadence of the timeline we originally planned
' while there has been criticism of the initiative - and i know this has n't been easy for any of you - let me assure you that we did n't expect universal praise , ' his statement said
the six - time nba champion wrote that starbucks ' ' race together ' campaign left him in ' shock and awe ' ' we leaned in because we believed that starting this dialogue is what matters most
' the initiative previously encouraged workers to write ' race together ' on cups and to also strike up conversations with customers about race
schultz said that the phase of the campaign that involved the messages on drink cups was ' just the catalyst ' for a larger conversation
starbucks will still hold forum discussions , co-produce special sections in usa today and put more stores in minority communities as part of the race together initiative , wrote schultz

' ' starbucks ceo howard schultz 's bold decision to encourage his baristas to discuss race relations with willing customers has filled me with shock and awe , ' he wrote in his time magazine column
defense : starbucks ceo howard schultz told good morning america on thursday that he is simply trying to use the company 's reach for good with its new ' race together ' campaign ' the problem with howard schultz 's race together program is that he 's picked the wrong venue with the wrong audience using the wrong spokespersons
' the former nba all - star also wrote that he admired schultz 's courage and applauded his initiative but worried that such conversations ' could quickly escalate to violence
' abdul-jabbar even likened schultz to the highly moral character of starbucks in moby dick trying to stop the blasphemous actions of ahab
' support : schultz was joined on stage at the annual meeting by rapper common , who also spoke about the importance of engaging with people from different backgrounds in support of the campaign ridiculed : after the campaign was announced , twitter users slammed the idea as naive ' do n't stop trying , mr. starbucks , ' wrote abdul-jabbar

a letter from howard schultz to starbucks partners regarding race together : dear partners , i want to offer my heartfelt thanks to every one of you for your fearless and energetic support of the race together initiative
this phase of the effort -- writing ' race together ' ( or placing stickers ) on cups , which was always just the catalyst for a much broader and longer term conversation -- will be completed as originally planned today , march 22
we have a number of planned race together activities in the weeks and months to come : more partner open forums , three more special sections co-produced with usa today over the course of the next year , more open dialogue with police and community leaders in cities across our country , a continued focus on jobs and education for our nation 's young people plus our commitment to hire 10,000 opportunity youth over the next three years , expanding our store footprint in urban communities across the country , and new partnerships to foster dialogue and empathy and help bridge the racial and ethnic divides within our society that have existed for so many years
while there has been criticism of the initiative -- and i know this has n't been easy for any of you -- let me assure you that we did n't expect universal praise
with great respect , howard schultz source : starbucks ' we 've tried to be very thoughtful , very genuine , very authentic and recognize that by leveraging our stores , potentially , we can elevate the conversation and make a positive difference
' he said that he was not surprised by the backlash but that if the company 's workers can ' elevate the understanding and the empathy with one customer per day ' , he will be satisfied

when good morning america asked schultz about some of the scathing criticism on thursday , schultz responded : ' well , you know what i say to that - no good deed goes unpunished
inserting itself into national issues is not new territory for starbucks in late 2012 , the chain asked workers to write ' come together ' on cups to send a message to lawmakers about stalled budget negotiations
schultz said at the time that starbucks was neither for nor against guns , underscoring that even a company that wants a voice in national conversations has to be careful about alienating customers
