as the clock to 2016 ticks down , democratic are fretful that clinton and her team are n't prepared for the rigors of a bruising presidential contest based on their botched response to what is now being called ' email-gate
other than vice president joe biden and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren , who has adamantly said she 's not running , clinton is seen as the only democrat with enough credibility and name id to weather a national campaign
while many democrats continue to stand with clinton , others are questioning the wisdom of the party 's approach as it seeks to win the oval office for a third consecutive time
but if not clinton , then who ? ' there is no one else â she âs the whole plan , ' sarah kovner , a high - dollar democratic fundraiser based out of new york told the times
republicans , and democratic who worry about clinton 's viability as a candidate , contend that the calculated move to avoid using an email address directly registered to the federal government will intensify the public perception that clinton and her husband , bill , are secretive and therefore potentially untrustworthy
clinton has said that she sent the state copies of all her work - related emails , but there 's no way to verify her statements , as she retains the rights to both her inbox and the computer server she ran them through
and the white house said on thursday that the federal government neither reviewed clinton 's personal email nor was it ' particularly interested ' in doing so to make sure she had n't tossed out anything of importance
if not clinton , then who ? : while many democrats continue to stand with the former secretary of state , others are questioning the wisdom of the party 's approach as it seeks to win the oval office for a third consecutive time still a candidate - in - waiting , clinton had to tackle the controversy over her emails this week with limited resources
the former secretary of state has already built a network of campaign staff , but they , like her , must continue to linger in the wings until clinton 's candidacy becomes official
the gap in staffing helped cripple clinton 's ability to strike back in real time to verbal assaults on her character throughout the last two weeks as fury over her email practices reached its peak
' given state 's delay in disclosing the fact clinton exclusively used personal email to conduct state business , there is no way to accept state 's or secretary clinton 's certification she has turned over all documents that rightfully belong to the u.s. people , ' he said in a statement on tuesday after hew news conference
campaign staff or no campaign staff , democratic heavy - weights have said that clinton should have publicly reacted to the email crisis much quicker
