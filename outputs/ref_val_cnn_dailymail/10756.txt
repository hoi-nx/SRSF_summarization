mcnamara last night backed the decision to let virgil van dijk play in sunday âs league cup final â but took a swipe at celtic âs willingness to question the disciplinary system while matters were still pending
van dijk will face dundee united at hampden park after his red card was quashed â with callum butcher , the man the dutch defender tangled with on the tannadice turf â already cleared to play due to being the beneficiary of mistaken identity by linesman graham chambers
but while the dundee united boss welcomed the fact that - with the exception of nadir ciftci - neither of the two finalists will be hindered by suspensions , he believes celtic âs readiness to question the loophole that got callum butcher off the hook was inappropriate
virgil van dijk was sent off in the first half of the scottish cup draw with dundee united â if you ask me , i would prefer that all the guys were playing â nadir ciftci as well even though he picked up two yellows , â mcnamara said
â you want all of your best players to be playing in cup finals - you do nât want anyone to miss out
the two of them â callum butcher and virgil van dijk were in a melee at that point but due to the loophole or rules , whether it âs right or wrong , that âs just the way it is
the celtic defender went in hard on opposing player callum butcher at tannadice â from our point of view , we have kept our silence and our focus on sunday
the last thing i would want is for any of my players to speak out about the opposition and what - not when it âs been dealt with by the authorities
â the fall - out from the scottish cup quarter - final at tannadice has threatened to overshadow the build - up to the first showpiece occasion of the season
mcnamara , for one , feels the myriad issues to come out of the spicy 1 - 1 draw on tayside last weekend point towards the imminent introduction of video evidence
â on sunday , with the time it took them to make a decision , i think it would have been helpful
where do you draw the line in terms of games that are and are nât on television ? â the game has changed so much with the appeal system and tribunals
â dundee united players appeal to the linesman after the clash in the scottish cup dundee united lost the scottish cup final to st johnstone at the end of mcnamara âs first season in charge
rank outsiders to upset deila âs treble - seeking side this weekend , the former celtic star believes it âs imperative that his side maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of lifting the league cup trophy
â it âs celtic again , but you play most teams four times a season anyway and you get to know everybody really well throughout the campaign
â it should nât come into play at all what happened last sunday
â the second of four back - to - back games between the clubs this month spanning the three domestic competitions , mcnamara believes that celtic âs superior depth in squad is another factor in deila âs favour this sunday
the dutch defender will be able to play in the scottish league cup final after having his red card rescinded â you could argue that ( it âs easier for them ) as they have the biggest squad in the league , â he added
â mcnamara had revealed how he has changed his squad âs routine this week , consciously making it a different experience to the build - up to last season âs scottish cup final
â dundee united striker nadir ciftci ( centre left ) was also cleared for kicking scott brown ( centre right ) in the head asked if , with the benefit of hindsight , he regretted some aspects of last year â s preparations for the scottish cup final , mcnamara replied : â no because that âs what i did at the time
it âs something that celtic have , the belief that they can go and do it
against celtic and aberdeen , however , we have held our own
