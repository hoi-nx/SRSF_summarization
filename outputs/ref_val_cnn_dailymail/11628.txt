and judging by the extensive list of backstage luxuries demanded by jeremy clarkson and his top gear live co presenters , it seems a miracle he had nât previously lashed out
the three - page catalogue was revealed after bbc producer tymon , who felt jeremy clarkson âs wrath , said he did not want to press charges
also required is chateau leoube rosÃ© or equivalent which â at jeremy clarkson âs insistence - must be â pale dry â¦ preferably southern france
â in case that runs out , they ask for two dozen bottles of peroni beer , bombay sapphire gin plus tonic , ice and lemon , all chilled in a fridge or cooler cabinet with at least four shelves
their drinks must be served on linen covered tables , while a sofa must be provided with â enough room to seat six people , one of whom is 6ft 3in and likes to lie down â
the stars also insist on a nespresso coffee machine with a milk frothing gadget , balsamic vinegar , dove deodorant , hair wax , â nice rubbish bins â and a coat stand â â not a rail ! â in all , there are about 120 different items listed for the green room which jeremy clarkson , richard hammond and james may use to relax in during breaks from hosting the top gear live events , which take place at arenas in the uk and abroad , and are separate from the bbc tv show
in all , there are about 120 different items listed for the green room which jeremy clarkson , richard hammond and james may use to relax in during breaks from hosting the top gear live events and in a move which might have pre-empted the attack that ended jeremy clarkson âs bbc career , the list also insists the green room must be located near a mcdonald âs , stating : â they will ask for this â
a source from top gear live told the mail : â all three presenters have their eclectic tastes and they certainly know what they want
â jeremy clarkson is very into his rosÃ© and very particular about getting exactly the right type of wine
â jeremy clarkson is alleged to have been drinking rose for three hours before he hit tv producer tymon , who had told him that he was nât able to have steak and chips at simonstone hall in north yorkshire following a day âs filming
details of the stars â demands come from a â green room rider â list from 29 november 2014 â the date of the last top gear live event in the norwegian capital oslo
soft drinks on the list included 12 small bottles of ginger beer , a selection of cokes and red bull , and still and sparkling bottled water
the rider states that trestle tables are expected â for the presentation of food and drink â and â table linen for all tables not in good condition ! â very specific requests from jeremy clarkson , james may and richard hammond include over 20 bottles of wine , such as veuve clicquot champagne , cloudy bay pinot noir and sauvignon blanc the room also has to include a sky tv connection or way to access live sports and films , apple tv or netflix and a selection of dvds including james bond films , blood diamond and motorbike movie closer to the edge
during most top gear live events the presenters â and anyone they invite to join them â spend a few hours in the room during rehearsals on friday and before and after shows on saturday and sundays
the rider was put together by pr firm r  and events , which worked on the top gear live shows
