uk drivers would have the cheapest petrol in western europe if tax was not added by the treasury , official figures reveal
pre-tax petrol prices in the uk are lower than anywhere in the european union except estonia , but when fuel duty and vat are added the cost at the pump is among the highest
with just weeks until the budget , the revelation will pile pressure for fuel duty cuts on chancellor george osborne who has called on fuel companies to reduce charges in the wake of falling global oil prices
official data released by the government shows that the pre-tax costs of petrol in the uk has fallen to just 32.4p per litre , the second lowest in all of the european union tax adds another 76p per litre , making it the fifth highest behind the netherlands , italy , malta and greece total petrol prices have begun rising in recent weeks , after falling dramatically from Â£ 1.30 to Â£ 1.06 in the year to february
but tax adds another 76p per litre , making it the fifth highest behind the netherlands , italy , malta and greece
it means tax makes up 70 per cent of the total price of a litre of fuel , the joint highest with the netherlands
' the revelation will pile pressure on chancellor george osborne who has called on fuel companies to reduce charges in the wake of falling global oil prices howard cox , founder of the fairfueluk , said : ' for decades the highest fuel duty in europe has held back the beneficial affects of having the lowest pre tax pump prices
' fairfueluk continues to call for a 3p duty cut in the budget so the uk drops down europe 's league table of this punitive tax
ministers claim that pump prices will be 18p per litre lower by the end of the parliament , compared to the labour government 's fuel duty plans
' due to the government 's action on fuel duty since 2011 , by the end of the parliament pump prices will be nearly 18 pence per litre lower than they would have been under previous fuel duty plans
