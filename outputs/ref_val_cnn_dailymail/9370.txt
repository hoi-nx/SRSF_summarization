cardinal vincent nichols , the archbishop of westminster , insisted parts of uk would ' grind to a halt ' with immigrants , the vast majority of whom ' work hard and make a very positive contribution ' mr cameron has admitted that his failure to fulfil his pledge has fuelled public concern about the numbers of people moving to the uk
in a letter sent to catholic churches across the country , the church 's bishops warn : ' there is a great danger of blaming immigrants for the ills of society
' vincent nichols told bbc one 's andrew marr show that ' every party has to be tested on its approach to immigration '
' asked if he was dismayed that immigration is such a big issue in the election , he replied : ' well i am because i do think we need to go back and say what is our stance towards the world around us ? ' do we see ourselves genuinely as a player , as a contributor wanting to build something that is better for everybody ? ' net long - term migration to the uk was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending september 2014 , a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier mr cameron has claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue polling data shows the level of public concern about immigration is higher when the numbers coming to uk have risen
' we have to somehow keep the human person at the front of all of these issues and remember that this city , for example , would grind to a halt without the contribution of people who 've come to this country
labour 's cooper warned immigration into uk is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach ' the vast majority of immigrants come here and work hard and make a very positive contribution
mr cameron said last month : ' back in the 1980s when we had an open economy , we had migration in the tens of thousands , and do you know what immigration ceased to be for many years a political issue on our country
' today labour 's cooper warned immigration into uk is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach
