ince , 47 , a double - winner with keane at manchester united in 1994 , on thursday hailed the irish assistant manager as â a leader of men
â â i speak to keane and he does want to get back in ( to management ) but at the right establishment , with the right project
keane is not a number two , keane is a leader of men , â said ince
keane has the â mental toughness â required to manage manchester united , says ince ince slides in for a tackle during manchester united 's game against sheffield wednesday in 1992 â and if the right thing ( job ) comes along then i âm sure he will get back into it ( management )
â keane was last in charge at ipswich over four years ago but even so ince is convinced the 43 - year - old will â be a top , top manager â and could even return to the front - line at manchester united
â to be manchester united manager you need broad shoulders and take a lot of criticism
keane has broad shoulders and he is mentally tough
â he has a poker face , does nât show if things are affecting him , and there is no reason why keane could nât go back to manchester united ( as manager )
ince is convinced keane , who was last in charge of ipswich four years ago , will â be a top , top manager â â some people love him , some people hate him
