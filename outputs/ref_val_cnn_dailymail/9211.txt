i never had this , but i âd heard the stories and was hoping for that father - son experience when i took my eldest son jayden to wembley on sunday
he âs 10 and a chelsea fan like his dad
not that i was worried about the real chelsea fans but more so those idiots who put on the shirt claiming to be chelsea fans without caring what image or message they send out , and are just out to cause trouble
chelsea supporters pose with duberry ( centre ) and his eldest son , jayden ( second right ) at wembley chelsea fans cheer on their team in the capital one cup final - and duberry was one of the supporters at wembley chelsea celebrate winning the coca-cola cup at wembley in 1998 , duberry 's first trophy as a professional i did nât know what to expect
it was nothing like the image those racist idiots painted of chelsea fans on the paris metro
i loved it as much as my son ' , said duberry ' it was a great feeling it was walking down wembley way with my son among different races in blue shirts ' the scenes on wembley way vastly contrasted with the behaviour of some fans on the paris metro last month chelsea have a more cosmopolitan set of fans than when i was playing
i played my one and only wembley cup final in march 1998 in this same competition , but known then as the coca-cola cup
the chelsea supporters at wembley were a mixed set of fans from different races , families and groups ' when terry scored the first chelsea goal i enjoyed a brilliant , that father - son moment of celebrating ' as we took our seats , i gave him a history lesson about the day i played in this final 17 years ago
around us again were a mixed set of chelsea fans from different races , families , groups of lads and father and sons
after a while a few asked for pictures with me and also offered some kind words to me about my time at the club , dads explaining to their kids i used to play for chelsea and making me feel old
flag waving and singing songs with jayden and the other chelsea fans was great
when terry scored the first chelsea goal it was brilliant , that father - son moment of celebrating was priceless , then to see the other fans celebrating with him was great
' costa ( right ) , my son 's favourite player , scored the second goal to seal victory for chelsea ' costa 's deflected effort beat hugo lloris to make it 2 - 0 to chelsea in the capital one cup final when the final whistle went , we were high - fiving and hugging strangers and watching terry lift the trophy which brought back memories for myself of dennis wise letting gianluca vialli lift the trophy in 1998
it was a shame to hear more stories about alleged racism on a train later in the night
' watching terry lift the trophy with his team - mates brought back memories of my coca-cola cup win ' costa and terry pose with the capital one cup final trophy on the wembley pitch after the 2 - 0 victory the sooner a strong radical punishment for such behaviour is put in place the better it is for all
i had enjoyed the day as a black father and a chelsea fan watching his team win at wembley
