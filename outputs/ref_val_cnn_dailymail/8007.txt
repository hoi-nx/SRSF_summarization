a massachusetts teenager 's confession to police that he killed his math teacher can not be used in his murder trial , a judge ruled tuesday even as he allowed a bloody box cutter and other key pieces of evidence to be admitted
the ruling came in the case of 16 - year - old chism , who has pleaded not guilty to raping and killing 24 - year - old danvers high school teacher ritzer on school grounds in october 2013
chism 's lawyers had argued that police coerced their client , then 14 , into making detailed statements about the killing , despite invoking his right to remain silent
' as a result , the judge said , he would allow the statements chism made to topsfield police to be introduced as evidence but not his taped confession at the danvers police station
he also allowed items gathered at danvers high school , as well as those seized from chism 's pockets and backpack
they included ritzer 's id and credit cards , a bloody box cutter and women 's underwear
