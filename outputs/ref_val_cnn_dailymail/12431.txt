a federal judge has ordered the department of defense to release photos that allegedly show detainees being abused in detention centers in iraq and afghanistan during the bush administration
the aclu sued the department of defense in 2003 to have the photos made public
it 's not clear how many photos are involved or where the pictures were taken , but in an august opinion hellerstein said the government acknowledged having at least 29 pictures from at least seven different locations in afghanistan and iraq and may have hundreds or thousands more
in 2004 , photos became public that showed american soldiers abusing abu ghraib detainees and putting them into humiliating sexual positions
hellerstein said the government failed to prove its argument that releasing the photos would endanger american soldiers or civilians overseas
in july 2011 , the judge blocked release of the photos at the urging of the secretary of defense because american troops were still fighting in iraq
by december 2011 , most american ground troops had withdrawn from iraq , the judge wrote , and he did n't know whether release of the photos would affect military operations
the aclu argued the department of defense must individually review each photo and explain why its release would put american in danger
the department of defense has refused to release the photos requested by the aclu , saying publication could endanger american soldiers and civilians overseas
