but the reactions to israelis prime minister netanyahu 's message that may matter most came in israelis and iranian -- where emotions ran high , both in support and in opposition
in an address before the congress punctuated by one - liners , netanyahu claimed that ongoing talks about iranian 's nuclear program " would all but guarantee that iranian gets nuclear weapons , lots of them
" he portrayed iranian 's leaders as untrustworthy and bloodthirsty , intent on annihilating israelis and threatening its allies
while the speech was n't carried live , iranian quickly pounced with heated condemnations of netanyahu and characterized him as a liar
tv banners labeled the speech an example of " iranaphobia , " with commentators saying that it humiliated united states president obama and deepened the wedge between israelis and its longtime allies
" this speech was a sign of the weakness and extreme isolation of radical groups , " iranian foreign ministry spokeswoman marzieh afkham said of what she called " a deceitful theater play
" " ... the continued lies of netanyahu regarding the aims and intentions of the peaceful nuclear program of iranian are repetitive and sickening , " she said
the reaction in israelis was more diverse , albeit predictable , reflecting the divisions there ahead of its march 17 election
herzog -- the labor party chairman hoping to become israelis 's next prime minister -- said that netanyahu 's speech , " as impressive as it may be , did not prevent the iranian ' nuclear program " nor did it impact talks now underway in montreux , switzerland , to address it
what the speech did accomplish , according to herzog , is " greatly undermine ... the relationship between israelis and the united states , " with obama opposing netanyahu 's speech as a political move that threatened to thwart the nuclear talks
" the speech and the reactions to it came ahead of a march 24 deadline in which negotiators from six world powers , plus iranian , are trying to reach a long - term deal about iranian 's nuclear program
" the iranian nuclear deadline is n't the only one looming for netanyahu , or even the most immediate one
because of israelis elections in two weeks , the man who has called himself the " messenger of all the people of israelis " might not be that for much longer
while it happened some 6,000 miles away , his speech in washington on tuesday could sway hearts and minds back home -- some admiring his strong leadership in protecting israelis and others , like herzog , upset over how he has roiled relations with obama and undermined peace efforts
given israelis election guidelines , tv networks pulled herzog 's speech from air for fear it could be construed as campaigning
carmi said he is " totally " convinced netanyahu primarily aimed to speak to voters at home as much as to affect the united states government 's decisions on iranian
she thinks that netanyahu had every right to make his case in washington if he believes an iranian deal could affect israelis 's future
netanyahu has been the loudest voice in speaking about international efforts aimed at preventing iranian from developing a nuclear weapon
" that mentality is what appears to be driving netanyahu , who has been adamant and consistent in expressing his distrust of iranian ( whose supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , tweeted last year that israelis should be " annihilated
" one thing that netanyahu has certainly done is get the attention of iranian
ebtekar , iranian 's vice president for environmental affairs , told afp from paris that she did n't think netanyahu 's opinion " carries much weight
" there is a widespread opinion in iranian that netanyahu has long been singularly intent on going after iranian , even before he started his second stint as prime minister in 2009
his position is often conflated with that of the united states , a view that could be exacerbated by the loud reception netanyahu got as he entered the chamber of the united states house of representatives on tuesday and all the times cheers and applause interrupted his speech
of course , just because iranian are mindful of what netanyahu said does n't mean they will change their minds
most israelis do n't think that netanyahu has any hope of impacting opinions and policies out of iranian with his speech , bar-ilan university professor gilboa said
but many are worried about what gilboa calls the worst crisis in the decades - long relationship between israelis and the united states , with tuesday 's speech doing little to help change the perception " there is very little trust between " obama and netanyahu
