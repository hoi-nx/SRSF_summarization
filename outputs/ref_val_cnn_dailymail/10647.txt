in charles darwin âs theory of evolution , life is able to evolve through a process of â natural selection â , where certain traits become more or less common in animals based on their benefit
and now researchers are starting to emulate the same process in robots , so that they can learn how to perform complex tasks
the research involves a similar process of selection but on a larger and faster scale , allowing artificial brains to pick out the most worthwhile traits and continue evolving
research carried out by a team from michigan state university used genetic algorithms to model a large population of robot brains ( stock image shown )
these were asked to perform tasks , such as finding the exit to a maze
those that performed the task best had simulated ' offspring ' , creating a better brain the research , led by computational biologist dr adami from michigan state university , involves using genetic algorithms to model a large population of robot â brains â working on a task
for example , this could be finding the exit to a maze
the brains that performed the task best had the largest number of simulated â offspring â , meaning the smartest robots multiplied
the researchers ran this genetic algorithm over thousands , and sometimes hundreds of thousands of generations , and then downloaded the surviving brains into robots that executed the tasks in the outside world
one of the more complicated tasks the team 's robots worked on required multiple machines to figure out and remember in which order they would leave a room
this , according to professor cronin , mimicked the process of natural selection , which charles darwin proposed for driving evolution
dr adami believes that evolving robot brains in complicated worlds that force them to interact with each other is the best path toward self - aware intelligence
one of these included finding the exit to a maze ( stock image shown ) charles darwin , british naturalist , is shown here in a portrait from 1878
