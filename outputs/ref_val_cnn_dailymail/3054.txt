mason thinks spurs boss mauricio pochettino should take a great deal of credit for the role he played in helping him earn his ' dream ' england call - up
mason was drafted into the england squad following the withdrawal of adam lallana and could make his debut in friday 's euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania or the friendly in italy next tuesday
mason tracks raheem sterling in training after winning his first england call - up this week mason says it would be his dream to be handed a first england cap against lithuania or italy this week the spurs midfielder has been in superb form this season , prompting roy hodgson to select him ' it 's every boy 's dream to represent their country at any level , so hopefully i can get that and it would be a great achievement personally , ' the 23 - year - old spurs midfielder told thefa.com ' it 's the pinnacle of your career to represent your country
' mason 's route to the top has been far from straightforward
he signed for spurs 's academy as a 16 - year - old and just 12 months later he made his debut in a uefa cup match against nec nijmegen
former spurs boss harry redknapp farmed mason out to yeovil , millwall and doncaster , where he had three loan spells
kane made his spurs debut six years ago , but has spent the intervening time on several loan deals neither harry redknapp or villas-boas saw a place for him in the first team , but he is now showing form mason started last season on loan at league one and did not feature under tim sherwood at spurs once villas-boas had been sacked
mason is grateful to mauricio pochettino , therefore , for finally giving him a chance at white hart lane this season
it 's amazing and has been a bit of a whirlwind over the last few months mason thanked mauricio pochettino for the faith the argentinian manager has shown in him this season last year mason was on loan at swindon in league one , but has made remarkable progress since returning ' it was unfortunate that i did n't kick on at a younger age , it took me a bit longer to establish myself
