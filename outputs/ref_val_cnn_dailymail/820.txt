a woman raised by two lesbians has provoked controversy after publicly announcing that she is against gay marriage because she says she missed out on having her father in her life when growing up
barwick , a 31 - year - old mother - of - four from south carolina , says her mother left her father when she was 2 or 3 so that she could move in with the woman she loved
my mom raised me with her same - sex partner back in the ' 80s and ' 90s , ' writes barwick for the conservative publication the federalist
barwick , a 31 - year - old mother - of - four from south carolina , says she is against gay marriage because she missed out on having her father around when she was growing up ' i 'm writing to you because i 'm letting myself out of the closet : i do n't support gay marriage
' barwick recalls growing up in a very liberal and open - minded suburb surrounded by a ' tight - knit community of gay and lesbian friends ' and says her mother 's partner ' treated me as if i was her own daughter '
she also admits that her biological father ' was n't a great guy , ' and ' did n't bother coming around anymore
' despite being an advocate for gay marriage in her 20s , barwick now says she 's had a change of heart
my father 's absence created a huge hole in me , and i ached every day for a dad
i loved my mom 's partner , but another mom could never have replaced the father i lost
' abigail garner , an lgbt family - rights educator and author of the book families like mine : children of gay parents tell it like it is , who was raised by two dads , told yahoo parenting that barwick 's reasoning did n't make much sense
' while i sympathize with barwick 's pain caused by being abandoned by her heterosexual father , her pain has nothing to do with same - sex marriage , ' she said
' we are all entitled to our personal narratives , but i strongly disagree with barwick 's contrived attempt to offer her personal story as a case for blocking other families ' access to marriage rights
