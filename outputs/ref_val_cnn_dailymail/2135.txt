manchester united have not told monaco they wo n't be taking up the Â£ 43million option to make falcao 's move to old trafford permanent
manchester united will delay making a decision over falcao 's future until the end of the season falcao has just over three months to convince louis van gaal that he is worthy of a Â£ 43m transfer fee the 29 - year - old , once one of the most feared strikers in the game , has struggled for form at manchester united since he made the switch from monaco in the summer
falcao penned a season - long deal with manchester united but has scored just four goals in 20 appearances - a record that would appear to scupper any chances of his agreement being made permanent
