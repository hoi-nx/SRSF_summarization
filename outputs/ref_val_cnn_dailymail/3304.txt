dame jane goodall has condemned politicians for pushing ' frankenstein food ' dame jane goodall , the renowned primate expert , has condemned â deluded â politicians for pushing â frankenstein food â
the highly respected academic has endorsed a new book , which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers
historically , critics of gm food have been lambasted by the gm companies , scientists who rely on their funding , and politicians , including the uk government , as being â anti-science â
however , jane argues that the advocates of gm food have ignored evidence of harm with the result it is they who are guilty of being â anti-science â
the intervention is a powerful condemnation of the way biotech companies like monsanto , syngenta and bayer , have forced gm crops and food on to dinner plates in the us without proper safety tests
and she is joining a growing campaign warning that britain and europe must not drop safeguards that have kept gm crops out
dame jane âs concerns have been raised in the foreword to a new book , â altered genes , twisted truth â , which is written by the us public interest lawyer , druker
its publication comes as the us is seeing a growing backlash against gm. just last week it emerged that the country âs favourite chocolate manufacturer , hershey , is to drop gm from its products
the britain government has signalled that it plans to use a new gm crop approval process to push ahead with growing the crops in this country
separately , a new trade agreement between the eu and the us , which is called ttip , could make it much easier for gm foods from north america to appear on shelves here
however , jane warns it would be an enormous risk to accept the technology and describes mr druker as a hero worthy of a nobel prize for lifting the lid on the truth about gm dame jane endorsed a new book , which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers ( file picture ) she describes his work as one of the most important books of the last 50 years , and adds : â it will go a long way toward dispelling the confusion and delusion that has been created regarding the genetic engineering process and the foods it creates
â mr druker , who gave a press conference in london yesterday ( wed ) , has challenged britain âs royal society to apologies for its pro-gm stance and its part in rubbishing scientists who have safety doubts over the crops and food
â pat thomas , director of the campaigning group gm , warned the ttip trade talks mean britain and europe could see a flood of biotech crops and food arriving here
she said : â steven druker âs investigation into the history of fraud and deceit that ushered in the era of gm deserves serious consideration before we take actions that will irreversibly alter the europe food supply â
' they state : ' in fact , seeds with gm traits have been tested more than any other crops in the history of agriculture â with no evidence of harm to humans or animals
