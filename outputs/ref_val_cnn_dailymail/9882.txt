the first thing you need to know about mourinho is just how much he loves winning football matches
it is everything to him â whether it is the barclays premier league , the champions league or a charity match
last summer , mourinho was in charge of the rest of the world , i was playing for sam allardyce âs england side and mourinho âs team were leading at old trafford going into the final moments
to ensure the advantage was preserved , however , mourinho â with a glint in his eye â had a word with james , the hollywood actor , who he was putting on as substitute
the job was done and they won 4 - 2 ! nemanja matic ( left ) john terry and gary cahill joke during training at the end of a hard week for chelsea mourinho spikily replied to comments made by jamie carragher and graeme souness cesc fabregas controls the ball as the barclays premier league leaders look forward to sunday 's southampton game i must stress that it was all good - natured , but on wednesday night against psg , the actions of a mourinho team were significantly darker
i called chelsea âs behaviour disgraceful and sad as they pursued a champions league quarter - final place
they went beyond what is acceptable but , unfortunately , it is not the first time we have seen them do it
mourinho and his teams take winning to a level that other teams and managers do not
mourinho shakes hands with fans before the start of last summer 's soccer aid match at old trafford jamie carragher ( centre ) played for sam allardyce 's england side for the charity game in june last year as the seconds dwindled , james mcevoy ( left ) went down with an injury as the the rest of the world won 4 - 2 respect for mourinho âs achievements in the game is beyond doubt
in a few years from now , we could be acknowledging him as the most successful manager of all time , particularly if he keeps picking up a trophy every 35 matches , as is his current remarkable ratio
but will he be loved ? chelsea fans undoubtedly adore him
porto and inter supporters will too
chelsea players surround bjorn kuipers as the dutch referee gives ibrahimovic his marching orders it was this tackle by the swede on oscar that had the chelsea players swarming round the ref ibrahimovic 's night was over after the tackle in the first half every outfield chelsea player except oscar was involved in the mass protest are trophies more important than creating good memories ? i would always argue â yes â to that
if i âm honest , it annoys me , especially when i hear stories even now of how great kevin keegan âs newcastle team of 1995 - 96 were or how thrilling the leeds team were that reached the champions league semi-final in 2000
mourinho led porto to the uefa cup in 2003 and the champions league a year after mourinho grabs marco materazzi after guiding inter to their third champions league in 2010 you want to be successful and have a reputation that spans a lifetime , like the real madrid team of the 1950s that alfredo di stefano and ferenc puskas inspired to five consecutive european cups or the ajax team of rinus michels and johan cruyff from the 1970s
real madrid 's raymond kopa , rial , alfredo di stefano , ferenc puskas and gento pose before a game in 1959 johan cruyff rounds argentina keeper daniel carnevali before scoring in the 1974 world cup quarter - final the great brazilian side of 1982 celebrate socrates ' wonderful equaliser in the 3 - 2 defeat by winners italy i know most of the names of that great squad , as i am sure many do â zico , eder , falcao , socrates â but what would those men rather have , a winner âs medal â like their compatriots in 1970 â or just the knowledge that everyone loved the football they played ? in an ideal world , you get remembered for winning with style
their quality in that period was beyond compare and they remain the last side to retain the champions league
mourinho is just as prolific at collecting trophies as pep guardiola but the brand of football his team play does not compare
chelsea have been likened to the leeds team from the 1970s but i actually think the way they conducted themselves was worse during mourinho âs first spell in england
pep guardiola is thrown by his adoring barcelona players after winning the 2011 champions league leeds players surround ray tinkler after the referee controversially allowed jeff astle 's goal in 1971 john terry , john mikel obi , ashley cole and michael essien get in referee rob styles ' face in 2007 none of that might bother mourinho , in the same way it did nât bother rafa
oscar appeared to be no worse off after ibrahimovic 's midweek tackle as he trained on friday diego costa sat down for a bit of keepy - uppy at cobham as the players prepared for southampton mourinho keeps a close eye on things as the blues boss gets his side ready for sunday 's lunchtime kick - off his point was all that mattered was spain had won the trophy
mourinho would clearly understand the logic in that argument
i loved winning , there was nothing better that you could experience in football
and if mourinho âs teams keep taking things to the brink , the love his achievements should secure is unlikely to ever come
west brom are thriving under his guidance and there is little doubt they will be in the barclays premier league next season
but what about hughes , the man who succeeded tony pulis at stoke ? tony pulis won the manager of the month award for february after his fine work at west brom hughes ( right ) has flown under the radar but has led the potters to eighth in the barclays premier league without grabbing any headlines , hughes has impressively manoeuvred stoke into eighth place in the barclays premier league and they have built on their efforts of last season
lukaku skips past aleksandar dragovic ( left ) during an all - action display against dynamo kiev lukaku 's penalty was not convincing , but it hands everton the upper hand in the tie ahead of the return leg when you see everton play like that , you wonder why they have struggled in the barclays premier league
