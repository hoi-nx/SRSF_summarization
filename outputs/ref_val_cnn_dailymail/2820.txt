celtic captain scott brown has insisted he has no reason to fear being banned for sunday âs league cup final and called on critics of his tannadice tackle on ciftci to â man up â
the parkhead skipper , whose heavy challenge on the dundee united striker sparked a melee during a stormy scottish cup quarter - final at the weekend , is one of a number of players who will find out on tuesday if they face retrospective action from the sfa
but , dismissing any concern , scott brown said : â am i worried about being cited ? not in the slightest
celtic 's scott brown has accused dundee united forward ciftci of ' blatantly ' kicking him in the head â it was a great tackle
â in the wake of an absorbing 1 - 1 draw game that saw three red cards and two penalties , one of which was saved , the tannadice club announced they are appealing the red card issued to midfielder paton
the luckless paton was the victim of mistaken identity by referee thomson , at the behest of assistant referee graham chambers , after his team - mate butcher clashed on the ground with celtic âs virgil
but while paton âs appeal on thursday is expected to be straightforward , van dijk faces a 48 hours cup final sweat after celtic also appealed his red card
scott brown holds his head during the bad - tempered scottish cup quarter - final on sunday afternoon and in what is shaping up as a disciplinary d-day , dundee united trio cifti , butcher and connolly will join scott brown in finding out by 3pm this afternoon whether they face retrospective disciplinary action from sfa compliance officer tony mcglennan
ciftci appeared to kick scott brown in the face following the celtic man âs heavy challenge , while butcher could be hit with a red card for his role in the clash with virgil
connolly , meanwhile , could face a simulation charge after celtic boss deila accused him of diving to win his team âs first half penalty kick , scored by ciftci
paul dixon was the other sending off during sunday âs match but dundee united wo nât contest that and he misses the scottish cup replay at parkhead on march 18
after the cup match , dundee united boss jackie mcnamara said much of the trouble could have been avoided if referee thomson had sent off scott brown for his initial challenge on ciftci
the referee did not even give a foul but the celtic captain â who called for video evidence to be introduced to help the under - fire match officials â added : â i was kicked in the head ( by ciftci )
leigh griffiths wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1 - 1 draw with dundee united celtic defender virgil ( right ) was sent off after only nine minutes of the scottish cup quarter - final in a case of mistaken identity , the referee also sent off dundee united 's paton â do i hope virgil wins his appeal ? that would be great but we will see
â scott brown , who was speaking at lesser hampden where he was publicising sunday âs showpiece occasion , also backed up his boss deila âs assertion that connolly had been guilty of simulation to win a penalty
â it was a blatant dive , â said scott brown
