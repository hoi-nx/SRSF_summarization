stripped of its skin , and showing every bone and sinew , this gory display of an elephant is part of the latest exhibition from the infamous dr von hagens
body worlds : animal inside out , in which animal carcasses are preserved and displayed , opens today at ambassador theatre in dublin , ireland
created by plastinator dr von hagens and curator dr. angelina whalley , the exhibition offers visitors an ' anatomical safari ' past nearly one hundred anatomically dissected animals
the graphic exhibition features samba the elephant which , at 3.2 tons and a size of 6 by 3.5 metres , is the largest whole animal ever plastinated
' it is fascinating to see the anatomical similarities of the vertebrates on the one hand , and how many different anatomical variations have formed on the other hand in response to an animal 's living conditions â such as the elephant 's trunk or the giraffe 's long neck , ' says the curator dr. angelina whalley on the exhibition website
using dissection tools , the skin , fatty and connective tissues are removed in order to prepare the individual anatomical structures
forced impregnation a reactive polymer - silicone rubber - replaces the acetone
every single anatomical structure is properly aligned and fixed with the help of wires , needles , clamps , and foam blocks
dissection and plastination of an entire body requires about 1,500 working hours and normally takes about one year to complete it aims to illustrate the complexity of the animals ' insides , and how different animals have adapted both their anatomy and their organ function to their natural habitats
the exhibition uses plastination , a technique developed by german anatomist dr von hagens in 1977 for preserving biological tissue specimen
each could take up to 1,500 person - hours to prepare
von hagens went on to form the institute in heidelberg , west germany in 1993 which made their first showing of plastinated bodies in japan in 1995 , which drew more than three million visitors
over the next two years , von hagens developed the body worlds public exhibitions , showing whole bodies , donated by willing donors , plastinated in lifelike poses and dissected to show various structures and systems of human anatomy
past exhibitions have included a display in barcelona , spain which was mainly composed of plastinated asian body parts and embryos
the current exhibition , which is at ambassador theatre in dublin , ireland , was was made possible through cooperation with various veterinary programs and zoos with no animals harmed or killed for use
student kifah ajamia looks at a horse 's head , as nearly 100 anatomically dissected animals go on display at the ambassador theatre in dublin an intricate display shows a chicken 's blood vessels and veins which have been preserved using a technique called plastination but many of dr von hagens ' exhibitions - dubbed dr tod ( dr death ) in west germany - have drawn criticism from religious groups
the professor has continually courted controversy throughout his career and in 2005 in a four - part series on channel 4 called anatomy for beginners , he dissected cadavers on live tv
between 2005 - 2006 he dissected cadavers live on television a human body is on display next to a 120kg gorilla at the exhibition which offers visitors an ' anatomical safari ' past nearly one hundred anatomically dissected animals some animals , such as this shark , have been given the full - body plastinate process , while a series of ' single specimens ' offer preserved organs or even slices of animal the display aims to illustrate the complexity of the animals ' insides , and how different animals have adapted both their anatomy and their organ function to their natural habitats the exhibition uses plastination , a technique developed by german anatomist dr von hagens in 1977 for preserving biological tissue specimen
