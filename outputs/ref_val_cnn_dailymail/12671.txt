on october 24 , 1944 , u.s. warplanes swarmed at the leviathan of battleships , japan 's musashi , splashing down torpedoes or dive bombing it
it took them four hours and more than 25 direct hits to put one of the two largest war ships in world war ii to the bottom of the philippines ' sibuyan sea
this month , microsoft co-founder paul allen and a team of researchers found a sprawling undersea wreck after an eight - year search for the musashi
japan maritime expert todaka is 90 % sure they found the right ship after the first images were published earlier in march
unfortunately , japan war ships did not bear their names on their sides , so a full identification takes a while
on thursday , paul allen 's team treated the world to a live tour from the wreck at nearly 4,000 feet under the waves
the live tour began with one of the musashi 's many death blows -- a warped bow
the submersible showed multiple hits right under the musashi 's main gun , perhaps the most powerful naval cannon at that time
while in the musashi 's death throes , the gun discharged one time before everyone took cover and blew sailors off the ship 's deck , paul allen 's researchers said
the musashi was the most heavily armed ship of its time , the researchers said
as the musashi sank , parts of it , where air was trapped imploded
could the small chain have been a necklace ? pocket watch chain ? those wanting to answer those questions themselves will find the recording of the tour archived on paul allen 's website
the u.s. navy sank the musashi during the battle of the sibuyan sea , part of the battle of leyte gulf in the central philippines
microsoft billionaire paul allen has said his long fascination with world war ii history was inspired by his father 's service in the u.s. army
to finally arrive at the wreck , kraft 's team scoured historical records from four countries and undersea topographical data before sending down detection devices , such as the bluefins that have searched for missing airliner malaysia airlines flight 370
