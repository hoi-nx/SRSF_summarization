astronauts on the iss completed a spacewalk sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut 's helmet , nasa reported
in a tweet , the space agency said astronaut terry virts experienced water inside his helmet , just as he did wednesday , but " it 's a known issue ; no concern
" crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks , " the agency said in a release
nasa previously said the suit worn by nasa astronaut terry virts has a history of " sublimator water carryover
" water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk , causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet , nasa said
terry virts said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize
that 's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in parmitano 's suit during a spacewalk in july 2013
there was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on december 24 , 2013
