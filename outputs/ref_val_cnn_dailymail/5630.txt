the frontrunner to replace clegg as lib dems leader has savaged the way his party has conducted itself in coalition with the tories â saying it deserves just â two out of 10 â
in a thinly - veiled attack on the deputy prime minister , tim farron said the party should have been much braver and blocked the conservatives â controversial health reforms
the mp for westmorland and lonsdale acknowledged that the party will lose many of his seats at the election â saying he was looking forward to the â thrill of rebuilding â
attack : tim farron , right , the front - runner to replace clegg , left , as lib dems leader has savaged the way his party conducts itself in the coalition â saying it deserves a score of â two out of ten â but he said that , despite this fall in parliamentary strength , he would demand the same number of cabinet ministers in any new coalition agreement
the lib dems won 57 seats at the 2010 election , meaning that when they went into coalition with the conservatives , they were able to argue for five cabinet places
but the polls are so bad now â one even put the lib dems on 5 per cent â that the party is projected to lose half his seats in may
in an interview with the financial times , mr tim farron said the lib dems should â actively consider â something short of a full coalition if the general election results in a hung parliament
if mr clegg goes after the election , mr tim farron is seen as the front - runner to succeed him
mr tim farron told the ft that while another coalition is possible , the lib dems should consider letting david cameron or ed miliband form a minority government
mr tim farron said the price for any formal deal should be for the lib dems to take ownership of one particular part of government policy
â defence : mr tim farron insisted that forming the coalition had been the â grown - up â thing to do and said his party should not be â punished â
above , david cameron and clegg outside no 10 after the 2010 election the former lib dem party president said that if the lib dems did agree to a coalition , he would expect the party to hold as many ministerial posts as now â even if the party has far fewer mps
