internet retail giant amazon is testing its drone delivery system at a secret site in british columbia after becoming frustrated with us regulations
the world 's largest online store had wanted to test its prime air drones , which fly between 200 and 500 feet in the air , in washington but has now moved its research across the border , the guardian reported
last week the faa ( faa ) gave amazon permission to begin testing one particular type of drone that the company now says is obsolete because the technology is moving so quickly
however , the company has already been testing in secret for the last several month at its own restricted airspace in canada , about 2,000 from the border
the body has only approved 48 out of more than 750 exemption requests for exemptions that would allow outdoor drone testing before new guidelines are in place
oil giant bp was the first company to get approved for commercial drones over us land last year and drone pilots for the exemptions have been required to get pilot 's licenses
canada has fewer restrictions , essentially allowing amazon do whatever testing they needed within their airspace , and only took three weeks to give the go ahead to the seattle - based retailer 's application
the faa has only approved several dozen applications for drone testing licenses , though canada has approved more than 1,600
the faa 's proposed rules mandate that drones would have to be in the line of sight of their pilots at all times transport canada , which has been giving out the licenses for almost a decade while the us just started last year , said that is aims to complete applications in 20 working days
the us 's northern neighbor has granted 1,672 drone testing applications
amazon hopes that it 's canada testing will help build a system that allows customers to have goods delivered to their homes within 30 minutes of ordering them online
