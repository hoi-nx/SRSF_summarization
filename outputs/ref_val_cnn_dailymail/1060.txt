the one thing you can count on at poundland â according to its bosses â is that everything costs Â£ 1
today âs ruling by the asa is a major blow for the company , which has built its empire on the boast that just Â£ 1 can buy anything in its stores
poundland has been told it must drop the claim ' everything costs Â£ 1 ' after selling dvds and cds for Â£ 2 the decision even calls into question whether the budget chain can legitimately continue to call itself â poundland â
before the advertising watchdog âs ruling , poundland 's website boasted : â everything for Â£ 1 was the idea of our founders in 1990 and we âre still true to that vision today
poundland defended the breaking of its normal Â£ 1 price barrier saying the Â£ 2 items were part of a special promotion run at the tills and sold to customers providing they met a minimum spending threshold
poundland has become hugely popular with wealthier shoppers after stocking baking products under the name of actress jane asher â in october 2014 , poundland obtained feedback from consumers regarding the promotion and found that a significant proportion agreed that they would buy items from poundland that cost more than Â£ 1 , provided they were clearly marked and located in a special place in the shop
â the company said the stock of Â£ 2 dvds and cds were on a specific display that was separated from the normal Â£ 1 products and there was no chance of shoppers being confused or misled
but that did not satisfy the asa , which said the claims on the poundland website suggested that all its products were no more than Â£ 1 â regardless of whether or not they were sold via a concession arrangement or as promotional goods â
poundland confirmed some â special promotion â items cost more than Â£ 1
currently , it is selling an easter bunny toy and a nivea skin set for Â£ 3 to customers who spend Â£ 3
a spokesman said : â following advice from the asa on the communication of our special promotions on the poundland website , we have amended the site and made the special promotions clearer
â our special promotions have been bought by nearly one million customers , and are an additional offer separate to our usual product lines for customers who qualify , by spending Â£ 3 or more in - store
