you get what you pay for , so they say
but the high street is adept at doing tailored pieces in smart fabrics
tv presenter kate garraway tried three top - to - toe outfits
could she spot the bargains from the bling ? dinner date dress , Â£ 20 , oasis - stores.com necklace , Â£ 2.99 , and bag , Â£ 14.99 , newlook.co.uk ring , Â£ 7 , asos.com shoes , Â£ 5 , everything5pounds.com total : Â£ 49.98 a belt would improve the overall shape of this dress , but at a smart evening event no one would know it cost the same as a posh bottle of wine
i ca nât believe the shoes are only Â£ 5 ; they look as if they âd be at least Â£ 50
dress , Â£ 650 , beulahlondon.com necklace , Â£ 3,195 , caratlondon.com ring , Â£ 235 , monicavinader.com bag , Â£ 195 , lkbennett.com shoes , Â£ 725 , arunaseth.com total : Â£ 5,000 this dress looks sweet and fits perfectly , but it does nât feel expensive ( 75 per cent stiff cotton , 25 per cent nylon with a 100 per cent silk lining )
out for drinks dress , Â£ 30 , axparis.com jacket , Â£ 5 , and shoes , Â£ 5 , everything5pounds.com necklace , Â£ 7 , and earrings , Â£ 3 , claires.co.uk total : Â£ 50 this dress may be less than a tenth of the price of the more expensive one , but i prefer it 100 per cent
on looks , i âd think it was the more expensive of the two
winner : the cheap option â it makes a better impact all round
