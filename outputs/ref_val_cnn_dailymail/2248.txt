this was the year we âd be wearing shoes that tied their own laces â or so the back to the future films predicted in the eighties
while this may seem as fanciful now as it did then , 2015 does looks set to be the year of so - called â wearable technology â , clothing and accessories that could transform not only our wardrobes , but our health , too
until now , wearable technology has largely taken the form of wristband trackers â such as the fitbit ( launched in 2008 ) , 2011 âs jawbone and the much - hyped apple watch , due to go on sale on april 24
the latest innovations include a bra that could deliver life - saving breast cancer medication and socks that warn if you âre at risk of injury
hi - tech : a bra contains technology which allows tiny â nano â particles of a substance - for instance , a drug - to be embedded into a material even big brands are moving into the market â this year , the u.s. designer ralph lauren will launch a sports top that monitors heart rate , muscle movement and calories burnt
â so far , wearable technology in the context of well - being has been mainly about monitoring personal data , â says caroline till , course leader in material futures at central st martins , university of the arts london
â the question now is what do you do with the data once you have it ? is the information of value ? â this is where the latest technology comes in , with the focus on giving you feedback from the information collated
so in theory , â wearables â , as they âre known , will not only take your blood pressure reading , they âll tell you if it âs dangerously high
â the holy grail of wearable technology is something that âs integrated seamlessly into something you wear or use already , so you do nât notice it âs there , â says caroline till
another material technology , known as micro-encapsulation , allows tiny â nano â particles of a substance â for instance , a drug â to be embedded into a material so it is gradually absorbed through the skin when worn
here , we look at the latest â wearables â â some of which are already available , with others still being developed â that could transform our health
the omsignal top has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing bra that delivers cancer drugs the foxleaf bra contains micro-encapsulated â bubbles â of the drug tamoxifen in soft , plastic inserts in the cups
the idea is that the body âs heat and moisture rub off the bubbles â coating and the tamoxifen , which blocks oestrogen to slow the growth of cancer cells , can be gradually absorbed through the skin throughout the day
the bra was developed by masters , a masters student at central st martins , london
it aims to provide a possible solution for thousands of women who find the side - effects of tamoxifen intolerable
delivering the drug locally means less has to be processed by the liver , potentially reducing side - effects such as hot flushes , cramps and nausea
da costa âs next project is to see whether similar technology could be used to deliver dementia drug galantamine via bedding or nightwear
from around Â£ 90 ( $ 139.99 ) from cold - shoulder.com sun savvy : the netatmo june bracelet has a sensor that measures uv light t-shirt to monitor your heart omsignal , the company working with ralph lauren to create a tech sports shirt , has a top already on sale that has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing
the heart and breathing rate data is also used to estimate how many calories you âre burning â thought to be much more accurate than standard fitness tracking wristbands which make calculations based on how much you âre moving
lumo lift , Â£ 79.95 from store.apple.com / uk lechal trainers have touch technology in the insole that give you directions running socks that can prevent injury sensoria âs smart running socks monitor the way your feet strike the ground , warning you if you are at risk of injury and also how to correct your stride
the sensoria socks detect how your foot lands , and conductive fibres then relay this information to a small clip - on device on the ankle
the shoes are based on â haptics â â touch technology that gives you physical feedback from an electronic device , like a games console controller that vibrates if you crash a car in the game you âre playing
