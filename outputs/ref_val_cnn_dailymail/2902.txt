but , somewhat farcically , voting for the players ' player of the year award , has already begun
luis suarez , who scored 31 league goals for liverpool last term before his Â£ 75million summer move to barcelona , currently holds the title
sportsmail 's team of top writers give their verdict on which player they would want to follow in the uruguay international 's footsteps if they were asked to cast their vote today
nemanja matic , in action for chelsea against psg earlier this week , has starred for the blues this season matt barlow harry kane chelsea have been the best team with immense consistency from nemanja matic and eden hazard
harry kane celebrates with his second successive barclays player of the month award on friday harry kane , pictured celebrating against queens park rangers , has scored 26 times for spurs this season lee clayton who deserves to be voted player of the year today ? here âs my answer to the question : no - one
but among the contenders : john terry , harry kane , coutinho , alexis sanchez , costa , eden hazard , danny ings , de gea and charlie austin
alexis sanchez has impressed for arsenal following his summer switch from barcelona mike keegan eden hazard it 's close between eden hazard and sergio aguero but the brilliant belgian shades it thanks to his remarkable injury - free record
eden hazard has played 41 matches for chelsea this season but has been one of the league 's best players neil ashton harry kane he deserves it for the surprise element more than anything else - nobody could have predicted his impact at spurs this season
rob draper nemanja matic i reserve the right to change my mind in the next few weeks , as eden hazard and alexis sanchez have both been superb
but i âm close to settling on nemanja matic , because his position is often under - acknowledged and because he has provided balance to a chelsea team that had collected flair players while eschewing midfielders who can defend
nemanja matic parades the capital one cup trophy with branislav ivanovic after their triumph over spurs alexis sanchez and eden hazard have both been impressive performers for their sides this season craig hope harry kane there is nothing dark about the art of harry kane and a victory for the spurs striker would be a victory for football and all of the reasons why we should love the game
his brilliant enthusiasm aside , harry kane is a worthy winner on footballing merit alone and has consistently been the division 's best striker this season
de gea has spared united 's blushes on a number of occasions this season branislav ivanovic would win joe bernstein 's vote martha kelner de gea he almost certainly wo n't win it but de gea deserves some representation for player of the year based purely on the fact he has single - handedly and often stunningly rescued united and kept them in the hunt for a top - four finish
joe bernstein branislav ivanvoic this is one of the toughest to call because the obvious stand - out performers - costa , eden hazard and sergio aguero - have missed games or been inconsistent
so in a very even field i 'd vote for branislav ivanovic because he 's typified best why chelsea will be champions chris wheeler eden hazard chelsea are nât winning too many friends at the moment but it does look like they will win a premier league and capital one cup double , and no - one will have contributed more than last season âs pfa young player of the year
a supremely gifted footballer , eden hazard deserves the main award this season ahead of alexis sanchez , costa , coutinho and harry kane
