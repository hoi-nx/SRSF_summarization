on september 1 a soyuz â fg rocket will blast off from the baikonur cosmodrome on a mission to the iss and alongside a russian commander and danish flight engineer will be english soprano sarah brightman - who is said to have already paid Â£ 35 million to fund the outlandish space trip
earlier today the 54 - year - old announced more details about the project and revealed some of the gruelling training she is undergoing at the star city in moscow
on september 1 a soyuz â fg rocket will blast off from the baikonur cosmodrome on a mission to the iss. alongside a russian commander and danish flight engineer will be english soprano sarah brightman
the singer is pictured during training at star city in moscow the trip will make her the eighth so - called ' space tourist ' who has paid millions for the privilege of bloasting into space
ms sarah brightman will begin her 10 - day stint in space and on - board the iss on 1 september
she will be accompanied by colonel sergei volkov , a 42 - year - old russian who will be leading his third mission into space , and 35 - year - old andreas mogensen flight engineer andreas mogensen
at a press conference at the ham yard hotel in soho the 54 - year - old singer ( pictured left ) said her training lasts for 16 hours a day , starting at 6am , and this includes four hours of russian language classes
she will also need to undergo weightlessness training in the russian hydro lab ( pictured right ) a mock - up of the soyuz spacecraft used to take astronauts to the iss is pictured ms sarah brightman said her training lasts for 16 hours a day , starting at 6am , and this includes four hours of russian language classes
it also includes being thrown around inside a machine called a centrifuge at high speeds to adjust to the varying levels of g force the journey into space involves
this training is taking place at the star city in star city in moscow because the crew will travel to the iss on a russian soyuz capsule and need to know how to use it
group training : during the group training phase , cosmonauts focus on learning about the soyuz and iss crew training : the final crew training phase then covers detailed vehicle operations procedures , iss training , and english language

weightlessness environment training the hydro lab was set up in in 1980 and is designed to train cosmonauts in conditions of simulated weightlessness using water
the first centrifuge , called cf - 7 , was installed in 1973 and was designed to study the influence of spaceflight on the human body , reduce negative effects of acceleration , and test aeronautical and space engineering models

her training lasts for 16 hours a day , starting at 6am , and this includes four hours of russian language classes
it also includes being thrown around inside a machine called a centrifuge at high speeds to adjust to the varying levels of g force the journey into space involves
this is to help the three astronauts cope with the cramped conditions in the small capsule - like ship that will carry them to the space station
