nick clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories nick clegg last night issued a damning critique of the use of ancient laws to prosecute journalists pursuing public interest stories
the lib dem leader said prosecutors were â relying on 13th century laws â to put reporters on trial and condemned the lack of a defence for those â uncovering information in the interests of the public â
he is the most senior political figure to raise concerns about the multi-million pound police investigation into tabloid newspaper payments for information , which critics condemn as a â witch hunt â
operation elveden , which began in 2011 and has cost taxpayers more than Â£ 15million , has seen dawn raids , large numbers of arrests and lengthy bail periods for suspects
but of the 20 journalists whose cases have come before the courts only two have been convicted , and last week one of those , a sun journalist , was invited to lodge an appeal against his conviction
prosecutors have pursued the newspaper journalists and public sector workers using the ancient common law offence of misconduct in public office
speaking at his party âs campaign launch in abingdon , oxford , mr nick clegg told the daily mail the public interest defence was â just far too opaque in too many of our laws
he added : â the fact that prosecutors are relying on 13th century laws , that we do nât have an up - to - date definition of what a public interest defence is , shows the need for a proper review and a proper reform of the law in this area
