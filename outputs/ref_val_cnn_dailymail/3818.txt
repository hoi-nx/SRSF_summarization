ozil believes arsenal can beat monaco by three goals to reach the champions league quarter finals no club have ever overturned such a deficit , but the german says his team should take heart from recent form arsenal were in fine form to beat west ham on saturday , with giroud playing a part in all three goals ozil says the gunners can carry their momentum into the midweek tie and progress past monaco monaco beat nine - man bastia 3 - 0 in ligue 1 on friday night to extend their formidable defensive record with only seven goals conceded from the last 22 games

' we need to score three goals and monaco are a team that play defensively , but we have to take initiative and score the first goal as quickly as possible to boost our confidence
ozil and giroud cut a dejected figure while arsenal were being beaten at home by monaco last month the gunners will need to overturn a two - goal deficit against a team who rarely concede but ozil is confident that they have enough going forward , and can win if they seize the early initiative ' it is going to be difficult to score three times because they have defended well in the tournament so far , but if you look at our past matches and the way we played against manchester united ( in the fa cup quarter - final ) last week , i think there 's a chance we can still progress
' ozil added : ' we know the quality we have in our team - there are world - class players here
ozil was taken off early on saturday , along with alexis sanchez , to preserve them for midweek in monaco the german , who was out with injury for much of this season , has come back stronger and fitter than ever the 26 - year - old former real madrid midfielder feels he is benefiting from his new training regime
