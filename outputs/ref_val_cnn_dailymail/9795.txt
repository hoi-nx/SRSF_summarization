real madrid 's 4 - 3 loss to schalke has prompted further calls for change in the spanish capital
they progressed to the quarter - finals of the champions league thanks to a 2 - 0 win in the first leg , but tuesday night was supposed to be easy
most players have been criticised - cristiano ronaldo included - but perhaps most under - fire is casillas
mr real madrid , with over 500 appearances
real madrid goalkeeper casillas has come under heavy scrutiny after a series of poor performances united goalkeeper david de gea has been touted as the perfect replacement at real madrid three of schalke 's four goals could have been saved , they said
casillas needs to leave , they said
united 's david de gea has been touted as his possible replacement , and even sportsmail 's jamie carragher waded into the debate on tuesday night
but you get the feeling that real madrid would not be the same without casillas
at the end of the game on tuesday night , there was an endearing moment in which he refused to let his team - mates leave the pitch before thanking the real madrid fans
casillas would not let his team - mates leave the pitch on tuesday night before they thanked the supporters cristiano ronaldo was unhappy at his side 's performance , but was made to applaud the fans by casillas pointing and pulling , ushering his team - mates to the corners of the pitch to applaud the supporters
success is in real madrid 's nature , and their fans are n't happy with the amount of goals they are conceding
david de gea is a spain international and grew up in real madrid , playing for atletico before moving to united casillas has had a remarkable career , winning numerous trophies including the 2010 world cup but david de gea makes sense
