it was a case of â the young man and the sea â after a massive swordfish was caught by a 16 - year - old boy in tasmania that weighed over three times his bodyweight and which took him six hours to get into the boat
the amazing feat was pulled off by teenage fisherman kyle - who weighs just 70kg - when he caught the record - breaking 263.5kg broad - bill swordfish about 35km off tasmania âs east coast
what made the effort even more incredible was that the teenager caught the 263.5kg fish using just 24kg fishing line
i was pretty exhausted by then but once the fish was in the boat i just felt massive relief , ' kyle told daily mail australia ' then there was a huge amount of excitement
it took kyle ( left ) six hours to get the giant 263.5kg broad - bill swordfish into the boat kyle kept the fish and divided it up amongst his mates who helped him to eat it
apart from fishing kyle âs in his first year doing a school - based apprenticeship as an automotive mechanic
â the worst moment was when it got closer to the boat
' kyle battled with the huge fish despite feeling mentally and physically exhausted kyle was onboard his friend leo miler âs 7m boat leo miler while competing in the coles bay classic fishing competition last saturday when he made his memorable catch
leo miler explained that kyle had to stay patient and not rush into making any mistakes
kyle just had to be careful because the line was so much lighter than the weight of the fish , ' leo miler told daily mail australia
the 16 - year - old was able to catch the massive swordfish using only 24kg fishing line ' it jumped about 23 times to try and get rid of the hook , but we still were nât sure how big it was
