it is a stunning sunset - and heralds that for antarctica , winter really is coming
antarctica is moving from 24 - hour daylight to the 24 - hour darkness of winter
the centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff , depending on the time of year
as the south pole moves from 24 - hour daylight towards gradual darkness , the british antarctic survey research station on the brunt ice shelf witnesses this year âs first sunset over antarctica for the crew of the french â italian halley research station in antarctica , it means isolation is coming
called halley vi , it is made up of four - legged modules linked by enclosed walkways
the centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff , depending on the time of year
a vacuum drainage system keeps water consumption down , and the ski - clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres ( 13 feet ) above the level of the ice
the inside of the centre has been been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter , when temperatures at the base drop as low as -56c

the halley vi centre , a dismantlable research station created for the british antarctic survey by british architects hugh broughton , was nominated for the world architecture festival awards 2013 ask anybody how they feel and most will reply â fine â but , for mission controllers planning a complex spacewalk or spacecraft docking , having an objective second - opinion could be a lifesaver
a skeleton crew of up to 15 to keep the base running and fend for themselves for nine months
but thanks to its strikingly futuristic appearance , the halley vi centre has been causing quite a stir in architectural circles , and it has now been nominated for a prestigious global award
in a textbook example of form following function , british architect firm hugh broughton created the series of four - legged pods , seven of them blue and one red , which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up
the halley vi centre consists of series of four - legged pods which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow which builds up the dismantlable research station , which few fans of design will ever get to see unless they venture to the antarctica wilderness , is among the nominees for the world architecture festival awards 2013
halley vi is the sixth facility to occupy the site on the brunt ice shelf - a floating sheet of ice about 10 miles ( 16 kilometres ) from the edge of the south atlantic
most of the previous stations were crushed under the weight of the polar snow , while halley v had to be abandoned due to fears that the station would be lost if the ice sheet split apart , said survey spokesman paul seagrove
