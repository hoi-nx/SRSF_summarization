tomas rosicky had only been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he fired a deflected effort beyond howard in the everton goal tomas rosicky was left in acres of space and allowed time to take aim as he made sure the points were staying at the emirates tomas rosicky and olivier giroud , arsenal 's two goalscorers , celebrate the former 's strike in the dying minutes against visiting everton a strong display from gabriel against lukaku may have heralded new central defensive partnership - alongside laurent koscielny - for the gunners until at least the end of the season
