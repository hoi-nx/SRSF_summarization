' this taxpayer money was not spent securing our borders , it was not spent on national defense , and it was not spent contributing to a safety net for those in need , ' wisconsin republcian sen. johnson said during a senate hearing on monday
' these federal government programs were responsible for the biggest chunk of the $ 125 billion wasted on improper payments in 2014 : johnson chairs the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs committee , which held a hearing on reducing improper payments by improving death records maintained by the social security
social security has no death record for 6.5 million people who would be at least 112 years old , according to a report by the agency 's inspector general
only 13 of the people are still getting social security benefits , the report said
each year , the agency adds about 9,000 names to the death list of people who are still living , said brune , a senior adviser to the social security 's deputy commissioner for budget , finance , quality and management
' without a social security number , you can do nothing in the us , ' rivers said
they include programs to reduce fraud and abuse in medicare and medicaid , as well as budget increases at the irs to combat tax fraud
medicare 's payments to doctors and hospitals had the most improper payments , at $ 46 billion
the report said many were caused by insufficient documentation for home health claims and errors on medical necessity forms for hospital patients
the earned income tax credit provides payments to low - income families through the tax code
