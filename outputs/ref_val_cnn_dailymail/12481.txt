the next time someone accuses you of acting like a neanderthals , do n't be offended
" a new study published this month suggests neanderthals were more " cognitively advanced than we give them credit , " kansas university 's frayer said in a release
frayer , a professor emeritus of anthropology , was a part of the study published in the journal plos one that looks at eagle talons found in present - day croatian
the talons are among the thousands of human remains , animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by croatian scientist dragutin gorjanovic-kramberger
" the markings , including polishes and areas where the bones were " rubbed together , " show that the talons were " manipulated into a piece of jewelry , " frayer said
their research indicates neanderthals were more than just the cavemen - like characters depicted in geico commercials , but sophisticated creatures concerned with ornamentation and possibly even an " advanced level of prowess " in catching birds , according to frayer
