kane 's impact on friday night was extraordinary
what a delight it was to see a young english , who is leading the premier league scoring charts , come on and score for england within 79 seconds
like everyone at wembley , i left the ground with a smile on my face because of kane âs cameo appearance
on friday against lithuania he was facing a league one back four
to judge kane properly you need to see him over 10 international games â and probably 10 back - to - back games
kane ( left ) scored 79 seconds into his england debut against lithuania on friday kane wheels away to celebrate scoring for england against lithuania at wembley on friday kane 's incredible rise continued on friday when he marked his first england game with a goal what i will say is that from what i âve seen of him over the past 12 months , stepping up from under - 21 level to the tottenham first team , to the europa league and now to full international level , he has looked comfortable at every stage
on friday , when he came on , there was nothing to lose
rooney and daniel sturridge will both enjoy playing with him
i âve said before that we have nât had this range of attacking talent since i was the england manager and had to pick between alan , teddy , michael , ian wright , les ferdinand , robbie fowler and andrew cole
we âre not going to mess around any more with rooney playing out wide
but i can see rooney and kane playing up top together , with one dropping in behind at times
so we had to work at the system so that both of them would have little spells where they would be up top : michael because of his pace and alan because of his goal threat
i did nât want a 4 - 4 - 2 with two strikers playing square because , at international level , that âs food and drink to defenders
kane headed in england 's fourth against lithuania shortly after replacing rooney it has been queried how kane ( left ) would fit in a starting line - up alongside captain rooney kane and rooney in the same starting line - up could see formation turn to a 4 - 3 - 3 the attacking full backs , leighton baines and nathaniel clyne , would be able to provide width to the attack i think rooney and kane can do that , so that when we âre in possession it naturally changes into a 4 - 3 - 3 , with the wide men pushing high
and if they stay up square of each other , the two wide men can come back down and the full - backs can get overlaps on them
it also gives your wide player the opportunity to come inside and , although he ca nât play on tuesday , danny welbeck did that fantastically on friday , driving into the box
give kane a bit of time and there âs no reason to think he ca nât be an important part of that
it is not just kane who we have to be careful not to overpraise
we need to be realistic about this england team , too
roy hodgson is refusing to get carried away with the hype that is surrounding kane danny welbeck ( left ) produced a man - of - the - match display in england 's win against lithuania raheem sterling ( left ) scored his first england goal in the victory over lithuania on friday as the world cup demonstrated , if you âre a little bit short , two years of work can all be over in 180 minutes of football
and let âs see how well the full - backs stand up when they are put under pressure
phil jones ( left ) started alongside gary cahill in defence for england against lithuania danny welbeck ( second right ) celebrates england 's second goal with gary cahill and raheem sterling if england have less of the possession against italy on tuesday it would be probably be beneficial in the long term
let âs hope england are up to the olympic standard because we âre only going to find out next june .
