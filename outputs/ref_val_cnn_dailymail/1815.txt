cia director john brennan , in a speech in new york , said such communications only add to the difficulty of dealing with diffuse threats and attacks across the world from groups like islamic state , known also as isil , and others
' new technologies can help groups like isil coordinate operations , attract new recruits , disseminate propaganda , and inspire sympathizers across the globe to act in their name , ' john brennan said , using an acronym for the militant group that has taken hold in syria and iraq
and while agencies such as the cia have worked to boost their capability of fighting cyber-based threats , those bent on committing acts of terror have also improved their use of technologies , he added
