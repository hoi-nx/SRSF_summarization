you do realise you 've walked into the best windsurfing centre in the world ? ' announces our instructor , sam , at the beginning of our first lesson at club vassiliki
while these surfer dudes tend to lean towards hyper - enthusiasm ( everything is ' totally awesome ' or ' epic ' ) , i think he may be right on this one
we can sense it the second we arrive at this windsurfing hotspot on the southern end of lefkada island in greek
our welcoming committee of caramel - coloured instructors eye up the new arrivals through their ray-bans
staying on her feet ( for now ) : francesca gets to grips with the art of wind - surfing in sunny lefkada when my friend and i wander down to the beach , we see an exhilarating display of one hundred windsurfers skimming across the water like dragonflies
how hard can it be ? everyone at club vass - a hotel and windsurf school - has the same obsession
thanks to its position in a thumb - shaped inlet , enclosed on three sides by mountains , this watery playground has its own weather system , which runs like clockwork during the summer
by early afternoon , the heat pressure behind the western mountain has built up so the wind whooshes down into the bay
there are numerous watersports centres along vassiliki beach , but club vass , which has been here since 1987 , is the place to be
i feel like a new - born foal trying out my legs for the first time
mornings begin with greek yogurt and honey before our lesson at 10.30am
stroll along the beach to vassiliki town for a competitive line - up of seaside tavernas offering tzatziki , fried courgette and giant meaty skewers , or nip eastwards to the pretty bay of sivota where we gorge on fresh fish and watch yachts bobbing
a seven - night stay at club vass ( 0844 463 0191 , www.clubvass.com ) costs from Â£ 599 per person , including flights from gatwick , transfers , windsurfing tuition , mountain biking and stand - up - paddle boarding .
