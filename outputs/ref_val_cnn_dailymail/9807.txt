mullins has described his historic achievement of having the first three home in the hurdle as his greatest ever training achievement
but the feat of the ruby walsh - ridden 4 - 5 favourite faugheen leading home stablemates arctic fire and dual champion hurricane fly will take some surpassing even for a man who has won a grand national
a jubilant ruby walsh enters the winners enclosure on board the champions hurdle winner faugheen it is the most outstanding feat since michael dickinson trained the first five in the 1983 gold cup
â and it is even more remarkable given what else mullins managed on the first day of the cheltenham festival with three other winners â douvan ( 2 - 1 favourite ) beating stablemate shaneshill in the supreme â hurdle , un de sceaux ( 4 - 6 ) in the arkle challenge trophy and paul townend - ridden glens melody ( 6 - 1 ) in the olbg mares â hurdle
ruby walsh - ridden annie power , 1 - 2 favourite and the horse mullins had regarded as his certainty of the day , was clear at the last in the mares â hurdle when taking a crashing fall
ruby walsh celebrates on faugheen after the seven - yeatr - old won the champion hurdle challenge trophy mullins said : â annie power got a horrible fall and she will have a sore neck and shoulder in the morning but she will be ok
faugheen was imperious as he led home a mullins - trained one - two - three at the cheltenham festival douvan , like faugheen owned by former barclays investment banker rich ricci , had been decribed as one of the best mullins had brought to the cheltenham festival
and there was faugheen , the horse who has developed from an ugly duckling into a fully - fledged hurdling swan unbeaten in nine races
after he had made the running before sprinting clear off the home turn , mullins revealed ruby walsh had formulated the battle plan months ago , even though he had only confirmed he would ride the seven - year - old on saturday
ruby walsh glides over the fence on his way to winning the champions hurdle at cheltenham festival 2015 mullins said : â i did nât think he would win that impressively
but he still has somewhere to go to usurp dual champion hurricane fly in mullins â affections
