pregnant donna lever , her boyfriend johnson and their four children , aged between seven months and seven , were sent to stay at the hill view hotel in blackburn , lancashire , after a fire devastated their home

donna lever and johnson , pictured with children eva , seven months , dominic , one , and charles , two , say toddler charles discovered a nine - inch meat cleaver stuffed into the side of a bed in their hotel room the family say they reported their find to a member of hotel staff , and to rossendale council , which had placed them in the hotel
but the hotel manager , hussain , refutes the claims - and has accused the family of damaging a bed , which they deny
miss donna lever , 38 , and her family were moved into the temporary accommodation after the fire , thought to have been sparked by a faulty tumble dryer , tore through their housing association property in bacup
the family said they had been out when the fire started on wednesday last week , and because their home was so badly damaged they were told by rossendale council that they must go into temporary accommodation at the hotel
the family say charles discovered this meat cleaver inside a rip in the side of the bed when the family attempted to move the piece of furniture miss donna lever and mr johnson , 32 , who are both jobless , and the children - mylo , seven , charles , two , dominic , one , and eva , seven months - had been due to stay at the hotel for two nights , but say they left after just one having discovered the cleaver , and returned home
' now we âre back in the smoke - damaged house , despite the fact the fire service told us it was nât safe for me to be there while i âm pregnant
hussain , manager of the hill view hotel in blackburn ( pictured ) , refutes the claims - and has accused the family of damaging a bed , which they deny mr johnson , who took a photograph of the cleaver on his mobile phone , said he believes it was left by a previous guest
speaking of the moment his son found the knife he said : ' he had his hand underneath the bed and he pulled something shiny out
' the couple and their children are now sleeping on the kitchen and living room floors of their damaged house
but mr hussain says the room had been ' inspected thoroughly ' before the family arrived and no concerns were reported to him during their time at the hotel
he later contacted the police to claim a bed had been damaged by the family , and has also accused them of littering the room with cans - which , like the criminal damage allegation , they strongly deny
miss donna lever , 38 , and her family were moved into the temporary accommodation after the fire , thought to have been sparked by a faulty tumble dryer , tore through their rented house in bacup ' i find it insulting as all i 'm trying to do is put a roof over my kids ' heads
' mr hussain also refutes the family 's claim that the room was untidy and said the cleaver was not spotted during his staff âs prior checks
' the council was only made aware of the meat cleaver find once the family had left the accommodation , after one night and returned to their home
