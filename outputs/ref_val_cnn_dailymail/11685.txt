real madrid and barca have two of the most talented , and expensively assembled , teams in world football
but who would make a combined xi out of the two squads based , not on reputation , but on current form ? allow me to get ahead of the fury of the comments section
cristiano ronaldo may be the world player of the year , but on current form he does n't make combined xi our combined xi , which has no place for cristiano ronaldo , but does feature some of the world 's best players cristiano ronaldo has n't scored a league goal from open play in a month , and bale is preferred on the wing did cristiano ronaldo have a brilliant first four months of the season ? of course he did ? might he score the winner on sunday ? quite possibly
portuguese centre back pepe has been in excellent form in recent weeks , holding the real madrid defence together sergio ramos ( left ) has returned to fitness , and should start on sunday , but pepe just pips him in our team left back - jordi alba a very close call between jordi alba and marcelo
jordi alba proved against jesus navas that he is the fastest full back in the world , and he makes the xi real madrid 's left back marcelo has improved his game , and offers plenty going forward , but just misses out right midfield - ivan rakitic scored against manchester city and in the league against granada two weeks before
the injury to sergio busquets has allowed mascherano ( left ) to prove again that he is the world 's best left midfield - isco he is not the complete midfielder that many real madrid supporters seem to believe he is but all the same he is in very special form at the moment and in this team he can play alongside messi , who famously has a dog named after
isco is in a rich vein of form for the european champions recently , and can thrive in a number of positions right forward - messi does there need to be an explanation here ? messi mesmorised manchester city in midweek with a performance for the ages at the nou camp messi is currently the best player in the world , on form , and possibly even the greatest of all time centre - forward - suarez selecting between suarez and karim benzema was one of the toughest choices but in this combined super-team you have messi dropping into midfield so the battering ram that is suarez gets in ahead of him
suarez just edges in ahead of karim benzema to allow for his combination with messi up front left forward - bale it has to be bale or cristiano ronaldo or neymar so what can you do ? neymar and cristiano ronaldo both went off in a huff in their last league games , bale scored twice to silence some of the disproportionate criticism he has been on the end off
put bale back on the left where he can whip the ball on his favoured foot or just do as he did last season against barca in the copa del rey final and power so far in front of his marker that he can still cut inside and shoot
there is also only one player who has scored with a direct free - kick for real madrid this season ... and it is nât ronaldo it âs bale
total : barca 8 real madrid 3 bale gets in ahead of cristiano ronaldo after his two goals , complete with great celebration , against levante bale can have a real impact if he is moved back to the left hand side , and starts up front in our team
