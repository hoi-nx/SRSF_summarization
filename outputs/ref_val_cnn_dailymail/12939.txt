london it might sound like a really old wives ' tale , but a thousand - year - old anglo-saxon potion for eye infections may hold the key to wiping out the modern - day superbug mrsa , according to new research
the 10th - century " eyesalve " remedy was discovered at the british library in a leather - bound volume of bald 's leechbook , widely considered to be one of the earliest known medical textbooks
christina lee , an expert on anglo-saxon society from the school of english at the university of nottingham , translated the ancient manuscript despite some ambiguities in the text
" we chose this recipe in bald 's leechbook because it contains ingredients such as garlic that are currently investigated by other researchers on their potential antibiotic effectiveness , " lee said in a video posted on the university 's website
the recipe calls for two species of allium ( garlic and onion or leek ) , wine and oxgall ( bile from a cow 's stomach ) to be brewed in a brass vessel
the book included an instruction for the recipe to be left to stand for nine days before being strained through a cloth
efforts to replicate the recipe exactly included finding wine from a vineyard known to have existed in the ninth century , according to diggle , an associate professor of sociomicrobiology , who also worked on the project
the researchers then tested their recipe on cultures of mrsa , methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus , a type of staph bacterium that does not respond to commonly used antibiotic treatments
the team says it now has good , replicated data showing that the medicine kills up to 90 % of mrsa bacteria in " in vivo " wound biopsies from mice
harrison says the researchers are still not completely sure how it works , but they have a few ideas -- namely , that there might be several active components in the mixture that work to attack the bacterial cells on different fronts , making it very hard for them to resist ; or that by combining the ingredients and leaving them to steep in alcohol , a new , more potent bacteria - fighting molecule is created in the process
