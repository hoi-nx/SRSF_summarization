gareth bale has told his wales colleagues he wants to stay at madrid for at least one more season
but chelsea are poised to move in
indeed , the madrid hierarchy are ready to accept gareth bale 's Â£ 75m buy - out clause back to a premier league club in order to refurbish their team and keep cristiano ronaldo
gareth bale wants to stay at madrid but chelsea are poised to move for the wales international man united would love to re-sign cristiano ronaldo from madrid but have other transfer priorities borussia dortmund defender mats hummels and juventus star paul pogba are targets for man united it could then be that gareth bale becomes a battle between chelsea and manchester city with the blues in pole position given ffp rules
arsenal , meanwhile , aspire to sign germany international marco reus but madrid are likely to win that battle
arsenal are keen to sign borussia dortmund 's marco reus but madrid are likely to capture the winger sam allaradyce could become the new republic of ireland manager next season
if it goes the wrong way then sam allardyce - on his way out of west ham - has been identified as a potential new man , football grapevine has been told
west ham manager sam allardyce could replace martin o'neill as republic of ireland boss next season i am hearing while west ham have cooled on the idea of signing alex song , currently on loan from barcelona , on a permanent basis , they are keen to buy carl jenkinson from arsenal when his loan term expires in the summer
arsenal , though , could play hard ball over the fee , wanting perhaps in excess of Â£ 10 million
west ham have cooled on signing alex song but are keen to purchase carl jenkinson from arsenal i am also hearing liverpool still believe they will sign danny ings from burnley on a bosman transfer this summer
but danny ings , who has attracted interest at real sociedad , also has options with bundesliga clubs borussia monchengladbach and borussia dortmund
liverpool believe they will sign burnley 's danny ings but the striker is also wanted by borussia dortmund i was in the company of frank lampard snr ( father of ex-chelsea star frank lampard - now of manchester city but very soon to be new york city ) last week at langan 's restaurant in london âs mayfair for a pre-launch of bobby moore : the documentary
' frank lampard snr ( second left ) revealed bobby moore ( right ) was the guv'nor but he could n't dance isay there were many people , including ex-pro pundits , who somehow thought gerrard received an easy ride from the media for his red card against man united last week for a stamp on ander herrera compared to chelsea striker costa , who was also given a retrospective ban for a similar incident earlier this season
some went as far to suggest it was more evidence of a conspiracy against chelsea
gerrard is shown red for a stamp on ander herrera during liverpool 's 2 - 1 defeat by man united but it 's true that in general , gerrard did receive far less of a ' coating ' for his nasty act than costa
many people believe gerrard received an easy ride compared to chelsea attacker costa costa was handed a retrospective ban after stamping on liverpool midfielder emre can at stamford bridge btw as soon as harry kane began celebrating his debut england goal after his hurricane entry into international football , the tv cameras flashed to the vip box and caught fa chairman dyke beaming with a smug grin then turning to someone in the row behind
it took a season or so for john terry to find his feet at chelsea back in the day
one wonders though , would jose mourinho have the patience with a 19 - year - old john terry ? john terry took a season to find his feet at chelsea and has made over 650 appearances for the blues take west ham - they have taken 33 - year - old brazilian nene , who is effectively past it , for the rest of the season on a free transfer to plug a gap rather than recall promising 20 - year - old forward elliot lee from his spell at luton
but sam allardyce does not have a good track record for bringing young players through
west ham signed 33 - year - old nene ( left ) on a free transfer rather than blooding the club 's youngsters those premier league owners who object to dyke 's plan should take a step back and consider it could make economic sense for them and not just boost the pool for the national team
the way he 's going it 's hurtling towards Â£ 50 million
one of england 's best displays against italy was the 0 - 0 draw they achieved in rome in 1997 to qualify for the world cup
