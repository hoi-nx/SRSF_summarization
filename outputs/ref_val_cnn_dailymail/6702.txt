all that separates premier league leaders chelsea and third - placed arsenal , two sides who , up until the last couple of months , were deemed to be having wildly contrasting seasons
arsenal 's players celebrate after mathieu flamini 's goal in their 3 - 0 win against west ham on saturday chelsea captain john terry looks dejected after his side 's 1 - 1 draw with southampton on sunday hull ( away ) - march 22 stoke ( home ) - april 4 qpr ( away ) - april 12 united ( home ) - april 18 arsenal ( away ) - april 26 leicester ( away ) - april 29 crystal palace ( home ) - may 2 liverpool ( home ) - may 9 west brom ( away ) - may 16 sunderland ( home ) - may 24 newcastle ( away ) - march 21 liverpool ( home ) - april 4 burnley ( away ) - april 11 sunderland ( home ) april 18 * postponed chelsea ( home ) - april 26 hull ( away ) - may 2 swansea ( home ) - may 9 united ( away ) - may 16 west brom ( home ) - may 24 * due to fa cup that leaves arsene wenger 's side as the biggest threat to chelsea , something which seemed almost unthinkable come the final hours of new year 's day
arsenal overcame a 12 - point deficit to beat united to the premier league table in may 1998 the gunners secured the 1997 - 98 title with a 4 - 0 win over everton at highbury , lifting the title that day arsenal still not in title race - arsene wenger one league defeat - albeit to north london rivals tottenham - is the only blot on their record since that forgettable day at st mary 's , while a return of 24 points from a possible 27 is the best in the division
and that run , combined with chelsea 's lacklustre 1 - 1 draw with southampton on sunday , left jose mourinho admitting that the north londoners can be considered title challengers
the only defeat in arsenal 's last nine league games came against tottenham ; they 've won the other eight jose mourinho ( right ) has a lot of history with arsene wenger , and he still believes arsenal have a chance ' both manchester city and arsenal are in the title race
arsenal trained on monday in preparation for their champions league game against monaco on tuesday arsenal lost the first leg 3 - 1 , and will be focused solely on the premier league if they get knocked out the gunners were 12 points behind united and had three games in hand with a little over two months of the season remaining but went on a magnificent 10 - match winning run to wrap up the title with two games to spare
as well as having an opportunity to claw back three points against the leaders at the emirates on april 26 , they also have games against struggling newcastle , burnley , hull and sunderland to look forward to
ian wright ( left ) plants a kiss on the cheek of arsenal captain tony adams after winning the 97 - 98 title marc overmars scored twice against everton to help arsenal to the title in 98 ... but can they do it this season ? a home clash with in - form liverpool next month and a trip to united in the season 's penultimate fixture will be tough , although last week 's fa cup win at old trafford should fill arsene wenger 's squad with confidence
chelsea also have some games they will relish but the visits of united and liverpool to stamford bridge at least offer potential for jose mourinho 's men to drop points
it will need to be some slip - up for arsenal to take advantage like they did 17 years ago but arsene wenger 's men - who could well be free of champions league football this week - should not be discounted
