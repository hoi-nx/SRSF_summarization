the maker of a controversial documentary about rape in india , udwin , told cnn she is shocked by the india authorities ' move to ban the film without even having seen it
the storm over " india 's daughter " blew up out of nowhere and is " based on nothing , " udwin said , in an interview for cnn 's " the world right now with hala gorani
" " the tragedy here is it 's a missed opportunity for india to actually show by embracing the film ... to show the world that india is as concerned as the rest of the world is to put gender inequality on the agenda , " she said
the bbc documentary featured an interview with one of the men convicted in an infamous 2012 gang rape case in new delhi that sparked massive outrage and protests in india
an india court restricted the publication and airing of the film in india as well as the dissemination of excerpts from it after comments by singh , the interviewed convict , were released in several media outlets
singh appeared to show no remorse and blamed the rape victim for being out at night , according to the documentary
it was , in fact , the street protests , not the brutality of the crime , that first inspired udwin to make the film
but all singh says about how he , and the other men convicted over the rape , have been treated is to ask why such a fuss is being made about them when " everybody 's doing it , " udwin said
at the heart of the matter , she said , is the issue of gender inequality
from birth , boys in india and many other countries are accorded a higher status than girls , so it 's unsurprising that they go on to treat women as lesser beings
she compares gender inequality to a cancerous tumor that shows its spread through offenses against women
the dead girl 's father , who is also interviewed in the film , explained that in order to send his daughter to medical college , he sold a piece of ancestral land -- a big deal in india , udwin said
why is nobody saying to me , ' how dare you put that comment in the documentary ' ? " in a statement , india 's home minister said the documentary crew violated the conditions granting the jail interview , which stipulated that the authorities be shown all unedited footage
" udwin also speaks out for the " massive swaths of india people who are so forward looking , who are so embracing of change and are agents of that change
" and she stresses that the issues of gender inequality and sexual violence against women are not confined to india
the film ends with a series of statistics on sexual violence from other countries , she said , including the united states and united kingdom
