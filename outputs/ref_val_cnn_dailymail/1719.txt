the adoptive parents of a teenager missing from her home for years have received prison sentences from a federal judge who also scolded them for the girl 's treatment
u.s. district court judge thomas schroeder in winston-salem , north carolina , on friday sentenced casey parsons to 10 years in prison for tax fraud
her husband , sandy , received an eight - year sentence
erica , the couple 's niece , lived with the family until she disappeared in 2011 at age 13
she was n't reported missing until 2013 when her 20 - year - old adoptive brother informed authorities of his sister 's absence after getting into a fight with his parents
her husband , sandy , received an eight - year sentence schroeder said that , after sentencing more than 1,000 people , he has never been more troubled by a case
the parsons continue to claim that they sent erica to live with her ' nan ' , though the girl 's biological mother says no such grandparent exists
the missing teen 's biological mother carolyn spoke out against the couple 's claims , saying she will not give up looking for her daughter , who is now 15
