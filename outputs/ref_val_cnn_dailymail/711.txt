bayern legend beckenbauer has raised concerns over the poor discipline of franck ribery and jerome boateng
winger ribery was criticised recently by bayern head coach guardiola for his tendency to react angrily to on - field provocations , and beckenbauer is worried that a failure to control his temper could end up costing his team
the spaniard 's deal at the allianz arena is set to expire next year and beckenbauer spoke only in glowing terms of the man who delivered four trophies in his debut season in charge of the club , lifting the bundesliga and german cup domestically as well as the uefa super cup and fifa world club cup
beckenbauer said , ' guardiola does not need a contract
' guardiola 's impressive cv , which also features three la liga and two champions league titles from his time with barcelona , means that should he opt to leave bayern , he will have no shortage of suitors
