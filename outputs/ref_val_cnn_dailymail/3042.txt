this is the dramatic moment passengers on board a united airlines flight tackled a young man to the ground after he shouted ' jihad , jihad ' and threatened to hijack the aircraft
shocking video emerged online showing a young man with a bloodied face being pinned to the floor of the boeing 737 by several passengers while frantically apologising and shouting in apparent fear as a police officer identifies himself and says he will be removed from the plane
video of the young man being subdued was later posted on reddit , where some individuals claimed to have been among the 33 passengers and six crew on board the denver - bound plane
footage on the incident shows a brown - haired man in his 20s or early 30s on the floor of the aircraft with several cuts and bruises on his face
during the clip , which is understood to have been taken after the plane had safely landed , a police officer attempts to calm the man down while he frantically shouts and apologises
flight 1074 had been scheduled to depart dulles at 10.30pm local time , suggesting it had not been in the air for very long by the time the incident occured
