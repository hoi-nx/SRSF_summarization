the city , which sits in tornado alley and sees a large number of the tower 's namesake weather events , has been looking for a building to rejuvenate an area that currently holds a part - time garage
kinslow , keith and todd inc , an architecture firm based in tulsa , was approached by a local magazine to come up with an idea , and has now unveiled the concept for the tornado tower , which would hold a severe weather museum and research center
mr kinslow said that the garden floors were designed to look like tree debris being carried away by the twister
the building 's similarities to its real - life counterpart also include led lights on the outside that would be spaced to give drivers on a nearby highway the illusion that the structure was spinning
the funnel cloud building would hold a weather museum , multiples gardens , a revolving restaurant and a research center while the design of the building may make it look likely to be blown over in the famously strong oklahoma winds , its creators say the structure would be stable
architects say office space could be easily added and classrooms in its base could help teach visitors about weather safety
it would be located near the bok center ( left ) , a 19,000 - seat arena tornado tower would be visible from most of the downtown tulsa area , and the architect said his team was looking to make ' an elegant looking building '
kinslow said that discussions have also been had about moving the prospective building to a different area with more ground space
the weather museum and research center would add another skyscraper to the tulsa skyline if it is built near the bok center ( right )
