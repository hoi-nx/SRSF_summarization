the delphina valle dell'erica resort in sardinia is huge
even the name is on the big side and when i looked at its website i had misgivings , not least because i have stayed in so many unwieldy hotels around the world that i always long for something small and personal
i had visions of elbowing fellow holidaymakers at the breakfast buffet and setting the alarm to grab a sun lounger that might actually face the sun. mum 's the word : jodie and her son indio enjoyed their first trip to sardinia what 's more , this was to be an important holiday for my three - year - old son , indio , and neither of us had been to this italy island before
but , from the moment we set foot in the 28 - hectare resort near santa teresa gallura , i realised my worries were entirely misplaced
yes , it is big - in fact it is really two hotels joined together - but it never felt big and there were days when we hardly saw a soul
there were children 's areas , adults - only areas , family areas and ones where no one seemed to go at all
on a couple of occasions i arranged for a babysitter for indio and , believe me , i am not a mother who readily leaves her child with a total stranger
but i trusted them completely and indio seemed to look forward to their arrival
there were very few british people staying - and lots of italy
i took that as a good sign because italy love children
come to think of it , food , wine and sunshine rate high on my own list of priorities â especially food , after masterchef , where to my astonishment i reached the final
one day , i dropped indio off at the kids ' club and booked in for a day of windsurfing and kitesurfing
but i had never attempted kite - surfing
kite - surfing is great fun once you get the hang of it - and you need a good teacher
we went exploring around the north point and then visited the island of santa maria maddalena
actually , i think indio and i both felt ready to conquer something or other after our a week at delphina
