london british prime minister david cameron formally asked queen to dissolve his country 's parliament on monday , opening the way for campaigning ahead of the may 7 general election
the procedural step means there are officially no members of parliament until it reconvenes on may 18 for the swearing - in of members and the official state opening of parliament on may 27
addressing media outside the official prime ministerial residence at 10 downing st. , david cameron said that british had been " on the brink " when he came into office
" the next prime minister walking through that door will be me or ( labour leader ) miliband , " he said
" you can choose an economy that grows , that creates jobs , that generates the money to ensure a properly funded and improving nhs ( national health service ) ... and a government that will cut taxes for 30 million hard - working people ... or you can choose the economic chaos of miliband 's british , " david cameron said
this election is about moving forward -- and as prime minister here at no. 10 that 's what i will deliver
for five years , david cameron has been governing in coalition with the british 's third party , the clegg
clegg , clegg leader and deputy prime minister , has mostly backed david cameron in parliamentary debates against labour 's miliband
" the right - wing british independence party , or ukip , which has pledged to take the british out of the eu , has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of david cameron 's conservatives
last year , in a backlash against the eu , ukip caused a political earthquake and won elections to the parliament in british , and some commentators have likened its impact on british politics to that of the tea party in the united states
it is unclear how ukip will perform in the may 7 british general election
" by holding the balance of power in a hung parliament , snp mps can work with others to lock david cameron out of downing street -- and ensure that scotland 's priorities become priorities at westminster , " she said
