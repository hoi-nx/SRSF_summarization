during the three years that i was serving as a member of tunisia 's constituent assembly , i would frequently walk to work through the gate of the bardo museum so i could get a glimpse of the mosaics , and perhaps enjoy the adjoining herb garden
the museum , in downtown tunis , serves not only as a physical reminder of tunisia 's roman , jewish , christian and islamic heritage , but is also connected to the tunisia parliament
more than two dozen people were killed as gunmen armed with kalashnikovs opened fire , sending men , women and children scrambling through the lion gate to escape
however , the attack followed the release of videos purportedly from the isis threatening tunisia
meanwhile , individuals associated with the banned tunisia organization ansar al-sharia declared allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi
have salafi terrorists moved beyond their usual guerrilla - style operations to suicidal attacks outside iraq and syria ? if they have , then our political leaders -- who have already been vocal about their commitment to combating terrorism , and have been collaborating with turkey to prevent tunisia entering syria -- will need to redouble their efforts
the threat posed by terrorism to tunisia citizens and our guests ca n't be downplayed , much less ignored
however , the reality is that a comprehensive strategy is still wanting , a point made in a recent report published by the tunisian institute for strategic studies , tunisia 's foremost think tank on political , economic and environmental matters
indeed , the institute , which has tracked the upsurge in salafi jihadi recruitment in tunisia based on fieldwork and interviews with tunisia jihadists , has documented how the phenomenon has largely unfolded outside the media 's view
with this in mind , it is clear that the tunisia state has done a poor job of " recruiting " its citizens into the fold , which has left space for terrorists to make a pitch for young tunisia who feel alienated and who have lost hope
