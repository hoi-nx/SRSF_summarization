it 's the biggest week of the year for chocolate sales , eclipsing demand at christmas and even valentine 's day
and just in time for easter , one of the world 's foremost food scientists - bernard lahousse - has explained why easter eggs taste so good
according to mr bernard lahousse , it 's all down to smell of chocolate which , when presented in easter egg form , is enhanced
happy memories associated with easter firmly anchor positive feelings towards chocolate eggs mr bernard lahousse told femail : ' the smaller the chocolate layer is , the easier the chocolate will melt
' so that is the advantage of easter egg ; they melt easily and the aromas of the chocolate come into your nose quite fast
' there are a number of reasons why chocolate tastes so good - and like mr bernard lahousse explained - the majority of them have to do with the way chocolate smells
' chocolate contains a lot of different aroma molecules , ' he said
and it 's not just the smell of chocolate that makes it so appealing
' there are a lot of taste components contained within chocolate , ' mr bernard lahousse continued
so what happens to us when we eat chocolate ? why does it make us feel so good , so content ... so happy ? the small chocolate layers in an egg means we get an intense whiff of chocolate when we first bite into it ' chocolate contains a molecule called phenylethylamine , which chocolate is loaded with , ' the scientist continued
' pairing chocolate with extra ingredients will enhance the feeling , ' mr bernard lahousse said
' and finally it all goes down to pleasurable memories and the way your egg is presented to you
' if you do n't have the time to make chocolate from scratch , you can simply melt down any chocolate bar you have to make your own eggs
