it 's time for leaders in israel and the us to call off their war of insults before they cause serious , lasting damage
heading into prime minister netanyahu 's address on tuesday to a joint session of congress , both sides should immediately agree to a cease fire
the speech itself is a terrible mistake
blame for the deterioration in relations is shared here in us as well as in israel
the obama team also accuses netanyahu of timing his congress speech to rally israel voters behind him in elections two weeks away -- netanyahu as churchill standing up to the nazis -- while netanyahu 's team is convinced obama is desperate for a deal to burnish his legacy -- the nobel laureate who brought peace
the netanyahu government believes the agreement which obama appears ready to accept will let iran eventually wriggle free and build a bomb
but what is alarming not only to israel but to other us friends in the region -- and rightly so -- is that the us and its partners in the negotiation with iran ( russia , china , the uk , france , germany ) have made repeated concessions to get an iran signature without getting major concessions in return
consider : the us and israel started down the negotiating path saying publicly that iran must totally dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of punishing economic sanctions against teheran
leaks since then have shown that in pursuit of a deal , the us is now willing to accept more and more centrifuges in iran -- 6,500 by latest count
in times past , us and israel leaders have sometimes had bad blood and still made substantive progress
despite sometimes bitter words during israel 's recent dust - up with hamas -- especially directed by israel against secretary kerry -- obama ensured that israel was well supplied militarily , particularly with the iron dome missile defense system that saved countless israel lives
israel should remember that us is its best friend in a world where anti-semitism is once again raising its hideous head
the us should appreciate that for israel , a nuclear iran could pose instant annihilation
this is a moment that demands that leaders in both israel and the us lower their voices , take their differences indoors and begin restoring broken bonds of trust
dennis ross , for example , argues that if the us could greatly strengthen an inspections regime -- a much bigger team who could go anywhere , any time in iran -- and could enshrine in legislation that iran violations will bring military action , that would go a long way toward allaying opposition fears
martin indyk proposes that , drawing upon ideas embraced by president clinton in middle east negotiations 15 years ago , the us could enter a formal treaty with israel , voted upon by congress , that would provide a us " nuclear guarantee " to israel in event of an iran breakout
secretary kerry seemed to be pointing in that direction sunday when he said netanyahu is welcome to speak in the us on tuesday
