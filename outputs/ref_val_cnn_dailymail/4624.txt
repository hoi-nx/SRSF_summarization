the three main contenders - chelsea âs diego costa on 19 , tottenham hotspur âs harry kane on 19 and manchester city âs sergio aguero on 17 - are all in with a chance of winning it
will it go down to form ? will it be rocked by injury and suspension ? will it have the fairytale conclusion that so many would love to see ? sportsmail takes a look at the runners and riders in the race for the golden boot ... the race for the golden boot seems to be between harry kane ( left ) , diego costa ( centre ) and sergio aguero left foot : 5 right foot : 10 head : 4 minutes per goal : 98.26 harry kane , tottenham hotspur can harry kane âs whirlwind season continue right until the end or will it run out of air ? his hat - trick against leicester city in tottenham hotspur âs last league match just goes to show how quickly the goalscorers chart can change as he leapt to catch diego costa within the space of 90 minutes
tottenham hotspur 's harry kane was 500/1 to be the golden boot 's top goalscorer at the start of the season burnley ( a ) ( scored 1 goal against ) aston villa ( h ) 1 united ( a ) 1 southampton ( a ) manchester city ( h ) stoke ( a ) hull city ( a ) 1 everton ( a ) record against remaining teams : scored against 4/8 ( four goals total ) this zonal map shows where harry kane scored his 19 goals this season for tottenham hotspur in the golden boot this pitch view map shows where harry kane scored his goals from around the 18 - yard box for tottenham hotspur left foot : 5 right foot : 11 head : 3 minutes per goal : 102.42 diego costa , chelsea the snarling , street - fighting chelsea striker is joint - top of the goalscorers chart , but has played fewer games to reach his total goals tally and has one more to play than his two main rivals
chelsea also have a tougher run - in than tottenham hotspur and manchester city
chelsea striker diego costa is among the best signings of the season and has 19 goals in the golden boot stoke ( h ) qpr ( a ) manchester united ( h ) arsenal ( a ) ( scored 1 goal against ) leicester city ( a ) 1 crystal palace ( h ) liverpool ( h ) 1 west bromwich albion ( a ) 1 sunderland ( h ) record against remaining teams : scored against 4/9 ( four goals total ) this zonal map shows where diego costa scored his 19 goals this season for chelsea in the golden boot this pitch view map shows where diego costa scored his goals from around the 18 - yard box for chelsea left foot : 4 right foot : 13 head : 0 minutes per goal : 107.53 sergio aguero , manchester city he is the rank - outsider , but one who you would bet against at your peril
sergio aguero is trailing the other two by two goals , but he has scored four in one game this season , against tottenham hotspur who he will face again in manchester city âs remaining eight games
he has already scored eight times against the last eight teams manchester city have to face - the same amount as diego costa and harry kane âs record put together in their last fixtures of the season
manchester city striker sergio aguero has 17 goals and is just two behind the leading golden boot goalscorers crystal palace ( a ) manchester united ( a ) ( scored 1 goal against ) west ham ( h ) aston villa ( h ) 1 tottenham hotspur ( a ) 4 qpr ( h ) 2 swansea city ( a ) southampton ( h ) record against remaining teams : scored against 4/8 ( eight goals total ) this zonal map shows where sergio aguero scored his 19 goals this season for manchester city in the golden boot this pitch view map shows where sergio aguero scored his goals from around the 18 - yard box for manchester city my golden boot guestimate â¦ this is , obviously , no exact science
but then sergio aguero has not scored in five games , diego costa has two in last two and harry kane six in his last four
my heart says harry kane , but my head goes with diego costa , so i choose the chelsea man
