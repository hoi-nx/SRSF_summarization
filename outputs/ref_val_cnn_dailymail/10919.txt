now , a robot modelled on a four - year - old child , has been developed with a â sense of self â
it was originally created by the italian institute of technology as part of the efaa project and over the years , it âs been refined to be able to crawl , walk and dance to music , manipulate objects in its hands , speak and express emotions
it 's latest iteration is more human - like than ever
a video posted by new scientist shows it playing a game of paddle war â a simple game where two players each hold a paddle - or in this case a cylinder - and try to score goals using a digital ball , while stopping their rival from scoring
a video shows icub playing a game of paddle war ( pictured ) â a game where two players each hold a paddle and try to score goals using a digital ball , while stopping their rival from scoring - but the robot is a sore loser ! the robot âs goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately to whether it is winning or losing
when icub concedes a goal , it frowns and furrows its light - up eyebrows , sometimes swearing like an ill - tempered human
the robot âs goals and emotions change constantly , based on information picked up by sensors and it reacts appropriately
a stock image is shown the robot laughs , or says â ha ha â when the ball ricochets off the side of the screen , but is seemingly a bad loser
â that is nât fair , i should be stronger at video games ! â it says , after losing the game
the video also shows how the robot can respond to being touched , a little bit like a slightly creepy human
when a human strokes its arms it affects icub âs reactions and emotions and the robot says on one occasion in the video : â i like when you touch me this way '
tweaks to its software also mean that the robot is starting to understand language and can follow instructions that require reasoning , such as identifying two objects and moving them to a position , as instructed
