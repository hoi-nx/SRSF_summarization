this was an afternoon for nostalgia , a chance for liverpudlians to embrace the past and pay homage to some returning heroes and they grabbed their chance when suarez and torres took to the field for this all - star charity match , between teams captained by gerrard and carragher

manager : roy evans attendance : 44,903 torres , who was sold to chelsea for Â£ 50million two days after suarez joined liverpool in january 2011 , had admitted to being unsure what kind of reception he would receive , given the circumstances in which he had left
the upshot , of course , was the brazilian scoring and chelsea blowing a hole in liverpool âs title challenge
he , clearly , enjoyed the 30 minutes he was on the pitch , as did everyone else involved in the game , which came from an idea gerrard had to say thank you to liverpool as a city before he starts his new venture in los angeles
didier drogba puts an arm around west ham united midfielder kevin nolan as stars from across gerrard and carragher 's careers came out to play harry kewell plays a pass with his left foot as chelsea captain terry and liverpool captain gerrard , playing on the same team , watch on mario balotelli opened the scoring at anfield after just eight minutes , getting ahead of opposition captain gerrard to slam in a long - range shot carragher and his sky sports colleague thierry henry share a laugh and a high five after the former defender thwarts his friend 's chance didier drogba doubled the lead after deceiving goalkeeper brad jones with a step - over and then coolly finishing into the empty net at the the kop end chelsea 's ivorian centre forward has scored 11 goals against liverpool during his long career so it was no surprise to see him score at anfield take terry and didier drogba
for so long these two chelsea stalwarts have been regarded as the enemy but both were given generous receptions for helping the cause , particularly didier drogba when he scored the second goal of the game for carragher âs team on 31 minutes
the first had been scored by mario balotelli and a cracker it was too , the italian whipping a 25 - yard drive that fizzed into the corner of the kop net on nine minutes
at one stage it looked as if carragher âs side , managed by roy evans , would saunter to victory but gerrard has made comebacks a fixture of his liverpool career and he ensured this match did not end in defeat
he scored two penalties , one in the 36th minute after martin kelly had adjudged to trip jerome sinclair and another just after the hour when carragher quite clearly barged suarez over
mario balotelli and didier drogba share an embrace after their goals gave carragher 's xi the lead from early on in the charity game bayern munich midfielder alonso leaves the field at anfield to a warm ovation and an embrace with liverpool manager brendan rodgers jerome sinclair was brought down by martin kelly inside the carragher xi penalty area to give gerrard the chance to pull a goal back reina does his best to put his old team - mate off ahead of his attempt from the spot , but the jibes were all good - natured between the pair gerrard was obviously not phased by reina 's antics , and he sent the spanish keeper the wrong way from the spot , shooting to his left two former liverpool strikers entered the field as half - time substitutes , with suarez and torres both returning to anfield torres holds off the challenge of current liverpool midfielder lucas as he got back into the experience of playing on merseyside gerrard tucks away his second penalty of the afternoon to level the scores for his team after they came from two goals behind afterwards gerrard told lfc tv : ' it has been absolute brilliant , more than anything the charities have done well with a full house
