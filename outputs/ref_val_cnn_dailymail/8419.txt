the remains of a woolly mammoth that died 10,000 years ago have been unearthed in siberian by oil workers
two tusks , teeth and rib bones of the extinct giant mammal were discovered buried three metres down in the frozen soil around 31 miles ( 50km ) from nyagan in khanty-mansi , russia

oil workers noticed a tusk sticking out of the excavator bucket using shovels they then unearthed a second tust , a tibia , ribs , teeth and fragments of the animal 's jaw
' genetic analysis will help to determine which population this mammoth was from - europe or north america
' recent research has shown that many woolly mammoths discovered in siberian may have originated in north ameria and migrated across the bering strait when sea levels were lower
many believe the original siberian population of mammoths disappeared around 40,000 years ago , with north america mammoths dominating until around 4,500 years ago
palaeontologists who examined the mammoth 's remains ( shown above ) estimate it died 10,000 years ago oil workers had been excavating a site 31 miles from nyagan in russia ( above ) when they found the mammoth
they estimate that the giant had been a fully grown female , around 30 to 40 years old a recent study has suggested that human hunting caused a massive drop in mammoth populations in western europe around 30,000 years ago
dozens of mammoth remains have been unearthed in siberian , including entire skeletons and even mummified bodies still preserved in the ice
