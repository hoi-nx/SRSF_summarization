we are family : ' nothing better than getting to spend the day with both of these amazing woman ... my sister and my mother ... family is everything ! , ' tyler posted on instagram ' we thought pulling out is good enough , and like typical dumb kids , we could n't actually comprehend what would happen if it was n't
' we just approached sex like we 'd taken the pills and the air duster
she smelled pot in her house at age ten and started getting high on the sleeping pill unisom to trip out hallucinating , consuming five or six at a time
basically , anything we could get our hands on to get high with , we 'd do it
