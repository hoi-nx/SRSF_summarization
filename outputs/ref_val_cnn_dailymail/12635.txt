eto'o wanted to buy a watch
' " eto'o , who played in london with chelsea last season , called his brother who was nearby and it was he who brought a new credit card so the transaction could be completed
while eto'o does speak english , his brother has a far wider vocabulary and was able to ask just what had occurred moments earlier
eto'o then takes up the story , saying the lady in the store said she was wary of him because " we had some nigerians in the store the other day who came with fake credit cards
if i gave you my name , you will recognize who i am ? ' " he shrugged and i said , ' i 'm eto'o
" i told the lady , ' in my next interview , i 'm going to tell them about this and i 'll name the store so everyone can know that you treat people differently here , ' added eto'o referring to the saleswoman
" eto'o tells this story to demonstrate his belief that racism is not just football 's problem but one that society as a whole must combat
the cameroon international has played across the world in england , italy , spain as well as a spell in russia with anzhi
in 2006 , during a game against real zaragoza , eto'o was subjected to " monkey chants " -- and the forward came close to walking off the pitch
in 2010 , while playing for inter at cagliari , eto'o was again subjected to racist chanting which caused a three - minute stoppage to the contest
eto'o went on to score the only goal of the game as inter triumphed 1 - 0
" you have to understand that football is just a reflection of what we have in society , " said eto'o
" the first time i experienced racism was n't on a football pitch , but the truth is that i never thought that that could happen to me on a football pitch because football is a passion , it 's a feeling that touches millions of people
" eto'o , now 34 , believes there has been progress within the game in recent years and has decided that it is safe enough for his children to return to stadiums
for a man who has won three champions league titles , his assertion that this particular award is his " biggest " gives an insight into eto'o 's mindset in dealing with the scourge of racism
" it 's the most important , " eto'o said of the award
" eto'o also defended russia 's record of dealing with racism , despite fifa , the sport 's world governing body , expressing its concerns over how the country 's authorities deal with the problem
according to a report published earlier this month by the fare network , an anti-racism body , and the sova center , which conducts research on nationalism and racism , there were more than 200 cases of discriminatory behavior within the russia game over two seasons
the fans of cska moscow , one of russia 's most famous clubs have been serial offenders in terms of racism with uefa , the game 's european governing body , handing out punishments on numerous occasions
yet , eto'o , now playing in italy with sampdoria , retains fond memories of russia
he scored 36 goals in 71 appearances before joining chelsea in 2013 -- but he rejects any suggestions that russia is a hotbed for racism ahead of the 2018 world cup
" at the world cup in russia , you 'll see that there wo n't be incidents like this , " he added
this is where football wins , but when there are incidents like this , it 's shameful , but it does n't mean this will happen in the world cup just because it 's in russia
