six suspected ira terrorists thought to be behind a string of bomb attacks in uk are facing new police probes after the government withdraw controversial letters insisting they were no longer wanted
the fugitive paramilitary suspects had all received so - called ' comfort letters ' under a peace deal negotiated by blair
but the letters only came to light last year after the collapse of the terror trail of ira suspect john downey , who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the 1982 hyde park bombing in london
blair negotiated a deal with sinn fein in which on - the - run terror suspects not wanted by police received ' comfort letters ' the case against mr john downey was thrown out after he produced a letter from the government telling him he was no longer wanted and was free to travel to the uk
following the government 's intervention detectives now believe these ' comfort letters ' do not protect suspects from prosecution , documents leaked to the telegraph reveal
in the letter , kerr , the assistant chief constable , said the psni did not believe there was any barrier to prosecuting ' on the run ' suspects who had been sent ' comfort letters ' â because coalition government ministers have recently said the letters had no legal force
it is understood that ' comfort letters ' were given to suspects in the harrods car bomb in 1983 , which killed six and injured 90 , and the remembrance day bombing in enniskillen in 1987
ira terror suspect john downey was wrongly sent an immunity letter mr blair has insisted that only those individuals who were genuinely not wanted by police , and were therefore not going to face trial , were supposed to have received otrs
in a report to be published on tuesday , the committee is expected to raise questions over whether the policy of sending ' comfort letters ' to ira suspects during mr blair 's final months in office was lawful
mr blair has insisted the northern ireland peace process would have collapsed without the controversial scheme giving immunity from prosecution to republican terror suspects â the so - called ' on the runs '
some 95 recipients of the so - called ' comfort letters ' were linked to almost 300 murders
