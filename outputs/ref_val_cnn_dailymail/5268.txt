at my current vintage , 62 , my mother was content to spend her days playing golf , perhaps a rubber of bridge , popping in on the grandchildren , then spending the evening watching tv
like most women of my age , i âm occasionally exhausted , but in the main , engaged , active and having as much ( if not more ) fun than ever
linda kelsey says aged 62 she is occasionally exhausted but is very active and having more fun than ever so , i ca nât understand why mariella frostrup â a woman who is smart , successful , has the voice of a vamp and looks that make men of most ages go weak at the knees â has declared herself , at a mere 52 , the poster girl for the fed up 50 - something brigade
despite the evidence to the contrary , mariella frostrup thinks women over 50 are the hard done by generation
â it simply is nât so , mariella frostrup
julianne moore , 54 , has won an oscar , julie walters , 65 , has stolen the limelight from the young , good - looking cast of channel 4 âs indian summers and 50 shades of grey , based on the books of e. l. james , 51 , has become the highest grossing 18 - plus film ever
monica bellucci , 50 , is smouldering away as the latest bond girl , 65 - year - old twiggy is fronting a magazine cover and new beauty campaign , and theresa may , 58 , is said to be in the running as a potential next leader of the tory party
mariella frostrup , 52 ( pictured ) , thinks women over 50 are the hard done by generation having conflated her existential angst at turning 50 with what she perceives is going on in society at large , mariella frostrup seems to have missed the blindingly obvious fact that older women have never been so visible â or so courted
but now we âre worth more than a bob or two ( over- 50s represent 76 per cent of the nation âs wealth ) , by retailers and advertisers who realise we âre worth wooing because of , and despite , our wrinkles
compared with our mothers â generation , there âs been a seismic shift in attitudes
even if there âs still a way to go we should be recognising that whole new windows of opportunity have opened up
julianne moore , 54 ( pictured ) , won the best actress accolade at this year 's oscar like mariella frostrup , i remember that turning 50 can feel like the beginning of the end
of course , there are real physical and psychological reasons why hitting the big five - 0 may be a wobbly moment in a woman âs life
julie walters , 65 ( pictured ) , has stolen the limelight from the rest of the cast of channel 4 âs indian summers while the menopause can be liberating , it carries a sense of loss of possibilities as well ; at least it did for me
monica bellucci , 50 ( pictured ) , is the latest bond girl and will star in the new 007 film , spectre and after my marriage breakdown , i was overawed to find out love can flower at any age and sex can be better than ever
how different it was for my mother âs generation , who seemed to accept that slowing down was inevitable in their 50s
â you do too much , you need to rest , â is my 87 - year - old mother âs mantra
in some ways , we women in our 50s and beyond are nât just luckier than our mothers , we âre also luckier than the men of our own generation
65 - year - old twiggy ( pictured ) is fronting a magazine cover and new beauty campaign if some of the ads aimed my way are the saga cruises mariella frostrup objects to , that also does nât bother me â my partner and i have planned our american road trip this summer with the help of the internet rather than a package tour
one of my closest , who âs just turned 65 , was devastated when her husband left three years ago after 40 years
mariella frostrup âs portrayal of older women feels outmoded and overplayed â not to mention the route to becoming self - obsessed and feeling terminally sorry for ourselves
