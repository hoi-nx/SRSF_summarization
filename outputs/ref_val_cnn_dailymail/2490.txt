deonte , 12 , was with his mother , whitehead , as they returned from her sister 's house in the early morning hours of tuesday
as they pulled into the driveway of their detroit home , three men suddenly appeared and began cursing at whitehead and demanding she give them money
that is when young deonte stepped in to protect his mother , and one of the men stabbed him in the arm
" ' the men ran off immediately after , and whitehead , 44 , rushed her son to the hospital where he was treated and released later that morning
' he was like , " is mom ok ? " ' denote placed himself between the men and his mother , at which point one of the men stabbed him in the arm and while the mother is incredibly proud of what her son did to protect her , she does not want him risking his own safety in the future - even if it is to protect her
meanwhile , assistant detroit police chief steve dolunt has called what deonte did for his mother ' extremely commendable
