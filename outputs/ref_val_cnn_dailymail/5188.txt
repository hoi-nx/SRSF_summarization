star wars fans who once flocked to the tunisians town which was luke 's home are now staying away because of the proximity of violent jihadists
the desert cliffs around the town of tataouine were once the backdrop for much of the 1977 classic , parts of which were filmed in the arab state the year before
the struggling town on the fringes of the sahara still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict , as a way - station for jihadists crossing the libya border 60 miles to the east , according to cnn
the igloo home of luke and his foster family was destroyed in the film by stormtroopers from the galactic empire , but should militants extend their reach across the border , it could well be threatened for real
they are thought to have been removed from a libya armory in the aftermath of former dictator moammar gadhafi 's ouster in 2011
there is now a 1.8 - mile no - go zone inside the 380 mile long border , and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles
the area is under threat from an isis affiliate group a valley near tataouine.three young men were arrested in the area earlier this month as they allegedly made plans to cross into libya and join an affiliate of islamic state luke 's restored igloo home which was renovated by a group of star wars fans in 2012 a much wider 12 mile buffer zone has also been created , which people can only enter with permission , and men aged 18 - 35 have reportedly been banned from going to libya unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there
even so the two gunmen who stormed into the bardo museum in the capital tunis last week , who were both in their twenties , had been able to cross illicitly into libya in december , according to tunisians state security minister rafik chelly
chelly told a tunisians network the pair had received weapons training in the isis stronghold of derna
japanese , spanish , italian and colombian tourists were among the 20 victims when the gunmen opened fire on their buses as they arrived at the museum , which houses some of the roman artifacts that are one of tunisians 's major draws
an affiliate group is making ground in libya , which borders tunisians tunisians holding candles pray at the entrance gate of the national bardo museum in the tunisians capital tunis where 20 people were killed after gunmen staged in an attack the attackers clearly aimed to cut this lifeline
security forces at the scene shot dead two gunmen but another is still on the loose and some of more than 3,000 tunisians to join islamist militant groups in iraq and syria have returned home , raising fears of more attacks
