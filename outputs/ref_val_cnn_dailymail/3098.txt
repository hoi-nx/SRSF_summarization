being at old trafford on saturday was a surreal experience â and i âm not even referring to the wes brown - john oâshea red card cock - up
manchester united dominated the game , were by far the better side , and they won comfortably
but their fans were not satisfied
boos echoed around old trafford , and then a loud chant rang out : ' attack ! attack ! attack , attack , attack ! ' wayne rooney leaps for joy after scoring a brace against sunderland on saturday as manchester united won manchester united only took control of the game after wes brown was sent off against his former club there is a lack of realism among manchester united âs critics and some of the supporters this season
they need to understand and accept that it used to be champagne and caviar with fergie ; last season was bread and water ; this season it âs a bag of chips with one of those little bottles of cheap , weak continental beer
we âre waiting to see if louis van gaal is the right man , but manchester united âs football does nât look good when compared with the recent greatness
in the years before sir fergie retired , manchester united were phenomenal
despite the win there were sections of the home crowd that were not totally satisfied with the performance the champagne and caviar days that supporters were used to under sir fergie are over some great players contributed to that run of success â cristiano ronaldo , carlos tevez and wayne rooney up front
of all those names only one is still playing for manchester united , and he scored both goals in saturday âs win
many of fergie 's title - winning team in 2013 have left the club and it is hard to replace those players fergie celebrates winning his final premier league title in 2013 before retiring some manchester united observers seem to think that the signing of a Â£ 60million player should automatically return the side to the breathtaking football from a few years ago
it does nât work like that â it âs about building a team after that glorious side under fergie was decimated
in the first half on saturday he was pretty awful but he was also targeted by sunderland
but as gus poyet said after saturday âs game , manchester united fans have nothing to worry about if they remember this is di maria , who is actually one of the world âs best players most of the time
louis van gaal is rebuilding the manchester united team and it is a work in progress angel di maria has been criticised in recent weeks and was awful in the first half against sunderland there are some surprising positives for manchester united this season â notably ashley young , who has been consistently impressive and effective out wide
i understand that manchester united fans want to play football the fergie way
