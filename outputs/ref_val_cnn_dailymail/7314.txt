if cech , at 33 , is available in the summer , and arsenal have a chance of buying him , what should be arsene wenger 's best offer ? jose mourinho says cech can leave chelsea if he wishes , but only for big money as he rates him one of the top three goalkeepers in the world
chelsea manager jose mourinho has said goalkeeper cech can leave stamford bridge in the summer david de gea , manuel neuer and ginaluigi buffon are the three most expensive goalkeepers in history cech can not command such a fee at his age
so if chelsea asked for Â£ 10m for a 33 - year - old reserve , should arsenal be tempted ? yes again
the absence of a world class goalkeeper is holding arsenal back
