it 's thanks to those 19th - century promoters that the elephant rose to become the circus 's king of beasts -- the living symbol of " ringling brothers
" " this is something that has been a big deal historically , " says circus historian janet davis , an american studies professor at the university of texas
traditionally , she observes , elephants are the stars of the parade when circuses come to town
there was even a 19th - century phrase , " to see the elephant , " a euphemism used by soldiers for seeing battle , recognizing the wonder and rarity of these giant animals
on thursday , ringling brothers , part of the feld entertainment firm , announced that it would be ending use of elephants by 2018
cnnmoney : ringling brothers will soon be without elephants brown was perhaps the first to make elephants a part of the circus atmosphere
the modern circus only dates back to around 1770 , the invention of an englishman named philip astley , who added jugglers , acrobats and clowns to his equestrian show
brown 's show , by adding a menagerie tent to the circus tent , could market their shows as educationally uplifting by " showing people the wonders of the animal world , " she adds
by the 1850s , elephants were regular circus attractions
" elephants become this incredibly important signature part of the circus , " says davis
the attitudes towards elephants , and circus animals in general , started changing in the early 20th century , says davis
for one thing , until world war i , the circus was the king of the entertainment circuit : " there were no movies , radio or television to compete with the wonders of the circus ring and little traffic congestion or parking problems to impede those who sought to attend , " wrote bob brooke in history magazine
ringling brothers and other circus companies have dealt with numerous challenges over the last half - century , including ever - splintering attention for entertainment dollars and the rise of acrobat - based shows such as cirque du soleil , which is now a global empire
but " ringling brothers " is still hugely popular , and davis believes the loss of elephants wo n't affect the circus ' bottom line
" when it comes to circus animal acts , are more changes to come ? are lions and tigers next ? davis wonders
