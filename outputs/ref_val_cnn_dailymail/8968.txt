louis van gaal 's first season with manchester united is in danger of turning into a complete mess following the fa cup defeat by arsenal
manchester united manager louis van gaal ( left ) and assistant giggs during their defeat by arsenal why sell danny welbeck ? there was an inevitability the england striker would return to haunt van gaal
van gaal prides himself on working with young talent , so keeping danny welbeck should have made sense
it caused shock against arsenal that falcao was overlooked when manchester united were losing but has the colombian really done anything to justify being at old trafford ? van gaal 's mistake was letting danny welbeck leave and bringing in a player who was n't guaranteed to suit english football
danny welbeck shoots to score the winning goal against manchester united on monday night at old trafford a stranded david de gea looks on as the goalkeeper was beaten by former manchester united player danny welbeck danny welbeck celebrated his goal against his former club as arsenal won the fa cup tie 2 - 1 messing up in milton keynes so much has happened during this season you could almost forget about the events of tuesday , august 26
however , van gaal made an error that night by selecting a weak team to take on mk dons in the capital one cup
tumbling out of the fa cup means this will be the first time since 1989 that manchester united have gone two years without a trophy
manchester united lost 4 - 0 against mk dons earlier in the season as van gaal played a weak team mk dons striker benik afobe celebrates scoring their third goal against manchester united at stadium mk no coach should throw away an opportunity to win a competition but van gaal did against mk dons not playing to rooney 's strengths as roy keane observed after the arsenal defeat , rooney is ' as good as anyone ' when he is deployed in a central striking role
giggs speaks with manchester united captain rooney , who has been played out of position previously van gaal has muddied the picture by playing rooney deep at times and not utilising his talents what has happened to that style ? roy keane made another pertinent observation when he said it is ' time to stop looking back at what manchester united had before '
has van gaal presided over a performance this season that has been universally lauded for attractive football ? no. it says everything about them that against arsenal they finished off hoisting long - balls to marouane fellaini and chris smalling
manchester united have lacked a good style since van gaal took charge during the summer after the world cup firing it up to marouane fellaini marouane fellaini is a good player and he has made a contribution for van gaal this season but his continued presence in the team is now proving a hindrance
van gaal is a coach whose teams historically play attractive football but marouane fellaini is making manchester united a more primitive outfit
angel di maria is shown a red card during manchester united 's defeat at old trafford against arsenal on monday di maria leaves the field after being sent off during the defeat that was van gaal 's last chance of a trophy changing the formation football should , essentially , be a simple game but van gaal 's tactics can be confusing and nothing shows that up more than whether he is playing three defenders or four
manchester united pass the ball around at the back without really having a purpose and they now have a habit of getting themselves into a panic , as shown by the mistakes that led to danny welbeck 's goal
van gaal 's ego meant he was always going to be single - minded in his approach to this job but maybe he has underestimated how true manchester united fans are to traditions
