in november 2002 , the world was captivated by the biggest archaeological discovery ever made relating to jesus : a 2,000 year - old ossuary -- or bone box -- bearing the tantalizing inscription in aramaic : " james , son of joseph , brother of jesus
' finding jesus ' : john the baptist q&a so who are these " brothers " that the gospel of mark mentions ? the rev. james martin , author of the book " jesus : a pilgrimage , " calls the relationship between james and jesus " very complicated
but catholics also believe in mary 's perpetual virginity , so james martin surmises that james and the other brothers were joseph 's children from a prior marriage
" other catholic scholars see james and jesus as cousins , an idea that began in the fourth century , when jerome , who translated the hebrew bible and the the new testament into latin , argued the point against the theologian helvedius , who said mary and joseph had other children
one of them is jesus -- but the question then becomes , which one ? ben witherington iii , professor of new testament interpretation at asbury theological seminary , offers the protestant view that jesus and james were full brothers , with jesus being the elder
" the new testament says nothing about mary being a perpetual virgin , it says she virginally conceived jesus , and it certainly implies that she went on to have more children after that , and his brothers and sisters are in fact his brothers and sisters , " ben witherington iii says
is judas in hell ? jesus is presented as the older brother who leaves the family and walks about in galilee and judea , has a ministry and leaves james and the other brothers and sisters in charge of the family , according to the scholar
what 's more contentious for some protestant , is the fact that jesus , as the eldest in the family , essentially forsook his obligation as next - in - line to head the family after joseph died
5 things you did n't know about jesus that left james to fill the void
whatever he was -- brother , step - brother or cousin -- we know that james became important in the early christian church because of his relation to jesus
