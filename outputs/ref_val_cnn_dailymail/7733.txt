such was the sad situation faced by the sfs at joint base san antonio - lackland in texas recently , when a beloved member of their unit , daysi , had to be euthanized for an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor
she had never had a handler before , and her partner with sgt. paul olmos , had never had his own dog
' daysi and paul olmos were an ideal team pairing , ' said tech. sgt. nelson , 802nd sfs kennel master
' their relationship is immense because this was their first experience as a daysi team
' paul olmos would spend all of his free time with his charge
' i 'm single and i do n't have immediate family here , so i 'd come on the weekends just to visit her and take her on runs , ' paul olmos said
however in january this year , trainers noticed something was wrong with daysi 's left leg
sick : daysi had an aggressive form of cancer and a malignant tumor and could not be operated on an initial check - up did n't show anything abnormal
' final goodbye : military members line up and salute daysi as she is walked into a veterinary clinic to be put down by her partner , sgt. paul olmos on february 27 , all of those who had worked with daysi lined up outside the veterinary clinic
the officers then saluted as daysi was lead into the facility to be put down
