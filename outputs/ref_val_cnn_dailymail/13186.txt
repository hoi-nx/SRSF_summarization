kuala lumpur the initial hours after the disappearance of flight mh370 were characterized by confusion and chaos , as air traffic controllers struggled to comprehend the situation and radar operators failed to take notice , according to data contained in an interim report
the report -- released one year after the disappearance of the boeing 777 and its 239 passengers and crew --- provides a detailed picture of delays and protocol violations before the launch of the search and rescue
an astonishing five hours and 13 minutes passed between the last communication from the flight crew and kuala lumpur 's first distress signal concerning the missing plane
and it was another five hours before the first search flights took off to try to find it
cnn 's aviation correspondent richard quest said he believes the delayed response was the most disturbing thing revealed by the interim report -- " the lack of somebody pushing the big red button that says crisis and panic
" a year later after the plane 's disappearance , not a single trace of mh370 has been found despite extensive search efforts
no explanation for the delay is given in the interim report , which is composed of factual data and provides no conclusions or recommendations
after the air traffic controllers lost contact with mh370 , the plane continued to fly within the range of multiple radar systems belonging to four different countries
the interim report says that " for unknown reasons " indonesia 's medan radar did not see the flight
and thailand " did not pay much attention , " since mh370 's flight path did not fall within its borders
though the interim report makes no mention of it , a failure by the malaysian military to alert others to the relevant radar data may be blame
a briefing document prepared by the icao ( icao ) said military authorities failed to share the final radar fix of mh370 with their civilian counterparts for 20 hours
the interim report released by malaysian investigators on sunday provides no information about when the military radar data was shared with other authorities
though the mh370 investigation team did not draw lessons in the current report , it plans to provide safety recommendations in the months ahead
