david gill , the fa vice- chairman , says fa cup replays and the two - legged league cup semi-finals may have to be sacrificed in the season of the qatar world cup
why wait ? if anything , replays are detracting from the excitement of the competition , and the format of what is currently the league cup is an anomaly
it should not take fifa âs monstrous destruction of football âs calendar to make the english game see sense
by chance , there were no replays in the fa cup fifth round this year and they were not missed
david gill suggested removing cup replays , and he has a point , even if it it has taken qatar to make it happen cambridge united were excellent to earn a replay against manchester united , but lost the second game that is when bradford city beat chelsea and sunderland , when middlesbrough eliminated manchester city , when blackburn rovers beat swansea city then stoke city
jonathan stead 's goal against chelsea was part of a shock that re-affirmed the fa cup 's giant killing tradition bradford celebrate their win at stamford bridge , and did n't need a replay to upset the premier league leaders we cling to tradition , but tradition had teams playing replay after replay until they could be separated
that is the true gladiatorial tradition of the fa cup , but it is unthinkable with modern fixture congestion
so as the shoot - out that completes the first replay is in itself a compromise , why is it needed at all ? middlesbrough also caused an upset , by beating manchester city , but replays rarely lead to shocks smaller clubs might be better rewarded if games were decided on the night by a penalty shoot - out a game decided on the day , one hit , with extra-time and penalties , would go some way to restoring tension and drama
it should not need fifa âs selfishness to be a catalyst for reform in the english game
