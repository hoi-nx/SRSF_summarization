a chelsea fan on twitter - @ talkofthebridge â tweeted recently : ' i dread the day terry retires more than i dread my own death
' at first it makes shocking reading , but when you factor in the extreme passion of football fans , the love they have for their club , and the astonishingly high regard chelsea fans have for their captain , it all makes sense
chelsea will not be able to replace terry when he finally retires
but the question remains , how on earth will chelsea cope when the inevitable happens ? life and chelsea will go on of course , but reflecting on yet another incredible man - of - the - match performance from terry at wembley , it occurred to me that he is unique
terry and jose mourinho celebrate on the wembley pitch after chelsea 's win on sunday not so long ago some were declaring terry was finished
andre villas-boas ' ridiculous high line ensured this over-hyped manager got the worst from terry and made the player look vulnerable
and then rafa benitez arrived to seemingly finish off the destruction of arguably chelsea âs greatest ever player
it is now a major cause for concern among chelsea fans if terry is nât in the starting line - up
but the love for terry among chelsea fans is about so much more than him being a very good centre half
terry beat hugo lloris to score chelsea 's crucial first goal in the capital one cup final the blues captain ran off to celebrate after breaking the deadlock at wembley ... and he led the celebrations at the end as the chelsea players partied after winning the capital one cup he came through the youth ranks , and is now a revered chelsea captain
terry was a huge part of that journey , and in their minds he belonged on that podium , he deserved the champagne , and he deserved to be wearing the shirt that night as the celebrations began
the chelsea captain celebrates after they beat bayern munich to win the champions league in 2012 i âm not a chelsea fan , so i asked three friends of mine who are to sum it up
' another friend , laura used the cliche â ' mr chelsea ' to describe him , and then went on : ' you can see what the team and the club mean to him
' another colleague , the ex-chelsea defender jason cundy , told me this : ' terry is the best ever chelsea youth product , best ever chelsea centre back , and most successful captain ever
with so many foreign players at chelsea , and so few homegrown players to come through over the last 15 years , he represents the fans on the pitch and plays with the same passion , pride and love for chelsea that we fans have in the stands for the club
