so when chelsea surrounded referee bjorn kuipers to get zlatan ibrahimovic sent off on wednesday it was nât something new , or a modern phenomenon that has been creeping up on us
it âs been a part of english football for years
having said that , now is the time to draw a line and punish teams that overstep the mark in this way , as i believe chelsea did on wednesday and i think it could be done with a simple amendment to the rules
almost all the chelsea squad surrounded referee bjorn kuipers after an incident at stamford bridge if a referee feels that he is being aggressively hounded by a group of players he should have the power to reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way
so on wednesday night , he could still have sent off zlatan ibrahimovic if he really felt it was a red card offence but chelsea would have lost the advantage of a free kick
at the moment , it âs worthwhile clamouring round a referee to get a decision , so few coaches would discourage their players from doing so
however , if you felt that by hounding the referee , your team might lose a potential goal - scoring opportunity , because you would miss out on a free kick on the edge of the box , managers would soon start telling their players to exercise more restraint
imagine losing the chance to take a penalty kick because you had surrounded the referee
bjorn kuipers might have looked at the zlatan ibrahimovic tackle and thought it was a 50 - 50 decision
this tackle from psg striker zlatan ibrahimovic sparked a furious reaction from chelsea players the chelsea players surround referee bjorn kuipers at stamford bridge as he brandishes the red card chelsea captain john terry ( left ) reacts after zlatan ibrahimovic 's tackle on oscar in the first - half this would only be a small change in the rules but i believe it would make a massive change in behaviour over time
john terry ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following zlatan ibrahimovic 's first - half challenge football is a physical game and that is part of its spectacle
when friday comes , english teams can feel benefit in europe it has been an awful few weeks for english teams in europe with only everton thriving in the europa league
given the competitiveness of the premier league you would imagine that our teams would be more than ready for this stage of the champions league and europa league , when the competitions step up a level
the sheer competitiveness of the premier league is leaving us short in these difficult games
not only do we tend to have four teams who believe they can win the title , which is not the case in most of europe âs other major leagues , but there is an increased level of intensity about all our games
everton are progressing well in the europa league as other english sides continue to struggle in europe having played in france , i know that for psg , marseille and lyon there will only be a handful of games for which they need to be at their best
it âs not that it âs easy but going to the smaller france teams is not like going to turf moor to play burnley or loftus road to play qpr , where the crowd is right on top of you and everyone is expecting the home side to put one over chelsea or manchester united
arsenal endured a torrid champions league 3 - 0 defeat against monaco late last month and while the christmas break is nât as long in france , italy and spanish , it allows their players to relax get a couple of weeks in the sun. it âs ironic that the intensity and competitiveness of the premier league , which is what has made it so successful , might now be damaging our performance in europe and by extension damaging it âs reputation
however , there is an opportunity now to help english team in the champions league
jose mourinho has long drawn attention to spanish teams playing games on a friday night if they have a tuesday night champions league game
the new Â£ 5.1billion tv deal â a mark of how popular the premier league is â has provision for some friday night games
the premier league and tv companies should be looking at those friday night games to see whether they can schedule teams competing in the champions league
after all , if premier league clubs consistently fail in europe , global audiences will begin to question just how good these clubs really are
