as the world digests the shock of russian opposition leader nemtsov 's brutal murder in front of the kremlin on friday , everybody is trying to determine who was behind it
the russian authorities were quick to throw out a number of theories , which ranged from the cia to ukraine , and even to nemtsov 's relationship troubles
while most people have discounted these out of hand , there are a surprising number of people who have bought into the statement , released by vladimir putin 's spokesman , that " nemtsov was only slightly more than an average statistical citizen " -- implying that the russian president would have no reason to want him dead
nemtsov may not have been a significant threat two years ago when oil prices were high and russian were feeling politically apathetic -- but with oil prices down 50 % , the ruble down 50 % , the economy shrinking and companies firing people , a charismatic opposition politician like nemtsov is a real and direct threat to vladimir putin , who is terrified of experiencing a ukraine - style revolution in russian , especially when there is an unpredictable economic crisis brewing
nemtsov 's corruption exposÃ©s laid out , in damning detail , the truth behind the personal wealth of vladimir putin and his cronies ; one does n't need to be an expert to see the similarities with former ukraine president viktor yanukovych , who fled kiev following popular uprisings in february of last year
nemtsov was also preparing a paper documenting the experiences of russian soldiers in ukraine -- one that could have dealt a catastrophic blow to the russian propaganda machine about the ukraine conflict

although kremlin involvement in her killing was never proved , the number of brave , outspoken investigative journalists in russian dropped to only a handful after her death
in addition to the political benefits of nemtsov 's demise , his killing also sends a clear and chilling message to anyone else who is similarly outspoken against vladimir putin : it does n't matter how well known you are , how many heads of state in the west know you , or how many people would be outraged by your death
this is the most brazen high - profile assassination of a political opposition leader in modern russian history
no investigation conducted solely by the russian government would be credible under the circumstances , because it can not impartially examine the possible complicity of vladimir putin or the russian secret service in this act
these sanctions will also act as a real consequence if the russian government refuses to cooperate with an independent inquiry into nemtsov 's murder
