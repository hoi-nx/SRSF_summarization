esa 's rosetta spacecraft is getting ready for an adventurous pass through the geysers of comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko
esa is preparing to send its rosetta spacecraft within nine miles of comet 67p
the probe will be tasked with studying the jets coming from its surface ( shown in image )
these could reveal what the comet 's interior is composed of
and as the comet gets more active , philae on the surface could wake up â the comet is getting super exciting , â said esa âs rosetta project scientist dr matt taylor in the times
â the rosetta probe , which was carrying philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 3.3ft ( one metre ) per second relative to the comet
the probe will be brought within nine miles ( 15km ) of the comet , with its path taking it right through 67p âs geysers
these jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. it is getting closer and closer over the next few months , with its point of closest approach taking place in august
as it becomes more active , rosetta has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data
but studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface , and it could also reveal the connection between the comet âs atmosphere - its coma - and the surface
as the comet gets closer to the sun , scientists will also be hoping to hear from the philae lander on the surface
the rosetta ( illustrated ) , which carried the philae lander , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p
it is about 2.7 miles ( 4.3km ) long and 2.5 mniles ( 4.1km ) wide , and will make its closest approach to the sun on 13 august 2015 after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , rosetta successfully released the philae ( illustrated ) from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 3.3ft ( one metre ) per second relative to the comet
shown is one of the first images returned by philae on the surface , showing what appears to be the probe on its side wedged in darkness against a cliff the main issue at the moment is that , for the lander simply to wake up , it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45 Â° c ( -49 â° f )
the next few months are certain to be an exciting time , though - not just for philae , but for the orbiting rosetta spacecraft as well .
