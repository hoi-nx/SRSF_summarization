an unseasonably warm winter has left parts of alaska 's iditarod trail without snow , exposing grass and gravel and forcing the famous dogsled race to move 225 miles north
when the race begins monday , mushers will cross the starting line in fairbanks instead of willow , the traditional starting point
it 's the second time in the race 's 43 - year history that the starting point has moved from willow to fairbanks because of weather - related issues , an iditarod spokesperson said
race organizers made the unanimous decision in february to move the race after determining that conditions were worse than last year in critical areas , and " therefore not safe enough for the upcoming race , " iditarod chief executive hooley said in a press release
the lack of snow could be attributed to a highly amplified jet stream that brought warm air from the pacific to the region , said meteorologist dave snider with the national weather service in anchorage
warm sea surface temperatures along the alaska coastline are another reason for milder conditions , he added .
