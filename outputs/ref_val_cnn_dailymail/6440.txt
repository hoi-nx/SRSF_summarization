a group of patients who criticised their local gp surgery on facebook have been told to consider finding a new doctor in an attempt to stifle negative feedback online
staff at the trent meadows medical practice near burton , staffordshire , had been monitoring social media comments and culprits have since been sent ' threatening ' letters
sylvia blackshaw , 35 , had written that on three occasions she waited for 90 minutes for an appointment for her newborn baby
but she was later accused of abusive behaviour by the surgery who branded it ' inappropriate patient behaviour ' and warned her that she should consider finding an ' alternative practice '
row : jenny wheeldon , left , and sylvia blackshaw , right with son jake , have been told to consider finding a new gp after their surgery saw their criticism online spark : surgery staff were obviously monitoring comments on facebook and sent a letter on the back of this one mrs sylvia blackshaw had said ' omg
a fortnight later a letter sent to her home from the surgery said : ' we have a zero tolerance for inappropriate patient behaviour which is either face to face , over the telephone or on social media networks and do not accept this from our patients
' a copy of her facebook criticism was also attached
warning : this letter from gp partner judith crosse has also been sent to other critics several other patients also received a letter
i think they should take the criticism and use it to make the surgery better
' another patient , jenny wheeldon , 34 , was left upset by her letter , which came after she described months of poor service at the surgery in an online comment
' the letter invites recipients to speak to the patient liaison manager and one of the gp partners , but adds ' in the absence of such a meeting , it is felt you might give consideration to finding an alternative practice to receive your general medical services '
