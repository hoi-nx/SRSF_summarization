t.j. maxx has pulled a t - shirt from its shelves after a shopper tweeted an image of the shirt featuring the phrase " hang loose " and an illustration of a noose , leading to an uproar on social media
beachwear company tavik made the shirt , hence the surfing term " hang loose , " but the inclusion of the noose led posters on social media to draw connections to lynching and suicide
" " at t.j. maxx , we take product matters very seriously and appreciate that this t - shirt was brought to our attention , " t.j. maxx spokeswoman doreen thompson said
" as soon as we became aware of the offensive t - shirt message , we initiated the process to remove this item from our stores
" this t - shirt will not be sold by tavik or any other retailer , " mcelroy wrote in an email
