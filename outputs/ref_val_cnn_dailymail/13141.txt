as a well - traveled photographer , pieter ten hoopen is no stranger to refugee camps
but he never experienced any like the mayo camp , which is outside the sudan capital of khartoum
ten hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for emergency , a humanitarian group from italy
he also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there
his hopes were dashed , however , when he was told he could n't photograph outside the hospital compound
" i had very , very hard restrictions from the sudan government
... they are very well - skilled in keeping the media at bay , " ten hoopen said
with no freedom of movement , much like the refugees themselves , ten hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in african
with the help of refugee hospital workers , he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available
the studio quickly became a sensation
once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken , lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken
" this was one of the reasons why i built the studio : to get more material and more narratives from the people , " ten hoopen said
the project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees
the photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp , some have been there for decades
women wearing the traditional sudan tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped
whether from sudan , south sudan or eritrea , the faces become , individually and collectively , a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the horn of africa
hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely
it was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital
so i build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the african continent or in european ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way , " ten hoopen said
" ten - month - old buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio
" how did ten hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees , some severely traumatized and living in fear ? " it was n't hard , " he said
" pieter ten hoopen is a photographer based in stockholm , sweden
