missouri 's oldest death row inmate was executed on tuesday for murdering a sheriff 's deputy , after the u.s. supreme court and the governor declined to spare the 74 - year - old whose attorneys said he had a diminished mental capacity because of a sawmill accident decades ago
' they brought me up here to execute me , ' clayton uttered before he was put to death by lethal injection after governor jay nixon denied a clemency request
after a final meal of fried chicken , mashed potatoes , corn , green beans and a cola , he was executed at the correctional center in bonne terre at 9.13pm and was pronounced dead at 9.21pm
clayton was executed despite repeated attempts by his lawyers to spare his life , claiming he had an iq of just 71 after suffering a traumatic brain injury decades before he killed the officer in 1996
put to his death : clayton , 74 , was executed by lethal injection at 9:13 p.m. on tuesday for the 1996 murder of deputy sheriff christopher castetter
the u.s. supreme court was also divided , with four judges saying they would have granted a stay
mike o'connell , spokesman for the department of corrections , said in a statement that clayton was executed at 9.13pm and pronounced dead at 9:21 p.m. the claim of diminished mental capacity stemmed from a 1972 sawmill accident that clayton 's attorneys argued cost him about eight percent of his brain , including 20 per cent of the frontal lobe portion governing impulse control and judgment
combined with his reported iq of 71 and reading skills of a fourth - grader , clayton 's attorneys insisted psychiatric evaluations over the past decade concluded that the inmate did n't understand the significance of his scheduled execution or the reasons for it , making him ineligible to be put to death under state and federal law
in their 11th - hour appeals , clayton 's attorneys had argued that his deteriorating mental health left him convinced his conviction was a plot against him and that god would rescue him from a death sentence at the last minute , ' after which time he will travel the country playing the piano and preaching the gospel
missing : a brain scan shared by his lawyers show a significant section of his brain is missing at a press briefing on tuesday evening , james castetter thanked authorities for convicting clayton for the ' senseless murder ' of his brother , chris
' clayton was convicted of gunning down christopher castetter , a sheriff 's deputy in rural southwest missouri 's barry county
authorities said clayton shot christopher castetter once in the forehead while the deputy was in his car , which was found against a tree , its engine racing and wheels spinning
clayton 's brother had testified that the sawmill accident led to clayton 's breakup from his wife , alcohol abuse and violent outbursts
the lethal injection , clayton 's attorneys said , was ' sure or very likely to cause excruciating or tortuous pain and needless suffering ' in light of his dementia
' if missouri proceeds with its scheduled execution of mr. clayton , it will be conducting an unregulated experiment on a human subject , as there are no studies that support ( the prison system 's ) use of missouri 's lethal injection protocol on an individual suffering from severe brain damage , ' the appeals on clayton 's behalf argued
killed : barry county sheriff 's deputy christopher castetter , pictured left , was shot dead by clayton , pictured right in an old mug shot , as he responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in 1996 at the weekend , when the missouri supreme court issued its decision , three of the seven judges agreed that clayton was entitled to a competency hearing
dr. james reynolds of the missouri department of mental health had concluded that clayton was mentally ill , but could not be certain that he did n't understand his death sentence
