i âm starting to think lallana might actually become a better version of gerrard
he âs certainly got all the qualities that make him the perfect replacement for the liverpool captain
i appreciate that jordan henderson is set to take over as skipper , but in terms of dynamism , energy and quality , lallana looks like the perfect replacement for gerrard the player
have a look at sunday âs victory over man city : lallana started the game as one of two no 10s behind raheem sterling ( rodgers â innovative approach as a coach should not be underestimated )
lallana ( centre ) gave an all - action display as liverpool impressively beat man city lallana chats with liverpool captain gerrard during training on monday he is truly two - footed â for that reason alone english football should treasure him
lallana still has to prove he can do it , as gerrard did , in a major final , but he proved it in a massive game on sunday
a simple five - minute chat about lallana with rodgers will have him purring
philippe coutinho ( 2nd right ) curled home liverpool 's winner late on in the premier league clash at anfield vice-captain jordan henderson ( right , front ) also scored a screamer for the reds on sunday one thing you might not know about lallana is that in rodgers â words , he is ' no shrinking violet '
rodgers knew that opponents â approach to liverpool would be different this season , he knew he would need players to be clever on the ball , and lallana has that football intelligence
lallana - who played three positions against man city - shows his defensive qualities challenging sergio aguero he does nât get talked about too much , does he ? is that because he âs english ? probably
gerrard âs departure will still hurt liverpool fans , but i expect lallana to grow even more when the legend leaves
lallana slides in to have an effort on the man city goal that went narrowly wide of the target
