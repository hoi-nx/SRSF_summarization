a detailed search for indian ocean rubbish on the south west coast of tasmanian might have indicated that the hunt for missing flight mh370 is in the wrong place
volunteers have scoured beaches , rocks and shallow waters along a 60 - mile stretch of coast in the lower corner of the island state , located to the south of the australian continent , picking up no less than 80,000 pieces of rubbish
yet the official search area for the aircraft , some 1200 miles south west of perth in australia , lies virtually in the path that the rubbish from the other side of the ocean has drifted along
doomed : a detailed search for indian ocean rubbish on the south west coast of tasmanian might have indicated that the hunt for missing mh370 ( pictured ) is in the wrong place if nothing more , the discovery of rubbish from madagascar and south africa confirms that the ocean tides will carry debris many thousands of miles , passing close to the mh370 search area , to the shores of australia - and perhaps onwards into the pacific ocean
there have been numerous suggestions that despite complex mathematical calculations the search for the aircraft , which vanished more than a year ago on its way from kuala lumpur to beijing with 239 passengers and crew , is in the wrong area
and while the rubbish clean - up by a team of volunteers along the remote beaches of tasmanian was not conducted to look for debris from the aircraft , the ocean currents have brought nothing in to suggest that the aircraft lies at the bottom of the sea somewhere out to the west
if there was anything in southern tasmanian from the jet , the team would have found it , for they have been picking up minute pieces of plastic as small as a grain of rice
