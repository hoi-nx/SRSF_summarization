sturgeon has vowed to join forces with labour after the general election to ' lock david cameron out of downing street '
in a speech in glasgow tonight , she said that scotland mps would vote to stop a tory government ' even getting off the ground ' in the event of the snp getting a majority north of the border
speaking to 3,000 delegates ms sturgeon also put forward policies which would increase public spending , including an end to austerity , a rise in the minimum wage , and increased payouts to youngsters who stay on at school past the age of 16
in echoes of conservative adverts showing ed miliband in the pocket of alex salmond , she also talked about the snp ' forcing labour 's hand ' and giving the labour party ' backbone and guts '
she said : ' let me said it loud and let me make it clear - the snp will never put the tories into government
' as long as there are more anti-tory mps-labour or snp - than there are tory mps in the house of commons , we can keep them out of government
' if there are more anti-tory than tory mps after the election , the only way the tories get back into power is if labour lets them back in
if there is a hung scottish parliament , snp mps will vote to stop a tory government even getting off the ground
she also said that the snp would ' force labour 's hand ' in government , giving ed miliband 's party ' guts and backbone ' ' i call on labour , today , to match that pledge - to make clear that if labour and the snp combined have more seats than the tories , they will join forces with us in a vote of confidence to lock david cameron out of downing street
' ms sturgeon said a vote for the snp was ' a vote to make sure that the tories are replaced with a better alternative
' she told the conference : ' if you want a labour government to have backbone and guts , you need to elect snp mps to provide it for them
' and if you want a labour government that wo n't just be a carbon copy of the tories , but will instead deliver the real change scotland needs , then you must elect snp mps to force labour 's hand and keep them honest
ms sturgeon also talked of offering ' the hand of friendship ' to the rest of the britain after the bitter independence battle of last year
' labour leader jim murphy added : ' no - one will be fooled by sturgeon 's claims to be the britain 's best friend when the snp 's entire purpose is trying to break up britain
