liverpool are the biggest english club when measured solely by the number of major trophies won , all - time
with 18 league titles , seven fa cups , eight league cups , five european cups and three uefa cups , they have lifted 41 major honours in their history , two more than their closest rivals in this regard , united , who have 39
united have more league titles , 20 , and 13 of those have been won since liverpool âs last league title in 1989 - 90
they also have more fa cup wins than liverpool ( 11 ) , but fewer league cups ( four ) , fewer european cups ( three ) and fewer other european trophies ( one , the cup-winners cup of 1990 - 91 )
the silverware has been totted up as part of a sportsmail study to explore which english clubs are the â biggest â ; 59 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been considered , having played in england âs top division for at least a season
trophies we counted â major â trophies won by each club , giving points for each ; 10pts for each european cup / european cup win , 8pts for each top - division english title , 5pts for each fa cup or other european trophy win , and 3pts for each league cup win
some trophies are bigger than others ; few would disagree a league title is more impressive than an fa cup , or that a european cup is bigger than a league cup
so we have weighted the trophies , awarding 10 points for each european cup , eight for each league title , five for an fa cup or other european trophy and three for each league cup win
liverpool stay at no1 for example ahead of united , themselves clear of arsenal ( 28 trophies ) in third , villa ( 20 ) in fourth and chelsea ( also 20 ) in fifth
villa and chelsea have both won a european cup but villa âs seven league titles to chelsea âs four made the difference between that pair
after the top five trophy winners come everton and tottenham in sixth and seventh places , everton ahead on points because their nine league titles , the last of them in 1986 - 87 , are far superior to tottenham âs two titles , the second and last in 1960 - 61
spurs are more cup specialists , having won eight fa cups , four league cups and three cups in europe , albeit not the european cup
manchester city , newcastle and sunderland fill out the top 10 places , with rankings 10 to 20 dominated by former premier league teams , among them blackburn , wolves , nottingham forest , sheffield wednesday , leeds , huddersfield , sheffield united , portsmouth and preston among them , all of who have won the english title at least once and all of whom have won between four and 10 major trophies in their histories
bolton in 23rd place are the highest - ranked club never to have won the title , and are 23rd courtesy of their four fa cup wins
