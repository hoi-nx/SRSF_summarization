each time i told her i wanted to play football she would say , â no you âre going to be with your friends â
â ideye was sent to live with his aunt but eventually ran away to train with his old coach and finally told his mum he wanted to make a 200 - mile trip to bayelsa state to play regularly
i went to bayelsa state then ocean boys
once he had signed professional forms , ideye patched up his relationship with his mum
i looked at what your friends were doing and believed if i left you that is how you âd become
â ideye spoke frankly about being sent to live with his aunt in order to keep him out of trouble as a youth having looked well short of his pedigree in the opening months of the season and on the verge of a cut - price deal on deadline day to qatar side al-gharafa , a glorious spell of four goals in six days ( three games ) followed
getting back to the ideye people know
â i think it âs not the right thing to say , â says ideye
