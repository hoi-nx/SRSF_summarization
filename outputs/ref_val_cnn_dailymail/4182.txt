scottish âs title winners were handed a new incentive to reach the promised land of the champions league after uefa confirmed large increases in the cash sums on offer
champions for the last three season , celtic earned Â£ 12.6million for reaching the group stage and winning one of their six matches in 2013/14
the same performance next season would bring in at least Â£ 16m under the new figures announced by eastern europe âs governing body â and that does not include ticket sales
confirming the cash â cycle â for the next three years , uefa will also seek to narrow the gap between the cash available to champions league and europa league clubs
a scottish club participating in the group stage of the junior competition now stands to make in excess of Â£ 4m
significantly , however , the three scottish clubs that enter the europa league qualifiers will now cover their costs via a solidarity payment of Â£ 150,000 â even if they crash out at the first hurdle
celtic failed to make the champions league this season , crashing out to maribor in the qualifiers craig gordon saves against inter in the last 32 europa league clash at the san siro celtic line up against inter but the parkhead club will be greedy for the champions league rewards yet , the europa league remains very much the lesser of uefa âs tournaments and ronny deila , who failed to navigate celtic to the champions league this season , will now come under increasing pressure to deliver qualification â and bigger rewards - this summer
currently top of the league table and chasing four - in - a - row , the parkhead side can expect to make over Â£ 10m if they retain their title and reach next season âs group stage â even if they fail to win a point - an increase from Â£ 6.4m
the rewards for reaching the last 16 â as celtic did most recently in 2012 â will now leap by a whopping Â£ 4m
if an english side were to win next season âs champions league , they would earn around Â£ 74m from central uefa funds alone
becoming champions of scottish is no guarantee of champions league participation , of course , yet the prospect of a Â£ 16m - Â£ 20m windfall is a strong incentive to get it right this time
giorgios samaras scores in the nou camp for celtic in their 6 - 1 loss in the 2013 group stages celtic enjoyed a glamour tie against ac milan in the group stages of the 2013 champions league instalment uefa said the changes are a bid to address this , to narrow the gap between the elite competition and the europa league â the level spfl clubs realistically aspire to â with general secretary gianni infantino insisting : â uefa is really pleased that the new distribution system not only provides for a substantial rise in monies received by clubs participating in the champions league and europa league but also strengthens uefa âs solidarity principle , namely ensuring an even more substantial increase in solidarity payments to clubs
â in this way , the new system provides a better deal for everyone , especially those clubs which did not qualify to the group stage of either of the two uefa club competitions
â for every pound uefa give to clubs in the europa league currently champions league clubs receive Â£ 4.30
â there is more money now coming into the europa league and more potentially available to scottish âs participants via solidarity payments if they do nât make it to the group stage
yet celtic used the europa league group stage as a parachute after champions league failure last season
with a stated goal of competing with celtic as soon as possible , the gap becomes more and more difficult to bridge every year their rivals win the scottish title and have another crack at the champions league
barnett argues differently , however , and added : â celtic could make Â£ 3m to Â£ 4m for reaching the group stage and for a club like celtic , playing in scottish , that is big money
