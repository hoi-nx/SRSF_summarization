emails ? what emails ? secretary clinton did n't address her growing email scandal on monday as she spoke about global progress on the role of women scripted : when melinda gates ( left ) , chelsea clinton ( center ) and secretary clinton ( right ) participated monday in the unveiling of a clinton foundation report on women 's rights , nothing was left to chance he 'll handle it : white house press secretary earnest said monday during his press briefing that president obama exchanged emails with secretary clinton at her private , non-government email address earnest said the president actually learned from those news reports of clinton 's privately run email server , but was familiar with her private account earlier because the two had exchanged emails when she was in office
obama did not know at the time that she was using private email exclusively , earnest said
when she sat down to lead more informal conversations with invited speakers , participants appeared to be reading from teleprompters
' last week , clinton said in a twitter message that she wanted her emails released by the state department as soon as possible â but did not address why she does not put them out herself immediately
clinton 's spokesmen and the state department have said she never received or transmitted classified information on her private email account , in which case there would be no concerns that disclosure of her messages could compromise national security
the state department is reviewing 55,000 pages of emails that she has turned over and republicans in congress have said they plan to review her email practices .
