some of the most popular family restaurants are serving children âs meals with dangerously high levels of salt , a survey has revealed
more than a quarter of meals sampled contained over an entire day âs salt allocation for a child under the age of four
experts warned last night that chain restaurants â disregard for child health risks creating a generation addicted to salt , leading to raised blood pressure , heart attacks and strokes
it found that 28 per cent of the meals surveyed contained more than 2g of salt , an entire day âs allowance for a child under four , and 7 per cent contained more than 3g , the allowance for a child under seven
â the meal with the most salt content was the burger king kid âs veggie bean burger with small fries , which contained 4.6g of salt per serving , the equivalent of nine packets of crisps
hungry horse âs ham with mashed potato and baked beans contained 4.2g of salt per serving
other meals in the top ten for salt came from beefeater , bella italia , wetherspoon and nando âs
â a beefeater spokesman said : â as a popular family friendly restaurant visited by thousands of people every week , we are constantly working hard to bring down the salt content of our meals and we take our responsibilities towards public health very seriously
