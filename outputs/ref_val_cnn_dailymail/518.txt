the increase is so noticeable that the world 's trees and plants now store almost four billion more tonnes of carbon than they did in 2003
thousands of square miles of rainforest is cleared in the amazon ( pictured ) each year to make way for farming land - a pattern of destruction that takes place all around the world - but despite this , the planet has got greener in the past decade , with the total amount of plant coverage increasing overall this is thanks to tree - planting in china , forest regrowth in former soviet states because of abandoned farms , and more lush savannas because of higher rainfall
scientists analysed 20 years of satellite data and found an increase in carbon , despite ongoing large - scale tropical deforestation in brazilian and indonesia , according to research published on monday in nature climate change
carbon flows between the world 's oceans , air and land
it is present in the atmosphere primarily as carbon dioxide ( co2 ) - the main climate - changing gas - and stored as carbon in trees
the greening of earth is thanks to tree - planting in china , forest regrowth in former soviet states because of abandoned farms and more lush savannas because of abandoned farms and higher rainfall
there are more trees in china because of planting programmes that have been running for a few decades
vegetation has increased on the savannahs of australia , africa and south america as a result of increasing rainfall
russia and former soviet republics have seen the regrowth of forests since huge collective farms have been abandoned
while the four - billion - tonne increase is helpful , it is small compared to the 60 billion tonnes of carbon released into the atmosphere by fossil fuel burning and cement production over the same period , said liu , the study 's lead author and a scientist at the university of new south wales
' dr liu , who specialises in observing the water cycle , including rainfall and soil moisture , used a new technique of collecting satellite data on radio frequency radiation naturally emitted by the earth to calculate the amount of vegetation in a given area
he had expected to find increased forests in china , which has had tree - planting projects for two to three decades , as well as on abandoned farmland in former soviet countries
china has had tree - planting projects for two to three decades and is now boosting the earth 's greenery , researchers say
here , two giant pandas rest on the outskirts of chengdu in china 's sichuan province but he was surprised to discover the large expansion in vegetation due to higher rainfall on tropical savannas and shrublands in australia , africa and south america
' savannas and shrublands are vulnerable to rainfall â one year can be very wet , and more carbon will be fixed in plants , but the next year can be very dry , and then we will lose the carbon fixed in previous years , ' dr liu explained
