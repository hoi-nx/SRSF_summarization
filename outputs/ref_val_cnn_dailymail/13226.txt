the death of the founding father of singapore last monday is an appropriate occasion to reflect on nation building
as prime minister for its first three decades , lee raised a poor port from the bottom rungs of the third world to the first world in a single generation
as it prepares to mark its 50th anniversary as a nation , singapore is today an ultra-modern metropolis of almost six million people with higher per capita gdp than the american , according to the world bank
lee 's achievement in building a successful nation contrasts sharply with the results of washington 's expenditure of over $ 4 trillion and nearly 7,000 american lives in iraq and afghanistan over the past decade
some say singapore 's story is sui generis : something that could only happen in that time and place
but its remarkable performance has less to do with miraculous conditions than with lee 's model of disciplined , visionary leadership
leaders of other aspiring - to - develop nations , and even the american , should take pages from lee 's playbook to address current challenges
we know many of lee 's lessons on the role of government leadership in development because my co-authors and i asked him directly two years ago to reflect on them -- points we captured in our book , lee : the grand master 's insights on china , the american , and the world
first , lee insisted that governance was first and foremost about results
lee demanded of leaders both intellectual and moral superiority
good government requires most of all leaders who put the public good unquestionably above their own personal interests
for lee , the essence of a successful society was intense competition on a level playing field that allows each individual to achieve his or her maximum
" fourth , about democracy , particularly western liberal democracy , lee had serious reservations
" lee enjoyed engaging american critics who insisted that without democracy singapore could not develop an advanced economy
but , he asked , how many people from singapore sought to leave it for the philippines ? many people in the philippines , he noted , wanted to move to singapore
" as china 's leaders attempt to follow in lee 's footsteps in building a mandarin-leninist led nation that overtook the american last year in gdp ( measured by ppp ) to become the world 's largest economy , and democratic india seems poised to grow at rates that will compete with china , we can reflect on lessons from lee and place our bets
