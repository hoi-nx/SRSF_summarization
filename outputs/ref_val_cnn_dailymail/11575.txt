balls was accused of having â lost his marbles â yesterday after painting an â apocalyptic â picture of uk under another five years of tory government
later however , mr balls was forced to admit that even he did not believe the foreign office would be abolished
the 31 - page labour document painted a bleak picture of life under a tory â 35 per cent state â , a reference to plans to reduce public spending as a proportion of gdp
mr balls insisted a conservative government would have to make Â£ 70billion of spending cuts to eliminate the budget deficit by 2017/18
he suggested avoiding some of the â extreme cuts â outlined in the document would be possible only by raising vat , slashing the nhs budget or imposing charges for healthcare
asked if he â seriously believed that the tory will close down the foreign office or close down the department for transport or close down the department for work and pensions â , mr balls said : â no i do nât think that
â when asked why such scenarios were included in the dossier , he said : â because what the document says is if the government was to do those spending cuts , which are bigger in the next parliament than in this parliament , on the same basis as in this parliament , that would mean closing the foreign office and the department for work and pensions
â public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018 - 19 , according to the office for budget responsibility 's forecasts of spending cuts the tories accused balls ( pictured above ) of â absurd scaremongering â after he launched a labour dossier which suggested three government departments could disappear under the a tory government even the bbc âs assistant political editor norman smith described the scenario as â an apocalypse â
a labour aide added that the document had set out an â implausible scenario â to illustrate the difficulty of the tories achieving their deficit reduction plan
â i think balls has lost his marbles on this , â he said
â he is making up a set of figures today and i think fairly ludicrously already having to back track from his speech in which he claimed the next tory government would be closing down major government departments
â mr balls insisted that to achieve a budget surplus by the end of the next parliament , mr george osborne would have to deliver â colossal cuts â to public spending
â an unprecedented Â£ 70billion of spending cuts would be deeply destructive and close to impossible , even for this chancellor , â he said
â labour 's doom - laden dossier says the tories â â extreme plans â would mean Â£ 70billion in cuts and have a â crushing impact â on public services
shadow chancellor balls end of the nhs claim : labour said tory plans are â so extreme as to make them close to impossible to deliver while maintaining current projections for areas such as the nhs ... a 35 per cent state is not compatible with an nhs as we know it
â reality : the tory - led coalition has repeatedly protected nhs spending from cuts â despite complaints that this has meant more painful reductions elsewhere â and repeated a pledge to ensure real - terms increases until 2020
foreign office closed claim : if cuts fell on government departments on the same basis as they did in this parliament , three of them â the foreign office , department for work and pensions and department for transport â would â cease to exist â
â police cut to 1970s levels claim : in the next parliament , mr balls said tory plans â would be equivalent to 29,900 police officers lost and 6,700 pcsos [ police community support officers ] lost â
reality : crime is the best illustration of the tory mantra that it is possible to do â more for less in public services â
smallest army in 350 years claim : labour suggested tory plans would mean â the smallest army since cromwell â
there would be 34,500 fewer soldiers and 60,800 fewer personnel , which would â fundamentally impact on the uk âs ability to project power around the world at a time when we face multiple threats â
balls told the bbc in january : â there will be no additional funding for local government unless we can find money from somewhere else , but we have not been able to do that in the case of local government
