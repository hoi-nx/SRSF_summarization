a terrified woman who knew her sister - in - law had been murdered by their mother - in - law kept quiet about the crime for seven years because she was scared she would suffer the same fate
sarbjit eventually found the courage to speak out about the so - called ' honour killing ' and bring her murderous mother - in - law to justice
now she has shared her story with the ci show britain 's darkest taboos as she hopes her experience will encourage other victims trapped in violent marriages to speak out
sarbjit struggled to settle into her new home where her mother - in - law bachan ruled the roost
' honour killing ' : sarbjit , left , on her wedding day with her sister - in - law surjit who was murdered by their mother - in - law and her husband when she tried to get a divorce but she did find companionship in her new sister - in - law surjit , 18 , who was married to her husband 's brother , sukhdave
sarbjit said : ' my role in the family after i got married was to cook and clean , take care of the family , take care of the extended family if they were coming round , cooking and cleaning and then accompanying our mother - in - law to other occasions
' when surjit and sarbjit both had children , their mother - in - law took over their upbringing as well
' while sarbjit felt powerless , her sister - in - law surjit started rebelling against their treatment
her husband and mother - in - law started beating her because they said such behaviour brought them shame - but surjit remained defiant
upon hearing this , sarbjit said their mother - in - law was enraged and told her , ' your sister will have divorce over my dead body
' sarbjit did n't realise quite how far bachan would go to stop her daughter - in - law leaving her son until it was too late
murderous matriarch : bachan was jailed for life in 2007 for her part in surjit 's death bachan arranged for surjit to go to india with her - but the young women never returned from the trip
sarbjit said her sister - in - law had only gone because bachan tricked her
she explains : ' my mother - in - law spoke to surjit and said , " before you have your divorce i want you to come to a family trip to india with me
do your duty as a daughter - in - law and then when you come back you can have your divorce
" ' when bachan returned from the two - week trip without surjit , she and sukhdave told surjit 's two children that their mother had run away and left them because she did n't love them
sarbjit knew her sister - in - law would never do such a thing and confronted her mother - in - law
" ' she told me , " surjit was driven out in a jeep and surjit was drugged , strangled and her body was thrown in the river
" ' sarbjit was shocked and horrified by the confession but she was too scared to go to the police and tell them what bachan had told her
she now knew what her mother - in - law was capable of and was scared she or her children could be her next victim
' for years , sarbjit continued to live in fear and silence while surjit 's family tried to find out what happened to her
thanks to the people he met in india , who remembered surjit 's visit , and how her mother - in - law and husband tried to cover their tracks after her disappearance , he is finally able to piece together a picture of what happened to surjit
sarbjit reveals she was chilled to the bone when her mother - in - law told her , ' we 're going to take a trip to india '
the mother has now trained as pcso as she wants to help others in need ' i realised that i had to get out , ' sarbjit said she she fled to dci driscoll and urged him to arrest bachan , and sukhdave right away
