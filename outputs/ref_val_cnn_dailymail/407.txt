comedian and prankster mandel became the butt of a joke when his house was tp 'd with more than 4,000 rolls of toilet paper
fellow prankster atwood brought the toilet paper and friends to mandel 's californian mansion as the deal or no deal host was flying home from new york
they unloaded the truck full of materials and atwood and friends - along with mandel 's son - covered the house end to end
they unpacked it all and lined the house before throwing it on to the roof with toilet paper ready and lined up with the house , atwood , friends and mandel 's family took turns throwing rolls when mandel ( pictured ) arrived home , however , he did not seem pleased with the mess
at first he was shocked anyone could get into his gated community atwood even wrote a special message with the toilet paper - ' smile more ' - and mandel eventually found humor in the prank
but by the end of the prank when atwood reveals himself , mandel laughed and embraced the toilet paper mess
