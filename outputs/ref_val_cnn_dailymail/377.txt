tebow , whose stint as a nfl quarterback briefly sparked ' tebow - mania ' , spent monday trying to make a comeback in a workout for the eagles
but after one day of training , tebow left without being signed , according to espn nfl insider schefter
the 27 - year - old who once played for the denver and new york jets performed for the eagles and coach kelly in hopes of trying out for a quarterback position , a source told ap. tebow , pictured in august 20123 , trained with the eagles on monday in an attempt to try out for a quarterback position considering all the offseason moves made by kelly , taking a look at the 2007 heisman trophy winner with the huge following should n't be a surprise
tebow elicited interest from millions of fans in large part for his public displays of religious faith on and off the field , a head - bowing genuflecting move on one knee that became known as ' tebowing ' in the wake of his success
but tebow 's 47 - per cent pass - completion rate was the worst in the nfl that season and when the denver signed peyton manning in 2012 , tebow became expendable
tebow was seldom used even as new york jets starter sanchez struggled
the new england patriots made tebow one of their final roster cuts in 2013 and he spent last year as a college gridiron television commentator when no nfl team wanted him
tebow , pictured here in august 2013 , left training on monday without signing with the eagles
but espn nfl insider schefter left the idea open , claiming ' we 'll see if anything changes ' tebow was being assessed by an eagles team that features sanchez , who joined philadelphia after his own departure from the new york jets , and bradford , a quarterback who missed most of last season with a torn left knee ligament
although tebow had some success in denver , his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the nfl
