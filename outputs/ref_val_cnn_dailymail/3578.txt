an asteroid so large it has the potential to cause widespread devastation is on its way towards earth
but despite being called a â pha â ( pha ) by nasa , experts are telling people not to be worried
the huge rock , called 2014 asteroid 2014 yb35 , will sail past the planet tomorrow morning at a distance so large it it is 11.7 times further than the distance between earth and the moon
it was discovered by the catalina sky survey at the university of arizona
the asteroid is estimated to be 1,640ft - wider ( 500 metres ) which would be large enough to cause devastation - but it will not hit earth and while this event will occur without incident , the experts added it is a reminder of how many dangerous space rocks there are in our planet âs vicinity
the asteroid is estimated to be about 1,640ft ( 500 metres ) wide which , if it hit earth , would be large enough to cause widespread devastation - although there is no chance of this happening
however , it is estimated that there are about 25,000 near - earth objects ( neos ) larger than 460ft ( 140 metres ) , bodies that come close to earth but do n't necessarily hit our planet
on average , earth is hit by a football pitch - sized rock every 5,000 years , and a civilisation - ending asteroid every one million years , according to nasa 's neos
last year , the privately - funded b612 foundation discovered that earth is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought
relative to earth , asteroid 2014 asteroid 2014 yb35 is travelling at 23,000 mph ( 37,000 km / h ) , and its closest approach tomorrow will be 2,779,956 miles ( 4,473,907km )
it was first discovered by the catalina sky survey at the university of arizona in december 2014 , and will make an even closer , but still safe , approach in 2033 - 2,069,166 miles ( 3,330,000km )
nasa lists 2014 asteroid 2014 yb35 as a â pha â ( pha ) but , as yet , there is no chance of an impact scheduled for any point in future
â this â potential â to make close earth approaches does not mean a pha will impact the earth , â said nasa
a single au - au - is the distance from earth to the sun credit : nasa last year experts warned that we must do more to track asteroids , as one could cause widespread damage to the planet
it is estimated that of the million or so asteroids that could cause major damage on earth , we are aware of only about 10,000 - or one per cent
