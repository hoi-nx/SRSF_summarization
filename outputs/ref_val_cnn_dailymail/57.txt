sir clive woodward , world cup winning coach , gives his views on the good points and bad points of england 's 25 - 13 win over scotland in the rbs 6 nations at twickenham
the 12 - point win means stuart lancaster âs side have an excellent chance of claiming an unlikely championship title if they can see off france more convincingly than ireland beat scotland or wales beat italy
but the display was strewn with errors and england delivered less than they should have done , although there were positive signs
england captain chris robshaw lifts the calcutta cup after england beat scotland , but it was a mixed bag what i liked the creative spark i am enjoying england âs creativity and their ability to fashion try - scoring opportunities , even if they must be more clinical in accepting them
the caveat is that scotland were poor and most top international defences are akin to that which england encountered in dublin , the only rbs 6 nations game this season when the england backs have been blunted
george ford is a sublime late passer of the ball and clearly has the composure for test matches joseph has such quick feet and that is an attribute that can be lethal when linked with ford settled at the back ford and ben youngs are now established as starters and an established half - back pairing is a boon to any side
equally , i believe the back three of mike brown , jack nowell and anthony watson are probably the preferred trio going forward and joseph is a must at outside centre with the cutting edge he now brings â four tries in four rbs 6 nations games this season
ben youngs ( right ) is part of an established half - back pairing with ford and that is a boon to any side courtney lawes the hitman northampton lock courtney lawes is one of the key men for england , with an athleticism that matches anything in the southern hemisphere
add joe launchbury to the mix and england have arguably the best second - row pairing in world rugby
courtney lawes is a key man for england and his athleticism matches anything in the southern hemisphere sniff of a trophy the southern hemisphere teams , and indeed ireland and wales , wo nât be particularly bothered whether england win the title or not â only grand slams impress the rugby world at large â but england winning the title could be important
they have won nothing under stuart lancaster â england have won only one title since 2003 â so to chalk up a championship would be a useful stepping stone and receiving the trophy at twickenham would help set up the year ahead
better from the bench england still have nât got this entirely right , as they showed against ireland , but against the scots on saturday tom youngs and geoff parling , in particular , made a big impact that was nât quite reflected on the scoreboard
jack nowell scores for england against scotland , he has returned to the international scene a stronger player video o2 inside line : england v scotland match review and what i did nât centre headache inside centre
england need a better â footballing â 12 and might have farrell in mind , but he has endured an injury - hit 12 months and does he fit into the dynamic of england âs back line ? you would think manu tuilagi must play some role but is he similar to luther burrell ? if not , where do you play him and who do you drop ? henry slade could well be a strong contender but england have been reluctant to blood him , which is a badly missed opportunity
luther burrell has good qualities but no kicking game , england need a better ' fooballing ' 12 in the side matching george ford clearly has composure at test level but others do not â so much so that gilt - edged opportunities went begging against scotland
ford has the composure required for test level but the scotland game showed that others do not missed the boat it is too late now to integrate danny cipriani and steffon armitage into your starting team
ford is my first - choice 10 but i would have started danny cipriani against the scots as we had to see him in a competitive match
england can not start either against france now and that âs the only match that matters before the world cup , the only real test
i would have started danny cipriani against the scots as we had to see him in a competitive match paying the penalty there were 13 penalties against ireland and 10 against the scots , which is still too high
england are conceding too many penalties when either in no immediate danger from opponents or needlessly when on the attack â for instance , joe marler going in on the angle in the first half when england had the scotland scrum on toast and it was odds on for a pushover try
the england line - out has been strong but it must be better , the very best in the world , reaching perfection kick in the teeth ford is good but he is not a world - class kicker yet at test level , and he missed two shots again on saturday
leigh halfpenny is the standard in terms of world - class kickers , ford is good but not at that level yet where âs our fortress ? fortress twickenham : england âs magnificent home ground still is nât the citadel it needs to be for the world cup
going in to the final weekend of the rbs 6 nations , four teams - england , ireland , wales and france - are still in with a shout of claiming the trophy
