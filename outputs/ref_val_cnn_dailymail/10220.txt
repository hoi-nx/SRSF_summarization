two underground craters measuring 400km together in size have been discovered in central australia , sparking the possibility of a previously unknown asteroid impact event 300 million years ago that caused many species to go extinct
the impact zone was found in the warburton basin in two parts , each 200km wide , indicating the meteor that created them split into two before smashing into the earth
even though it was found two kilometres underground , the impact zone is now the largest in the world , by over 100km
dr glikson from anu indicates that the size of the asteroid means it could have impacted a mass extinction the precise age of the crater is not yet known exactly , but researchers think it may be around 300 million years
â we can not define this impact zone in anywhere near the degree of detail we can define the ones exposed on the surface , ' lead researcher dr glikson of the australian national university told daily mail australia
' the impact zone extends through the earth 's crust which is around 30km thick in australia
after using geothermal research to look at the internal heat of the earth and seismic data to see the vibrations of the earth 's surface , the team of geophysicists released high velocity shocks two kilometres underground by drilling
the impact zone was found in the warburton basin in australia and spans 400 kilometres scientists have been using information from a major 2010 discovery that showed a large meteorite strike 66 million years ago wiped out the dinosaurs
