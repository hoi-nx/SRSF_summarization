the 21 - year - old son of a utah doctor found guilty of murder in the 2011 death of his cancer researcher ex-wife has spoken out about how he fought for three years for his father to be convicted
salt lake city pediatrician john brickman wall , 51 , was convicted of killing uta von schwedler in september 2011 amid a bitter custody dispute
he faces up to life in prison
the case was highly contentious , with prosecutors alleging john brickman wall had murdered his wife while defense attorneys claimed von schwedler killed herself
their son , wall , said that though his father told him and his three siblings that their mother had killed herself , he did n't believe it
' as i thought about ... my dad 's behavior before and after her death , it became more and more apparent to me that - that he was responsible for killing her , ' wall told cbs 's 48 hours
prosecutors alleged john brickman wall attacked 49 - year - old uta von schwedler with a knife , dosed her with an anti-anxiety drug xanax and drowned her in her bathtub
defense attorneys countered that the theory was unbelievable , and it was more likely von schwedler killed herself
her death initially was treated as a suicide
but family and friends pushed for more investigation , saying the researcher showed no signs of wanting to end her life
' part of the reason i was concerned for my safety as well as my sibling 's safety - was that i saw this anger that he had towards my mother , ' wall said

on the day before his 18th birthday in january 2012 , wall moved out of his father 's house into the home of his best friend , jessica oglesby , and was welcomed by her parents with open arms
the children were all moved into homes of family friends
wall countered his father 's lawsuit with a wrongful death suit , holding his father responsible in the death of his mother
john brickman wall was eventually arrested and put on trial for the murder of von schwedler
the evidence in the case was unusual : a medical examiner thought the shallow cuts on von schwedler 's wrists and leg looked like she was defending herself from an attack , but he could n't explain the fatal level of xanax in her system

he said now he wants a confession from his father for the prosecution , spilled antihistamine pills on the floor , a house in disarray and bloodstains in von schwedler 's bed showed she was attacked
prosecutors said von schwedler studied childhood leukemia and recently made a discovery that could help find new treatments for the disease
she had no prescription for xanax , but john wall filled a large one for his mother months before his ex-wife 's death
after the verdict was read , the wall thanked police for years of investigation and ' uncommon persistence
' johnny never succeeded to destroy uta von schwedler 's joy for life , but he ended up taking her life , ' she said
