cancer survival rates in britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other european countries , experts warn
even for breast cancer â one of the most treatable forms of the disease â the figures are still well below those reached by france , sweden and italy in the late 1990s
macmillan cancer support has described the situation as â shameful â and warns too many patients are dying needlessly here when they would survive had they been treated elsewhere in european
cancer survival rates in britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other european countries , despite billions of pounds being spent to improve the britain 's survival rates ( file picture , posed by models ) and despite billions being spent to improve cancer survival rates over the last 15 years â Â£ 640million invested by labour in the early 2000s and Â£ 750million by the tories â britain does not appear to have gained any ground
data analysed by macmillan shows that 81 per cent of breast cancer sufferers in britain survive five years
in these countries the survival rates are now 86 per cent or higher
for bowel cancer , 54 per cent of britain can expect to survive five years , whereas in the late 1990s it was already 59 per cent in finland and 55 per cent in norway , the netherlands and france
what we can see here is that better cancer survival rates are not unachievable
the figures are taken from a comparison of survival rates of european countries carried out by researchers at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , known as the â concord programme â
