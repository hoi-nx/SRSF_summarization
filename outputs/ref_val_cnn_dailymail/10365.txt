a Â£ 13,500 holiday of a lifetime turned into a living hell for angela swann and andrew smith who say they were infected with gastric illnesses a holiday to zanzibar that should have left a couple with lovely memories , has instead left them in turmoil ' also sometimes some of the food served did not appear fresh and some of the food on occasions did not appear hot enough
' nichola blackburn , the legal expert in irwin mitchell 's international personal injury law team who is representing angela swann and andrew smith , said : ' we are conducting investigations into what was the cause of the illness angela swann and andrew smith suffered from
the couple 's week stay at the all - inclusive stay at the hideaway of nungwi resort and spa turned sour after the pair fell ill ' as we conduct our investigations we would urge anyone who stayed at the hideaway of nungwi resort and spa and who may be able to provide information about the conditions there to get in contact with us as soon as possible
' sadly , their story of working and saving to afford a luxury break only for the holiday to be ruined by serious illness is an unfortunate one , and understandably such issues have left angela swann and andrew smith frustrated and desperate for answers regarding the illness they have suffered
