with the discovery of a gray , fossilized jawbone in a remote corner of ethiopia , a student at arizona state university may have changed our understanding of our earliest ancestors
the jawbone has been dated to 2.8 million years ago -- which predates the previously known fossils of the homo lineage by approximately 400,000 years , according to arizona state university
seyoum , a graduate student from ethiopia , came across the fossil -- the left side of a lower jaw with five teeth -- while on a field expedition in the afar region of eastern ethiopia in 2013
" the age of the fossil means it could help fill in an important gap in our knowledge
fossil found by fisherman may reveal new type of ancient human it also means the homo genus could have evolved nearly half a million years earlier than previously thought
researchers have previously found fossil remains dating back 3 million years or more , such as the skeleton of " lucy , " the famous 3.2 million - year - old remains of the species australopithecus afarensis
scientists have also found fossils that are 2.3 million years old and younger , which are in the genus homo and are closer to modern day humans
but until now there has been little fossil evidence from the 700,000 years in between -- a crucial period in the evolution from hominids like lucy to the homo genus
" the jawbone , found in the ledi - geraru area of the afar region , combines features seen in australopithecus afarensis with those seen in later specimens of the homo genus , according to the study
