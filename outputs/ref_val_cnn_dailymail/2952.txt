the children watch on excitedly as the male raccoon chases the female from the fence and into the garden as the youngsters speculate about whether they will jump from the fence â before a little â muffin man â song interlude â one of the raccoons descends into the garden closely pursued by the other
one child , sensing the tension , asks : â can raccoons fight ? â while another exclaims : â woah , they âre wrestling
