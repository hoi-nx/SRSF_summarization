a daredevil swiss wingsuit flyer has jumped off the side of a mountain in pitch darkness and flown down past huge pillars of rock using only the light from two bright red flares
and the amazing night - time flight by patrick kerber , 33 , was not only captured on video , but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer meier
in the picture patrick kerber 's route appears as a glowing red line running down from the top of the 10,000 - foot titlis mountain in the resort town of engelberg in central swiss to the bottom
he said : ' i wanted to do a wingsuit base flight at night during winter for a very long time
' the idea became reality when they decided to try and do a single photograph on a slow shutter speed and at the same time fit a light to the jumper so that the flight down the mountain could be recorded
they solved it , though , by using two superheated emergency flares
patrick kerber said : ' we used flares exactly like the ones used for rescue missions or emergencies
to show how dangerous the jump was , patrick kerber did a trial run in daylight a slight mistake would have sent patrick kerber crashing into craggy rocks the wingsuit jump produced a dramatic video , with patrick kerber zooming down the mountain at breakneck speed ' there definitely was a lot of pressure
patrick kerber also had to wait until the torches burned out before he could open the parachute
if this one burns or melts , it 's over ! ' patrick kerber decided to use two torches
' patrick kerber has jumped at night before , but not in winter and only at full moon
