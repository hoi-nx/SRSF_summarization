nasa had chosen the ambitious mission that will visit a comet and pluck a boulder from its surface to create an orbiting base for astronauts
a robot ship will pluck a large boulder off an asteroid and sling it around the moon , becoming a destination to prepare for future human missions to mars , the u.s. space agency has revealed
after extensive studies , nasa opted to collect and move a boulder , a mission that will cost about $ 100 million more , but which better prepares the agency for the ultimate goal of landing astronauts on mars
nasa plans to study the asteroid for about a year and test deflection techniques that one day may be necessary to save earth from a potentially catastrophic collision
the mission involves flying a robotic spacecraft , powered by solar electric propulsion , to an asteroid for an extensive survey
the mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next - generation orion
after the orion and the asteroid are attached , the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object
once the orion docks with the remote - operated asteroid capture device , the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from , the video shows
after the mission is complete , orion returns to earth on the same path it journeyed out on , loops around the moon included , and splashes down in an ocean - likely the pacific-10 days later
the mission is seen as an important step towards eventually sending humans to mars and returning them safely
the probe would include a docking ring so a orion spaceship , carrying two astronauts , could reach the asteroid , a mission targeted for around 2025
nasa 's ultimate goal is to send humans to mars , and they say the asteroid redirect mission ( arm ) will be an important stepping stone towards getting there
astronauts aboard nasa 's orion spacecraft , launched from the upcoming sls ( sls ) rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the mid- 2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon nasa plans to launch an arm robotic spacecraft to rendezvous with , capture and redirect an asteroid by the end of this decade
astronauts aboard nasa 's orion spacecraft , launched from the upcoming sls ( sls ) rocket , will then explore the asteroid in the mid- 2020s at the furthest point in its controlled orbit around the moon
this includes advanced sep ( sep ) - one of the critical technologies needed to send larger payloads into deep space and to the mars system
the agency plans to announce the specific asteroid selected for the mission no earlier than 2019 , approximately a year before launching the robotic spacecraft
returning asteroid samples will help nasa develop tools and techniques for future space exploration
nasa was also working on a mission concept that would fully enclose a large asteroid using an inflatable system and the other would capture a smaller boulder from of a much larger asteroid using robotic arms
the arm crewed mission , in which astronauts will explore the redirected asteroid around the moon , provides unique opportunities to test human spaceflight capabilities as well
this will allow the crew aboard orion to attach to the arm robotic spacecraft and study the asteroid
this could be later used to connect orion with a deep space habitat or ' stepping stone ' on its way to mars , or even station cargo and fuel depots in strategic places such as lunar orbit
astronauts returning home with samples from mars will hold a treasure trove of research scientists will study to unlock new knowledge about mars and the solar system 's history
in the enhanced gravity tractor approach , the spacecraft would first pick up a boulder from the asteroid 's surface as in mission option b. the spacecraft with the collected boulder would then orbit in a circular halo around the asteroid 's velocity vector
as well as this , returning asteroid samples will help nasa develop tools and techniques for future space exploration
