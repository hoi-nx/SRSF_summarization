melissa was sold into the sex trade by a family member when she was only 12 years old
her life became a prison : chained to a bed in a warehouse , she endured regular beatings , rapes and once was even set on fire by her captors as she was forced to serve 5 to 30 men every day
the experience was enough for her to wish she was dead
and while institutionalized slavery has long been cast from united states 's history books , thousands of children still suffer from the bonds of sex trafficking
indeed , with the average age of a victim only 13 years old , these horrific crimes are stealing the innocent childhoods of kids across united states
and the problem is n't confined to one part of the country
two bills we have introduced to combat this horrific crime recently passed the judiciary committee with strong support and will have the opportunity for consideration by the judiciary committee
when a state passes a safe harbor law , it means that kids sold for sex are steered towards child protection services , rather than being arrested , charged , or convicted under a state 's criminal statutes
we must do everything we can to free them from the shackles of sex trafficking
we must join together and take action to combat this modern - day slavery once and for all .
