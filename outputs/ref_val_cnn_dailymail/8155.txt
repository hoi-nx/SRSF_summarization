iraqi requested the strikes , which began wednesday and are ' ongoing , ' according to the unnamed us official
al-abadi praised all the groups involved in the battle against the islamic state group , including the so - called popular mobilization forces , which the us calls iran - backed militias , the sunnis tribes and coalition forces
us airstrikes in tikrit raise highly sensitive questions about participating in an iraqi campaign that has been spearheaded by iraqi shiite militias trained and equipped by iran , an avowed us adversary
difficulties : militias like the imam ali brigades , one of whose members is shown , have encircled isil forces but have been unable to dislodge them from the city iran has provided artillery and other weaponry for the tikrit battle , and senior iran advisers have helped iraqi coordinate the offensive
iraqi pointedly did not request us air support when it launched the offensive in early march and recently , the offensive has lost momentum
col warren , a pentagon spokesman , said wednesday the iraqi forces have encircled tikrit but not yet made significant inroads into the heavily defended city limits
the us has hundreds of military advisers in iraqi helping its security forces plan operations against the islamic state , which occupies large chunks of northern and western iraqi
but the us has said it is not coordinating any military actions with the iran
the us - led air campaign , launched in august and joined by several european allies , has allowed iraqi forces to halt the isis group 's advance and claw back some of the territory militants seized last summer
uneasy : militiamen guarding the front line in the battle between iraqi forces and isil militants , a battle which has ' stalled ' recently but the growing iran presence on the ground has complicated the mission , with washington refusing to work directly with a country it views as a regional menace , yet is currently embroiled with iran in sensitive negotiations over a nuclear deal
hadi al-amiri , leader of the badr organization and a commander of iraqi 's shiite militias , told reporters in samarra : ' if we need them ( the us - led coalition ) we will tell them we need them
' we heard quite a bit from the iraqi and some even from the iran â some fairly high - confidence statements about how rapidly the operations for tikrit would go , " warren said
