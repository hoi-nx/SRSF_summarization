a giant semi-fossilised egg that is almost 100 times larger than a chicken 's egg and still has the tiny skeleton of a bird inside is to go on sale for more than Â£ 50,000
the rare egg , which is 12 inches long and more than eight inches in diametre , belonged to the now extinct elephant bird that lived on madagascar
the flightless birds , which stood nearly 10 feet ( three metres ) tall and weighted half a tonne , died out in the 17th century after heavy hunting
genetic material has been extracted from the shells of ancient elephant bird eggs
by injecting the genetic material into the unfertilised eggs of other large flightless birds like the ostrich , it may be possible to recreate the elephant bird
scans taken of the egg , which is at least 400 years old , have also revealed the tiny bones of an embryo that had started to grow inside along with dehydrated organic material
he said : ' the eggs of elephant birds are extremely rare - there are probably 25 of them in the world
' a ct scan of the elephant bird egg revealed dehydrated organic matter , shown as pink in the image above , and fragments of fetal bone still preserved inside the egg , shown by the small white mark in the pink material the egg that has come up for sale ( left ) is one of the largest in the world and was laid by the now extinct elephant bird ( right ) which grew to around ten feet tall and lived in madagascar until the 17th century the elephant bird , or aepyornis maximus , was one of the largest birds to have ever lived
they are thought to have been common in madagascar until they wre hunted into extinction during the 17th century
the ct scans took slices through the egg and revealed dehydrated organic material and bone fragments inside another elephant bird egg was sold in 2013 for Â£ 66,675 - more than twice its expected value
douglas g. d. russell , senior curator of birds , eggs and nests at the natural history museum in london , said the elephant bird eggs were now very rare
