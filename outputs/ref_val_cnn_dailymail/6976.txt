the presumptive presidential candidate for the democratic , used a personal email account when secretary of state , rather than a government - issued email address the computer server that transmitted and received clinton 's emails - on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was secretary of state - traced back to an internet service - registered to her family 's home in chappaqua , new york , according to records reviewed
the highly unusual practice of a cabinet - level official physically running her own email would have given clinton , the presumptive democratic presidential candidate , impressive control over limiting access to her message archives
it also would distinguish clinton 's secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians , including mitt romney and sarah palin , who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by microsoft corp. and yahoo inc. most internet users rely on professional outside companies , such as google or their own employers , for the behind - the - scenes complexities of managing their email communications
in most cases , individuals who operate their own email servers are technical experts or users so concerned about issues of privacy and surveillance they take matters into their own hands
clinton has not described her motivation for using a private email account - hdr22@clintonemail.com - which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym - for official state department business
operating her own server would have afforded clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal , administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails
and since the secret service was guarding clinton 's home , an email server there would have been well protected from theft or a physical hacking
but homebrew email servers are generally not as reliable , secure from hackers or protected from fires or floods as those in commercial data centers

it was unclear whom clinton hired to set up or maintain her private email server , which the ap traced to a mysterious identity , eric hoteham
in november 2012 , without explanation , clinton 's private email account was reconfigured to use google 's servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed , according to internet records
then , in july 2013 , five months after she resigned as secretary of state , clinton 's private email server was reconfigured again to use a denver - based commercial email provider , mx logic , which is now owned by mcafee inc. , a top internet security company
in theory but not in practice , clinton 's official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the u.s. freedom of information act
rep. gowdy , r-s.c. , chairman of the special house committee investigating the benghazi attacks , said the committee learned last summer - when agency documents were turned over to the committee - that clinton had used a private email account while secretary of state
