the best of british come face - to - face on saturday afternoon when austin 's qpr take on harry kane 's tottenham at loftus road
and austin , who has scored the most goals of any english player in the premier league this season , is keen to put his past behind him to be viewed as a footballer and not an ex-builder
to fund himself while playing for clubs like kintbury rangers and hungerford town , austin was a builder by trade , but now the time has come for a change in mentality
austin ( right ) thinks he has scored enough goals to be considered a footballer rather than a builder austin has come up through the ranks , starting in non-league and working his way to the top ' i have scored 100 - odd career goals now , ' austin told the sun , ' and think i have done enough to be considered a player rather than a builder who plays football
the now - qpr striker got his first premier league break at swindon town , for whom he scored over 30 goals austin takes on team - mate shaun wright-phillips during a training session at qpr for austin though , that route did n't work out
' coming through the academies did n't work for me , ' the qpr striker continues
' regardless of their differences , austin and harry kane will face each other for the first time on saturday afternoon
austin 's career in football has been the opposite of harry kane , who has been at tottenham for 11 years the 25 - year - old will come face - to - face with harry kane for the first time in his career on saturday afternoon
