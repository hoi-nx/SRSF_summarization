it is the supermodel look that many people aspire too , but it seems our early ancestors may have naturally had waif - like hips and thin legs
scientists examining a 1.9 million year old pelvis and femur have found that a now extinct species of early human had very different bodies to our own
the fossil is thought to belong to either homo rudolfensis or homo habilis , two species of human ancestor that evolved in africa
the 1.9 million year old femur and pelvis above are thought to belong to homo habilis or homo rudolfensis while scientists have long studied the different skull shapes and facial features of these species , they are now turning their attention to their bodies
this would have given these early humans an upright posture but with narrow hips and spindly legs
' the fossilised pelvis and femur fossils were found at the koobi fora site on the eastern shore of lake turkana , in the rift valley of kenya
as the oldest fossils of homo erectus to be found are 1.8 million years old , they concluded that the fossilised bones may belong to to one to two other early human species around at the time - homo habilis or homo rudolfensis
the site where the fossil femur and pelvis were found is shown above along with when they were discovered the site where the fossil femur and pelvis were found was in koobi fora , within the rift valley of kenya there are almost no skeletal pieces in the fossil record for these two species so the discovery has provided scientists a rare glimpse at how they may have looked
the researchers , whose study is published in the journal of human evolution , used ct scans of the fossilised pelvis and femur to compare them to those of other species of primate , early human and modern humans
' this does nât necessarily mean that these early human ancestors moved or lived differently , but it does suggest that they were a distinct species that could have been identified not just from looking at their faces and jaws , but by seeing their body shapes as well
