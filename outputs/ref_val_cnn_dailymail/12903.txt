police in charlottesville , virginia , will publicly discuss on monday the results of their investigation into an alleged gang rape of a uva student , which was initially reported last year in rolling stone magazine
the police findings could put to rest a complicated controversy about the alleged gang rape of a female student at a fraternity party
the accusation has been controversial because of the nature of such a crime and because the accusation itself has been clouded by subsequent questions about the rolling stone article
after the account was published last fall , rolling stone magazine later apologized for discrepancies in its article about the alleged gang rape after friends of the victim expressed doubts about the woman 's account and the accused fraternity chapter denied key details
cnn senior media correspondent stelter described rolling stone 's announcement as falling short of a full - scale retraction
" uva pledges zero - tolerance in rape cases the article chronicled the school 's failure to respond to that alleged assault
however , the uva 's phi kappa psi chapter did not have a party the night of september 28 , 2012 , the date when the alleged attack occurred , or at all that weekend , the chapter said
for example , the accused orchestrator of the alleged rape did not belong to the fraternity , the fraternity house has no side staircase , and there were no pledges at that time of year
