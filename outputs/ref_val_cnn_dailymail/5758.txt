liverpool manager rodgers has experienced the harsh realities of his philosophies being called into question but unlike some critics he has no doubt about the credentials of louis van gaal to get things right at manchester united
they have not lost in the barclays premier league since and , ahead of the clash at anfield on sunday , the perception of liverpool - and rodgers - has changed completely
liverpool manager rodgers has lavished praise on opposite number louis van gaal ( pictured ) rodgers has lauded van gaal ahead of liverpool 's home match against manchester united manchester united are currently two points ahead of liverpool that loss against manchester united was the last in a run of eight matches which brought just eight points and left liverpool in 10th place , seven points off fourth
however , after taking 33 points from a possible 39 they are just two points behind manchester united , who occupy the final champions league spot
manchester united , by contrast , are still failing to impress in van gaal 's first season in charge despite their league position with many questioning whether he actually knows what his best side is and whether he is getting the best out of the talent he has at his disposal
but rodgers believes that should not reflect badly on the dutchman
' he will have seen , coming into this country for the first time , the challenges of this football - it is why it is the most competitive league in the world
van gaal 's manchester united go into the barclays premier league match at anfield in fourth position ' there is no question about the philosophies he has put in place at ajax or barcelona or his achievements and when he leaves manchester united he will still be one of the great managers
' rodgers found himself under similar scrutiny after liverpool 's poor first half of the season but things have turned around and he is flavour of the month once again
rodgers , pictured during liverpool 's slender win over swansea , insists his side will not be taking manchester united lightly ' i am early in my career as a manager but that period benefited me
' liverpool are the top - flight 's form team at the moment but rodgers will not be taking manchester united for granted , whatever the critics say about their performances this season
