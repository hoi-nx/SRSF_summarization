and if you think the only teens who sext are the ones engaging in high - risk behaviors , like drinking , using drugs or skipping school , keep reading
studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit
more than half the undergraduate students who took part in an anonymous online survey said they sent sexually suggestive texts when they were teenagers , according to the study by drexel university , which was published last year by the journal of sexuality research and social policy
another study , this one by the university of texas medical branch at galveston , found that while students who admitted sexting were 32 % more likely to report having sex the next year , sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time
the study , published in the journal pediatrics , found that teens who sexted were not more likely to have multiple sexual partners , use drugs or alcohol before sex or not use birth control
sexting may be the new " normal ' when it comes to adolescent sexual behavior , the study concluded
" i 'm not saying that it 's healthy or that it 's harmless , but it 's not a situation where kids who are depressed are doing this or kids who have very bad self - esteem are doing it , " said englander , who researched sexting , as well as a host of other teenager behaviors , for her recent book " bullying and cyberbullying
no sexting happening in this household
" but there are plenty of apps teens can use to send messages their parents ca n't find later
snapchat , cyber dust , vaporchat and others allow users to send messages that disappear on both the sender and recipient 's phones after a certain period of time
these apps are used by kids and adults alike to send a variety of messages -- from perfectly harmless to potentially dangerous
brutally honest : is it ok to spy on your kids ? graber , who teaches " cyber civics " to middle schoolers in aliso viejo , california , was blown away by the response she got from eighth graders when she , for the first time , included a session on sexting
" they had no idea what the consequences were , " said graber , co-founder of cyberwise.org , a digital literacy site for parents , educators , and tweens and teens
a few students wanted to hang around after the class , which is held at the end of the school day , to talk more about sexting and related things
" she now plans to make it part of her " cyber civics " curriculum , and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting
" we know that throwing the book at them , it 's too much too late , so that 's not working , " said graber , who offers tips for parents on how to help children have safe online relationships
" englander , the psychology professor and researcher , says in her experience , it 's not that adults are n't warning teens about the criminal consequences for underage sexting or how devastating it could be to a teen if their nude photo became public
' it 's not 100 % impossible but even in the early cases of sexting , when ( law enforcement ) did prosecute kids , they did n't go to jail
" englander said what she is most troubled by is not how widespread sexting might be but how teens feel after they sext , especially if they felt pressured to do it
in her own research , she said she found that 92 % of the teens who said they were not pressured to sext reported no problems afterward , but that number is only 68 % for teens who felt pressured into doing it
" that was actually the most common result , that they just felt worse
