" introducing la belle , the 80 - meter gold and crystal - encrusted superyacht described as a floating " boudoir for women , " by its female designer
" but there will be a fantastic spa with a beauty center , large mirrors , and huge wardrobes , " she said of the concept yacht , which she claims is the first designed specifically for women
