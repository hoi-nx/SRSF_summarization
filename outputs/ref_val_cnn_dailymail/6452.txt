playwright bennett , who has said that english is a nation of hypocrites and that english are ' better than all the rest ' at setting double standards we are a nation famed the world over for conquest , industry â and of course a good cup of tea
but according to playwright bennett , what english really excels at is â hypocrisy
â the writer made the astonishing attack as part of a milestone series celebrating the 50th anniversary of bbc radio 4 âs world at one
but in an interview with martha kearney , to be broadcast today , he says he believes that what the english are â better than all the rest â at is setting double standards
he said : â in english , what we do best is lip service
â he went on to claim that too often , the english are lazy in their assumptions that problems which affect other countries do not exist in their own , saying : â our policemen are wonderful , provided you âre white and middle class and do nât take to the streets
as part of his explanation , the writer says that policeman in english are wonderful , ' provided you 're white and middle class and do n't take to the streets ' ( file picture ) and in his letter he says ; â do it english â
