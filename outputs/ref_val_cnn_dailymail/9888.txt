hart is not getting carried away with his current form and admits he could be the â worst goalkeeper in the world again â by the next game
the 27 - year - old put in a world class performance when manchester city played barcelona in the champions league and pulled off a string of saves to keep his side in the game
hart is refusing to get caught up in his own hype despite showing excellent form with his club of late manchester city goalkeeper hart makes a save during training at st george 's park with the england squad hart drew praise from messi , andres iniesta and luis enrique despite manchester city 's european exit messi said : â he was phenomenal , he stopped everything
â it is in stark contrast to the beginning of the season when hart was dropped by city manager manuel pellegrini and replaced by willy caballero , but he has fought his way back
â the english keeper says that ' for all the good stuff ' that he showed in barcelona , his form could easily dip messi tries to find a way past hart but despite a dominant performance barcelona were restricted to a single goal neymar attempts to nip the ball away from hart 's clutches at the nou camp but again is denied hart will reach a half - century of caps if he plays against lithuania and italy in england âs next two games
â will caballero took over the manchester city no 1 spot from hart briefly for a spell earlier this season at the etihad peter shilton was 31 when he won his 50th england cap , while hart could win his against italy next week
