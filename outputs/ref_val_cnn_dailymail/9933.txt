an illinois man who spent nearly two decades in prison for a 1992 rape and murder of a girl , 11 , he did not commit has received a $ 20million settlement
rivera , 42 , was awarded the money in the highest individual settlement given in a wrongful conviction case in u.s. history , his attorneys said on friday at press conference in chicago
rivera was tried three times , the first time when he was 19 years old , and was finally cleared in 2012 when his 2009 conviction was reversed for the rape and murder of holly staker of waukegan
attorney jon loevy said there has never been a wrongful conviction case where the defendants agreed without a trial to pay compensation in such a large amount , according to abc
rivera was coerced into a false confession and his conviction was not an accident or a mistake , said his attorney locke bowman

as he looks forward to a new future , rivera ( right ) plans to go to college and study business management and accounting , and help pay for his mother 's medical bills however , it was later revealed that the shoes were not available for purchase at the time of the murder , and his lawyers said police had tampered with them
one of the critical factors in rivera 's successful appeal was the 2005 dna testing that proved his semen was not the sperm found in holly staker 's body ( above holly staker , 11 , who was raped and murdered in 1992 ) last year , cops linked dna from the semen found in staker with dna obtained from a two - by - four used to brutally beat a man , delwin foxworth , eight years later in 2000
failure to identify and arrest holly staker âs real killer allowed the real killer commit a second murder , according to rivera 's lawyers
