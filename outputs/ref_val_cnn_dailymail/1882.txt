no davis cup match would be complete without some kidology , and some of that duly surrounds the match that everyone in glasgow wants to see this weekend
andy and jamie murray versus world champions bob and mike bryan on saturday looks to be the pivotal rubber of the davis cup first round knockout match between great britain and america , which begins this afternoon at the emirates arena
yet the home side were trying to play down expectations that it would happen on thursday
middlesex 's dom inglot was officially named to play with jamie murray while the former wimbledon champion insisted it was ' unlikely ' he would play on saturday
( from left to right ) dom inglot , jamie murray , captain leon smith , james ward and andy murray fancy their chances of taking down the usa with the backing of a noisy glasgow crowd jamie murray admits he is unlikely to team up with brother jamie murray in an all - sibling davis cup doubles pairing jamie murray will face the usa 's donald young in friday 's opening singles tie in glasgow 's emirates arena jamie murray ( left ) , andy murray ( centre ) and leon smith speak to the media on thursday the smart money , however , would be on a clash of two siblings as the emotional centrepiece of what ought to be a fascinating three days
if , as expected , the match stands at 1 - 1 by friday night then gb captain leon smith will surely opt to throw in his trump card against the world 's leading pair - however unlucky that would be for dom inglot , who has actually beaten them twice this year with romania 's florin mergea
snp versus usa ? let 's not go there
playing america in the davis cup is not what it was twenty years ago , but there is still a cachet about the fixture that was the original challenge match for this competition when it was invented in 1900
jamie murray ( right ) will kick off the tie at glasgow 's emirates arena on friday against donald young bob ( left ) and mike bryan field questions from the press ahead of the weekend 's davis cup action in glasgow his biggest call has been to pick world number 47 donald young as his second singles player , who could find himself playing a deciding rubber against gb number two james ward on sunday afternoon
great britain 's own stocks are so modest that there has been a frisson of excitement around the 27 year - old london cabbie 's son recent flirtations with the top 100
what he will not lack is motivation , and some of his best performances have come in the davis cup , such as when he beat america 's sam querrey last year
james ward chats with captain of the aegon gb davis cup team leon smith ahead of the davis cup match ' the two biggest passions in my life are arsenal and playing for my country , ' he said
' he begins today by playing usa number one john isner , who he beat in an exhibition match just prior to the open
this tie being close presupposes that andy murray can shake off his sometimes erratic post-melbourne form and win both his singles matches
' as ever it is the younger jamie murray who will bear the greatest burden , with gb trying to pull off its first home win at this elite level of the competition since 1986
so , what âs the story with the davis cup , then ? now heralded as the world âs largest annual team competition , with 122 nations taking part last year , this world cup of men âs tennis actually looked more like the old ryder cup when it began in 1900 â when harvard âs tennis team came up with the idea of pitting the best usa against the finest players from the british isles
if you âre in the elite top 16 , where great britain are now , it becomes a whole lot more simple
and great britain are good , are they ? since reaching the final in 1978 , gb have plummeted to some pretty low depths over the years
it starts with two singles matches on the friday , there âs a doubles rubber on the saturday , then the reverse singles on the sunday
gb will lean heavily on andy murray , who may yet play in the doubles â as well as his two singles rubbers â despite not being named alongside brother jamie murray in yesterday âs draw
what happens if we win this one ? a victory for great britain would see them progress to the davis cup quarter - finals , to be played between july 17 - 19
