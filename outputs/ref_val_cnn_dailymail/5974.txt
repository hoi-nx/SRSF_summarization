a talented chinese lawyer who was banned from working in california because of the chinese exclusion act has been finally granted a license , 89 years after his death
but he was banned from practising in california as he was ' a person of mongolian nativity ' defiant : in later life , hong yen chang served as a banker and a diplomat , and was awarded a doctorate of law by the chinese government
but he was never granted a license to practise law in california hong yen chang , from xiangshan , guangdong province , was chosen to travel to the united states in 1872 when he was 12 years old , as part of a chinese educational mission
he studied law at yale and colombia , from where he graduated in 1886 with ' high markings from the examiners '
however , for the rest of his life he faced a struggle to practise law , as under 19th century legislation ' a person of mongolian nativity ' would not be accepted to the bar
in 1888 , after long deliberations , new york passed an act for the relief of hong yen chang , which waived the chinese exclusion act in the state , allowing him to receive a license to practise law in new york
but the california authorities said that they did not recognise the new york ruling , leaving hong yen chang unable to work there
on monday , the california supreme court granted a posthumous law license to hong , known as united states 's first chinese - born lawyer
' even if we can not undo history , we can acknowledge it and , in so doing , accord a full measure of recognition to hong yen chang 's pathbreaking efforts to become the first lawyer of chinese descent in the united states , ' the court said in its unanimous ruling
