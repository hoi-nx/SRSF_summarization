experts have called for a ' turbocharged ' campaign to rid the world of tobacco by 2040 leading experts have called for a ' turbocharged ' global campaign to make the world tobacco free by 2040
the sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years , leading public health researchers have today said
they claim one billion deaths from smoking could be averted by the end of the century , if action is taken now
but a global campaign will only work with the support of governments as well as with stronger evidence - based action against the tobacco industry , they warn
professors robert beaglehole and ruth bonita , from the university of auckland in new zealand have called on the united nations to lead efforts against the sale and consumption of tobacco
they warn that despite the decline of smoking in the developed world , tobacco use is expected to increase in some countries over the next decade , notably in africa and the middle east
professor robert beaglehole , said : ' the time has come for the world to acknowledge the unacceptability of the damage being done by the tobacco industry and work towards a world essentially free from the legal and illegal sale of tobacco products
' a world where tobacco is out of sight , out of mind , and out of fashion - yet not prohibited - is achievable in less than three decades from now , but only with full commitment from governments , international agencies , such as united nations and who ( who ) , and civil society
' global tobacco regulation should be ' turbocharged ' , with the united nations taking a leading role in efforts to eliminate the sale and use of tobacco
the experts pointed out that falling demand for tobacco in rich parts of the world had caused the ' big four ' tobacco companies to turn their attention to low and middle - income countries
the experts led by professors robert beaglehole and ruth bonita , from the university of auckland in new zealand , said the sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years that is despite research showing that increasing the cost of tobacco to consumers through taxation is one of the most effective ways to reduce consumption
in the last 10 years 50 million people have died as a result of tobacco use , indicating the fctc alone is insufficient to achieve substantive reductions in the use of tobacco
