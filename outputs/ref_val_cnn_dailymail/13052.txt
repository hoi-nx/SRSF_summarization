mcallen , texas for residents of this town just across the bridge from mexico , it 's hard to understand how a washington political fight could end up threatening the livelihood of people charged with securing the border
" the latest example of congressional dysfunction has real world implications here , where thousands of agents monitor the american border with mexico
the agents , along with other employees vital to national security such as tsa screeners , will have to show up to work without being paid if congress misses a friday deadline to keep the homeland security funded
the battle reached a fevered pitch last week when congress narrowly missed a deadline to avoid a partial homeland security shutdown , giving themselves an extension until march 6 to broker a deal
speaker john boehner could try to avert another showdown by holding a vote as early as tuesday on a homeland security bill that does n't touch obama 's immigration order
but the political intrigue is n't registering for some residents here
" i do n't know how that 's going to affect the protection of the border or border patrol , but i guess we 're going to find out
" marco solis said he was mad after hearing that congress agreed to keep homeland security running for only a few days
" local employees of the homeland security stationed along the border said they were n't allowed to speak to newsgroups on the record because of orders directly from washington
cabrera , the vice president of the local 3307 national border patrol council , a union for border agents , echoed those sentiments
he said that in the mcallen area , about 2,000 agents would be affected by this funding bill
he said the problem is in washington , where congress wo n't feel the direct effect of a possible funding gap
as a border patrol agent for 13 years who also felt the effect of the 2013 shutdown , he remembers how it went down last time
" the sad part is that we 're the football in this political game , and we 're just caught in the middle getting tossed around while somebody is trying to push their own agenda , one way or the other
" he added that he believes the cartels in mexico are keeping up with american news so that they can take advantage in case homeland security does shut down
" they know , " cabrera said about anyone across the border hoping to bring people or drugs
" mcallen mayor jim darling agreed and said he believes cartels and gangs are more tuned in about what 's going on in washington than his own constituents
" i would think there 's gulf cartel guys listening to washington right now , " he said
" darling says that washington 's actions have a " ripple effect " across the country , of which they should be more aware and considerate
