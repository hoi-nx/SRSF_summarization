before a vote has even been cast in the general election , he predicted the stars will be in â alignment â for his triumphant return to westminster as power broker , and vowed to crowbar ed miliband into no 10
mr salmond also said he would make it impossible for cameron to govern if the conservative leader fails to secure a majority in may âs election
last night , tory msp alex johnstone said : â nicola sturgeon must wish that salmond would just shut up
but mr salmond continued to publicise his plans yesterday , claiming he would join forces with labour to â lock out â the tory by voting down any attempt by mr cameron to pass a queen âs speech
asked by the magazine which â historical figure â he identified with , he replied : â nelson mandela
â mr alex johnstone said : â salmond is fast becoming a figure of ridicule
tory msp alex johnstone ( right ) said new snp leader nicola sturgeon ( left ) ' must wish that salmond would just shut up ' labour director of policy blair mcdougall said : â pink champagne ? lah-di-dah ! i âm sure the first minister is really relaxed about salmond âs boozy lunches with london journalists
â tory sources last night said that mr salmond âs comments showed the snp was prepared to â sabotage â the outcome of the election in order to put labour leader mr ed miliband in downing street
but mr salmond said the ( fixed - term ) parliaments act , which was passed by the coalition , meant that the snp could put labour into power even if the conservative win more seats
he said the snp â on course for an election landslide in scottish â would not contemplate any deal with the tory
asked about the prospect of a minority tory government , mr salmond replied : â the tory would have to go straight effectively for a vote of confidence , usually the queen âs speech , although it could be otherwise , of course , and we âd be voting against
â salmond on â¦ which historical figure he â identifies â with : â nelson mandela
â salmond on â¦ the snp âs 2011 election landslide : â it âs happening again
â salmond on â¦ his referendum defeat : â i âve no doubt that gordon saved the day for no. â salmond on â¦ his return to westminster : â i think the stars might be in alignment
a spokesman for the conservative said : â salmond has confirmed he would sabotage the democratic will of the britain people in order to make ed miliband prime minister
â the former leader of the snp said he indentifies with former south african president and anti-apartheid revolutionary nelson mandela ( pictured ) mr ed miliband moved to quell labour panic in scottish last week by ruling out a formal coalition with the snp
the snp has made it clear it would extract a ruinously high price in return for propping up mr ed miliband in office , including Â£ 180billion of extra borrowing , ditching britain âs trident nuclear deterrent and insisting on sweeping new powers for the scottish parliament that would leave the country reliant on dwindling north sea oil revenues
