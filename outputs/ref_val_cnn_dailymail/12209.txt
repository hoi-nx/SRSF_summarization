could it get any cuter than seal pup kisses ? the usgs and the u.s. department of interior this week shared a photo of a weddell seal nuzzling up to what looked to be its mom in erebus bay , antarctica
the expression of the mother is priceless
the photo was taken in october by usgs scientist link
" the agency 's public affairs department had asked scientists for interesting images to post on social media
as the instagram caption notes , the weddell seals of erebus bay have been studied extensively for over 40 years
it 's hard to describe the remoteness and isolation of the spot -- bitter cold , high winds , no life to be seen except for the seals , an occasional skua or an emperor penguin
" after a seal pup is born , link said its mom spends all her time close to her baby in a very small area , with hardly any interaction with other seals
