authorities quickly identified the boston bombing suspects , but almost immediately after tamerlan tsarnaev was killed during the manhunt for the perpetrators and dzhokhar was captured , investigators privately questioned if more people were involved
if there were others , perhaps a bomb maker is on the loose
dzhokhar told police he and his brother built the bombs , but court documents show some people involved in the case had their doubts
the bombs were described as powerful pressure - cooker explosives controlled remotely
the twin bombings in april 2013 killed three people and wounded more than 250 others
two years after the attack marks , a former special agent for the naval criminal investigative service , agrees on the technical aspects of the bombs
" it would be my opinion that they had somebody who was more of a skilled bomb maker , an engineer if you will , assist them in saying these are the steps you need to go through and then assemble the device to make it safely and to make it function the way they want
" they were the kind of bombs that need testing to make sure they work the way you expect
" there has been no evidence that the two brothers actually tested and tried out making a bomb and detonating it , " cnn national security analyst kayyem said
" dzhokhar told fbi agents he and his brother built the bombs following instructions from al qaeda 's inspire magazine
investigators have focused on tamerlan tsarnaev 's suspected ties to militants
there are other clues that the brothers would have needed help with the bombs
also , investigators apparently were troubled that they recovered one remote - controlled detonator at the scene of the bombings when there should have been two
" so this idea that there might be some evil hand out there telling dzhokhar what to do -- whether it 's his brother or someone who 's a bomb maker -- fits nicely into that narrative , " she said .
