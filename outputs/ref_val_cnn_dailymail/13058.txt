as a controversy over a racist video continues , the university of oklahoma is announcing a plan to hire a vice president who will oversee diversity programs
a video of a racist chant by the university 's now - disbanded sae fraternity made headlines nationwide this week
it shows students on a bus clapping , pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , " there will never be a ni * * * * sae
" in announcing the new position wednesday night , university president david boren said he decided to make the hire two months ago -- before the video came to light -- and is in talks with an african - american candidate
the school newspaper and a student organization publicized the nine - second video clip after receiving it via anonymous messages
shortly after it surfaced , the university cut ties with sae , as did the national fraternity
two students spotted in the video , rice and levi pettit , have been expelled for their alleged leadership role in the chant
" a statement from levi pettit 's parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to african - americans , students and university faculty
while it may be difficult for those who only know levi pettit from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist , " brody and susan pettit said
david boren has ordered a shutdown of the fraternity house in norman , and said it was no longer affiliated with the university
david boren has said the fraternity wo n't return during his tenure if he can help it
