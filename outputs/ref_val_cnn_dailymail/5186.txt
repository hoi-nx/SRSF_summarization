writer and broadcaster archie macpherson says farewell to mackay on the day football âs legends joined the tynecastle faithful in paying their respects to the former hearts , tottenham and derby county superstar
crowds clap whilst the hearse carrying the coffin of mackay leaves tyncastle stadium for his funeral but the claiming of their new divisional title will now be a permanent reminder of the resilience that mackay bequeathed his club when he strode the turf with a broad - chested imperiousness that was the formidable bridgehead for hearts â triumphs in the 1950s
mackay must , though , have had an inkling of the course of events which was leading inevitably to that apotheosis
the hearse carrying mackay 's coffin was complete with flowers and a football to mark his passing i was a student when i first saw the triumphant hearts side of 1957 - 8 which he captained , when they not only won the title but created a british goal - scoring record of 132 scored and only 29 against
i do nât know particularly why but i do instantly recall a game they played against clyde at the old shawfield where you could be very close to the pitch and , to this day , i will always associate mackay with â glaur
â for there he was yomping his way through the mud like a primeval predator whilst , through his prompting , hearts were playing the kind of slick football that as glasgow boy i thought was simply the preserve of the old firm
and i can not eliminate the image of his sliding into a tackle that took both mackay and the clyde man off the pitch and almost into the dog - track fence which surrounded the playing area
nor was he ever sent off in any game he ever played in from schools football through to the highest senior level , although his reputation for toughness did frankly make some opponents quiver when they saw his name posted on the team - sheet , as sir alex ferguson alluded to , in paying his respects on tuesday
the cortege leaves hearts ' stadium as the city were given the opportunity to pay their final respects â i was playing for queens park reserves against hearts reserves at tynecastle and the great mackay was playing because he was coming back from a broken toe , â said sir alex ferguson
so i got up and had a look at that big , barrel chest of his and he just said : â are you all right , son ? â that was a great memory - the only time i played against mackay - and i âll never forget it
â nor , when he had gone south to england football , will any of us ever forget the iconic photograph of mackay lifting billy bremner off his feet with a clenched fist , like a boy he had caught picking his pocket
the order of service for mackay 's funeral that is why so many notables from the england game travelled to edinburgh yesterday to pay tribute alongside the hearts faithful
pat jennings , terry medwin , steve perryman , gilzean , mike england , clive allen and cliff jones , who told the congregation : â whenever i hear the bagpipes playing * flower of scotland * i think of mackay - a proud scotsman who never forgot his roots
â gilzean added : â the legacy he leaves is unbelievable for three clubs - hearts , tottenham and derby county
within sir alex ferguson âs comments , though , there was also an element of regret about mackay âs record in the sense that he was under - appreciated in certain quarters , pointing to the paucity of caps he earned
â only 22 caps for a player as good as that ? â he lamented
