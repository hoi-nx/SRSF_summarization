researchers at lincoln park zoo in chicago have found that chimpanzees are willing to walk longer distances to get their favourite food - grapes - even when they are offered another option closer to hand
chimpanzees at lincoln park zoo in chicago exchanged white pvc pipes ( above ) for either grapes or carrots the findings suggest that our often irrational willingness to fulfill our cravings for fast food may have origins far back in our evolutionary past
dr lydia hopper , a research scientist at the lester fisher centre for the study and conservation of apes at lincoln park zoo , said she hoped to explore whether the convenience of the snack on offer may also impact how far chimpanzees are willing to travel
primatologists have found that a group of adult chimpanzees from a safari park in holland adapted the grunts they produced for foods like apples to match those of other chimps they lived with in edinburgh
she said : ' the chimpanzees , to a limit , were willing to travel farther to obtain the more - preferred grapes
' future studies should test whether chimpanzees would be willing to exert more effort for more - preferred rewards if the type of effort was different - for example , time to process the food or increased competition to negotiate
' dr hopper and her colleagues , whose research is published in the journal peerj , gave a group of six captive - born chimpanzees at lincoln park zoo rewards in exchange for small lengths of pvc pipe that the apes had to collect from a single location
the chimps could exchange these ' tokens ' at one of two locations - a close by one that gave them a carrot reward or one further away that gave them a grape
in a previous study hopper and her team had shown that the chimps preferred grapes to the carrots
they found that over time the chimps would travel further to collect the grapes in preference over the carrots
the chimpanzees in the study preferred grapes to less exciting carrots , much like this chimp at taronga zoo chimpanzees , like the one above , are our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom and their behaviour can help to shed light on our evolutionary past , such as how the human diet has changed over time she added that the findings could also help zoos improve the way they care for chimps
