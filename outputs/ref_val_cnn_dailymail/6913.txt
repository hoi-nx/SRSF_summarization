an african-american - african-american woman who accused cosby of rape dating back to the 1980s in november has revealed that her race weighed heavily on her decision to come forward with allegations
in an op - ed published on friday , former model allison claimed cosby forced himself upon her after inviting her to dinner and slipping something into her wine , which made her ill. she wrote that after other accusers came forward , she was not relieved , but instead terrified
allison ( right , next to cosby ) was a young model when she met cosby in the late 1980s
she claims that the tv star ( left ) sexually assaulted her at his home during a dinner ' as an african-american - african-american woman , i felt the stakes were even higher
allison claimed that the night of the dinner party cosby grabbed her hand and placed it on his genitals
in a recent op - ed with the post , the former model said that her race weight heavily on her decision to come forward with allegations against cosby speaking about the alleged assault to the daily news in november , allison said : ' we may be looking at america 's greatest serial rapist that ever got away with this for the longest amount of time
' but in her op - ed with the post she said that coming forward with her story would help bring down the entertainer , but she ' feared it would undermine the entire african-american - african-american community '
allison wrote that she did n't come out with her accusations earlier because she did n't want to see ' yet another african-american man vilified in the media '
the comedian has denied all claims like many in america , she watched the cosby show , and saw the dr huxtable character as a ' much - needed wholesome model of success '
she adds that though she feared coming forward , ' the only legacy at stake is of one entertainer , not of black manhood , as i once feared '
