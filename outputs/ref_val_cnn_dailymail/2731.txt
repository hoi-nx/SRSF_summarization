i spent a good chunk of my 20s in love - with my boyfriend matt and with new york , where we lived for five amazing , crazy years
we became a tight - knit team of two and whilst other friends diligently alternated between his and hers families for christmas , we did our own thing , eating turkey sandwiches from a corner deli , or inviting new york friends for eclectic english / ukrainian / french / italian parties
it was difficult adjusting to home when new york felt like our real home
but we cheered up when we got engaged in february and were looking forward to returning to manhattan for a holiday in june
i do n't know whose idea it was to get married in new york , but about a fortnight before our trip we both seemed to have the idea at once
sworn to secrecy ! best friend robin hobbs was the only witness to liz and matt âs wedding selfie time : the bride and groom were casually dressed in matching white and smiled for selfies on the way to their wedding i looked into it and it was pretty straightforward - apply for licence , wait 24 hours , take one witness , turn up on the day and queue at new york 's city hall with all the other brides and grooms
i knew i had to tell my parents but it was n't so much a matter of getting permission as casually dropping it into conversation at breakfast
' we 're thinking of getting married in new york , ' i said
it was easy to keep quiet - our english friends just thought we were excited about the trip , and we swore our witness robin to secrecy
he was our best friend , an english in new york who 'd recently moved to boston and understood the pull of the city as much as we did
the couple toasted the union with street vendor hot dogs and champagne in plastic glasses arty reception : the newlyweds had cocktails on the roof garden of the metropolitan museum - where liz furtively tossed the wedding bouquet over jeff koons â balloon dog sculpture we wanted a get out clause just in case robin could n't get time off work or we changed our minds at the last minute - another reason why a secret wedding seemed the right thing to do
party time : liz embraces a guest as the couple celebrate their marriage with friends in the boxcar lounge , one of their favourite east village bars a married man : matt pops open a bottle of champagne with friends the blushing bride : liz and matt leaving the boxcar lounge on their wedding night we celebrated with hot dogs from a street vendor and champagne in plastic glasses
our new york friends were out in force after work - we 'd suggested a drinking session and when a few cried off we had to admit we had ' an appointment at city hall ' and they might want to rearrange plans to join us on a pub crawl that kicked off with cocktails on the roof garden of the metropolitan museum of art. everyone promised to keep champagne photos off facebook and any wedding - related chat had to stay in new york because i was terrified the news would get back to english before we did
but we kept everyone sweet by promising an epic party on our first anniversary , and true to our word we planned a marquee - full of drinks , dinner and dancing with a healthy mix of english friends and new york guests who 'd experienced it all the first time round
