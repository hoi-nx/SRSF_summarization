calais officials are poised to start bulldozing the illegal migrant camps that have marred the town for more than a decade
yesterday it emerged that the prefect of calais has issued an ultimatum to migrants telling them to remove their belongings and evacuate by the end of the month or be forcibly ejected by riot police
it comes as the mayor of the port town opened the first purpose built accommodation for migrants since the closure of the notorious sangatte centre in 2002
calais officials will begin bulldozing migrant camps around the port city at the end of this month following the opening of a new refugee centre ( file image ) the jules ferry centre ( pictured ) , currently houses 50 women and children and is preparing to house up to 20 more
it is believed the french authorities plan to raze the illegal shanty town which has grown up around the town âs ferry port next tuesday
but since then the police have failed to move them on and the area has become blighted by rubbish and roughly improvised shelters causing fury among local french residents
bouchart , the mayor of calais , hopes the centre will allow authorities to get a grip on the situation which has plagued her town for months once cleared from their existing camps the migrants will be moved to an area of wasteland alongside the jules ferry site
the town mayor bouchart hopes the measure will help the authorities to gain control over the town âs chaotic migrant population and limit the influence of the people smugglers who exploit the desperation of those living in the filthy camps
but yesterday critics feared the move would only exacerbate the problem with charity workers predicting it would take the women given beds an average of three months to sneak into the britain
in addition to the jules ferry centre another â day â shelter was also opened yesterday
â earlier this week mayor bouchart , 52 , herself the daughter of eastern european migrants who settled in french , used a speech to european council to blame britain for the lawlessness in calais
â relations between the neighbouring countries have steadily deteriorated over the last year over the problem of calais
