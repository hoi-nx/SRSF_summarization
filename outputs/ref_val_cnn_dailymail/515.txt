in may of this year the lhc will be turned on at full power after a wait of more than two years , as scientists prepare to probe the secrets of the universe closer than ever before
he proposes that the higgs boson boson itself - which gives particles their mass - could disintegrate into dark matter , and he âs hoping the team at cern can prove his theory
according to dr christoffer petersson âs model the higgs boson particle can also disintegrate into a photon and particles of dark matter dr christoffer petersson from chalmers university of technology in sweden and two colleagues came up with the new particle model to predict the existence of dark matter
the current â standard model â of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level , but it ca nât account for dark matter in the universe
and his model also gives the higgs boson particle different properties , suggesting that it can disintegrate into a photon ( a particle of light ) and particles of dark matter
if the properties are there , it is a clear indication that the model fits
â it 's a dream for a theorist in particle physics , â said dr christoffer petersson
' the current â standard model â of particle physics is quite good at describing physics on a subatomic level , but it ca nât account for dark matter in the universe ( illustrated )
dr christoffer petersson âs model , though , contains more â elementary particles â than the standard model - and crucially it includes dark matter particles in may of this year the lhc will be turned on at full power after a wait of more than two years , as scientists prepare to probe the secrets of the universe closer than ever before
pictured is the atlas experiment at the lhc , one of two instruments trying to prove - or disprove - dr christoffer petersson 's model in the first studies the volume of data was unfortunately too small for it to be possible to either confirm or reject christoffer petersson 's model
