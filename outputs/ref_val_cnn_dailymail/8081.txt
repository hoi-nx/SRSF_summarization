billionaire entrepreneur richard branson 's virgin may take on tesla and other companies in developing electric cars
' we have teams of people working on electric cars , ' richard branson told bloomberg tv in miami where his virgin racing team competed in the all - electric formula e race that involves battery - powered cars
' we are working with the virgin formula e team to develop the plan for next season 's cars , ' virgin spokesman nick fox told reuters

' the streets snaking through downtown miami 's high rises will be buzzing this saturday as commuters make way for dart - shaped racing cars zooming by at breakneck speeds - and little noise
the race drivers will be competing in the first formula e race in the united states since the all - electric series was launched in beijing in september 2014
halfway through its inaugural season , formula e has offered the same , albeit quieter , thrills as the popular formula one events , with low - slung , opened - wheeled cars capable of speeds up to 136 miles per hour ( 220 kilometers per hour )
it is backed by environmentalist and actor leonardo dicaprio and entrepreneur richard branson , whose virgin sponsors a two - car team
