restorative justice is a government scheme aimed at giving victims a voice
the scheme allows offenders to take responsibility for their actions and try to make amends with their victims
for offenders , meeting their victims can be a challenging experience because they are forced to confront the personal impact of their crimes

according to the restorative justice council it accounts for a 14 per cent reduction in reoffending
