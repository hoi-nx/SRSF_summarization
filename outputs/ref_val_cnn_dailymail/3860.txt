now scientists have discovered vincent van gogh 's masterpiece 's are falling victim to the artist 's choice of pigments he used in his paint
they have found that a rare mineral in an intense red - coloured paint used by the netherlands impressionist is turning white as it breaks down into flaky white crystals
they say this mineral is the missing link that may explain why the red lead paint , known as minimum , is turning white
red lead is not the first pigment to be found in vincent van gogh 's work to be failing to stand the test of time
curators at the van gogh musuem in amsterdam have also found that the colours in vincent van gogh 's bedroom are also fading during a project to restore the painting
previous work by janssens has also shown that a bright yellow paint , known as chrome yellow , in vincent van gogh 's paintings has also been changing colour
he believes that vincent van gogh 's technique of blending white and yellow paint together may actually be to blame for the chemical reactions causing this darkening
the researchers , from the university of antwerp , belgium , studied microscopic paint samples taken from vincent van gogh 's wheat stack under a cloudy sky , which he painted in 1889
they found that at the centre of the fleck , the paint was still a vivid red colour where the original red lead pigment had been protected from the air while the colour changed closer to the surface
red lead was thought by much of the art world to be a relatively stable pigment , so the idea that it has been breaking down has surprised many
the researchers found that around the red pigment in their sample was a layer of plumbonacrite and then around that white crystals of lead carbonates , hydrocerussites and cerssites
scientists took a microscopic flake of paint from the pond in vincent van gogh 's wheat stack under a cloudy sky ( shown on the left ) and found that beneath the surface the vivid red lead pigment originally used remained ( top right and bottom right ) but had degraded to grey and white colour on painting 's surface ( bottom centre ) descriptions by vincent van gogh of the colour of his lodgings that he painted in the bedroom show that the floor and walls actually contained more red pigment , giving them more vivid shades than they have today experts have used computer reconstructions to boost the red in vincent van gogh 's the bedroom to see how it would have originally looked before they faded under the bright lights that has caused the red pigment to degrade they believe that sunlight has caused the original red pigment to be converted into plumbonacrite , which in turn reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form the white crystals
professor janssens and his colleagues propose that impurities in the original red lead pigment , also known as minium , may have triggered the degradation in the first place
they say a compound known as litharge , a natural lead oxide mineral , is often a remnant of the process of producing red lead pigment
this mineral is more reactive than the other minerals in red lead and so may have triggered the production of plumbonacrite
the red leaves on the pond in vincent van gogh 's wheat stacks under a cloudy sky have faded to white professor janssens said : ' the presence of plumbonacrite in paintings or painters materials is very scarce
' in our case , the presence of this carbonate - poor lead compound in between the red lead and the carbonate - rich lead white layer strongly suggests that plumbonacrite is present as an intermediate degradation product formed during the whitening of minium
' the findings could help future attempts to restore vincent van gogh 's paintings to their original colours by allowing scientists to work out what the pigments used were
' vincent van gogh 's paintings are widely considered among the most valuable in the world
