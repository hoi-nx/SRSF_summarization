police officers must record the stops they carry out on motorists amid fears they are unfairly targeting ethnic drivers , a watchdog has said
hmic ( hmic ) made the recommendation after finding that black and minority ethnic motorists were disproportionately affected by vehicle stops
but a survey by the police watchdog found 7 - 8 per cent of white drivers were stopped in the last two years , compared to up to 14 per cent of black drivers
police are not currently required to do so but the watchdog found 7 - 8 per cent of white drivers were stopped in the last two years , compared to up to 14 per cent of black drivers but white drivers were more likely to be arrested , given a fixed penalty notice , be summonsed or prosecuted â suggesting ethnic motorists were â more likely to be stopped for no reason â , the report found
police forces have also made â disappointingly slow progress â in improving their use of stop and search powers , said hmic
government inspectors warned in 2013 that more than a quarter of police stop and searches were unlawful â equivalent to 250,000 of the one million people every year being subjected to searches which did not stick to the rules
but the latest hmic report said good progress had been made on only one of 10 recommendations inspectors made in 2013 - the use of technology to record stop and search encounters between the police and a suspect
hmic chief stephen otter said : â too many police leaders and officers still do n't seem to understand the impact that the use of powers to stop and search people can have on the lives of many people , especially young people and those who are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds
mr stephen otter said police forces might be falling short because they were made up overwhelmingly of white officers
he said it was â difficult to look â stephen otter âs mother doreen lawrence , made a life peer in 2013 , â in the face because of the lack of progress that has been made in this area when it is pretty clear much more needs to be done
