men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women
however , women still live longer than men overall â though the gap is closing
the statistics , released yesterday , showed that over the past three years the expectancy of life in good health for a baby girl in england has dropped by nearly four months
but during the same period , the length of time that newborn baby boys can expect to live in good health has risen slightly
men are likely to live longer now because few work in dangerous industrial jobs like coal mining , and fewer drink heavily or smoke
women , however , are increasingly likely to spend much of their lives in demanding jobs , as well as bringing up children
according to the ons , in the three years between 2011 and 2013 , a baby girl born in england could on average expect to live in good health for 63.9 years
this means that men now spend 80 per cent of their lives in good health , compared to 77 per cent for women
women are increasingly likely to spend much of their lives in demanding jobs , as well as bringing up children , according to the ons newborn boys in the south east are likely to get 6.3 years longer in good health than those in the north east , and girls in the south east an extra 6.6 years
