most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient 's skin entering the surgical wound scientists in the u.s. have devised an implant in a tiny silk ' purse ' that kills infections after surgery and then dissolves in the body
up to four in 100 people undergoing surgery in the uk will develop an infection , and this can prolong hospital stays by as much as nine days
surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions after operations , according to a study published last month
most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient 's skin entering the surgical wound
the most common culprits are staphylococcus aureus bacteria , responsible for 20 per cent of surgical site infections , coagulase negative staphylococcus , and enterococcus bacteria
it consists of a tiny , magnesium coil wrapped in a pocket of silk protein , and is implanted during surgery - if the patient later shows sign of infection , the implant can be switched on using a remote control
researchers at tufts university have used the implant in mice infected with staphylococcus aureus , raising its temperature for two periods of ten minutes
' the team has also carried out experiments using remote control to deliver antibiotics to treat e.coli and staphylococcus aureus
this new purse could allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device the concept of reducing bacterium within the tissues and thereby reducing risk of infections is not new , and was previously achieved by deploying antibiotic beads within the tissues
' surgical site infections are costly as they increase the length of stay for patients and can lead to further surgery
' meanwhile , a team at the university of south florida has developed a new antibiotic to fight the superbug methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa , which kills thousands of people worldwide each year
