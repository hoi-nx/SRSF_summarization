the prime minister had promised to reduce net migration to the â tens of thousands â by the general election
however , last month that vow was shattered when figures showed it had hit a record high
david cameron âs pledge to reduce net migration to the â tens of thousands â is no longer taken seriously by the obr home secretary theresa may later insisted the tories would restate the failed target to slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they returned to government
theresa may said tories would slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they stayed in power it stated : â a reduction over time seems consistent with the international environment and with the government âs declared efforts to reduce it
â instead , it said net migration would â tend towards 165,000 in the long term â
shadow immigration minister david hanson said : â david cameron âs â no ifs , no buts â pledge on net migration is in complete tatters ; not even the obr believes the prime minister âs promise any more and are now planning for it to be broken
