it used to be a landmark age when women crossed over from being youthful and desirable to being over-the - hill
but today turning 40 , is no longer a harbinger of middle age but for many it 's just another phase of our ever extending youth with all the anxieties of opportunities not taken and plans left undone
here three generations of women discuss how they felt about the big 4 - 0 , and how society 's view of women as they age has changed for the better over their lifetimes

the 39 - year - old says talking to her mother and grandmother about turning 40 has helped her feel less downhearted about ageing , going grey and being more critical of her appearance sarah , right , with her mother helen ivens and one - year - old daughter matilda the grandmother mollie guillaume , 87 , is retired and lives in chigwell , essex with her sister , joan , 84
she says : ' back then , once a woman turned 40 she was expected to dress in a more subdued way , get a shorter haircut and generally become quite staid in appearance
' i 've always liked wearing tailored , comfortable clothes in flattering colours so my appearance has n't changed too much from birthday to birthday
' my daughter helen looks in the mirror and ca n't believe there 's an old woman staring back at her , but i 'm used to it so it 's not a shock for me any more
' as my granddaughter hits 40 , she should really be thinking " i 'm halfway done now , if i 'm lucky , so let 's enjoy this life ! " four generations together : from left to right , helen ivens , mum mollie guillaume and sarah with her son william , who 's now three the mother helen ivens , 65 , is retired and lives in chigwell , essex , with her husband keith , 66
' in fact 40 was a great turning point for me , and it 's been good ever since
' when i was a teen , when someone turned 40 i considered them very much past it and on the verge of old age
' in the 1980s , when i turned 40 , i was definitely the oldest mum at the school gates

helen says that when she turned 40 in the 1980s , it felt like a new phase of her life was beginning , ' if you have good health and enough money to be comfortable , it can be a great phase of your life ' helen ivens , centre , aged 40 with her children , from left : james , william ( sitting on her lap ) and sarah ' but of course this is all different now , and my daughter sarah is not unusual that she is turning 40 with a one - year - old daughter
' having a daughter who is turning 40 is quite a milestone for me
in fact , it 's a bigger shock to the system than when i turned 40

' it 's been very reassuring to talk to my mother and grandmother about turning 40 though because i have been surprised at how downhearted it 's made me feel
" mollie ( second from right ) , with her daughter helen ( far left ) , sister joan and granddaughter sarah ( far right ) says when she turned 40 in 1968 women were expected to dress conservatively and become quite staid in appearance with a shorter haircut , despite the women 's liberation movement sweeping across britain ' i 've never paid much attention to my appearance but suddenly i 'm studying everything in cruel , minute detail
' most of my friends have already turned 40 and i 've noticed the trend to throw parties as big as weddings in a giant celebration of yourself
