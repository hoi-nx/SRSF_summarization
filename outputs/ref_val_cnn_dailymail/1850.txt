a baby clothing company is being accused of fat - shaming babies after it came out with a onesie with the saying , ' i hate my thighs ' on the front
the kitschy company wry baby was brought into the spotlight after ms. magazine editor michele kort published a blog on march 10 saying the supposedly humorous onesie was actually detrimental to babies ' body image
after all , the company that sells this onesie with the saying " i hate my thighs " is named wry
' wry posted a pretend poll in the comments section of kort 's post sarcastically asking consumers which onesie they preferred to see , one that favored cynicism ( i hate my thighs ) or the other one which favored sweetness ( love me for my leg rolls ) , reports e online
' please make the donation to ms. magazine , wry baby
' and sorry that we do n't see much difference between i hate my thighs and love me for my leg rolls ; the subtext of the latter is that someone would not be loved for her leg rolls
new alternative : after the ' i hate my thighs ' jumper caused fury among some women , the company wry baby offered another alternative that said ' love me for my leg rolls ' other funsies : these fun baby onesies are among wry 's kitsch collection of baby gear ' what we âre trying to do is make the entire parenting experience as fun as humanly possible , ' writes wry baby co-owner kelly sopp
why should nât it be ? ' wry baby continued to fight back against kort 's criticism of them and wrote on march 12 , ' we could nât agree more about body image
obviously no baby would or should hate their thighs ! ... but we âre glad you âre able to froth up your readers this week and shine a light on what is apparently a vital mission of ms. magazine â reviewing baby clothes
