home secretary theresa may , pictured in downing street today , insisted the net migration target was ' important ' , even though latest data shows the figure hit 300,000 last year the tory are to repeat a pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands , despite utterly failing to meet it during the last five years
home secretary theresa may insisted the target was ' important ' , even though latest data shows the figure hit 300,000 last year - three times what cameron promised
the net migration target is now set to be included in the tory manifesto for may 's general election , after mrs may and mr cameron rejected repeated warnings that it was a mistake
a total of 298,000 more people arrived in uk than left in the year to september , as the numbers arriving from the rest of the eu hit a record high
' a record 624,000 arrived in uk in a year , up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months
at the same time , 327,000 left , a figure which has barely changed since 2010
former home secretary ken said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet , while baroness warsi , an ex-tory party chairwoman , said it was ' unrealistic '
now mrs may has signalled that she intends to include a pledge on net migration in the conservative manifesto
the idea of the net migration target will still be there
net migration to this country will be in the order of tens of thousands each year
it remains the objective towards which the prime minister and others are working
however , non-eu net migration is at its highest level since the end of december 2011
' prime minister cameron promised before the election to cut net immigration in the tens of thousands former home secretary ken said globalisation had made the immigration target impossible to meet , while baroness warsi , an ex-tory party chairwoman , said it was ' unrealistic ' downing street insisted mr cameron 's ' ambition ' to reduce net migration below 100,000 remained
' the spokesman said the prime minister 's views on the need to reduce annual net migration below 100,000 had not changed since a speech in november , when he said that it remained an ' ambition ' , even if it was not possible to achieve it during this parliament
when the latest figures were released last week , deputy prime minister nick clegg today said the tories must now ' quite rightly suffer the embarrassment ' of breaking the promise
sunder katwala , director of the british future think tank , said : ' if the prime minister remains in denial about the broken target , he is setting himself up for five more years of failure
