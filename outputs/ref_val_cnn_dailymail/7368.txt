scientists are listening in on earthquakes to create stunning marble - like simulations of earth 's interior
by recording seismic tremors , researchers are able to build a 3d picture of earth 's mantle - the layer between the crust and outer core
computer simulations use the speed of seismic waves from earthquakes to reveal the existence of subterranean structures
in this view of the mantle below the pacific ocean , slower waves are shown in red and orange while faster waves are shown in green and blue the princeton university team fed data from seismograms into a computer model , which then simulated each wave as it moves out from the epicenter
in these images , slower waves are in red and orange , while faster vibrations are in green and blue
the 3d models were created by princeton university 's professor tromp who is aiming to create a map of the entire mantle - down to a depth of 1,865 miles ( 3,000km ) - by the end of the year
' the resulting map could reveal the precise locations of tectonic plates , which can cause earthquakes when they move against each other
the images were created by princeton university 's professor tromp who is aiming to create a 3d map of the entire mantle , down to a depth of 1,865 miles ( 3,000km ) , by the end of the year a three - dimensional image showing contours of locations where seismic wave speeds are faster than average the maps could also reveal the locations of magma that , if it comes to the surface , causes volcanic activity , the researchers said
blue colours denote faster than average wave speeds , and red colors denote slower than average wave speeds the two panels on the right show a 746 miles ( 1,200 km ) deep slice of the earth taken from points b to b in europe as shown in the left panel
