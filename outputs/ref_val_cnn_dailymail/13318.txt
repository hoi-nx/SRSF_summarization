elias spent much of his life preserving the memory of his cousin anne
i could tell instantly that he was related to anne
elias told me that it was n't just anne who loved to write ; everyone in the family did
that day in atlanta , i listened to elias tell me about loved ones he lost
i thought back to our conversation thursday when i learned the news of elias ' death
he died peacefully at his home in basel , switzerland , at 90 , said an announcement posted on the website of anne , the foundation that elias headed
anne received her diary on her 13th birthday and wrote in it for the two years that her family hid from the nazis in the secret annex of an amsterdam apartment
i was only in seventh grade when my father bought me the book in 1975
later , anne and her sister margot were taken to bergen-belsen , where they both died in march 1945
her father , otto frank , was the sole survivor of the family , one of only 7,000 people who made it out alive from auschwitz
in the course of my two hours with elias , i learned new things about the young , jewish girl whose journal is arguably the most famous in the world
she called him bernd , short for bernhard , elias ' formal name
in his youth , elias was an actor and a skater with holiday on ice
" bernd , maybe we can skate as a pair together someday , " anne wrote in january 1941 from amsterdam
" in another letter , anne outlined the steps to their skating routine and drew a picture of the blue , fur - trimmed dress she would wear when she finally skated with elias
" she never did get to do that , " elias said
" that was the last sign of life i had with anne , " elias told me
he published anne 's diary in 1947 and helped transform it for the stage and film
otto frank kept alive his daughter 's legacy until he died in 1980 and passed on that role to elias
