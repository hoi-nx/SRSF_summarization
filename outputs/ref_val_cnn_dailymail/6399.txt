lisa , 42 , was shocked to be told her wheezing and chest pains were due to a bronchial carcinoid tumour for four years , mother - of - three lisa went back and forth to her gp , complaining of wheeziness and occasional sharp pains in her shoulder and chest
yet she was ' just pooh - poohed ' by doctors , says lisa , 42 , who lives in essex with her husband and has three children , aged 22 , 13 and eight
lisa , a teaching assistant , saw a specialist , who inserted a tube with a camera into her lungs and found a growth in her airways
she had a grape - sized bronchial carcinoid tumour - the same condition that the bbc 's political editor robinson announced he had this weekend
like robinson , lisa , 42 , had never smoked - and no one could explain why she had developed it
she was told the tumour was essentially ' benign ' and that if they removed it surgically , that would be the end of it
robinson , 51 , followed up the announcement of his cancer with typical good humour : ' timing lousy
indeed , the prognosis for most people with his form of cancer is very good if the tumour is caught early and surgically removed
bronchial carcinoid tumours are a form of cancer known as neuroendocrine tumours
every year , 3,000 people in the uk are diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour
the news came as a shock for both bbc journalist robinson ( pictured ) and lisa - as neither of them had ever smoked the difference between typical lung cancer and bronchial carcinoid is that the former occurs within the main cells of the lung ; bronchoid carcinoids occur in the neuroendocrine cells dotted around the lining of the main airways
wherever a neuro - endocrine tumour develops , it can begin to produce hormones - and 30 per cent do so , resulting in a range of symptoms
but these vague symptoms can make a neuroendocrine tumour more difficult to diagnose and , often , they are only picked up by chance , says catherine bouvier of the net patient foundation
lisa says her future is now uncertain and she is worried about her children the type of lung cancer most heavily linked to smoking is squamous cell , yet even this can affect non-smokers
the good news is that for 70 per cent of those who are diagnosed with a bronchial carcinoid , the condition can be ' cured ' simply by removing it surgically , says professor prowse
' however , not every patient with a neuroendocrine tumour gets seen by a specialist in one of these centres , ' he adds
lisa is one of the unlucky ones
lisa now knows this was caused by another tumour on her lung , pumping out hormones
' suddenly , doctors started using the word cancer for the first time - i had no idea that was what i had , which came as a major shock to say the least , ' says lisa
the tumour is between two major blood vessels , and she has been told it is inoperable
proportion of lung cancer cases linked to inadequate intake of fruit and veg but there are drugs that can stop the tumour getting bigger , and nuclear medicine treatments , using radioactivity to target receptors on the tumour cells
initially , lisa was given hormone injections , called lanreotide , which she had to self - administer once a month
' a recent scan showed her tumour had started to increase , and she now needs further follow - up scans to look at it in more detail
' they say : " good news , it 's a benign tumour " , then a few years later : " bad news , it 's spread "
' the cells can look benign down a microscope and that 's why you need to see a specialist , because they will know how these really do behave - and they do spread , in 30 to 40 per cent of cases
' lisa is very angry that neuroendocrine cancer is portrayed as almost ' harmless ' and that while specialists say anyone with an endocrine tumour should be followed up , she was not - she has also been in touch with others like her who have not been followed up , either
lisa says : ' it 's unfair
