he does n't wear a uniform or hold an official rank , but al-amari is a powerful military leader in iraq
ousting isis from tikrit is important for dozens of countries in the united states - led coalition trying to thwart the islamist extremist group 's quest to grow its caliphate
iran is n't a part of this coalition , but it is also working to defeat isis -- something that 's provoked both relief and alarm in washington
al-amari is confident his men , with help from the iraq army and some sunnis , can crush isis in iraq without this coalition 's help
he 's sure because the iran are advising them
" anyone who puts their faith in the international coalition to liberate iraq is putting their faith on a mirage
" iran knows what it 's doing , in his view
" does it matter that iran is advising militias fighting isis ? does it matter which countries are taking part in the fight against isis -- including that one of them , iran , is a longstanding united states foe ? when asked questions along those lines wednesday in washington , it seemed that even top united states military officials did n't have easy answers
the view is that defeating isis is good , while relying on and possibly strengthening iran is not
in other words , iran 's involvement in iraq is a mixed blessing
that imbued iraq shiites who have returned home with a fierce allegiance to iran
still , some sunnis have n't seen the change they want : for instance , sheikh naim al-gaoud in february called for direct united states arming of sunni tribes like his or at least pressure to make iraq 's government help them more in the fight for anbar province
given these harsh realities , it 's not necessarily cut and dried what a sunni citizen in tikrit will think if either shia militias or the shia - led iraq military battle the sunni group isis
" do i choose the iraq military ( which is working with the united states - led coalition ) or isis ? do i choose leukemia or the plague ? ... which groups do they dislike more ? " said biddle , a strategy expert and the award - winning author of " military power : explaining victory and defeat in modern battle
" so what should the united states do ? jessica stern , a lecturer on terrorism at harvard university who this month published , " isis : the state of terror , " says it 's imperative to address the sectarian divisions in iraq and continue pushing for changes in its government
she notes that " the anti-sunni , shia - promoting government of maliki " was a big reason isis was able " to take root " in iraq
what 's to say talk will translate into action anytime soon ? biddle thinks the united states should consider sweetening the carrots offered to the iraq as incentives -- and start carrying bigger sticks -- to spur it to get its act together
it 's part of this quandary because it shares a border with iraq , has its own interest in fending off isis , and is predominantly shia
) yet isis is likewise united states 's enemy , with president barack obama saying that the goal is to " degrade and ultimately destroy " that group
it 's not in iran 's interest to have iraq devolve into a sectarian war , says retired united states air force lt. col. francona , a cnn military analyst
but what should the united states think about iran 's efforts to defeat isis by backing shia - led militias ? speaking at a congressional hearing wednesday about the white house 's request for use of force to fight isis , the chairman of the u.s. joint chiefs of staff opined that iran 's involvement in helping iraq forces is a good thing
defense secretary ashton carter suggested that the matter was more nuanced
the united states is worried about iran 's role , he said
" it is something that is concerning to us , " he said of iran 's role , " in particular because the sectarian danger in iraq is the principal thing that can unravel the campaign against isis
