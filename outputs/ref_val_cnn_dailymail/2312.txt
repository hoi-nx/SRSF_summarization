the bbc has backed top gear over clarkson âs use of the word â pikey â
the word - used as a derogatory term for gipsies or travellers - was part of a â running gag â between clarkson and fellow presenter james may about their colleague richard hammond âs perceived cheap style
a complaint was lodged by the traveller movement charity after it appeared on a placard in a top gear episode from february last year
top gear hosts : the word ' pikey ' was part of a â running gag â between clarkson ( right ) and fellow presenter james may ( left ) about the perceived cheap style of their colleague richard hammond ( centre ) the bbc trust acknowledged that the word â pikey â derived from â turnpike â and so related to travellers in a ruling due to be published today
but the bbc trust âs editorial standards committee said there had been â no intended racist reference â by the top gear team
the ruling stated : â the committee believed the word â pikey â had evolved into common parlance among a number of people to mean â chavvy â or â cheap â and â¦ viewers would not necessarily associate it with the gipsy and traveller communities
â but a traveller movement spokesman told the newspaper : â we are horrified by the bbc âs green - lighting of the use of the word â pikey â by the top gear presenters
embattled presenter : the future of clarkson ( pictured leaving his house in london yesterday ) at the bbc is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in north ruling : the bbc committee said it â accepted that the word â pikey â did have the potential to be deeply offensive to the gipsy and traveller communities â ( file picture ) â the claim that it has evolved a new meaning and that most people do not realise it has any reference at all with gipsies and travellers is absolute rubbish
clarkson âs future at the bbc is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in north
he now faces an interrogation over his row with top gear producer oisin tymon by bbc chiefs , who are said to be â desperate â to get rid of him
last night clarkson was at the centre of another controversy after he said in the march edition of top gear magazine that foreign taxi drivers in london have â vehicles smelling of sick â
last year , clarkson apologised after he was filmed allegedly using the n - word in the poem â eeny , meeny , miney , moe â
the racing driver who was the stig on top gear for eight years has said that the bbc show could thrive without the embattled clarkson
claim : collins ( left ) , the racing driver who was the stig ( right ) on top gear for eight years , has said that the bbc show could thrive without the embattled clarkson the stuntman stated : â top gear has achieved huge status and clarkson has certainly been part of that because he âs got such a big personality ... he âs an unstoppable force
clarkson is certainly one of them , but not the only one , â collins , who was the stig until 2011 , said
meanwhile , perry mccarthy , who was the stig from 2002 to 2003 , said that top gear without clarkson would take â the fire out of it â and â wo nât work â
