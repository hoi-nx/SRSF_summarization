playing again : paul gray says years of loud music shattered his hearing musician paul gray first suspected he might have tinnitus while mid-way through a tour with punk band the damned more than 30 years ago
â i wondered where it was coming from , looked all around the room , opened the windows , and then figured that it might just be tinnitus
â the yellow foam ones looked uncool and the wax ones were totally unsuitable for musicians as they cut out too much sound , â says paul gray
â back then , it was a case of â oh , it must have been a great gig , my ears are still ringing â , â says paul gray , who first found fame as a bass guitarist with eddie and the hot rods before going on to join the damned and then later working with former wham ! star andrew ridgeley
tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree , according to the british tinnitus association
many have hearing damage as a result of being exposed to loud noise , be it in industry , the armed forces or the music business
at first paul gray , now 56 , experienced â a whine in my ears that was louder in my right ear , a bit like the sound of a jet turbine cranking up
â it was worse after gigs , but it would come and go , until one night in 1995 while paul gray was on stage with captain sensible ( who topped the charts with his cover of happy talk in the eighties )
back home in cardiff , paul gray âs doctor referred him to a specialist at the university hospital of wales ear , nose and throat department , who diagnosed â high - frequency hearing loss â after acoustic trauma , and advised him to limit his exposure to noise â and to get a new career
but for paul gray , being a musician was more than a job
â however , the tinnitus gradually worsened
â tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree , with many suffering from hearing damage by 1997 , paul gray had to admit defeat and call time on his musical career
â we were trying to retrain his brain into not focusing on the tinnitus â it was a distraction technique , â says tim bord , a senior audiologist at the hospital , who has been treating paul gray since the mid-nineties
paul gray was supposed to wear maskers for eight hours a day for a year
â you name it , i threw money at it , but they were all useless , â says paul gray , who resorted to hiding earplugs around the house to cope with the noise when his young son jeff had friends round to play
while this was some help , paul gray concluded he was just going to have to learn to live with his condition
paul gray also avoids noisy places as , like for many sufferers , background noise makes the problem worse
there have been some advances in treatments since paul gray was first diagnosed â such as the introduction of smaller â in - ear â white noise generators , and devices that combine a hearing aid and sound generator in one
paul gray has now learned to live with his condition and is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music a new treatment , neuromodulation â an earplug - type device designed to target the specific frequencies that distress an individual â is available privately , but is still undergoing trials
meanwhile , paul gray is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music
â paul gray , who has recorded a new album , a postcard from britain , with his old bandmate captain sensible , is able to play again for up to an hour at a time , so long as he wears his earplugs
