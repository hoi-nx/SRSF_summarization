on the way home from old trafford on monday night , the debate , as it turned out , was the wrong debate
should danny welbeck have been sold to arsenal last summer ? should he have celebrated his winning goal back in manchester ? both questions were irrelevant
danny welbeck is an honest and talented footballer but he would nât make a difference to louis van gaal âs manchester united
danny welbeck shoots to score the winning goal against manchester united on monday night at old trafford a stranded david de gea ( right ) looks on as the goalkeeper was beaten by former manchester united player danny welbeck danny welbeck celebrated his goal against his former club as arsenal won the fa cup tie 2 - 1 danny welbeck is swamped by his arsenal team - mates on a night to forget for manchester united supporters manchester united manager louis van gaal ( left ) and assistant giggs watch on during their latest defeat danny welbeck , whose international record is better than his club record , scored a well - taken and well - anticipated goal on monday and celebrated appropriately
on tuesday danny welbeck said : â manchester united is a club that means so much to me
â but manchester united âs problems under van gaal go much deeper than any associated with his decision last august to sell a player he figured â with reason â would have been his fourth - choice centre forward
van gaal cut a frustrated figure during the match as he and his team lost their last chance of a trophy manchester united 's ( left to right ) marouane fellaini , michael carrick and wayne rooney look frustrated on the pitch tactical genius ? not quite
louis van gaal received 3/10 for his tactics on monday night , but what about the players ? click here for full ratings the most telling moments of this fa cup tie came in the second half
arsenal manager wenger will have been disappointed his team had conceded an equaliser so carelessly so soon after taking the lead but at half - time he appeared to tell his team to continue in the same vein
he did a similar thing at swansea recently and manchester united lost that one , too
later , with manchester united chasing in the wake of danny welbeck âs goal and angel di maria âs sending - off , van gaal pushed marouane fellaini â and , soon after , smalling â to the top of the manchester united formation and asked them to feed off a diet of long balls pumped from their own half
angel di maria is sent off by referee michael oliver after the midfielder grabbed the official 's shirt di maria applauds the manchester united supporters after being sent off for manhandling the referee during the tie radamel falcao sits on the bench next to juan mata as the on - loan striker went unused against arsenal van gaal issues instructions alongside giggs but their tactics and substitutions were questionable with their exit from the fa cup against arsenal , manchester united 's attention now rests solely on the premier league
yet manchester united have n't beaten a side currently in the top half since their home win against liverpool in mid december last year
nevertheless , while this was going on , manchester united âs spanish playmaker juan mata and their colombian centre forward radamel falcao sat in the dug - out
they were still there when an aimless hoof from jones rolled out of play for a goal - kick and referee michael oliver signalled the end of the game
manchester united , whether they knew it or not , hired a pragmatist last summer and it is that side of the manager that the supporters are seeing now
it also points to problems that will greatly affect manchester united âs transfer strategy this summer

van gaal has to make decisions about juan mata , radamel falcao , robin van persie and rafael da silva and that is before he addresses the issue of whether less glamorous types such as jones , smalling and jonny evans are evergoing to mature into footballers good enough to help manchester united back to the top of the premier league
