but this little elephant in thailand proves that it âs not always as hard as you would think
captured on video by a visiting tourist who dubbed the elephant double trouble , the excitable animal is filmed diving straight towards the bath , snagging its leg on the side of it , tripping up and falling straight into the water
after balancing on its head for a while looking as if it is struggling , the elephant manages to turn itself back onto its side and begins splashing about - seemingly unbothered by its less - than - graceful entry into the water
returning to its feet , the elephant heads towards the man bathing it , who is believed to be claus jorgensen , the danish tourist who later uploaded the footage from the royal elephant kraal and village , in thailand
the excited elephant charges straight towards the bath and snags its leg off of it on the way in causing it to fall over the calf slip - slided its way in eventually as grown elephants stood in the back watching head over heels ! the elephant looks like it is about to drown before it turns itself onto its side and begins splashing the video concludes with double trouble jumping back into the bath even more enthusiastically , before a woman and little girl spray it with a hose
royal elephant kraal & village in ayutthaya is a non-profit organisation that breeds elephants , cares for retired elephants and looks after all the ones in between
