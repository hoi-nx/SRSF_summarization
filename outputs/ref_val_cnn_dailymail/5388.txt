universal man : the seven lives of keynes by davenport-hines keynes is a great name from our past , yet a vague one
an economic guru between the wars whose radical ideas helped to end the great depression and who then fought the american for us in the harsh , ungrateful bargaining after the end of world war ii about who should pay for it
keynes ( right ) with his russian ballerina wife , lydia lopokova ( left ) no one but economists read keynes â books and the controversies they created â because nobody but economists can bear to read about such â a technical and difficult subject â , as he called it himself
daringly but sensibly , this renowned biographer , davenport-hines , has studied keynes from seven points of view â not one of them as an economist
presiding over his versatility was keynes â amazing mind
to quote no lesser an authority than bertrand russell : â keynes â intellect was the sharpest and clearest i have ever known
â for recreation away from all this cerebral activity , keynes was an active and unapologetic homosexual for his younger years
then he converted spectacularly to become the devoted husband of a glamorous russian ballerina
â but he did â and some of the most surprising pages of this book are devoted to keynes the lover and sexual cruiser on the pick - up
â we are the immoralists , â said keynes
keynes ' ( pictured ) radical ideas helped end the great depression and he then fought the american at the end of world war ii about who should pay for it returning after two years â absence , he commented , excitedly : â the thing has come on by leaps and bounds to the point where practically everybody in cambridge is an open and avowed sodomite ! â the apostles were responsible for distinguishing between the higher and the lower sodomy
keynes entered into â love â triangles with such bloomsbury names as strachey and his brother
the spectacle of two men who both hated their appearances equally â strachey was tall , ungainly , with a tuft of red beard , glasses and a shrill voice , matched by keynes , whom virginia woolf described as â a gorged seal , double chin , ledge of red lip , little eyes , central , brutal , unimaginative â â well , it is hardly appetising
keynes â encounters in cambridge were all discreet and confined within the colleges , but he took rooms in bloomsbury for adventurous sallies on the streets
keynes enjoyed his hazardous sex life
with his brother , james , he set about demolishing keynes â reputation
strangely enough , it was keynes â love for duncan grant , who then had a love affair with virginia woolf âs sister , vanessa bell , that changed him in the same direction
he started paying court to lydia lopokova , who had arrived in london as a star of the diaghilev âs ballets russes
keynes never slept with a man again
she looked after keynes , who began showing symptoms of a weak heart
although keynes was an active and unapologetic homosexual during his younger years , he never slept with a man again after he married ballerina , lydia lopokova he overworked at the treasury throughout world war ii , but his great contributions were still to come as it ended
this was averted by setting up the bretton woods trade agreement , a world bank and an international monetary fund â all keynes â ideas
it took the american some little time to appreciate that , in keynes , they were not dealing with another england grandee , like his fellow negotiator lord halifax , but with the fastest brain in the west
