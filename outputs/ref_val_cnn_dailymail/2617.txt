islamic state supporters have taken to social media to boast about the recruitment of a failed party loving rapper from tunisia
maurouane douiri , better known by his stage name emino , announced his decision to join isis by posting a picture of himself holding a goat , allegedly in iraq
emino appears to have abandoned his trademark ushanka hat and is shown wearing a long red and white arab scarf
emino was one of a dozen tunisia rappers who were vocal critics of president zine el abidine ben ali 's regime
previously the 25 year old used his social media page to proudly show off photos of himself surrounded with a bevy of scantily clad ladies
one of the photos shows the rapper being touched and stroked by a group of women , with one of them appears to be drinking from a suspicious looking wine glass
emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers have joined isis over the last few years

but the recent surge in numbers seems to be down to the hard - line groups which have taken advantage of the relaxing laws following the jasmine revolution in 2011 - including islamist militant group ansar al sharia , which the u.s. brands as a terrorist organisation and blames for a 2012 attack on the u.s. embassy in tunis
â social media is also blamed , with pictures of isis fighters getting thousands of likes and recruiters using facebook to find any potential fighters , much like is seen in the british
