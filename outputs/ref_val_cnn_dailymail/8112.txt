clarkson could make a return to the bbc as early as next month to front the top gear live world tour , which is set to make more than Â£ 10million
bbc bosses are said to be in negotiations about the tour , which was planned to be fronted by clarkson along with co-presenters james may and richard hammond under the bbc top gear brand
however the future of the shows , which have sold 200,000 tickets , has been cast into doubt after clarkson was dismissed from the bbc last week for an ' unprovoked ' attack on a top gear producer
it says : ' we have not canceled any shows - but we are working through the implications of clarkson 's contract not being renewed by the bbc
clarkson , 54 , was dismissed from the bbc last month for an unprovoked attack on a top gear producer ' there will be a new name and no stig because obviously that 's their property
if the live shows go ahead key elements may have to be removed - such as the mysterious stig tony hall , the director - general of the bbc , has had to employ round - the - clock bodyguards after he received a death threat for refusing to reinstate clarkson
he became a target after taking the final decision to axe clarkson , the bbc 's biggest star , from his Â£ 1 million - a - year role presenting the corporation 's biggest global money - spinner
a spokesman from bbc worldwide said : ' there âs lots of speculation about top gear at the moment â however no top gear live shows have been cancelled and we are working through the implications of clarkson âs contract not being renewed
