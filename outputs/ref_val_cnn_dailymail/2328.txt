when a baby is screaming for food in the middle of the night the two minutes it takes to boil water to heat the bottle can seem like a lifetime
a pair of entrepreneurs is hoping to make this easier by launching a kettle with a ' baby bottle preparation ' function
it lets parents schedule when the kettle should start boiling , which also also gives it time to cool down , to coincide with the expected feeding times
it is expected to launch on kickstarter on 31 march and connects the smart kettle to an app to schedule boils alternatively , a parent can set the kettle to boil as soon as the baby starts crying so by the time they have got the infant out of bed and into the kitchen , the water is ready
elsewhere , a connected app will reveal how much water is in the kettle so people know how many cups they can make , and this can ultimately save energy because kettles are n't boiled too often unnecessarily
