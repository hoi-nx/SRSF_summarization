london israeli prime minister netanyahu and his supporters are trying to create " an atmosphere of hysteria " and " fear - mongering , " the iranian foreign minister said thursday
" in a highly controversial speech to the u.s. congress on tuesday , netanyahu said that far from stopping iranian , the deal currently being negotiated in switzerland would pave iranian 's way to nuclear weapons
zarif told amanpour that netanyahu 's speech had " no effect on the negotiating table
" he spoke from montreux , switzerland , where iranian , the united states and five other countries are trying to hammer out an agreement that would trade sanctions relief for guarantees on iranian 's nuclear program
" " people have been predicting for the past 20 years that iranian was a year away from making a bomb , and that prediction has been proven wrong time and again , " zarif said
" " the object of this exercise is to ensure that iranian 's nuclear program will always remain peaceful , and to remove all the restrictions that have been imposed on iranian , in our view unjustifiably , " he said
" as iranian negotiates its nuclear future , a war against isis is being waged in neighboring iraq
tehran has supplied the baghdad government with advisers , weapons , and ammunition , and one of its top generals , qassim sulaimani , has been sent to the country , according to the semiofficial iranian fars news agency
the pentagon has suggested that iranian could themselves be participating in the fight , which zarif denied
" the united states , which also has military advisers in iraq and has launched an air campaign against isis , adamantly denies that it coordinates with iranian in the fight against their common enemy
