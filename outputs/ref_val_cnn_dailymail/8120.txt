furious parents have attacked a school 's ' ridiculous ' uniform policy after dozens of pupils were put in isolation for refusing to remove charity ribbons and badges
students at grange school , in runcorn , cheshire , were kept out of lessons today after they refused to remove yellow ribbons and daffodils supporting the marie curie cancer charity
head barry carney defended the decision , saying the school selected one charity to support each year and could n't be seen to prefer one cause over another , but parents branded it ' pathetic '
student lily gaynor , 16 , said that up to 70 students from grange school , cheshire , had been taken out of lessons ahead of their gcses for refusing to remove the charity pins pupil lily gaynor alerted a local newspaper to the student 's plight by calling them from isolation
the 16 - year - old said : ' we have been taken out of lessons before our gcses because we wo nât take off our charity badges
' we âve got cancer badges and ribbons on our blazers and they âre saying it is nât part of school uniform and it âs singling out some charities over others
' the marie curie daffodil appeal has been running every march since 1986
support : pupils were wearing these flowers and yellow ribbons given out by the marie curie cancer charity during march as part of a fundraising drive which last year raised Â£ 8.26million last year the campaign , which is supported by the likes of actors olivia coleman and dominic west , helped to raise Â£ 8.26 million , funding 413,000 hours of nursing care
despite criticism , barry carney , the head of grange school , said he was simply applying the school 's uniform policy , which was available online ' for all to see '
he told the liverpool echo : ' each year we have a nominated charity which we call the head boy and the head girl âs charity
