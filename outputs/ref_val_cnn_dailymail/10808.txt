rugby union has a well - worn reputation for being the game of the elite and now we have the indisputable proof , that you indeed need to spend flash dollars to watch the rah - rahs best in action
in a daily mail investigation into the cost of taking a family to the football , the queensland reds ' super rugby games at suncorp stadium came in a long last , costing about $ 90 more than the best value - the western sydney wanderers at pirtek stadium
so we decided to put them to the test and try and settle the argument , once and for all , by piecing together a direct comparison of a day ( or night ) out , for a family of four , to the home ground of the top two supported teams in each code
asian champions western sydney wanderers have played before packed houses at pirtek stadium for the past two years but while they are testing their fans ' resolve this season in the a league they can still boast that they are looking after their loyal followers when it comes to pricing the rabbitohs , with almost 32,000 members to their name , kick off their title defence in the nrl on thursday against rugby league 's other best supported club , the brisbane broncos but both fall just short in the pricing against afl 's best supported club collingwood the collingwood playing at both the mcg and etihad provide good value for a family of fans , particularly after the home of afl announced it would cut the cost of food and beverages
collingwood can boast the biggest following of any south australian football club with almost 70,000 members the queensland reds have one of the largest membership bases with 28,000 now signed up
while suncorp stadium is considered among the best to watch football in australia following the super rugby does not come cheap , ranking last in the daily mail 's assessment in value for money rugby league launches into action tonight with the premiers rabbitohs tackling the brisbane broncos at suncorp stadium , considered by many the premier sporting venue in queensland
but does it stack up against victoria 's home of afl , the mcg ? or what about the tight - knit groups at pirtek stadium which back asian champions league winners , western sydney wanderers or aami park 's a league toppers , melbourne victory
it was on the following criteria ; a family ticket in general admission ( 2 adults and 2 children ) , with the purchase of two meat pies , two hot dogs and two buckets of chips plus one beer , one soft drink and two bottles of water , as well as two supporter caps
collingwood at mcg $ 155.10 3
queensland reds at suncorp stadium $ 236.04 * based on prices from clubs , stadiums and governing bodies sometimes it 's the little things , as pirtek catering officials were quick to point out , that their meat pies and chips all come with sauce included in the price
the mcg was fast out of the blocks , this week , ahead of the afl bounce , touting a drop in prices for a pie at the footy , a move which was widely acclaimed by supporters
a game at ' the g ' , watching collingwood do battle against essendon on anzac day , for instance , will set you back just $ 155.10 for a family outing
suncorp stadium is arguably the best venue in australia to watch the footy but unfortunately what is beyond reasonable doubt , is that you pay for the privilege , as can be seen by the price of a brisbane broncos game $ 202.80
the queensland reds confirm it by taking out the value wooden spoon , by far the most expensive at $ 236.04
the super rugby champions simply referred daily mail to their website and ticketek for details of pricing
their home ground of allianz stadium , run by the scg trust , refused to reveal what they charge for a meat pie and beer
however , in stark contrast , adelaide oval officials , provided a quick and detailed summary and also highlighted the added extras of an event at the revamped home of south australian sport , including the ability for supporters to take their own ' packed lunch and thermos '
while suncorp and the queensland reds offered up all details , allianz stadium , which is home to super rugby champions the nsw waratahs , chose not to reveal any details of how much it costs for food and drink at a big game a western sydney wanderers home game at pirtek ranks among the most enjoyable for football fans in australia , its atmosphere rivalled now by its value for money for loyal supporters and adelaide oval is also one of few where boutique beers are available to punters in the general admission areas
' afl chief executive mclachlan called on venues around the country to follow the mcg 's lead
' etihad stadium is still negotiating with the afl on prices but venue management hopes to make an announcement on food pricing before the start of the season
the adelaide crows huddle before a match at the adelaide oval - where entry conditions are quite relaxed including being able to bring a thermos and packed lunch to the big game
