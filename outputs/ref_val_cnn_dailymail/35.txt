the need to anoint messi the greatest player there has ever been every time he has a good game is becoming rather tedious
yes , messi is a genius
every time i see him play live , it is a privilege
and yes , he was mesmerising against manchester city at the nou camp on wednesday night
â everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home , â said arsene wenger once , and now everybody believes there has never been a footballer as pretty as messi
messi showcases his magnificent ball control with an audacious nutmeg of james milner messi renders bacary sagna to the status of an open - mouthed ball - watcher during another masterclass messi awaits the ball as he inspired the catalan club to reach another champions leauge last eight messi forces his way past aleksandar kolarov and fernandinho during barcelona 's cruise against manchester city what saddens me about the relentless championing of messi , though , is that the idea there has never been anyone to match him has become such an aggressive orthodoxy
it is as though messi has become a god and the idea that he might have a rival is sacrilege
as a football fan , i worship messi , too , but i do nât think he âs the best there âs ever been
it âs too early for that
he âs only 27 but he has not yet achieved what many of the other greats of the game achieved , either for club or country
a graphic circulated on social media recently that showed all the records messi had broken
in the argument about football âs best ever , messi is vulnerable here
messi has never been able to lift argentina to a world cup victory as diego maradona , another rival for the â best ever â , did in 1986
at last year âs tournament in brazil , where argentina made the final , messi produced some wonderful moments but he was not even his team âs best player
pele is hoisted aloft after winning his third world cup in 1970 with that peerless brazil side diego maradona lifted argentina to their second world cup in eight years with his tour de force in mexico messi reached the world cup final with argentina but was unable to grab the game by the scruff of the neck messi and pep guardiola embrace after winning the european cup in rome against manchester united messi âs zealous champions point out , with some justification , that international football is not as prestigious or as important as it was a few decades ago
messi is vulnerable in this regard , too , though
he has played for barcelona , the team almost universally regarded as the outstanding side of the last decade and yet , remind me , how many european cup titles has he won ? that âs right
the european cup is now seen as the ultimate test of a player âs greatness and messi has only won it twice
real madrid 's raymond kopa ( left ) holds the european cup as team - mate alfredo di stefano looks on johan cruyff , barry hulshoff and johan neeskens are in jubilant form after ajax 's 1973 win over juventus a fresh - faced raul aped a matador 's passes with a large spanish flag following real madrid 's win at hampden clarence seedorf flashes a trademark grin as he celebrates his second european cup win with milan carlo ancelotti 's side arrive back in milan with paolo maldini ( right ) getting his hands on a fifth european cup we all have our own ideas of what constitutes beauty in football and messi fits all of mine
but if i had to single out the most beautiful thing i have seen in the game , it would be brazil âs fourth goal in the 1970 world cup final
in particular , it would be pele âs part in it
it epitomised the way a man who was also a genius was ready to subvert himself to the team ethic
pele âs the best for me but i wo nât pour scorn on you if you stick with messi
just remember that in the same way english football did actually exist before the premier league , great players populated our game long before messi walked this earth
red bull should stop moaning and build a better car when mclaren won 15 of the 16 races in the 1988 f1 season , i do nât remember williams bleating about how unfair it was
i do nât remember williams demanding instant redress when prost won the first race for mclaren at jacarepaguã¡ in brazil
i do nât remember williams saying that because mclaren âs mclaren honda engine was so powerful , it should be hobbled in some way
i do nât remember him demanding that the fia do something about it because he had nât done as good a job as mclaren had
the preponderant mclaren team celebrate ayrton senna 's title in 1988 after an utterly dominant season williams was always a bit of a stoic like that
