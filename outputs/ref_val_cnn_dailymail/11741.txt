so was the new one the unluckiest horse at last year âs cheltenham ? twelve months of wondering should finally be answered at around half past three on tuesday afternoon
but were we all conned by the final - furlong surge that he conjured under jockey sam twiston-davies to grab third place behind jezki and my tent or yours , just in front of dual winner hurricane fly in fourth ? sam twiston-davies has unfinished business in monday 's big race at cheltenham sam twiston-davies riding the new one on the way to victory in the stanjames.com champion hurdle trial jezki and hurricane fly , who have traded punches all winter across the irish , are back again
with hopes resting on the shoulders of the 22 - year - old sam twiston-davies and the gelding trained by his father nigel â and with the irish wave advancing â sam twiston-davies could be forgiven if he felt like michael caine in the film zulu
however , he is totally focused on exorcising last year âs nightmare experience
it was one which prompted an enduring image of the 2014 festival , the crest - fallen sam twiston-davies with his head in his hands
back in 2013 ireland outscored great britain by winning 14 of the 27 races , the first time in cheltenham history that the irish have won the majority of the races
great britain was back on top last year ( 15 - 12 ) but face a strong challenge this time , with five of tuesday âs races containing favourites from across the water
twiston-davies is entirely focused on exorcising last year 's nightmare experience if the hot four favourites trained by willie mullins and ridden by ruby walsh all win on tuesday , bookmakers claim they could be facing their worst day since frankie dettori âs magnificent seven at ascot in 1996 , which cost them Â£ 40million
the irish duo struck twice on opening day last year and team up this time with douvan in the supreme novices â hurdle , un de sceaux in the arkle chase , faugheen in the champion hurdle and annie power in the olbg mares â champion hurdle
coral âs dave stevens said : â if all four win it will be our worst day in cheltenham history
â sam twiston-davies says : â there are loads of different opinions and i âd love to know what the answer is
â since last year âs champion hurdle , the new one has won all of his five races , four of them this season
he gained plaudits for his impressive victory in cheltenham âs international hurdle in december but was less impressive when being forced to dig deeper than expected by bertimont in his final prep at haydock
but sam twiston-davies says that is not a concern , adding : â i would nât say we have drawn a line through haydock because we learned that he does nât want heavy ground
â sam twiston-davies says he is now able to deal with defeat and disappointment much better victory on tuesday afternoon would be made even more satisfying given the familial nature of the challenge
since last year âs meeting , sam twiston-davies , whose two cheltenham winners include the new one in the 2013 neptune investment novices â hurdle , has been appointed stable jockey to champion trainer paul nicholls , the best job in jump racing
â it âs a very interesting question and i could not give an answer , â sam twiston-davies says
â i have been lucky to win a lot of big races but the new one is spectacular â one of the best i have ever ridden
