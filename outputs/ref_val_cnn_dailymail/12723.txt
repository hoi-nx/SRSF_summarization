the attack on tunisian 's famed bardo museum is just the latest evidence that parts of north and africa have become a magnet for islamist extremism
but it has emerged as a place of increasing concern as the threat of islamist extremism has intensified in the region
islamist terrorists also have struck in algerian , where they killed at least 37 hostages at a gas field in 2013 , and in libyans , where terrorists killed the u.s. ambassador and three others in 2012 and where isis has established a beachhead in the east
al qaeda 's north african offshoot al qaeda in the islamic maghreb ( al qaeda in the islamic maghreb ) , which has its roots in algerian , has captured territory in mali and taken hostages -- often europeans -- in countries such as niger and mauritanian
so what is the world doing about it ? the u.s. has created a military command in africa and also established a special operations base in djibouti , which borders somalia in the horn of africa
here 's a country - by - country look -- although not exhaustive -- at how islamist extremism has reared its head across a swath of africa
algerian is home to a long - running islamist insurgency
in perhaps the highest - profile incident , islamist militants attacked the in amenas oil and gas plant in southern algerian in january 2013
" last september , another islamist group beheaded a 55 - year - old french hiker , herve gourdel , after seizing him as he walked in djudjura national park in central algerian
days earlier , the outfit -- jund al khilafa , a splinter group of al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -- had pledged allegiance to isis
militants affiliated with al qaeda in the islamic maghreb had previously also kidnapped foreigners in algerian , including italians and spaniards
in 2007 , al qaeda in the islamic maghreb launched a suicide bombing campaign in algerian , which included a deadly bombing against the u.n. headquarters in algiers
the attack was swiftly claimed by wilayat al-tarabulus , isis ' name for the province
besides its growing presence in tripoli , isis is now the dominant force in derna in eastern libyans and controls parts of the town center of sirte , the hometown of former libyans strongman moammar gadhafi
before the advent of isis , an islamist group called ansar al shariah was blamed by the u.s. for carrying out the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the u.s. consulate in benghazi in which ambassador christopher stevens was killed
in 2012 , islamist extremists capitalized on chaos in mali after a military coup and uprising by tuareg tribesmen to seize control of a large piece of northern mali , an area the size of french
al qaeda in the islamic maghreb issued a warning to french via jihadist websites in january , following terror attacks in paris , stating that " french pays the cost of its violence on islamists countries and the violation of their sanctity , " citing the presence of its soldiers in mali
" jihadist groups including al qaeda in the islamic maghreb and the mulathameen brigade operate in the porous border areas between mauritanian , algerian , mali , niger and libyans
mauritanian troops joined the fight against al qaeda in the islamic maghreb militants in mali
militant group boko haram has waged a campaign of terror in mostly northern nigeria for over a decade
perhaps the most notorious incident came last april , when boko haram militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school in chibok , in borno state
in january this year , hundreds of boko haram gunmen seized the town of baga and neighboring villages in northern nigeria , as well as a multinational military base , leaving bodies scattered everywhere and as many as 2,000 people feared dead
earlier this month , in an audio message purportedly from leader abubakar shekau , boko haram pledged allegiance to isis
it had previously declared ties to al qaeda in the islamic maghreb
al shabaab started with a goal of waging a war against the somalia government in an effort to implement a stricter form of islamists law , or sharia
the fear is that many of these fighters will return to north african to join isis - affiliated groups there and carry out attacks
