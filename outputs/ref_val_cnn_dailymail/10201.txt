lowe , 24 , stole the 2011 911 carrera gts in broad daylight after spotting the car parked on the driveway of personal injury specialist ackroyd who at the time was on a family ski - ing holiday in austria
just half an hour later , lowe , of ashton-under-lyne , manchester , was spotted by police driving the Â£ 60,000 car - described as mr ackroyd 's ' pride and joy ' on the m60 , and a six - mile high speed chase commenced along the motorway
lowe weaved in and out of traffic at 100mph , forcing cars to move and slow down dangerously , before he attempted to move on to the a666 towards bolton at the same speed
tragically , it later emerged father of three mr ackroyd , 46 , had been planning to take his 11 year old disabled son edward on a road trip in the porsche around the scottish highlands on return from the skiing trip , as the boy 's disability meant he had not been able to go to austria
at crown court , lowe was jailed for two years after earlier admitting aggravated vehicle taking , burglary , dangerous driving and driving without a licence and insurance
after the case mr ackroyd a founding partner of a law firm in rochdale said : ' i got a call when i was away on holiday from the tracking company
' edward is terminally ill with duchenne muscular dystrophy , and he in particular adored the car
he could n't come on holiday with us in january so the two of us were going to do a grand tour of the scottish highlands in the car
' the court heard the theft occurred at 1pm on january 23 after opportunist lowe spotted the porsche and sneaked around the outside of mr ackroyd 's cottage in oldham to establish it was empty
he smashed through patio doors and helped himself to ipods , a playstation3 and the keys to the car before driving away in it
lowe broke into mr ackroyd 's home , stole electronic goods as well as his ' pride and joy ' porsche 911 mr ackroyd was planning to take his terminally ill son on a driving holiday around scotland in the car the car , pictured , was written - off after lowe lost control at 100mph and crashed into an embankment shortly afterwards mr ackroyd who had a tracking device fitted inside the porsche , got a call from a vehicle tracking company who said his car was on the move
lowe tried to flee on foot but soon gave himself up to officers and admitted he had stolen the vehicle earlier that day
the tracking device fitted to mr ackroyd 's car later provided evidence that lowe had also sped through a residential 30mph zone in the country town of slaithwaite at 82mph and he hit a top speed of 104mph before the crash
there were only four in the country and the impact upon mr ackroyd has been significant
father and son had planned a road trip around the scottish highlands in the vehicle and were unable to do that and his son was very upset
' in a statement , mr ackroyd said his children are now reluctant to stay at his home as they do n't feel safe and he has been forced to increase security
defending lowe , who has 10 previous convictions for 20 offences , sara haq said : ' he expresses that he fully embraces a custodial sentence because he acknowledges at the time of the offences he was not coping with life in the community and custody provides him with the stability he ca n't find in the community
' a Â£ 60,000 vehicle was written off which was devastating for mr ackroyd as it was his pride and joy and we also heard about how his children feel about the intrusion to his house
' lowe was jailed for two years at crown court , pictured , after admitting the theft after the case detective constable adam frank said : ' it is a miracle that lowe did not kill either himself or someone else
he drove in such a reckless way and at such dangerous speeds that if he had crashed into another car , i have no doubt we could be talking today about a fatality
' i am pleased to see lowe behind bars , not least because he is a burglar who could still be out there today targeting people 's homes
' but also for the family who have suffered tremendously from lowe 's actions
