the appliance of science behind deila âs celtic reign was there for all to see on sunday afternoon
any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as aberdeen âs resistance
despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding , frustrating 90 minutes against inter three days previously â and the associated , sleep - disturbing travelling â deila âs team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4 - 0 victory
it was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus
the norwegian âs insistence that celtic could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure
deila 's celtic side are starting to become formidable under the norwegian 's reign at parkhead but this much is clear
deila has unquestionably made the parkhead side more formidable in that regard
including one which earned recent arrival gary mackay-steven a rapid ( in more ways than one ) gold star
to the 39 - year - old , these reams of figures produced by the technology at celtic âs disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion
deila ( centre ) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics â i think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective , â said deila
â there are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results , but i think we have had six victories after coming home from european games
gary mackay-steven ( right ) ran an impressive 1300 metres against aberdeen on sunday â we want to be direct , we want to create things , we want to have penetration , we want to be a high - pressing team , so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform
â when we played inter at home , their striker , palacio , ran 1250 metres at high intensity against us , sprinting
but at the weekend gary mackay-steven ran 1300m ! â you have to know the references of what it means to be fit
it âs easy to say that to the other players , if i tell them how far gary mackay-steven ran in a game and compare it to them
deila highlighted how impressive palacio 's running was against his side in the europa league clash â if a player asks me why he is sitting on the bench and not playing , i can show him the numbers
if he is running 600m and the guy in the team is running 1200m , what does he think of that ? â why ca nât gary mackay-steven run as far every game ? stuart armstrong ran 900m on sunday and he did nât play the whole game
â it was pointed out that stuart armstrong actually lasted only 62 minutes after replacing kris commons against aberdeen , before being hurt and making way for anthony stokes
was that not evidence of the midfielder being overworked ? the winger also scored a terrific solo goal against their title rivals to send the bhoys six points clear â it was cramp , he âll be okay for ( tonight âs game ) against st johnstone , â said the celtic manager
â just coming to celtic - dealing with the contract , the media and so on - used a lot of mental energy in gary mackay-steven and stuart armstrong
stuart armstrong is also a willing runner for celtic and his stats are impressive since he joined the club â but everything has to be related to football
â what celtic have done on scottish pitches is win their last 10 domestic matches
making it 11 against st johnstone at parkhead will push them nine points clear of aberdeen
