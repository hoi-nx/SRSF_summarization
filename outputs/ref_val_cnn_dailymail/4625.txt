to his adoring sons , weekes was the perfect dad - lavishing them with attention , treating them to trips away and spending every weekend caring for them
but behind weekes â fatherly devotion lay a dark obsession : he was hooked on trawling the web for vile child pornography
and when weekes â hapless family stumbled across his secret , he turned on them in the most cowardly way imaginable â he blamed the stash of obscene images on his own sons
traumatised sons ( thomas , 25 , left , and adam , 22 , right ) had no choice but to confide in mother , nicola , 47 ( centre ) after they made the shocking discovery devastated adam â who has now disowned his dad and even changed his name by deed poll - said : â he may have brought me into this world , but he âs not my father
â angry ex nicola , 47 , said : â weekes denied his guilt to the bitter end and tried to blame anyone and everyone around him â including his own family
â nicola was already a mum to two young boys â thomas , 25 , and his older brother , who has asked not to be named â when she met weekes more than 20 years ago
weekes treated the boys as his own and cemented his role as dedicated dad when nicola fell pregnant with adam , now 22
when their relationship fell apart , weekes insisted on staying in touch with the children , and the pair agreed the boys would spend weekends with him
nicola , from aberdare in rhondda , south wales , added : â i had no complaints about weekes as a father and no qualms about the boys going to stay with him
' when they were younger , they 'd sleep over at weekes 's house and they talked on the phone with him all the time
weekes pictured with his sons adam ( front ) and thomas when they were children â as they got older , they had their own social lives but they always wanted to spend time with weekes
' adam âs happy memories of weekends at his dad âs in nearby merthyr vale include learning to shoot an air rifle , trips to the cinema and theme park outings
â but that love was destroyed one night two years ago when adam was confronted by the awful truth that his dad hoarded sick images of child pornography downloaded from the internet
adam recalls : â it was late at night and dad had already gone to bed
â there were hundreds , maybe thousands of images of children in there â nasty stuff , too horrible to describe
adam was too horrified to tell his family , carrying the burden of what he had found , and endured three weeks of torment before he finally broke down â i was in total shock , i could nât believe what i was seeing
â the next morning , adam concealed his horror and spent the rest of the day with his dad before returning home
wrestling with his emotions , adam knew he had to share his discovery â but could nât bring himself to tell his mum what he âd found
' adam admits : â my head was wrecked
â after three weeks of torment , adam could no longer bear his secret alone and he finally broke down , revealing all to nicola
' sitting bolt upright , i asked him what he meant , and then he admitted he 'd found pornographic images of children
' the conversation was overheard by thomas who revealed he , too , had been wrestling with the discovery of vile photos on his dad âs computer for the past six weeks
â i was furious he had nât said anything before , but at the same time relieved i was nât alone , â adam says
i wished i had n't let them spend time alone at weekes 's house
â the boys gave statements and weekes , 48 , was arrested
computer equipment was seized in a raid on his new home in tredegar , gwent
the family did nât think the situation could get any worse â until weekes betrayed his sons by blaming them for his vile horde of downloads
' adam commented : â the police told us he was trying to pin it on us , and also his own brother
â weekes denied all but the family hoped he would face up to what he âd done and change his plea to guilty
adam explained : â when we were young , dad had this odd obsession with the police
â weekes has since admitted the ruse and received a 12 - month community order the jury heard how nearly 6,000 indecent images were found on a computer and equipment seized from weekes â home , going back as far as 2003
over 22,000 references to the phrase ' pre-teen ' were found on his laptop
' he was convicted unanimously on one count of possessing thousands of indecent images , another of possessing prohibited images of a child and one of possessing extreme pornographic images
he is awaiting sentence at merthyr crown court
adam changed his surname from weekes to lewis last year â and now wants nothing more to do with his father
â i want everyone to know what he is , â says adam
