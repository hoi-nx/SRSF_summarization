for the first time , nasa has tested one of the explosively powerful boosters that will help its space launch system rocket reach space in 2019 , and eventually take humans to mars
the 126 - second static - fire test took place in utah today at 11:30am edt ( 3:30pm gmt )
temperatures reached 2,500 Â° c ( 4,500 â° f ) - enough to melt sand on the site into glass - as 3.6 million pounds of thrust poured out of the engine
that static - fire test ( seen in the animation above ) took place at 3:30pm gmt and lasted 126 seconds
the 3.6 million pounds of thrust produced temperatures of 2,500 Â° c. when sls eventually flies , two of these boosters will be used this was the first test of the redesigned booster for sls
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton sls will stand 321ft ( 98 metres ) tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload
it measures 117 ft ( 54 metres ) in length , 12.2ft ( 3.7 metres ) in diameter and has a total mass of around 725 metric tons shown are engineers at atk preparing to test the largest , most powerful booster ever built for nasa 's new rocket , the sls ( sls ) , which fired up for a ground test today at atk â test facilities in promontory , utah the test was run by nasa in tandem with the rocket propulsion company atk
today was about as successful as you can get ' towering a staggering 384ft ( 117 metres ) tall , the sls ( sls ) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds when it eventually takes flight
it will be used to take astronauts to mars sometime in the 2030s , with nasa âs orion spacecraft being carried on top
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , the sls ( sls ) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds when it eventually takes flight
