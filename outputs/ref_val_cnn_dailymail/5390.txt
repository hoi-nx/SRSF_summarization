iditarod winner : seavey beat his 55 - year - old father to the finish line in nome , alaska , early wednesday morning with a time of eight days , 18 hours , 13 minutes and six seconds zapped by the cold : apparently the musher had frost in his beard when he pulled up to the finish line , with a windburned face to match an exhausted seavey , who also won the iditarod in 2012 and 2014 , petted and hugged his dogs after their victory
' it takes a whole team to get any of us here , ' he told reporters at a finish line ceremony , which was broadcast and live - streamed
