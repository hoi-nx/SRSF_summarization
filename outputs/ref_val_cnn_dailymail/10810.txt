lib dem leader lib dem today faced a grilling from towie star joey essex , who seemed a little confused about the lib dem â name , and what the election was all about
mr lib dem had to patiently explain that the party was not called â demo - cats â , after essex wondered why it had such a â weird â name
â in tribute to the star 's blunder , the party changed the logo on its website from the yellow bird to a yellow cat
but amongst the journalists and broadcasters in the audience was the 24 - year - old reality tv star , who is said to be making a documentary for itv 2 on the election
essex questioned why every party thinks they are right about everything , what is the point of voting lib dem and told mr lib dem that being deputy prime minister must be â sick â
the unlikely duo appeared to hit it off , and later posed for a selfie
â why are they called lib dem democats ? it âs a long word innit ? â essex asked
mr lib dem tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988
â this was before my time , they got together and created the lib dem
' i wondered that because it âs a weird word , innit ? it âs got cats in it
â laughing , mr lib dem tried to put him right
â mr lib dem tried to explain the history of the merger between two rival parties in 1988 which saw the creation of the lib dem the conversation moved on to the merits of power , and just how much mr lib dem wields
â you are basically like , you rule this country right ? â â i âve been deputy prime minister for the last five years , â mr lib dem replied
i sort of rule essex
i was going to say , someone else will be prime minister next ? are you going to be prime minister ? ' the lib dem leader , currently on around 8 per cent in the polls , had to admit this was unlikely
â essex is due to interview labour âs ed miliband and tory leader david cameron during the election campaign
mr lib dem said that he should challenge them both on the idea that either of them can win outright
i think the lib dem - not â cats â - have shown in the last five years have got good instincts
â joey essex was in the audience for the lib dem leader 's morning press conference on mental health and nhs funding essex is due to interview labour âs ed miliband and tory leader david cameron during the election campaign somewhat stating the obvious , essex admitted that he does not â really know much about all the politics â
it was only his second day in his job as a roving reporter on the campaign trail and so far â at the moment to me everyone just seems to want to win â
