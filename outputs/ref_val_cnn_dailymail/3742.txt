the number of pizza take outs compared with gym memberships may give you some idea of a city 's obesity rates
but scientists say to really understand an area 's weight problems you need to go underground into the grimy depths of the sewage network
here , they claim , raw waste can be analysed to reveal the urban ' microbiome ' , offering glimpses into disease trends on a wider scale
lifestyle differences can alter the human gut microbiome , and microbial community composition of an individual with obesity
now scientists say this community can be analysed from a community 's sewage system studies of the human microbiome , the collection of trillions of microbes living in and on the human body , have gained traction during the last decade
in a recent study by the university of wisconsin-milwaukee , sewage samples were collected from 71 cities across the us
according to the researchers , a microbial study of that sewage helped them predict each city 's obesity rates with 81 to 89 per cent accuracy
the skinniest city sampled was steamboat springs , colorado , with an obesity rate of 13.5 per cent , while the heaviest was st joseph , missouri , with a rate of 37.4 per cent
overall , scientists compared the gut bacterial community profiles of 137 healthy adults provided by the human microbiome project to the bacterial community profiles of more than 200 sewage samples
' the sewage samples of 71 cities do not tell us anything specific about ' individuals ' who live in those cities ' added eren
' however , only using sewage samples , we were able to differentiate these cities based on their estimated level of obesity
' this approach can be beneficial to answer various public health questions while not compromising the privacy of individuals
