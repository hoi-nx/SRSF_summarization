cnn has learned that the manufacturer of the endoscope involved in two superbug deaths at ucla never obtained permission to sell the device , according to an official at the fda
olympus started selling its tjf-q180v duodenoscope in 2010 , but the fda did n't notice until late 2013 or early 2014 that the company had never asked for clearance to put it on the market , according to karen riley , deputy director of strategy for the fda 's office of external affairs
" can you imagine a prescription drug getting out on the market that did n't go through the approval process ? " asked dr. steven nissen , the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the cleveland clinic , who 's testified to congress about device safety problems
" in a statement , olympus said it did n't think needed the fda 's permission to sell the device , but now at the request of the agency , it has applied for that permission
seven hospital patients at ronald reagan ucla medical center were infected with the deadly superbug cre -- also known as carbapenem - resistant enterobacteriaceae -- from october to january , according to hospital officials
the patients caught cre after routine endoscopic treatments
" according to fda rules , a manufacturer must seek clearance for a new model if it includes changes that " could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device
with this new model , olympus sealed up that part of the device , known as the elevator channel , hoping to make it more impervious to infection
last year , at the fda 's request , olympus applied for permission to sell the scope
olympus is working with relevant medical societies and our customers in research of this emerging issue and the development of additional safeguards to prevent infection associated with [ duodenoscope procedures ]
now the fda is asking all three companies to submit evidence that the scopes can be thoroughly cleaned -- and so far it 's not going well
riley said twice the companies have submitted data that failed to show that cleaning could get rid of 99.9999 % of all microbes on the scope -- the fda 's standard for disinfection
riley said she does n't know if the fda will penalize olympus for selling the device without permission
