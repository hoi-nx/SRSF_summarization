pope francis has said that all he wants is to go out one day to a pizzeria " without being recognized
pizzeria owner enzo cacialli personally handed the pope a pie on sunday as his motorcade drove through naples
but , not just any pizza : a naples - style thin crust creation with " il papa " spelled out in dough and topped with yellow cherry tomatoes , a reference to the vatican flag
when enzo cacialli learned francis was going to be in town he decided to follow in his father 's footsteps
" giving a pizza you made with your own hands to the francis is very emotional
" enzo cacialli is still waiting to hear whether francis enjoyed the edible offering .
