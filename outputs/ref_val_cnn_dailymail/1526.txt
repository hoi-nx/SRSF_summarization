i ca nât wait to compete at the european indoor championships in prague , which is the biggest competition of the season so far
for multi-eventers , packing your suitcase to go abroad can be a bit of an ordeal
i noticed it more last year when i just did long jump at the world indoors and i only had to take one pair of trainers
british 's katarina johnson-thompson spoke about her preparations for the european indoor championships the 22 - year - old athlete will be competing in the pentathlon in this year 's indoor championships in prague normally at championships i room with holly bleasdale or jodie williams but neither of them are competing in the indoors this season so i do nât know who i âll be in a room with this time â you get the chance to pick but i just left the box empty
she âs been so unlucky not just with injuries but competing with lots of drugs cheats in her event
i âm glad athletics is being cleaned up because to have an equal playing field means so much to us as athletes
it âs definitely good that all the drugs cheats are getting exposed and it âs going to be a clean sport
the last time i did pentathlon was 2012 because i did nât do an indoor season in 2013 and last year i was ill. i was a little kiddy in 2012 so i definitely should be getting one this time
the liverpudlian is confident after recording personal bests in the long jump and high jump this season i feel like a different person since i had a foot injury , which ruled me out of the commonwealth games and european championships last year
away from competition , there âs been a new addition to my household - i âve got another sausage dog as a companion to chorizo
i think it âs like having children - you make more mistakes with the first one and then correct them with the second ! as well as funding the road to rio athletes , every week national lottery players raise over Â£ 33 million for arts , heritage , charity , community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities
