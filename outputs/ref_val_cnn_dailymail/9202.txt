these are testing times for scotland
the embarrassment of the wooden spoon and a possible six nations whitewash await on saturday
after four straight six nations defeats , it may seem that he is a little detached from the reality of the situation but jim hamilton , that most rugged of lock forwards , maintains this is a team on the verge of something special
the 32 - year - old , who has won 60 caps during his nine - year international career , is not one to take a backwards on the field of play
and he insists that , despite results , vern cotter 's men are heading in the right direction
scotland lock jim hamilton has won 60 caps for his country spanning a nine - year international career ireland will attempt to rack up both the win and tries needed at bt murrayfield on saturday afternoon to apply a significant dose of pressure to championship rivals england before they take on france in the evening kick - off
but the man who vern cotter calls his ' great , old warrior ' was in no mood to take on the roll of cannon - fodder
and jim hamilton , who has already experienced the pain of the wooden spoon in 2007 and 2012 , said : ' i understand the results are the most important thing , but we definitely have some players who can do something really special in the near future
jim hamilton insists scotland are heading in the right direction under scotland coach vern cotter ( above ) ' we have some fantastic players coming through
jim hamilton cites young talent such as 21 - year - old lock jonny gray as reasons for optimism going forward ' i will stay here as long as i possibly can to help our fortunes change which they will
' jim hamilton 's optimism is not based in fantasy
all they have to do now is execute vern cotter 's game plan without making the silly mistakes that have cost them victory in at least three of their six nations matches thus far
young flanker adam ashe ( right ) is another player who has shown plenty of promise in recent games ' for example , look at the england game when we lost early points but went in at half - time winning 13 - 10 â which just shows the maturity in what is a young squad
can we win the game against ireland at the weekend with what we 've got ? of course we can
