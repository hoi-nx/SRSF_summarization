but when naomi and hannah moxon âs baby teeth started falling out on opposite sides of their mouths , their mother karen made a surprise discover - her girls were mirror twins
the rare condition , which is thought to occur in around 25 per cent of identical twins , refers to twins who are mirror images of one another
when they eat , naomi uses her cutlery the traditional way , while hannah moxon âs knife and fork are held in reverse
and their hair naturally parts on opposite sides of their heads â hannah moxon âs on the left , naomi âs on the right
yesterday the 19 - year - olds , from peterborough , who are currently competing in bbc talent show the voice , opened up about their unusual situation
naomi said : â our mum noticed quite early on that we were doing things with the opposite hands
she would say raise the hand you use to draw and i 'd raise one and hannah moxon would raise the other
' then mum mentioned it at one of our check - ups and that 's when they said about mirror twins
' â there were other things like i use my knife and fork the wrong way round , â hannah moxon added , â our baby teeth fell out on different sides as well , one of mine would fall out and then within a few days naomi lost the same tooth on the other side
also our partings are naturally opposite , although we sometimes wear it the same
â hannah moxon ( left ) and naomi are starring in the bbc tv show the voice bundles of delight : although identical , tiny tots hannah moxon and naomi are known as mirror twins the twins , pictured naomi , left , and hannah moxon , aged two in other respects , hannah moxon and naomi are remarkably similar , made even more so by the fact they like dressing alike
when they made it through the blind auditions round of the voice as singing duo classical reflections , they wore matching white dresses to perform nella fantasia by sarah brightman
hannah moxon said : â we like dressing the same , but not always
â â we started off as half a person , â naomi joked
the pair often finish each other âs sentences , have never spent more than a few hours apart and claim to know what the other is thinking â â if someone âs being annoying we can share it with each other with a look , â naomi said
speaking about their close bond , hannah moxon said : â we rely on each other a lot , we âre very protective of each other
â so much alike : the girls have different hair partings and one is left handed and the other right handed talented : the girls ' mother , karen , discovered her daughters were different from an early age however they left that school for an arts - based sixth form college where they developed their singing act , performing at local community events and weddings
and tonight the moxon twins , who live with their mother karen , 50 , and father david , 48 , will perform on the voice on bbc1
close sisters : hannah moxon ( left ) and naomi , pictured aged eight , are appearing on bbc1 's the voice ' also i think because of our past experiences we âve become really strong people and those sorts of comments do nât really affect us anymore
