former bbc boss greg dyke has branded clarkson a ' disaster waiting to happen ' amid claims the presenter punched a top gear producer
the fa chairman said the bbc has been placed in an impossible position and ' ca n't win either way ' whatever the outcome of the top gear inquiry
clarkson , who is currently suspended after allegedly hitting tymon in a row over hot food , has reportedly promised to sue the bbc if he is sacked from the popular show
speaking to itv news today , mr greg dyke said : ' first of all i 'd say that i do n't think clarkson is the first presenter i 've met who would have liked to have thumped his producer
it 's hard to â¦ i 'm glad i 'm not the executive who has to take that decision because if you were , you ca n't win either way now
' the former bbc director general added : ' even if you decide to keep clarkson â¦ what happens next ? ' clarkson allegedly believes that the bbc have launched a ' smear campaign ' against him which he ' wo n't let go '
it comes amid reports that the bbc are filming a pilot of a new motoring show called the getaway car , which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges
clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of ' a fracas ' , prompting the top - rating show to be pulled off air
the four top gear roadshows scheduled for norway next weekend have been postponed
tickets for the postponed shows cost between Â£ 42 and Â£ 100 , meaning the decision could cost the bbc more than Â£ 1million in lost revenue if clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled
sacking clarkson could mean the end of top gear , which makes the bbc millions every year speculation about his future has been mounting and will be decided this week when the corporation 's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director - general
the bbc âs internal inquiry into clarkson âs fracas with mr tymon is expected to made public as soon as tuesday
' clarkson , pictured with co ho - hosts james may and richard hammond at a top gear live show in prague , will not be performing at the four events in norway as they have been cancelled clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of ' a fracas ' with top gear producer tymon ( right ) , prompting the top - rating show to be pulled off air the top gear frontman revealed that he has been ' put on silence ' which is why he has been refusing to comment on the allegations
there are very good reasons from my point of view why i simply ca n't say a word
the bbc was given a reminder of the strength of support behind clarkson when a million - strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank
there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear â worth Â£ 50million a year to bbc coffers â off the air while the investigation was under way the petition , launched last week , reads : ' we the undersigned petition the bbc to reinstate clarkson
' it emerged yesterday that a report into clarkson 's behaviour was commissioned by bbc head of tv danny cohen after a series of other scandals last year
a report into the cases apparently concluded that top gear should have a new producer role to act as a go - between the show 's team and the bbc 's management to help deal with any future crisis
