the ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus will phase out the show 's iconic elephants from its performances by 2018 , telling the associated press exclusively that growing public concern about how the animals are treated led to the decision
executives from feld entertainment , ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's parent company , said the decision to end the circus 's century - old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length as elephants have often been featured on ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's posters over the decades
' there 's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers , ' said alana feld , the company 's executive vice president
13 animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018 while one elephant is on a breeding loan to the fort worth zoo
another reason for the decision , company president kenneth feld said , was that certain cities and counties have passed ' anti-circus ' and ' anti-elephant ' ordinances
the company 's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year , and alana feld said it 's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction
' all of the resources used to fight these things can be put towards the elephants , ' alana feld said during an interview at the center for elephant conservation
' the circus will continue to use other animals - this year it added a mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders to its circus xtreme show and it will likely showcase more motorsports , daredevils and feats of humans ' physical capabilities
ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's popular canada - based competitor , cirque du soleil , features human acts and does n't use wild animals
' there are endless possibilities , ' said juliette feld , another executive vice president of the company and a producer of feld 's marvel universe live , disney on ice and monster jam shows , among others
it costs about $ 65,000 yearly to care for each elephant , and kenneth feld said the company would have to build new structures to house the retiring elephants at the center , located in between orlando and tampa on a rural , ranchlike property
