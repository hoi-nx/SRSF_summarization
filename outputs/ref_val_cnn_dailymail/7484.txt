ageist comments about madonna 's fall at the brits could deter firms from hiring older women , a government adviser claims today
older workers ' tsar ros altmann said the reaction to the 56 - year - old 's dramatic tumble on stage at the awards ceremony ' encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate '
it comes ahead of a new report which reveals how unconscious bias or outright age discrimination stops some employers from hiring the over- 50s
she failed to untie her cape in time for her dancers to rip it away as she took to the stage at london 's 02 arena
mrs ros altmann said the media coverage after the fall was typical of the way age is treated
' the recent example of ageist comments after madonna fell off the stage at the brits encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate
' the pop superstar was dragged to the ground as she attempted to undo her armani cape which was pulled by a dancer madonna later laughed off the incident and said her armani cape was simply tied ' too tight '
she wrote : ' armani hooked me up ! my beautiful cape was tied too tight ! but nothing can stop me and love really lifted me up ! thanks for your good wishes ! i 'm fine ! ' ironically her new song referenced a fall
' older workers ' tsar ros altmann said the reaction to the 56 - year - old 's dramatic tumble on stage at the awards ceremony ' encapsulates ageist thinking that is inappropriate ' mrs ros altmann 's report , expected to be released tomorrow , will call for urgent action to improve the chances of older workers
' i 'd like to thank dr ros altmann for report as a clear call to government , business and individuals to encourage more older people into employment
