scientists using the hubble space telescope have confirmed that the jupiter - orbiting moon ganymede has an ocean beneath its icy surface , raising the prospects for life , nasa has revealed
the finding resolves a mystery about the largest moon in the solar system after nasa 's now - defunct galileo spacecraft provided hints that ganymede has a subsurface ocean during exploration of jupiter and its moons from 1995 to 2003
in this artist âs concept , the moon ganymede orbits the giant planet jupiter
a saline ocean under the moon âs icy crust best explains shifting in the auroral belts measured by hubble space telescope
scientists first suspected an ocean in ganymede in the 1970s , based on models of the large moon
the galileo spacecraft took brief ' snapshot ' measurements of the magnetic field in 20 - minute intervals , but its observations were too brief to distinctly catch the cyclical rocking of the ocean 's secondary magnetic field
using computer models , they realized that a salty , electrically conductive ocean beneath the moon 's surface was counteracting jupiter 's magnetic pull
they also repeated the seven - hour , ultraviolet hubble space telescope observations and analyzed data for both belts of aurora
ganymede joins a growing list of moons in the outer solar system with subsurface water
nasa hubble space telescope images of ganymede 's auroral belts ( colored blue in this illustration ) are overlaid on a galileo orbiter image of the moon
' it is one step further toward finding that habitable , water - rich environment in our solar system , ' said astronomer heidi hammel with the washington - based association of universities for research in astronomy .
