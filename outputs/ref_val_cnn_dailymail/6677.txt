famed radio presenter laws has again shocked listeners after he berated an elderly man who began to break down on air as he revealed he was sexually abused as a child
during the interview on thursday morning mr laws called the elderly man - known as brian - a ' wet blanket ' and suggested he should ' go to the pub and have a lemonade , for god sake '
' brian then told mr laws that he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to ' go away and forget about it
' it was at this stage mr laws added insult to injury as he told 80 - year - old brian that he should have fought the man off , as he himself had done when men had ' had a go ' at him when he was younger
the disgraced shock jock called the elderly man a ' wet blanket ' and suggested he should ' go to the pub and have a lemonade , for god sake '
did n't you kick or yell or scream or hit ? ' mr laws continued to press the issue and said he should have told his family or his boss , who it turns out was responsible for several of the assaults
repeat offender : mr laws was criticised in 2013 after telling a female sexual assault victim that women who dress provocatively are ' rapebait ' mr laws then tried to salvage the conversation saying he should have felt better after speaking to him and getting it off his chest
' mr laws then shockingly claimed the interview was a waste of ' both of their time
' brian continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks , trying to minimise human contact when mr laws thought it prudent to offer brian some more sound advice
in a flood of support for brian many twitter users have called for mr laws to be sacked ' have you ever stopped and asked yourself , why do n't people like me ? ' you 're not the happiest soul , i do n't know that you 'd make people who are around you feel all that good
' ' no ? well there 's not a lot more i can do , is there ? ' to wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation mr laws asked brian to thank him for his time
' brian , could you say thank you ? ' the interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation mr laws had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse
mr laws blamed the victim and claimed that women who dressed provocatively were ' rape bait '
the twitter community rushed to condemn the actions of mr laws labelling him a ' monster ' sarah monahan , the former co-star of hey dad ! who was among actor robert hughes â child sex abuse victims , chimed into show support for brian and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care
sarah monahan wants brian to know that he is n't alone and people do care karen willis from nsw rape crisis centre is among critics who say mr laws should be taken off the air
' brian , could you say thank you ? ' : mr laws insisted brian thank him at the end of the awkward conversation â what we know is that 40 years ago child sexual assault was rarely talked about
