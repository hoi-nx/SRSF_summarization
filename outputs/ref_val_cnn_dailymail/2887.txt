loneman , 59 , had been living on the streets of oklahoma city for the last decade when doctors gave him three weeks to live
loneman , who had loved being a marine , asked for three things : to be buried in dress blues , with a ' high and tight ' marine haircut and a corps flag for his casket
a flag and the dress blues were donated , and the foundations also paid for loneman 's funeral expenses and gave him an honor guard for his burial , according to koco-tv
loneman , who was native american , was beloved by the local veteran affairs organization , who knew him to have ' a good heart ' and a ' great sense of humor '
the oklahoma city veterans affair put the word out and a number of veteran organizations banded together to make loneman 's wish come true
his funeral was also paid for and he received an honor guard for his burial even as the organization fought to get loneman off the street , he would say the aid should be given to a veteran who needed more help than him
