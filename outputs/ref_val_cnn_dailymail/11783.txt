officers turned up at her home , and when she eventually answered the door she was so drunk she had to grip walls and furniture to stand up
in an account rejected by a district judge , she blamed the high reading on post-driving consumption and said she had downed one and a half bottles of wine in about ten minutes before the police came to her home
