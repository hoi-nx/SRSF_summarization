pm david cameron has said he would not bid for a third term for many of the greatest leaders in our history , one word was simply beyond them
so by historical standards , david cameron âs revelation that , if the voters send him back to downing street in may , he will step down after five years and allow somebody else to lead the conservatives into the 2020 election , counts as a genuine bombshell
but nobody expected him to say so publicly , and certainly nobody thought he would do it on the brink of one of the tightest and most unpredictable election campaigns in history
not for mr david cameron the solemn goodbye in an address to the nation
terms in office , he remarked , â are like shredded wheat : two are wonderful but three might just be too many â
what makes mr david cameron âs announcement so extraordinary is that there is simply no historical precedent
thatcher , for example , famously led her party into a third general election in 1987 with a promise that she would go â on and on â â a remark that delighted her admirers and horrified her critics
few people doubt that had she not been toppled in a coup in 1990 , she would have led the tories into a fourth election two years later
he should have resigned in glory after winning world war ii and losing the 1945 general election
in 2004 , mr blair promised that if he won a third election he would soon resign to give his successor time to prepare for labour âs tilt at a fourth term in office
i am sorry to say this is almost certainly the scenario that awaits mr david cameron
whatever you think of mr david cameron , the unarguable fact is that he remains the tories â single biggest asset
on top of that , mr david cameron is clearly the most popular and credible of the major party leaders
if i had been advising mr david cameron , i would have urged him to emulate wilson , who showed no sign of going anywhere until his shock resignation in 1976
like mr david cameron , the labour prime minister was the dominant political personality of his age
he even managed to bounce back from defeat in 1970 â as i believe mr david cameron could , too , if he really wanted to
by contrast , mr david cameron has , i think , made a rod for his own back
david cameron and his wife samantha cameron invited the cameras into their oxfordshire home ahead of the election , during which the prime minister made the revelation that he would step down before a third term indeed , for george osborne , boris johnson and theresa may , that campaign may well have already begun
and if mr david cameron sticks to his promise to serve a full five - year term , it will drag on until the beginning of 2020
and i firmly believe that at some stage in the next few years â and probably sooner rather than later â mr david cameron will have cause to regret his decision
and if mr david cameron manages to retain power on may 7 , then i believe he will bitterly regret the casual manner in which he threw away so much of his authority .
