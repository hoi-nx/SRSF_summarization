relations between the uk and china took a significant leap forward with an historic meeting between its president xi and the duke today
president xi , whose communist party leadership was once derided by the prince as ' appalling old waxworks ' warmly shook hands with his son william and heaped praise on the british royal family
the two men met in the imposing great hall of the people - home of the congress - where the president highlighted their past interest in his country and told of how they had contributed ' positively ' to co-operation between china and uk
' over the years the royal family has shown great interest in , and support for china / uk relations
' the president also passed on his good wishes about william 's second child expected next month and ' congratulated ' the duke and kate on the imminent birth
he concluded by saying ; ' i 'm sure your royal highnesses visit to china will be a productive visit and a visit of building friendships , ( it will ) surely go a long way to developing mutual understanding and friendly ties between china and uk people and i would like to wish your visit a great success
' in response william thanked the president ' enormously ' for inviting him to the great hall of the people and said : ' it 's been a long interest of mine , for many years , to come and visit china
' he told the china leader he was going to have an informative few days adding : ' i look forward to as you say strengthening uk / china relations and building things for the future
' william , who is an aston villa fan , added : ' i also gather you 're quite a football fan , i 'm looking forward to learning about china 's football ! ' the prince - who has left pregnant wife kate back in uk - said the forbidden city is ' beautiful and lovely ' he looked relaxed during his day in beijing , where the royals hope he can foster good relations with china prince william , who is on a week - long tour of the far east , flew into china last night from japan for one of the most high - profile â and diplomatically sensitive â tours of his fledgling royal career
with china on course to overtake the united states as the world 's largest economy , the uk government is keen to foster positive diplomatic relationships - and william 's visit is being seen as a key part of those efforts
stepping foot for the first time on china soil , the second in line to the throne became the most senior member of the royal family to visit the country since the queen nearly 30 years ago
in truth , many had believed that william 's father , prince charles , would be the first to stake that claim
however he has also made no secret of his personal , and deeply held , opposition to china actions in tibet , regularly welcoming their exiled spiritual leader , the dalai lama ( reviled in beijing as a dangerous separatist ) , to clarence house
the prince chats with a crowd of well - wishers outside the uk ambassador 's official residence in beijing william admitted his china is coming along ' slowly ' , and is mainly limited to greeting ' ni hao ' the pair have even been photographed holding hands
after taking part in the formal handover of the former uk colony of hong kong in 1997 to china , charles also memorably described the officials taking part in ceremony as ' appalling old waxworks '
william 's grandfather , prince philip , also has form in the country
during the queen 's 1986 visit to china he memorably caused enormous offence by telling a group of uk students : ' if you stay here much longer , you 'll all be slitty eyed
' following his meeting with the president , william visited the exquisite forbidden city â the ancient home of china 's deposed emperors
also present was barbara woodward , uk 's new ambassador to china and the first - ever woman in the role and sajid javid , minister for culture , media and sport
' william thanked the president ' enormously ' for inviting him to the great hall of the people and said : ' it 's been a long interest of mine , for many years , to come and visit china ' the president also passed on his good wishes about william 's second child expected next month and ' congratulated ' the duke and kate on the imminent birth responding to the mandarin greeting ni hao ma , he said : ' ni hao
' admiring the view of ancient temples and palaces on the hill beyond the forbidden city 's 10m - high walls , he also noticed building work taking place across the skyline
mr zhang told him : ' welcome to china , we did n't have time to visit all of the forbidden city today , just a small portion
' during a whistlestop tour of the forbidden city , william admired the view of ancient temples and palaces on the hill beyond the 10m - high walls it came the duke took part in a ' shaun the sheep ' promotion at the uk ambassador 's official residence the duke , whose whistlestop tour lasted just 35 minutes , replied : ' it feels like a very big portion
it 's a packed programme of engagements and while there is palpable disappointment that the prince 's wife , the kate , had been forced to remain at home due to the advanced stage of her second pregnancy , william has made the right noises so far , it seems .
