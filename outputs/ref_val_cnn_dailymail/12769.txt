in his writings , author roy yearned for reason and humanism guided by science
he had no place for religious dogma , including from islamic , the main religion of his native bangladeshi
extremists resented him for openly and regularly criticizing religion in his blog
they threatened to kill him if he came home from the america to visit
as usual , roy defied the threats and departed his home in suburban atlanta for dhaka , where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled " the virus of faith
as he walked back from the book fair , assailants plunged machetes and knives into roy and his wife , killing him and leaving her bloodied and missing a finger
" investigators are proceeding on the notion that roy 's murder was an extremist attack
" but at night , secularist sympathizers marched through a street holding torches ; by day , others held a sit - in to protest roy 's killing
roy founded the religion critical blog mukto mona , which served multiple writers
" to the most devout and to extremists , roy 's criticisms amounted to blasphemy
" roy , your voice of reason and your passion for free thinking will never die
roy and the blog 's other critics took off the gloves when it came to religion , particularly islamic
roy was a fan of maher 's harsh reproach of islamic and a critic of aslan , who has countered maher 's standpoint
" roy likened women in burkas to " living zombies , " tweeting out a cartoon of one standing next to a child dressed as a ghost for halloween
" the virus of faith was the weapon that made these atrocities possible , " roy wrote
to roy , god was an outdated notion
roy sought enlightenment in doubt , criticism and reason
roy was a fan of " cosmos , " the tv series explaining the science behind the origin of the universe , and of the geek sitcom " the big bang theory
" to me , it is a rational concept to oppose any unscientific and irrational belief , " roy said
" a well - known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through his numerous facebook statuses , " roy wrote
his book " hit the cranial nerve of islamic fundamentalists , " roy wrote
" roy lives in america and so , it is not possible to kill him right now
