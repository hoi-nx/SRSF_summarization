india has banned the broadcast of a controversial documentary in which one of the men who gang - raped and murdered a student is shown blaming the victim - a move the film 's maker called ' arbitrary censorship '
home minister rajnath singh told india 's parliament on wednesday the comments of singh , one of five men convicted over the 2012 attack in new delhi , were ' highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women '
' the government condemns it , ' he said of the documentary made by award - winning british film - maker leslee udwin , who won rare access to new delhi 's tihar jail jail to interview the prisoner on death row
singh 's comments in the rajya sabha , india 's upper house , came after a new delhi court late tuesday issued an order banning media from showing the film , ' india 's daughter '
the physiotherapy student died from her injuries 13 days after she was savagely attacked on a bus while on her way home from the cinema
it highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the world 's second most populous country and led to a major reform of india 's rape laws , speeding up trials and increasing penalties
india 's ndtv network was due to have shown the documentary to mark international women 's day on sunday , when it will also be broadcast in six other countries including british
leslee udwin said she was heart - broken by the ban on the documentary , in which singh said the 23 - year - old victim was to blame for her own death
singh , who was driving the bus , added : ' she should just be silent and allow the rape
' police officers escort singh , one of the men convicted of the gang - rape and murder of an india student , outside the high court in new delhi , on september 24 , 2013 ' i am sure , positive , that ndtv will fight this arbitrary censorship all the way , because it is an organisation that stands up for values , for public welfare and for the greater good , ' she told afp
but home minister singh said she had violated the terms of the agreement by not showing the complete unedited footage to jail officials
' four men including singh were sentenced to death for the crime , but their execution was later stayed on appeal by india 's supreme court
