dundee united manager jackie mcnamara pointed the finger of blame at ref thomson after paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1 - 1 draw with celtic in the scottish cup
paton was astonished to be shown a red card along with virgil van dijk after the dutchman and calum butcher clashed on the ground following a poor tackle by celtic captain brown on nadir â who appeared to kick brown âs head in retaliation
jackie mcnamara vowed to appeal in a bid to clear paton for next sunday âs league cup final against deila âs men at hampden , and it remains to be seen whether sfa compliance officer tony mcglennan will take retrospective action against calum butcher , nadir or brown , with tv pictures indicating they could all have seen red
dundee united manager jackie mcnamara was n't impressed with referee thomson 's performance paton was sent off in an apparent case of mistaken identity during a stormy 1 - 1 draw with celtic but the dundee united boss claimed that , had the match official sent off brown for the initial challenge , the ensuing melee and embarrassing card blunder would have been avoided
â i think we will be appealing , â said jackie mcnamara , whose team were reduced to nine men in the second half when dixon was sent off for handling the ball in the box
â paton feels a bit hard done to for being sent off for nothing
â asked if he expects brown to be hit with disciplinary action from the sfa , jackie mcnamara replied : â no comment
â nadir scored dundee united âs opener on the stroke of half time after connolly appeared to go down easily in the box , with celtic boss deila later insisting the player should be punished for diving
three minutes after the break , dundee united âs dixon was dismissed for blocking a goal - bound drive by griffiths but the striker âs penalty was saved by keeper radoslaw cierzniak
thomson ended up sending three players off , and dundee united will appeal the red card of paton griffiths had the last laugh , however , with a headed equaliser in the 71st minute to take the match to a replay at parkhead on march 18
nadir was lucky to still be on the park after kicking out at brown but jackie mcnamara claimed not to have seen the incident
and when nadir gets tackled by brown , the ball breaks and calum butcher wins the challenge to put us through and i was looking at that next bit of play
i did not see what happened with virgil van dijk , calum butcher or anyone else
â jackie mcnamara , whose side will now face celtic four times in march , also defended young striker connolly
