the treatment â known only by its experimental name of xaf5 â has been shown to significantly reduce bags under the eyes
its makers say it could also be used to dissolve double chins and even be employed on the body , particularly on stomach fat
the praise follows yesterday âs annual meeting of the american academy of dermatology , where us bio-tech company topokine presented details of a trial of 90 patients , aged between 40 and 70 , who applied the cream once a day to their under - eye area for ten weeks
bags were graded on a four - point scale , and in ratings given by independent doctors , just under half of those using xaf5 were found to have improved by one full grade in both eyes , with some seeing a two - grade improvement
â eye bags , or steatoblepharon , are fat pads under the eye socket that bulge forwards
when applied , xaf5 is absorbed through the skin and into fat tissue
the makers of the cream say it could also be used to dissolve double chins and even be employed on the body , particularly on stomach fat
however , while testing the drug , doctors noticed that fat around they eyes began to disappear within weeks â called prostaglandin - associated periorbitopathy , or pap
however , as well as losing their eye bags , some patients also developed deeper or â sunken â eyes
xaf5 , which would be a prescription - only cream to be applied at home once a day , is now undergoing further testing .
