screaming into a towel stuffed in my mouth , sweat pouring down my forehead , tears running down my face , i squeezed the breast pump again
such was my determination to give my newborn daughter the best start in life , i was expressing milk for her , despite the huge abscess across the centre of my right breast
rather than give summer , then just two weeks old , a bottle of formula , i battled on
months of brainwashing by the â breastapo â and their mantra â breast is best â , made me feel the only thing worse than this torment was giving up
laura ( pictured with her daughter , summer ) was so determined to breastfeed summer as a baby that she went through weeks of agony it was an attitude that not only threatened my health but also tarnished the first weeks with my precious firstborn and made me angry that women are put under such pressure to breast - feed that common sense flies out of the window
the questions about whether i intended to breast - feed began at my first prenatal appointment when i was 12 weeks pregnant and continued for the next six months
friends , family , colleagues ; it seemed everyone wanted to know my intentions and to preach how breast - feeding was natural , easy , the right thing to do
i wanted to breast - feed ; it can be a wonderful , bonding experience and mother âs milk protects against illnesses and allergies but the constant pressure to breast - feed takes no account of the fact not every woman can
when i put her to my breast she was too weak to latch on so the midwives gave her formula
thankfully , on day three , with the help of a breast - feeding consultant , summer finally latched on
laura ( pictured with summer ) wanted to breastfeed because she knew it could be a bonding experience and that the mother âs milk protects the baby against illnesses and allergies over the next few days i continued to breast - feed but summer was so hungry , i followed advice and relied on formula and expressed milk to top her up
anxious to know if i was doing things right , i asked a breastfeeding consultant âs advice
for the next six days i spent three hours a day with the breast pump and expressed at night after summer had finished feeding
when i found a hard , round mass in the tissue of my right breast i asked the breast - feeding consultant to take a look
â three days later my breast looked red and sore and was tender to touch
laura had problems with breastfeeding summer ( pictured at 4 days old ) right from the very beginning as summer was initially too weak to latch on my gp diagnosed mastitis ( inflammation of the breast ) and gave me antibiotics but instead of being supportive and reassuring , the breast - feeding consultant insisted i use my left breast
infection was running rife in my body and i had an abscess , 4cm wide and 3cm deep , under the skin of my right breast
the abscess had grown and the pressure from my building milk supply meant i had no choice but to start expressing again
while trying to breastfeed , laura ( pictured with summer at one month ) developed a 4 cm wide and 3 cm deep abscess under the skin of her right breast the next day , while waiting to be seen at the clinic , the abscess burst , leaving a deep , gaping wound across my breast
i asked him if i should feed with my left breast
when the breast - feeding consultant visited me a few days later she found me crying out of shock at the size of the wound
by now , so nervous i was doing things wrong , i was spending hours travelling all over cardiff to various breast - feeding workshops for struggling new mothers
each time i found waiting rooms packed with worried women and fraught staff
one midwife insisted on examining my abscess in the middle of a crowded waiting room
when the abscess burst , laura ( pictured ) was left with a gaping wound on her right breast , despite this she carried on trying to breastfeed with her left breast any advice i got was contradictory
a second abscess was duly drained but further ultrasounds revealed four more absesses in that breast
laura ( pictured with summer at five weeks ) , says it 's astonishing that she was never told to stop breastfeeding despite all the issues she had and the amount of medical professionals she consulted at last the decision was out my hands ; i had medical approval to stop
laura ( pictured ) says it was the pressure to breastfeed from the nhs , society and herself meant that she was too scared to stop because she felt the consensus would be that she had not tried hard enough when you have been through childbirth and are looking after a baby round the clock , you are already a physical wreck , unable to make sensible decisions
