a video has been released which appears to show rooney being knocked out cold by former manchester united team - mate bardsley
the old trafford captain and the stoke defender pulled on gloves during a night - in at rooney 's cheshire mansion last month - but bardsley 's wife tanya dismissed the incident as a joke
with only a small space in which to work in rooney 's lounge , the pair trade light blows for just under a minute before bardsley sends rooney reeling
the england striker lies motionless under a chair for several seconds before the video , obtained by the sun , cuts out
rooney , a big boxing fan , posted this picture on his instagram with professional boxer paul smith bardsley 's wife tanya moved to defuse the furore by claiming the video had been a joke ' rooney had everybody worried when he hit the floor like that , ' a source told the newspaper
' bardsley 's wife tanya later hit back at the furore caused by the release of the video
' the video is believed to have been filmed on february 22 , the day after manchester united lost 2 - 1 at swansea
rooney is wearing a pair of white adidas gloves while bardsley pulls on a pink pair
neither man has a headguard on and while bardsley is wearing shoes , rooney is in his socks
bardsley is the more aggressive throughout , and tries to go for rooney 's body , pushing him back
the incident could leave rooney with some uncomfortable questions to answer from manchester united chiefs over his choice of extra-curricular activities
and the manchester united manager is unlikely to be impressed with rooney for partaking in such dangerous activities prior to matches and training
