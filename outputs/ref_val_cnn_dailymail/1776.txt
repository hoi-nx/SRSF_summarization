the cheer for an ap mccoy - ridden winner this week might be loud but the decibel level could be matched if a runner trained by sandra hughes reaches the winner âs enclosure
and thursday might be that day as the sandra hughes - trained lieutenant colonel is 8 - 1 third favourite for the ladbrokes world hurdle , while the tullow tank is no forlorn hope in the opening jlt novices â nh chase
both will also carry a wave of sentimental support from the cheltenham crowd as sandra hughes took over the family stables close to the curragh after her father , dessie , lost his fight against cancer in november
sandra hughes celebrates victory at fairyhouse with lieutenant colonel and jockey bryan cooper a festival legend , dessie âs eight wins as a jockey included the 1977 gold cup on davy lad and the 1979 champion hurdle on monksfield
they were matched by eight winners as a trainer , headed by the back - to - back champion hurdle victories of hardy eustace in 2004 and 2005
appropriately , the track have named the prize for this week âs top trainer in dessie âs honour
it is a tribute that the sandra hughes family appreciate but securing a winner with what sandra hughes refers to as â dad âs horses â would be even more special
sandra hughes , whose thunder and roses unseated its jockey in the nh chase on tuesday , said : â it is great to get dad âs horses here because that is what he would have wanted
trainer dessie hughes , who passed away in november last year , celebrates with bryan cooper in the winners enclosure after our conor 's win in the spring juvenile hurdle â we always came as a family so it is quite tough not having him here , but i feel he is looking down on me
â with sandra hughes this week is dessie âs widow , eileen , and his son , richard , the three - time flat racing champion jockey who last week announced he will be setting up training in britain next year
but it was always the plan that sandra hughes would take the helm at her father âs stable
â jockeys line up to observe a minute 's silence at cheltenham racecourse after the death of trainer sandra hughes the tullow tank is so called because it is the nickname of ireland rugby forward sean oâbrien
â a win for the tullow tank would be popular as connell suffered the blow of losing sandra hughes - trained our conor in a fatal fall in last year âs champion hurdle
the hand of dessie is also very much behind the path steered by lieutenant colonel this season
he had always wanted a six - year - old he felt was some way off maturity to have another season over hurdles so , after he was beaten in his first steeplechase at naas in november , sandra hughes was delighted when his owners , ryanair boss michael and his racing manager brother eddie , suggested he switch back to the smaller obstacles
â sandra hughes fits first - time cheekpieces on lieutenant colonel , who will be ridden by bryan cooper , and is also optimistic the tullow tank will run well
