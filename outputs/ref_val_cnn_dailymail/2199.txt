detectives investigating claims of a vip paedophile sex ring have been passed lurid allegations relating to powell
the late tory mp , who was one of the most prominent and divisive politicians of the 20th century , was named in a church of england review into historic sex abuse
the claims relate to allegations of satanic rituals , often involving the abuse of children
the bishop of durham has also handed detectives the name of liberal , the flamboyant welsh mp who died in 2008 aged 91
last night the church of england confirmed that both names had been passed on to detectives from operation fernbridge , a metropolitan police inquiry into an alleged westminster vip paedophile network
the right rev butler was given the politicians â names by walker , former bishop of durham , who heard the allegations when he was a vicar counselling in the 1980s
mr walker told senior clerics that liberal was named by three abuse survivors whom he counselled when he was a vicar in brighton in the 1980s
powell is one of several high - profile names passed to scotland yard by bishop of durham paul butler , above , who is leading the review â a number of survivors independently gave the name of a particular mp being involved , â he said , adding
â a church of england spokesman said : â the name powell was passed to operation fernbridge on the instruction of bishop paul butler
â in 1994 , an investigation by the london school of economics into 84 alleged cases of â satanic abuse â in the uk between 1987 and 1992 found no convincing corroborative evidence
the claims against powell and abse have emerged amid mounting claims of a paedophile network involving establishment figures , which was allegedly covered up by special branch
powell âs frontline political career ended in 1968 after he made his â rivers of blood â speech warning about the dangers of uncontrolled immigration
tory leader edward heath sacked him from the shadow cabinet the following day , although powell remained a tory mp until 1974
when on saturday evening a fellow journalist told me of the allegations made by the church of england , my first instinct was to laugh : but that soon changed into utter outrage when i realised he was serious
the church of england has publicly accused powell of being involved in ritual satanic abuse on hearsay , without the slightest evidence
these post-savile accusations bring to mind the hysteria surrounding allegations of satanic abuse in the late 1980s and early 1990s , including notorious cases in rochdale and the orkneys that involved social workers and police forcibly removing children from their homes in dawn raids
powell , pictured making a speech in 1977 , has been named in a church of england review into historic sex abuse for decades , powell has long been a bug - bear of the liberal establishment
what better way for some mischievous leftist priest to damage powell further than by linking him with the current rash of stories about child abuse ? in 1998 , just after powell died , the bbc broadcast a programme in which they railed at enoch for his hypocrisy
i have long dreamt of the day when ignorant politicians and establishment figures would stop manipulating powell âs memory for their own advantage
