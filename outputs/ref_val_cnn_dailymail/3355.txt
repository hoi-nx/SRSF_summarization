the kevin pietersen storyline is a good'un , full of rage , intrigue and hypocrisy
england will not win or lose the ashes on the basis of whether kevin pietersen returns
and a 35 - year - old kevin pietersen is unlikely to be in any of those categories
kevin pietersen shows off his latest flamboyant hairstyle on his way to the fox sports studio on tuesday that 's the best - case scenario
from wg âs gamesmanship via compton âs knee through to ian botham âs extra-curriculars and kevin pietersen âs tweets , our game has always quietly welcomed the glamorous , scurrilous sideshow , the tabloid tittle - tattle to balance out broadsheet sobriety
( i hope kevin pietersen proves me wrong
the point of this article is not to pick on kevin pietersen
) kevin pietersen is gunning for an england recall after his exile from the side , but turns 35 in the summer the batsman has enjoyed some stellar achievements with england , such as here after the 2005 ashes win kevin pietersen 's antics entertain the public just as ian botham 's extra-curricular activities once did
here the all - rounder was pictured dressed as a rabbit next to team - mate phil defreitas in melbourne in 1986 what should concern english cricket right now is how one of the best - resourced teams in the world spent the world cup looking like one of the worst ; how an air of fatalism about their chances became a self - fulfilling prophecy ; and how downton appeared so intensely relaxed about the fact that england were miles off the pace
in fact , batting was not even the half of their problems â another reason why the kevin pietersen debate risks straying into red - herring territory
far worse was the bowling , with james anderson and stuart broad taking nine wickets between them at an average of 55
steven finn went for nearly seven an over , which was expensive even by the standards of this world cup
video we take responsibility for exit - morgan stuart broad was a key member of england 's struggling bowling attack during the world cup steven finn ( right ) has gone backwards in both pace and achievement as a bowler chris woakes has added pace but england 's bowling stocks pale in comparison with the likes of australia these are all questions that should concern colin graves and tom harrison in the short term
but the long term is even more worrying : where are england âs fast bowlers going to come from ? this is the area that has always been most poorly served by an overcrowded domestic schedule played on tired pitches
even james anderson has always relied on craftsmanship rather than speed , while stuart broad keeps breaking down and steven finn has slowed
it should n't be the case that england feel the need to take promising young quicks out of the domestic game , away from the coaches who know them best
if england are able to come up with an attack that regularly takes 20 wickets , then the inclusion or otherwise of one batsman will feel like an irrelevance
that was the week that was then again â¦ michael vaughan believes kevin pietersen has a 10 per cent chance of playing for england again
the mystery is why kevin pietersen is n't doing his best to increase the odds
speaking on fox sports last week , he had some fair things to say about the way peter moores had handled england 's world cup campaign â but basic psychology tells you they were the kind of points better made by an out - and - out pundit , not a man hoping to resurrect his international career by working with â¦ peter moores ! peter moores ( left ) will hardly be encouraged by his previous with kevin pietersen ... and kevin pietersen 's latest comments ' i heard the coach come out and say : " we do nât have a settled side " , ' said kevin pietersen
but , not for the first time , you do wonder : who , if anyone , is advising kevin pietersen ? morgan has conflicting ipl and england duties double standards ? that said , it would be intriguing to know what kevin pietersen makes of morgan 's decision to place his ipl deal with sunrisers hyderabad ahead of england 's trip to dublin in may for a one - day international that has taken on an extra dimension following the world cup farce
yet the ecb 's more relaxed approach to the ipl sheds a more sympathetic light on kevin pietersen 's wishes
and morgan , do n't forget , is england 's one - day captain
