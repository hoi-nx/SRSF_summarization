there 's a steady stream of blood flowing down his face from a cut just above his eye
and even if there were , it 's doubtful anything a doctor could say would stop him from fighting
the crowd that has gathered in this backyard of a miami suburb wo n't let him
they have too much money invested
besides , this illegal fight is the safest way he can make money
and his best chance of reaching the american dream
when i first saw this footage from the documentary " dawg fight , " i recoiled
here we are recognizing the 50th anniversary of " bloody sunday " in selma , alabama , and in the next state over there are desperate , unemployed black men beating the hell out of each other for a hundred bucks
while the 1999 cult classic " fight club " made organized street fights look like a sexy form of psychotherapy for repressed men ( and some of the guys who participate in street fights do fit the bill ) , the vast majority in the documentary just need the money
because in the miami area the poor reportedly live on $ 11 a day
and in west perrine , the suburb where " dawg fight " takes place and where nearly 75 % of the residents are black , unemployment remains high
" this is the future of americans , " said the film 's director , corben
" when you look at the incarceration rate , especially for black men , and income inequality , the life you see in ' dawg fight ' is where we are headed
the americans has 5 % of the world 's population but 25 % of its prisoners -- by far the most of any country
so while it is true unemployment is down and wall street is booming , the combination of a debilitating criminal justice system and low wages has created an environment in which men such as those featured in " dawg fight " feel backyard fights are actually one of the less nefarious ways they can make money
sens. rand paul , r-kentucky , and cory booker , d-new jersey , have become interesting bedfellows as they work to address the country 's runaway prison industry
that 's not to say all of the ex-cons in the 12 - by - 12 ring are nonviolent drug offenders
" i do n't promote violence , i promote hope , " said dada 5000 , who started west perrine fights in his mother 's backyard and who was once a bodyguard for mixed martial arts fighter kimbo slice
" people think of miami , they think of beaches and ocean drive and all of that
this is the part of miami people do n't want to talk about
" but you know what ? miami is not unique
" dawg fight " certainly does n't sugarcoat anything
" this is the real miami
