altmann , the government 's business champion for older workers , is releaseing a major report next week tens of thousands of women over 50 are being left on the jobless scrapheap years before retirement because they are forced to care for elderly , sick or disabled people in their family
it will highlight caring responsibilities as one of the major barriers preventing women in their 50s and 60s from staying in work
almost one in four women aged between 50 - 64 care for elderly , sick or disabled people â with some 153,000 women approaching retirement claiming carers allowance â compared to just 87,000 men
the caring responsibilities are hitting women 's job prospects â with the employment rate among 50 - 64 year old women just 63.7 per cent compared to 74.5 per cent for men
' the coalition government has taken bold action and is turning the tide , but there is more to do â particularly to help older women combine work with caring responsibilities
