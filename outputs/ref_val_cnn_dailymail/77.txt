a photographer has delved into the decaying bowels of the new york subway system and emerged with incredible shots of its abandoned tunnels
the subway 's third rail famously carries 625 volts of electricity and touching it means likely death for new york who do n't listen to announcements reminding passengers ' do not go on to the tracks for any reason '
'' death is a serious option down there , ' mr berg told daily mail online
berg , a 21 - year - old photographer in new york , regularly makes his way into the deep abandoned corners of the metropolis 's subway system the urban spelunker said that his favorite type of shot is where trains create a blur of light as they go past empty stations like the one above mr berg ( pictured ) goes down onto the tracks of the subway , but makes sure to be careful and avoid touching the third rail , which carries 625 volts of electricity some abandoned platforms , such as the unused area underneath 42nd street 's ace train stop , are within earshot of conversations happening at active stations the urban photographer , who grew up in manhattan and new jersey , would not disclose how he reaches the abandoned platforms , though doing so often requires going on to live in - use tracks where speeding trains come every couple of minutes
mr berg first met up with a group of underground photographers when he was 19 after seeing one of their pictures on instagram
the snappers regularly receive requests to help hopeful urban explorers reach hidden spots of the subway , which mr berg calls ' the bando , ' but does n't offer help to those who do n't know what they are doing and seriously hurt themselves
the skilled snapper said that while he may one day shoot commercial photography , though right now he is just focused on sharing his experiences in new york the photographer said that visitors to the subway tunnels can emerge with their hands and teeth covered in dirt despite not having touched anything the photographer is not interested in internet fame , but uses his instagram as a means of sharing his photos with like - minded people and creators there is also ' another world ' of graffiti artists and urban explorers who use the same tunnels for adventure , though some do not like photographers sharing photos of their secret spots he has also had close encounters with workers in the subway , and one time narrowly escaped an abandoned platform before an employee with a flashlight called over a group of his coworkers to the spot mr berg had been minutes before
' catching blurs of light from passing trains is his favorite type of shot
mr berg hopes his work lets new york , and people at large through social media such as instagram , see a different side to the metropolis some hidden parts of the new york subway system , which has been operating for more than a century , are only reached by long walks mr berg said that his ' brain works fast and unimpeded ' when he is down on the tracks and that the fear of oncoming trains or electric shock is ' only mental ' the 21 - year - old has had close encounters with getting caught after workers with flashlights suspected that someone was up to ' very illegal ' activity the tunnels are stifling hot in the summer and can become cold in the winter , though they are always capable get visitors dirty even without them touching anything
when people hear about mr berg 's photos they often ask if he has seen the ' mole people ' who live in the tunnels , though he does n't believe they exist
mr berg often rides between subway cars ( also very dangerous and illegal ) to find unused tracks that will lead to more hidden underground gems
the most famous abandoned station is the former city hall stop in lower manhattan , mr berg 's favorite
the station sometimes has tours where it is lit up , but mr berg prefers to shoot as it is , with minimal light and the blur of passing by with hundreds of unsuspecting passengers who will soon take the stairs back to the world at street level
while mr berg has also shot photos dangling his toes from skyscrapers dozens of stories up , he says there is nothing that compares to exploring the underground
the photographer once found a hole in the wall that would spit out water punctuated by bursts of 500 cigarette butts at a time mr berg often rides between subway cars , which is illegal and dangerous , to find unused tracks that may lead to the city 's hidden gems the new york subway has more than 400 active stations , but there are more that have fallen out of use since the system began in the early 20th century mr berg has also shot photos dangling his toes from skyscrapers dozens of stories up , he says there is nothing that compares to exploring the underground and finding new places mr berg ( pictured ) said that the city beneath his feet is ' truly beautiful ' and he hopes to ' captivate the city with some truly great people '
