a newlywed couple were so determined to have the ultimate set of wedding photographs they travelled to antarctic - so they could pose up with penguins in their natural habitat
and the bride even wore her strapless dress in the sub-zero temperatures , while her groom wore â what else ? â a penguin suit ! but the china couple âs antics have brought anything but best wishes back in their homeland , where their behaviour has been deemed an embarrassment , according to the people âs daily
white wedding : there were no cold feet for this couple - who posed up after their ceremony in antarctic walking down the icicle : while friends and family went for padded jackets , the bride wore a strapless dress snow regrets : the couple had the time of their lives - but these photos prompted frustration back home the nation is acutely aware of its reputation for tourists behaving badly abroad and anything that can be seen to reinforce the stereotype is often widely condemned
with a rapidly - growing wealthy elite , china already sends more tourists to antarctic than any country in the world apart from the u.s. and australia
irresponsible ? china citizens are keen to avoid anything that paints them as reckless eco-tourists souvenir : photographers claim to have witnessed tourists getting so close to penguins , they scare them off joking around : these men brave the cold as they visit antarctic 's paradise bay in the middle of ' summer ' internet users in china reacted angrily , with some suggesting the next stop would be taking inappropriate pictures on mars
