as soon as mourinho declared chelsea 's capital one cup final against tottenham as the most important final of his distinguished managerial career , it was hard to see past mourinho 's side
and that could , in part , be down to the chelsea manager 's brilliant record in cup finals : he 's lost just one final across 11 full seasons as a coach , winning 10 along the way plus seven league titles and four community shields or super cups
mourinho holds the capital one cup aloft , it is the 21st trophy of his career as a manager the portuguese coach lifts the cup in delight , and he believes ' finals are not for playing , they are for winning ' the ecstatic chelsea boss showed a contrasting mood to the miserable figure from recent press conferences june 15 , 2003 : taca de portugal final

' finals are not for playing , they are for winning , ' mourinho said at full - time at wembley , and he certainly believes in his own words given the impressive record he holds on show - piece occasions like sunday
victory over tottenham ended a two - year mini-drought for mourinho , having come through a difficult final season at real madrid before failing in all three cup competitions and finishing third in the premier league with chelsea last season
that was his longest stretch without a trophy while in constant employment as a manager - and sunday marked his first cup final success in almost four years
the only final that a mourinho - led team has been beaten in came in 2013 's copa de rey final when real madrid were defeated 2 - 1 by local rivals atletico madrid - and even then it took extra time to kill off mourinho
