a drone has been used in a daring night - time attempt to smuggle drugs and weapons into a high security jail
the plan was only thwarted when the machine became entangled in razor wire on a security wall and was then spotted by staff at bedford prison
it is the first known case of a remote - controlled aircraft being used to infiltrate a british jail
the chinese - made machine was carrying a package containing drugs , mobile phones , screwdrivers and a knife
prison staff spotted it on the razor wire and managed to retrieve it
the plan was only thwarted when the machine became entangled in razor wire on the security wall at the jail this is the first known case of a remote - controlled aircraft being used to infiltrate a british jail one theory is that the ' pilot ' planned to direct the drone to a spot where it could hover outside a cell window
a prisoner might then have been able to reach out and grab the illicit cargo
the miniature aircraft are already a major concern to police , who want to be given powers to seize them if they suspect they are being misused
the one flown into bedford prison two weeks ago was a dji phantom 2 vision , which weighs just 2.5lbs but has a range of nearly half a mile
the device is fitted with a wide - angle camera and can be bought online or at an electrical retailer for around Â£ 900
a bedfordshire police spokesman said : ' we were called to reports that a small drone had been discovered alongside a package at bedford prison at 11.30pm on march 6
there have been no arrests in connection with the bedford prison incident yet
