doctors could give transplant patients organs from cancer victims , drug addicts or those with infections under new plans in a bid to battle the shortage of healthy donors
the nhs is trying to increase the numbers of willing organ donors because so many patients are dying waiting for transplants
doctors could give transplant patients organs from cancer victims , drug addicts , and those with infections under new plans ( file picture ) and one of the plans reportedly been considered is offering patients transplants using organs from people who would have usually had them rejected after being deemed to ' high - risk '
according to the sunday times , the proposals would create a special ' fast track ' waiting list for the high risk organs
' organs are deemed high risk if they come from cancer patients , intravenous drug users and those with a history of having high - risk sex lives
however , central manchester university hospitals nhs foundation trust have said they rejected a research proposal looking into high - risk organ donation
' this was an application for funding for a research project looking in to offering patients at risk of dying without transplantation organs considered high risk
' hughes , 42 , left , and stuart , 67 , right , both died after receiving kidneys infected with meningitis - causing parasitic worms last year , it emerged that at least a quarter of all transplants that took place last year involved â high - risk â organs that could be damaged or infected
figures obtained from nhs blood and transplant , the authority which oversees donations , show that last year , 333 patients were given high - risk organs
â i was offered organs from patients with a history of recent and significant high grade cancer , which has a high risk of transmission
