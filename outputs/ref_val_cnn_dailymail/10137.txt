british scientist david nutt has claimed the terminally ill should take hallucinogenic drug lsd
david nutt , a former government drug tsar , thinks that psychedelic trips might be able to lead to long - term benefits in a person âs thinking
the 63 - year - old said that using the drug is the ' great unanswered question in neuroscience '
professor david nutt was sacked from his job as the government 's chief adviser on drugs in 2009 after saying ecstasy and lsd were less harmful than alcohol
but he maintains that psychedelic trips might help terminally ill patients feel at one with the world
' but on lsd it âs as if they have died , as if they âve gone out to another place
but having been turned down by ' classic funders ' , he raised the more than Â£ 32,000 on crowdfunding site walacea.com
early results are said to be ' exciting ' but the full findings must wait until more funding can be found to complete the research
' we 've banned research on psychedelic drugs and other drugs like cannabis for 50 years
two kinds of scans were used , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) and magnetoencephalography ( meg ) , which measures small magnetic fields generated in the brain
dr carhart-harris , also from the imperial college team , said the dose of lsd given to the volunteers was a ' tiny speck '
it would be described as a moderate dose , but a moderate dose of lsd can still produce a profound state of consciousness
' i would n't say that it 's a dangerous experiment , but i would say that lsd has potential negative effects
it 's not uncommon for people to have anxiety during a psychedelic drug experience
professor david nutt said lsd was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating ' many conditions ' , in particular alcoholism
' that is an absurd amount of censorship , ' professor david nutt added
' interesting drugs that we 've been researching like mdna ( ecstasy ) and lsd , are relatively low in terms of harms , considerably less even than cannabis and very much less than alcohol , ' he said
' he maintained that the risks of taking lsd had been ' massively exaggerated ' by the cia and us drug enforcement administration
initial funding for the lsd study came from imperial college and the beckley foundation , which promotes drug policy reform and research into the medical benefits of psychoactive substances
professor david nutt said lsd ( a molecule of the drug is pictured ) was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating ' many conditions ' , in particular alcoholism professor david nutt said he approached the medical research council and wellcome trust for the outstanding funding to no avail
' dr carhart-harris said : ' this is the first lsd brain imaging study that 's ever been conducted
