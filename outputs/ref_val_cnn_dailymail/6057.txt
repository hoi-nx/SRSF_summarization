arsenal beat west ham 3 - 0 on saturday and wenger âs side , who have not won the league since 2004 , are now seven points behind chelsea
mourinho has admitted that arsenal have joined chelsea and manchester city in the title race the blues struggled to break down southampton despite diego costa 's first - half opener at stamford bridge arsenal saw off the threat of west ham at the emirates stadium on saturday with an impressive 3 - 0 win mourinho said : â of course arsenal are in it
â both manchester city and arsenal are in the title race
it depends on the momentum for arsenal - the 3 - 1 defeat against monaco or the 3 - 0 defeat against west ham ? â so the danger is always there
â mourinho believed a wrongly - awarded penalty denied his side an eight - point lead over manchester city at the top of the league
mourinho says that arsenal are a danger to chelsea , although he is happy with his current strong position on sunday mourinho was frustrated matic was penalised - allowing dusan tadic to score from the spot and cancel out diego costa 's first premier league goal for almost two months - while branislav ivanovic was not awarded a spot kick at the other end
' dean ( right ) gave southampton the penalty for their equaliser , mourinho said that it ' is not a penalty ' thibaut courtois could not keep out dusan tadic 's spot - kick and the playmaker secured a point for southampton mourinho was clearly upset with the penalty decisions , but bit his tongue on this occasion
' branislav ivanovic may have been clipped by dusan tadic , but fell theatrically , dissuading dean from pointing to the spot
matic brought down saido mane for southampton 's equaliser but mourinho was clearly upset branislav ivanovic went down in search of a penalty but dean did not give the desired spot - kick asked about the fall , mourinho deferred to his media officer sitting alongside , saying : ' you have to control me , if not ... ' mourinho was told television pundit souness - with whom he had a public exchange of views this week after the scot criticised chelsea 's conduct in the champions league exit to paris st germain - thought matic had conceded a penalty
' souness says also that it 's more a reason to criticise a player who asks for a yellow card than a player who kicks somebody in the chest , ' mourinho added
mourinho was told television pundit souness thought matic had conceded a penalty , and responded mourinho said that pundits ' win every game ' due to their position of being critical but exempt from criticism ' pundits are paid to wear my suit , but i 'm not paid to wear their suit or to comment on their comments
' matic was replaced by ramires soon after a second - half foul on sadio mane which could have seen him booked for a second time - after his initial yellow when giving away the penalty - and sent off for a second successive premier league game
' when that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow card can come , ' said mourinho
