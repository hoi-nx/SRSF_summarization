google 's ' on - body detection ' users the phone 's accelerometer to know when it 's being moved and will only lock when placed on a flat surface google has already experimented with unlocking phones using faces , but for some this just is n't immediate enough
a number of android owners have spotted a new feature that keeps the phone constantly unlocked as long as it 's in a person 's hand , resting on their leg or even just sitting in a pocket
the ' on - body detection ' feature uses the phone 's built - in accelerometer to know when it 's being handled or moved , and will only lock the screen when placed on a flat surface
on - body detection was first spotted by fan site android police in the smart lock menu of a nexus 4 running android lollipop
but there have since been numerous reports of the phone appearing on other lollipop devices , and not just google 's own nexus 4 range
it appears to be linked to the most recent version of play services - a tool used to update google 's built - in apps
the on - body detection menu explained : ' the feature uses your device 's accelerometer to detect whether your device is still being carried on the body
' if your device detects that it 's no longer being held , your device wo n't stay unlocked
' the phone has to be unlocked the first time it is picked up in the morning but once unlocked it will stay open until it is put on a table or similar
but as google added , if the user unlocks their device and hands it to someone else the phone or tablet stays unlocked as long as the other person continues to carry it
google may shut down services but keep the screen unlocked , to avoid opening apps or accidentally calling people , known colloquially as ' butt dialling
