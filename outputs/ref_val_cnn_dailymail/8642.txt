a radical british islamist who stabbed a football fan in the head with a pen and skipped bail to join isis has uploaded a new photograph showing him posing with a notorious german jihadi in syria
abu rahin aziz , 33 , from luton , fled the british before he was handed a 36 - week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in london 's west
since joining isis he has spent much of his time of social media posting provocative message aimed at his largely western audience - including threatening mps at the coming general election and attempting to justify the brutal burning to death of murdered jordanian pilot moath al-kasasbeh
now he uploaded a photograph showing him posing arm in arm with notorious german jihadi denis cuspert , who had been a relatively successful rapper under the name deso dogg before trading in his faux - gangster lifestyle to wage jihad on behalf of the islamic state terrorist group

' ali , a former nhs surgeon , fled the british in 2013 the spy transmitted critical information about the rapper and his isis colleagues before escaping to turkey - where she was arrested and then turned over to the us , according to the german newspaper bild
german newspaper bild believe denis cuspert may have been targeted for the operation because of his womanising past
in german he fathered three children by three different women , including one who he dumped just before embarking on his career as an isis poster boy
denis cuspert arrived in syria in 2013 from a so - called german jihadi colony in egypt

it is understood he leads a unit of german - speaking isis terrorists operating under the name ' the german brigade of millatu ibrahim ' .
