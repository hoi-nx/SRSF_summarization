the ten - hour flight cards offered by magellan jets , a company that provides private travel services , also include perks like car services to transport clients to and from each campus
in its second year of running the offer , the company said last year 18 people purchased the cards , and each made around three or four college visits in one day
families can pay $ 43,500 to have a private jet help their college hopeful make multiple college visits into a short period of time ( above file photo ) this year , they are expecting 50 buyers of the package , which is offered from march 25 - june 30 , a magellan jets spokeswoman told cnbc
' while data from last year revealed that over the past three decades the average tuition at a public four - year college had more than tripled , most families are likely looking at financial aid options before considering splurging on a chartered jet to visit campuses
last year , he told business insider that through the service , a student can visit up to eight campuses in different cities in one weekend
he said they were able to take one student to visit northwestern , duke , and syracuse in one day
greg belezerian , a vice president at magellan jets , said there is a misconception with private jets being all ' glitz and glamour ' but that the real reason people use them is for efficiency ( above students on a college tour at saint michael 's college ) the company organizes a flight schedule based on the schools a client wants to visit , then sets up the car services , while some times even coordinating private tours of college towns with local chauffeurs
if a family using the service can not fit in all of the schools they wanted to visit using the ten - hour card , they have to purchase additional cards
