lee will forever be remembered as the man who transformed a mosquito - ridden colonial trading post into a prosperous financial center with clean streets , shimmering skyscrapers and a stable government
born in 1923 , lee became prime minister in 1959 when singapore , a tiny spit of land with no natural resources and a polyglot population of china , malays and indians , was still british territory and beset by riots and unrest
he presided over singapore 's bitter split from malaysia in 1965 and molded the independent country into the global economic powerhouse it is today
but lee was also a divisive figure , attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents
in 2013 , protests over plans to allow more immigrants into the city - state indicated growing unease among singapore about the vision of the country set forth by the people 's action party -- the party co-founded by lee that has ruled singapore for five decades
lee voluntarily stepped down as prime minister in 1990 , the first asian strongman to do so
however , he played a role in the country 's cabinet until 2011 when his eldest son , lee hsien loong , was elected for a second term as prime minister
a fourth - generation singapore , lee 's family originally emigrated from southern china
the city lee took control of in 1959 was still recovering from the ravages of war and could not have been more different from today 's singapore
while lee has been lauded for his economic accomplishments , he also created a singapore bound by stringent laws and regulations that dictated most , if not all , aspects of society -- including media and political freedoms , censorship and even the selling of chewing gum
in a 2014 article for cnn , opposition politician dr. chee criticized singapore 's authoritarian system , blaming a lack of dissenting views for economic inequality and worsening working conditions
but in a 2008 interview with cnn 's fareed zakaria , lee rebuffed charges that singapore was too domineering or coercive a state
while lee is likely to be remembered with affection and pride by many singapore , a younger generation , with no memory of the poverty and violence that marked the country 's birth , is questioning the lee dynasty 's control of singapore politics and pushing for greater democracy
in 2011 , the people 's action party lost six seats to the opposition , prompting lee , then the party 's " minister mentor " and another former prime minister , goh chok tong , to resign
" how singapore copes with these democratic demands will be key to its success in its second half - century , but those demands are unlikely to detract from lee 's achievements in its first 50 years
