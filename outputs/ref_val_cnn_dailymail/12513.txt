the expulsions of two students by the university of oklahoma for their role in a racist chant will likely not be the last word on the scandal
more students might be expelled
writing to the two students tuesday , just two days after a video of frat members singing the racist song surfaced , university of oklahoma president boren said they were being booted for " leading a racist and exclusionary chant which has created a hostile educational environment for others
hostin added : " i think there 'll be the arguments that these students were students , and that in our educational systems we want people to have , maybe , even a heightened level of freedom of speech
" also unknown at this point is whether other students who appear in the video will be expelled or otherwise punished
" well , legally , our concern is we have to demonstrate exactly how the educational experience of our students was threatened or disrupted by their actions , " boren said , " and it really has to focus on the students on the bus
did the other students have their educational experience disrupted ? " while he unwaveringly declared " there is no room for racists and bigots " at his university , the very thing that could keep the sae fraternity brothers sooners is title vi of the civil rights act of 1964
it 's an issue that ber thaddeus bailey , director of diversity , university of oklahoma student government , worries about
" i do want to encourage those who are considering the university of oklahoma that this is a great place to study , and we are going to continue to progress
