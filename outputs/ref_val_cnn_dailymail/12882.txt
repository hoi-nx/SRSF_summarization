nascar driver busch will not be charged with domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend , the delaware department of justice announced thursday , citing a lack of evidence
busch was accused by driscoll of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against the wall in his motor home at dover international speedway in september
" after a thorough consideration of all of the available information about the case , it is determined that the admissible evidence and available witnesses would likely be insufficient to meet the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that mr. busch committed a crime during the september 26th incident , " delaware department of justice public information officer carl kanefsky said in a statement
for this reason , the department of justice will not pursue criminal charges in this case
as i have said from the beginning , i did not commit domestic abuse
" while busch will not be charged , he must stay away from driscoll for one year , a kent county , delaware , family court commissioner ruled in february
driscoll had requested a no - contact order against busch
stemming from the family court ruling , nascar suspended busch indefinitely shortly before the daytona 500
" busch 's attorney , rusty hardin , previously has said that he would appeal the family court ruling and would continue to work to clear busch 's name
