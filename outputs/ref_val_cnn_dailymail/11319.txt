dickens admitted his company , baumhaus , supplied an unsafe item at aylesbury crown court , buckinghamshire , today
the firm produced the nutkin cot bed which was blamed for incidents where two children ' came very close to very serious harm or death , ' the court heard
dickens , described as ' the king of diy ' on a profile on the baumhaus website , could now face a jail sentence or a fine of up to Â£ 20,000
the site says the solid hardwood nutkin cot , a modified version of which is still being sold , is suitable for children aged 0 to 12 years as it ' transforms easily from cot into stunning sleigh bed
in 2013 , baumhaus released a product recall for the original design of the cot , explaining that parts of the bed , particularly the gaps at the top , had been identified as a potential trap - hazard
the company , which produces a number of ranges of furniture , has since modified the design of the cot and it is available from a number of retailers for around Â£ 500

baumhaus recalled the cot bed in december 2013
' entering pleas on the company 's behalf , dickens pleaded guilty to two counts of placing an unsafe product on the market between january 2010 and july 2013
