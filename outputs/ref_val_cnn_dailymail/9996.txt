called the pak ta , the conceptual aircraft is designed to carry troops and tanks at supersonic speeds and could take to the skies as early as 2024
the plane is an unusual shape because it is intended to carry up to eight armata tanks - which have yet to be built â complete with ammunition to anywhere in the world at supersonic speeds
it would fly at speeds of over 1,200mph ( 2,000km/h ) despite carrying a payload of up to 200 tonnes ( 200,000kg ) with a range of more than 4,350 miles ( 7,000km )

this illustration shows a cavernous opening at the back of the aircraft the programme envisages that 80 of these new aircraft ( illustrated ) would be built by 2024 , enabling russia to be able to drop a ready - made army wherever it may be needed in under seven hours conceptual : the pak ta aircraft is only a concept
purpose : the aircraft is designed to carry troops and tanks at supersonic speeds , so that a small army could be deployed anywhere in the world in just seven hours
speed : the plane would fly at supersonic speeds of over 1,200mph ( 2,000km/h )
payload : up to 200 tonnes ( 2 million kg ) which is enough for several tanks and ammunition
