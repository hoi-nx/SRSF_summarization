prehistoric hunters may have tipped their stone arrows and spears with poisons to help them bring down prey , scientists believe
researchers have developed a new technique that allows them to test ancient weapons for residues left by toxic plant material added to them
preliminary tests have suggested that a set of 4,000 - year - old stone - tipped arrows from egypt were coated with poisonous compounds including the plant acokanthera
dr borgia , a specialist in paleolithic hunting weapons at the mcdonald institute for archaeological research at the cambridge university , believes hunters may have been using toxic chemicals on their weapons up to 30,000 years ago
the image above shows arrows from chinese that were used in a crossbow that were dipped in poison she said that paleolithic hunters may have used poisonous pastes made from plants to help make their weapons kill prey more swiftly
early humans may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago , a new study has suggested
scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans
this would have enabled homo erectus to become a proficient hunter , able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey
she said : ' it made good sense for people to use poisons
' on their own , palaeolithic weapons with stone arrowheads may not have been deadly enough to immobilise or kill a large animal such as a red deer
using a technique called liquid chromatography mass spectrometry , which is used to detect traces of drugs by modern forensic scientists , they are examining residues left on the tips of ancient weapons
this wooden spatula from malaysian wrapped in a palm leaf was used to apply poison to darts used for hunting dr borgia has conducted tests on 4,000 year old arrow heads found in egypt ( left ) that are thought to have been tipped with a poisonous black residue
the image on the right shows a pot of curare , a plant - based poison which is still used by some indigenous hunter - gatherers in south america to coat darts and arrows they can then compare the results from these tests against a database of known poisonous plants
dr borgia has already collected samples from a number objects known to have contained poison and ancient weapons to test the technique
these include a 1926 chinese pot containing aconitum poison inside , malaysian darts tipped with the poison upas , chinese crossbow arrows and a number of africa arrows
dr borgia has also collected black residue from six arrows that date from pre-dynasty egypt
these 4,000 - year - old arrows were first studied by scientists 40 years ago when small portons of the residue from the stone tips were injected into a cat
' we know that the babylonians , greek and romans used plant - based poisons both for hunting animals and in war
