bitcoin operates as a two - way currency which can be exchanged for dollars , and vice versa
the app only works with fitness trackers that monitor heart rate and have open source software , which includes the jawbone and mio. as the wearer exercises , the fitness tracker sends the heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used
an algorithm then converts this energy into ' computer processing time on a bitcoin mining rig ' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins
