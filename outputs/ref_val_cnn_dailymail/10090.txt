william hanson says : ' nothing can put one off a fellow dining companion more than seeing them messily tackle what âs on their plate
' we now see politicians , tv masterchefs and competing dinner guests badly eat their victuals so perhaps now , if it is not too late , i give them ( and you ) my guide on how to best tuck in to some of the trickiest foods to tackle
rules of etiquette : never double - dip asparagus ... unless you have your own personal pot of sauce brits will eat these with the left hand ( leaving the right hand free of grease , ready to shake hands or pick up a wine glass , for example ) ; there are some cultures where eating with the left hand is not the done thing , in this case , they may eat the asparagus with the right hand
banana if in doubt , go for the banana , says william hanson : the fruit is easy to unwrap with a knife and fork fruit is served as part of the dessert course ( dessert was traditionally the fruit course at the end of the meal , whereas today people confuse it with the sweet course )
a banana is always the easiest fruit to pick
cut both ends off with dessert cutlery ( very sharp ) , slice down the skin to unwrap , and then cut off slices and eat with a fork and knife
instead , scoop a small bit on to your plate and use a thin piece of toast or a blini to consume
if you get served it , with naff prongs , then pick it up and gnaw away
escargot ( or snails ) special clamps are often used to hold the shell in place whilst a small , two - pronged fork is held in the right hand and used to pierce and scoop the fleshy meat from within
tricky little fellas ! william hanson insists you use a fork to tackle a langoustine and advises against sucking ... langoustine using a small fork upturned in the right hand , scoop out the white fleshy meat from the tail
your left hand can be used to secure the shell as you daintily perform your excavation ( a finger bowl should be provided )
you may see some people pick up the animal to suckle the head â these people are to be treated with the greatest of social caution
moules be sorry : use empty shells as would - be tweezers to help you pluck the flesh from other mussels , says william hanson ... and always make use of the finger bowl mussels the most elegant method is to use a fork to loosen and consume the first mollusc within , before using the empty shell to tweeze out the other mussels , discarding redundant shells on a nearby plate
oysters a skilled high - society habituÃ© will know that these are really only eaten in months containing the letter r. the upmarket way to eat is to simply tip the contents into the mouth from the shell , having loosened the contents beforehand with a fork
peas release me : scooping is a no - no , spearing is really the only way to go with the little green spheres peas good hosts will never serve these at a formal dinner party , but if you find yourself confronted by petit pois or the like resist the urge to turn your fork over and scoop
eaten , never drunk : soup should be pushed away from the diner and then gently tipped into the mouth soup with bread soup is always â eaten â , never drunk
the soup spoon is held in the right hand and scoops away from you on one side , skimming the surface
if bread is served with the soup ( let âs hope not a slice of bread â a bit â try - hard gastropub â ) never cut the roll
break a bite - sized chunk off , butter if desired , and eat
it is not the done thing to divide the bread into two , slather with butter and gnaw away
do nât be caught out as an air - butterer , either â apply the butter to the roll on the plate , not in the air
spaghetti spaghetti can be a nightmare for diners and is best avoided in formal social situations ... the one golden rule with pasta is never to cut it , an act of culinary terrorism in italy , no less , according to william hanson ( right ) this is eaten with a fork alone and never cut with a knife
etiquette comes first ... but if you get really stuck , then just bluff your way through , says william hanson dietary requirements it is the guests â responsibility upon accepting an invitation to alert their hosts as to their dietary requirements
even if it is not technically correct , they will think it is and so you can bluff your way through the meal â¦ and then get home and research the proper way to eat it so you are nât caught out again !
