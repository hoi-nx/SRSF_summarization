a salary dispute between south korea has sent jitters through factory owners operating at an industrial complex that is supposed to be a symbol of cooperation for the divided korean peninsula
the disagreement started in late february , when the north korea government demanded an increase of around $ 8.60 a month for north korea employees working in the kaesong
south korea is working on a response to the demands , leaving factory owners worried about the threat of a factory shutdown
" i 'm already nervous about the situation because of the traumatic experience in 2013 when the south korea closed down the complex , " said yoo chang-geun , the south korean head of an automobile parts manufacturer that employs 400 north korea in kaesong
yoo chang-geun 's company , sj tech , operates out of kaesong , which is just north of the demilitarized zone in north korea territory
he was referring to north korea 's monthslong closure of kaesong in 2013 , during a period of heightened tension on the peninsula
an official from the south korean government 's unification ministry , who according to policy spoke to cnn on condition of anonymity , says companies at kaesong pay their north korea workers an average of $ 155.50 a month
north korea is demanding an increase of roughly 5.5 % , to an equivalent $ 164.10 a month
the official called the south korea 's request a " one - sided demand
meanwhile , north korea gained a valuable stream of hard currency revenue by appropriating an undisclosed amount of salary from its citizens working in kaesong
