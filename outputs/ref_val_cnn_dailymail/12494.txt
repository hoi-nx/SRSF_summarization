house gop defeated a plan pushed by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to fund the department of homeland security , money that congressional gop have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn president obama 's executive order on immigration
when speaker boehner proposed an even narrower compromise , funding the department of homeland security for only three more weeks , his caucus said no. the final bill provides funding for one more week , at which point congress needs to take up the issue again
once again they are using up a valuable chunk of president obama 's political time
congress has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions , such as economic inequality or climate change , which the house hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the gop refused to do anything about these problems
while the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim , president obama has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues , like tax reform , where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough
using up the legislative clock has been central to the gop strategy since the 2010 midterm elections , a tactic that the democrats have found difficult to fight back against
each time that president obama tried to introduce a new issue to the nation , whether that has to do with immigration reform or economic inequality , gop have instantly shifted public attention elsewhere by threatening extreme action on some other area of policy
this is what gop did in 2010 and 2011 when they warned that they would not raise the debt limit ceiling if democrats did not accede to their budget demands
even though the possibility of repealing the affordable care act is remote , gop keep bringing it up for a debate , forcing democrats to defend the program and spending more time on a proposal that nobody really thinks stands a chance of passing
gop leaders can and have said to the house they would like to find reasonable solutions to these problems , but with a nod to the gop caucus , remind obama that they do n't have full control
even if there is a resolution that continues funding for the department of homeland security , months have been consumed on capitol hill
when house gop pushed their " stop - gap " measure to fund department of homeland security for just another week , they were following the standard game plan
