dressed in identical outfits and smiling sweetly for the camera , it 's hard to believe these healthy twin toddlers were not expected to survive
rosie and ruby formosa , two , from bexleyheath in south east london , were born joint at the abdomen sharing the same intestines and a team of 15 doctors spent five hours separating the pair
a life - threatening blockage meant they were transferred to great ormond street hospital for emergency surgery but almost three years on and the identical twins are fighting fit
' if i 'm getting ruby dressed first , rosie will run off , find the exact same outfit and pester me until i dress her exactly the same
normally rosie will learn something first - like talking - and within a week ruby will have caught up - they 're just little copycats really
' mrs angela formosa was only 16 weeks pregnant when a scan revealed to her and taxi - driver husband , daniel , 39 , that the twins were conjoined
together : ruby and rosie , who were born with the same intestine in july 2012 , are ' inseparable ' the couple , who also have a seven - year - old daughter , lily , prepared themselves for the worst as doctors gave the girls a small chance of survival as they could n't definitively see where the connection was
conjoined twins occur every 200,000 births , however , as few as five per cent of those births actually survive being born
mrs angela formosa , a full - time mother , said : ' hearing the girls were conjoined was the shock of our lives
' almost immediately after being delivered by caesarean section at university college hospital , london , rosie and ruby were whisked off to great ormond street hospital to be operated on
' those were the most difficult 24 hours of our lives , ' mrs angela formosa added
' having my babies taken off my almost immediately after they 're born and not knowing if either would survive was heartbreaking
' when the doctors came out to say the surgery had been a success and that the girls were both fine , it was like the world had been lifted off our shoulders
complications : rosie , left , and ruby , right , were born joined at the abdomen and shared part of the intestine sisters : the girls spent a few weeks in hospital before returning home to be with their big sister lily ( centre ) ' seeing their little bodies in two separate cots , instead of one , i just burst into tears
' mrs angela formosa and the girls spent another four and a half weeks in hospital to make sure they were healthy enough to go home
' toddlers : the identical twins love to dress in matching outfits ( left ) and playing on their scooters ( right ) the girls go to nursery five days a week and their recent report card says they are ' getting on just fine ' the girls only had a small chance of survival as few as five per cent of conjoined twins ' births actually survive being born occasionally rosie and ruby , who attend nursery five days a week , have to have routine operations , but even those minor setbacks are n't stopping their development
mrs angela formosa said : ' they 've both developed as any " normal " child does
the only problem we have is that rosie and ruby keep doubling up on their big sister lily so they can steal her toys
' birth : rosie ( left ) and ruby ( right ) were delivered at 34 weeks and weighed 5lb 3oz each and the following day they were operated on to clear a life - threatening intestinal blockage celebrating their first year : ruby ( left ) and rosie ( right ) are pictured on their first birthday in july 2013 today : rosie ( left ) and ruby ( right ) are fit and healthy two - year - olds and love to double up on their big sister conjoined twins are two children physically connected to each other at some point in their bodies
the lowest odds of this happening are 200,000 to one for every live birth and around 70 percent of conjoined twins are female
conjoined twins are always the same sex and the form of conjoined twinning refers directly to where they are joined
( american pediatric surgical association ) experts think that conjoined twins come from a single egg that fails to separate
around 200 conjoined twins are born each year and around half die before their first birthday
conjoined twins shivanath and shivram caused quite a stir when they were born in india , with some people in their village worshipping them as divine incarnations
