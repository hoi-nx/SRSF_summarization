harris is the only woman to ever be ' awarded ' the victoria cross on the india frontline in 1869 , harris risked her life to nurse soldiers hit by a deadly cholera outbreak back to health
as the only woman serving alongside the bengal fusiliers in peshawar , she saved more lives with her â tender consolations â than a surgeon did with his medicines
but her regiment were so struck by her â indomitable pluck â that , after obtaining queen victoria âs special permission , they had a replica gold victoria cross made for her
and as no woman has been awarded the honour since 1921 , mrs harris âs unofficial medal makes her the only female recipient
the remarkable story of her life emerged in detail for the first time yesterday , as her gold medal is set to go on display at the iwm in london next month
speaking about her heroic efforts , lord ashcroft , who owns the medal , said : â harris was a remarkable woman who risked her own life to save others with her selfless devotion in nursing the sick
women were ineligible for the victoria cross until 1921 , but queen victoria gave permission for a gold replica to be made for mrs harris to reward her for her â indomitable pluck ' in october 1868 , the newly - promoted major general harris took the 104th to peshawar , having anticipated trouble on india âs north - west frontier
mrs harris ( gravestone pictured ) spent three months nursing soldiers with cholera and keeping up an army regiment 's spirits even with her own life in danger , mrs harris did not stop her efforts to help the men beat the disease
â the 104th officers felt mrs harris had lived up to the traditions of the victoria cross and in 1869 she was awarded with the honorary medal
a letter to the times stated : â it is said that it was suggested to queen victoria that mrs harris might be given the victoria cross , but this was , of course , not possible , so the gold replica was made and presented to her instead
