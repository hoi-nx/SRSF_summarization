an amazing image showing a collection of stars and nebulae has been released by the eso
in the colourful picture star clusters , emission nebulae and active star - forming regions are seen at a distance of about 4,000 light - years
in the centre of the image is the young open cluster ngc 6193 , and to the right is the emission nebula ngc 6188 , illuminated by the ionising radiation emitted by the brightest nearby stars the image was created using the vlt ( vlt ) at the eso âs ( eso âs ) paranal observatory in chile
the rim nebula is towards the right - centre of the image , and is the prominent wall of dark and bright clouds that provides a border to an active star - forming region called rcw 108
the nebula is about 300 light - years long and contains young stars that formed as recently as a few million years ago - a blink of an eye in cosmic terms

â a great deal of computer work was needed to combine the many individual pictures and make this detailed colour view from them , â a spokesperson for the eso told mailonline
â this is a great image for studying what goes on in star formation regions , and how the young stars interact with their surroundings - and also trigger the next generation of star birth
