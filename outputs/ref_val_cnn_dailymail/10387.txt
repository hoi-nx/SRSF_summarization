when her beloved dog collapsed and had to be rushed to the vet , heather goddard was horrified
the grandmother was left grief - stricken when tests showed clover , an eight - year - old crossbreed , had lung cancer and would have to be put down
she and mr goddard , 67 , of seaton delaval , northumberland , were walking clover in a park when the rescue dog became ill. they took her to a veterinary practice in morpeth , where they were told she had black spots on her lungs and was also suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
the vet said nothing more could be done for clover , adding that the cause of her cancer was passive smoking
â knowing my smoking was to blame was like somebody had just put a bullet into my heart
it was a nightmare that had come true , â said mrs heather goddard , a retired cleaner who has another dog , roger , as well as two cats and a rabbit
â clover was a lovely dog
fond memories : she says thinking about clover ' brings a tear to my eye just thinking about the damage my smoking was doing ' - she is now hoping to inform others about the dangers of second - hand smoke clover had to be put down after a scan showed up black spots on her lungs â she showed no signs or symptoms of being ill. we had no idea why she had collapsed until we took her to the vets
â mrs heather goddard says she now regrets exposing her family and her animals to years of cigarette smoke in the house and the car
â it still took her nearly three years following clover âs death before she managed to quit her 30 - a - day habit â and by then she too had been diagnosed with chronic lung disease
new start : ms heather goddard pictured with her grandchildren - who are ' always happy that i no longer smoke ' â my grandchildren tell me they are glad i stopped smoking because i do nât smell of smoke any more
â she hopes by speaking out she will alert other animal owners and help protect more pets from the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke
