longreach in central west queensland is famous for qantas , also known as the flying kangeroo , but another airborne animal is nowhere near as popular
grasshoppers in ' plague proportions ' have destroyed hectacres of land in longreach in recent days after a severe drought there
â you walk out on your garden and they just swarm up from the lawn â one local told 7news
although some insects thrive in moist conditions , heat and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers
they are the most most common insects that cause problems during periods of heat and drought
all that 's left on the tree is the fruits as the grasshoppers ate all the foliage â what we have got is some areas where there is a localised , high - density infestation , ' spokesman chris adriaansen said
we have our own field staff based at longreach and they are very aware of what is in that area
' heat and drought can be the ultimate survival conditions for the likes of grasshoppers even if the grasshoppers are about to move on they still have left a calling card that could prove disastrous in the future
