mark duggan : linked to ten shootings and two murders before he was shot and killed by police while travelling in a minicab violent gangster mark duggan â whose death sparked the 2011 riots â was holding a gun when a police marksman opened fire , a report concluded yesterday
an exhaustive three - and - a - half year investigation by the police watchdog completely exonerated the firearms officer who shot duggan of any wrongdoing
and it backed v53 âs version of events : that he shot duggan because he saw a gun and thought the gangster was about to open fire
last year an inquest ruled that duggan was lawfully killed â but the jury concluded that he had dropped the gun some time before he was shot
however , yesterday âs report by the ipcc said the gangster was holding the gun and was â in the process of throwing it to his right as he was shot â
in the aftermath of duggan âs death , supposed witnesses claimed they saw police marksmen shoot him after he had already given himself up
aftermath : duggan 's body lies in the street moments after he was killed
a report today ruled that he had run from the minicab holding the gun wrapped in a sock , at which point officers opened fire he was placed under surveillance in august 2011 after officers learnt he was about to pick up a gun from kevin hutchinson-foster , an associate , in leyton , east london
after duggan had collected the weapon , the minicab in which he was travelling was stopped by armed police during the evening rush - hour in tottenham , north london
the ipcc rejected wild conspiracy theories and inaccurate witness statements , which were promoted by mark duggan âs supporters
duggan was shot twice by v53 after the officer saw him raise a gun wrapped in a sock towards him
the ipcc report found that scotland yard âs decision to place duggan under surveillance was â logical and legitimate â because he was â coming to prominence â as an active member of the notorious tottenham mandem gang
â last night , the duggan family released a statement in which they claimed the report â confirms their belief that the ipcc are unfit for purpose â
