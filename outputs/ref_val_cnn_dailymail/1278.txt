a striking set of twins , who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed - race parentage , have revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers
appearing on itv 's good morning britain , lucy and maria aylmer , both 18 , said classmates at school thought they were telling fibs when they revealed they were twins
lucy and maria aylmer 's mother donna is half jamaican and their father vince is white , and in a genetic quirk , together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin
lucy ( left ) and maria ( right ) maria aylmer , both 18 , have faced questions from curious strangers throughout their lives over their radically different looks
lucy even uploaded a photo of her birth certificate to facebook the twins say it is n't just their looks that are different , they have individual personalities too
lucy ( far left ) says she 's much more shy than her sister maria aylmer ( second left ) , despite being born 23 seconds before her speaking to ben shepherd and susanna reid , the twins , from gloucester , opened up about how their distinctively different looks had often made life difficult at school
' when the girls were first born in 1997 , their mother donna had no idea that she could give birth to such different looking twins , described by experts as a one - in - a - million chance
lucy says : ' i think i said to my mum : " i do n't want to wear the same clothes as maria aylmer any more "
' same same , but different : lucy and maria aylmer , 18 , from gloucester are non-identical twins when asked at what age the girls knew their situation might raise questions from others , they say it took them a long time to know that their family was anything but ordinary
' their mother , who is 47 and a warehouse worker , and their 53 - year - old father , who works as a scaffolder , split up after the twins were born
lucy told the daily mail : â our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween maria aylmer and i. we are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween
â family line : the twins ' mother donna is half jamaican and their father vince is white , and their siblings george , chynna and jordan all have darker skin than lucy and lighter than maria aylmer two of a kind : the twins , who live in gloucester , were born in january 1997 different strokes  studies law at cheltenham college , while ' shy ' lucy studies art and design at gloucester college all together : maria aylmer and lucy with their mother donna and siblings george , 23 , chynna , 22 , and jordan , 21 non-identical twins come from separate eggs , so inherit different genes
the girls â half - jamaican mother carries genes for both white and black skin
by chance , lucy will have inherited genes for white skin and maria aylmer will have genes that code for black skin
lucy studies art and design at gloucester college whilst maria aylmer studies law at cheltenham college
lucy explained : â maria aylmer was outgoing whilst i was the shy one
