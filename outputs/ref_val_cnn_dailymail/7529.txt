some apps for android smartphones are tracking people 's movements every three minutes
this is according to a us study that found apps can collect a device 's gps coordinates on average of 6,200 times over two weeks
the study also revealed that most smartphone users have no idea how closely they are being tracked , and many were surprised by the results
scientists asked 23 users of android 's version 4.3 to install software that logged app requests
they found that even when an app provided a location based service , some attempted to collect more data than was needed
groupon , for instance , requested one participant 's coordinates 1,062 times in two weeks scientists at carnegie mellon university asked 23 users of android 's version 4.3 to install software that logged app requests , according to a report by elizabeth dwoskin in the wall street journal
they found that even when an app provided a location based service , some attempted to collect more data than was needed
groupon , for instance , requested one participant 's coordinates 1,062 times in two weeks
meanwhile , the weather channel 's app requested device location an average 2,000 times , or every 10 minutes
the main focus of the study , however , was on how users reacted to how often their data was being shared
they received a daily message , or ' privacy nudge , ' telling them how many times information such as location , contact lists or phone call logs had been shared
one notable example : ' your location has been shared 5,398 times with facebook , groupon , go launcher ex and seven other apps in the last 14 days
' most smartphone users , in fact , have no way of obtaining this data about app behaviour
the most popular flashlight apps for android smartphones have been downloaded tens of millions of times
during the first week of the study , app behaviour data was collected for 23 people as they used their own android mobile devices
during this phase , which spanned eight days , users collectively reviewed permissions 69 times , blocking 122 additional permissions on 47 apps
