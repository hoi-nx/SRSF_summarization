after the lord mayor âs show on saturday afternoon in cardiff â where their title hopes will be crushed or resurrected â england will set about further diminishing the value of the old calcutta cup at twickenham
stuart lancaster âs team can not lose
england go through the motions in training as courtney lawes offloads the ball at twickenham tom wood passes the ball as england ran through their moves for the final time before the scotland clash england will be wounded after their defeat to ireland , and are sure to bounce back by beating scotland chris robshaw lifts the calcutta cup aloft after winning it at murrayfield last year stuart lancaster 's men need a win against scotland , and should get it against the wooden spoon candidates since then , cotter has brought kiwi steel and some encouraging results , but saturday 's visitors are bottom of the rbs 6 nations table after three straight defeats â the last at home to italy â and they have not won in south west london for two generations
â so , at the end of a week which began with hogg bemoaning a lack of english â respect â for scots rugby , the lions full - back and his team - mates have a prime opportunity to regain it , by claiming a win which would amount to one of the upsets of the era
they will be desperate to salvage a crumbling campaign but england are also in wounded mode after their beating in dublin , which derailed the slam bandwagon for the umpteenth year
james haskell goes for a run with the ball as england prepared for the must - win fixture at twickenham george ford works on his kicking as danny cipriani watches on during the final training session ben youngs throws as pass as england 's forwards look on , ahead of a game they should win easily england could beat scotland with three of four different xvs , and will have more than enough on saturday scotland go through their paces at twickenham on friday - it 's an important game for them to restore pride that is not to denigrate the scots ; it is just a reflection of stark reality
cotter âs side have dropped to 10th in the world rugby rankings , six places behind england who have shifted clear of fifth - placed australia
another defeat for scotland would leave them in danger of being over-taken by japan , while losing further ground on samoa above them
defeat would wreck the quest to create that fortress - feel at twickenham and would also ensure that england could not rely on telling momentum to propel them into the showpiece event in september and october
the last time scotland beat england at twickenham in 1983 , margaret thatcher was still prime minister john beattie celebrates a scotland try , but the calcutta cup has been devalued by england 's dominance since fortunately for the head coach , he has a squad who are driven by a fervent desire to make amends for their loss to ireland , and more than enough trump cards to ensure this is an occasion devoid of tension and a nasty shock at the end
stuart lancaster 's side could face scotland in the world cup quarter - finals , which may worry them more scotland present more of a creative threat than in the recent past , despite the cruel injury to one of their stellar centres , alex dunbar
england must win and they will win
the calcutta cup is no longer the cherished prize that it once was , so retaining it is a minimum requirement .
