strachan is living proof there is life after man united
scotland âs manager left the world âs wealthiest football club at the age of 32 and , like the clichÃ© says , feared the only way was down
within three years , he was captain of leeds , champions of england
the odds of fletcher mirroring that achievement at west brom are long
yet strachan casts a glance at one of his star midfielders now and sees a rejuvenated figure
free of the ulcerative colitis which cast a long shadow over his old trafford career , fletcher is playing football again
scotland manager strachan has praised fletcher for leaving man united strachan has revealed he is yet to decide if fletcher ( centre ) will lead scotland in their upcoming fixtures scotland manager strachan says he does n't know who will be his captain for the upcoming fixtures there can be no denying that having a man united player as captain was a boon to scots morale
yet strachan knew when the time was right to seek fresh pastures
fletcher , he believes , is thriving in his new environment
â you can , when you leave man united , go on and create a new career for yourself , â said the scotland boss as he prepared for the twin challenges of northern ireland and gibraltar
that âs what fletcher is doing now
â i got on all right after i left man united
fletcher has got a hunger and a pride
it âs not easy to leave man united
â man united was all fletcher had known
strachan ( far right , pictured with ron atkinson , jesper olsen and alan brazil ) left man united to join leeds celtic captain scott brown has been scotland skipper in the absence of west brom skipper fletcher born in dalkeith , he signed for sir alex ferguson in 2003 and spent 12 years at the club
in contrast with his latter years at man united , when first - team appearances were bitty and sporadic , fletcher has played almost every game since signing for tony pulis in the january window
â i think he âs happier in himself , which is understandable , â said strachan
â i âve been lucky during his absence that i âve got scott brown , james mcarthur , james morrison and mulgrew
â there is a physical and mental side to it for fletcher but he has dealt with that
he has decided what his career is and that it âs not with man united any more
â fletcher has played seven games for west brom since joining the midlands outfit on february 2 fletcher decided to leave man united after struggling to break into louis van gaal 's first team plans capped 66 times , fletcher has been captain of the national team for most of that time
it âs far from clear he will be this time , with celtic âs scott brown claiming the armband in recent games
strachan says he has yet to decide his team to face northern ireland , let alone the identity of his captain
the intensity of training has taken the scotland boss by surprise , adding to the difficult decisions which lie in wait
â steven naismith ( right ) was desperate to train with the scotland national team despite his recent exploits it âs impossible for outsiders to know how true this is , yet there is a simple gauge for the contentment levels of a national team
â they surprise me with their enthusiasm because i thought , after four months and all the games they have played for their clubs in between , that this week would be all about rest and talking , â said strachan
