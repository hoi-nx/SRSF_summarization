i am a friendly , hard - working ohio native
it 's how a lot of my friends in new york city describe midwest
it 's as if we 're assembled at " the flyover wonder bread factory , " devoid of color or depth
we supposedly represent all that is wholesome in america
that may be true , but " friendly and hard - working " is so ... bland
if you think i 'm being a tad harsh , ask anyone who is n't from the midwest to describe someone born and raised in america 's heartland
my favorite definition came from a colleague raised in florida
she struggled to describe us at first , then said , " simple
" um , like the amish ? " no , " she said , flustered
even my fellow midwest have a hard time coming up with interesting descriptors
first thing out of his mouth , " friendliness ! " after that , he struggled , too
" i asked these questions after interviewing dayton , who wants his native minnesota to divorce itself from the midwest
" we 're midwest if you 're looking at it from new york city or from anywhere on [ the east ] coast , " dayton told me
" dayton and his brother , andrew , whose father is the state 's governor , are minneapolis businessmen whose clothing store and restaurant have a decidedly local flavor
dayton , after touring scandinavia ( many minnesotans are of norwegian descent ) , became enthralled by the region 's strong identity
minnesota -- or should i say minneapolis -- is criticized , by some of my compatriots , for being " minnesota nice , " the sort of " nice " ( fake ) that is n't remotely the kind of " nice " ( sincere ) for which midwest are renowned
the only truly midwest states are illinois , missouri , iowa , kansas , nebraska and south dakota
and no one in minnesota had ever heard of grape salad ... it was kind of a harmless example , but if we do n't tell the rest of the country who we are , we end up with grape salad
the new york times extolled the salad 's " deliciousness " by saying it " calls to mind the processed - food delights that , for decades , characterized the cooking of the midwest
" seriously ? the new york times is n't solely to blame for the midwest 's image problem
he wrote a book called " the identity of the midwest : essays on regional history
" " the midwest , " he told me , " has always been a dynamic and diverse place , but that image does n't fit with what people want to believe
" and , by people , cayton means politicians who routinely use the midwest as code for a place in time that never actually existed : crime - free and populated with hard - working people who all look and worship the same
" arguing about the midwest , " cayton says , " has become arguing about america as a whole
" so , listen up , campaigning politicians ! stop trying to bond with the midwest with your bowling prowess ( or lack thereof ) and for goodness ' sake , stop eating corn dogs at state fairs
and while i 'm at it , political reporters , please stop interviewing voters in diners ! i 'm not maligning bowling ( my dad , tony , is in the amateur bowling hall of fame ) or corn dogs , but those things do n't represent the modern midwest
and , minneapolis is not like any of them , either
minneapolis also has a thriving cultural community , is home to 19 fortune 500 companies and has a cuisine all its own that is not based on processed foods
and , at the moment -- it has what many polite midwest ca n't abide by -- attitude
i think it 's important for the reasons we 've discussed that there is recognition of what we have to offer
" maybe ohio should join the rebranding club and become " the east
