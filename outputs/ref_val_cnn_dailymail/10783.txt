they are often seen as a healthy alternative to breakfast or chocolate treats , but it seems cereal bars may be better suited to the confectionery aisle
the consumer group analysed the amount of sugar in 15 leading bars and breakfast biscuits and found many of them were not as healthy as most would think
other bars marketed at children , such as the popular choc chip harvest chewee milk , were also high in sugar and saturated fat
and while kellogg âs strawberry nutri-grain fruit breakfast bars contain 31 per cent whole grain cereal , they were found to be made up of 33 per cent sugar
its executive director richard lloyd said : â it âs worrying that cereal bars , especially those aimed at children or claiming to be healthy , contain so much sugar but most do nât make this clear on the front of the pack
a kellogg âs spokesman said : â there are less than two teaspoons of sugar in a coco pops snack bar â that âs 9 per cent of your recommended intake
