unidentified gunmen attacked the lawyer , samiullah afridi , in his car near the city of peshawar on tuesday , said mian saeed , a police superintendent in peshawar
two different militant groups claimed responsibility for the killing
the lawyer had represented dr. shakeel afridi , who was convicted of treason in 2012 by a pakistan tribal court and is now serving a 23 - year prison sentence
it was unclear which of the two groups claiming responsibility for the attack was actually behind it
fahad marwat , a spokesman for the militant group jundallah , told cnn that samiullah afridi was on the group 's hit list
but ehsanullah ehsan , a spokesman for a faction of the pakistan taliban , said his group had carried out the assassination because samiullah afridi defended the doctor , whom he described as " a friend " of bin laden 's killers
cnn national security analyst bergen said jundallah is " kind of a splinter group " of the pakistan taliban that 's " been around for a long time
" last month , the group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing outside a shiite mosque in the city of rawalpindi
bergen said dr. samiullah afridi is " a very unpopular figure in pakistan " because of the perception that he was involved in helping find bin laden
" although dr. samiullah afridi was working for u.s. intelligence , " the cia was n't telling the doctor , you 're helping us find bin laden , " bergen said
