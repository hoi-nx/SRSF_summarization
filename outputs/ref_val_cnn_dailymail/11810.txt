more than half a million cancer patients are being let down by failings in basic care , a leading charity warns
and more than 100,000 are not given enough help with routine tasks such as washing , dressing , going to the toilet or collecting their prescriptions
shocking : more than half a million cancer patients are being let down by failings in basic care , a leading charity warns the lack of support from the nhs and local councils is leaving patients distressed , lonely and humiliated , says the report by macmillan
the charity says the problem is partly the fault of doctors and nurses failing to tell patients how to access extra help from the nhs , councils or voluntary organisations
but many patients who apply for extra funding from either the nhs or their local council are told they are not eligible
macmillan âs report is based on a survey of 1,037 cancer patients and their carers
one in seven said the lack of support in attending an appointment , collecting a prescription or other basic care had led to them needing to go to hospital as their condition suddenly deteriorated
â lacking support : macmillan estimates that around 512,000 patients with cancer do not get enough help cancer patients are too often assumed to have all their needs met by the nhs , because they are thought to require purely medical care , she added
macmillan has repeatedly warned that the health service is struggling to cope with the rising numbers of patients with cancer
