he is better known as the hapless , doughnut - obsessed safety officer at springfield nuclear power plant , but it appears that homer may have outwitted some of the brightest minds on the planet
the author of a book looking at the maths hidden within episodes of the the simpsons has discovered that homer may have predicted the mass of the higgs boson 14 years before physicists discovered the particle at the large hadron collider in european organization for nuclear research
dr singh , a physicist and author , found the solution written on a blackboard in front of homer during a 1998 episode of the long running cartoon
speaking to the independent , dr singh said : ' that equation predicts the mass of the higgs boson
' if you work it out you get the mass of a higgs boson that 's only a bit larger than the nano - mass of a higgs boson actually is
' it 's kind of amazing as homer makes this prediction 14 years before it was discovered
' my phd is in particle physics , so i was similarly shocked by homer 's equation predicting the mass of the higgs boson
' the existence of the higgs boson - sometimes nicknamed the higgs boson - was first predicted by professor peter higgs , a theoretical physicist at the university of edinburgh , and five other physicists in 1964
proof that the particle existed , however , did not appear until march 2013 when scientists working on the large hadron collider - the worlds biggest atom smasher - announced they had discovered a particle that matched predictions of the higgs boson would be like
however , it appears that the writers of the the simpsons had already successfully predicted the outcome 14 years earlier
dr singh claims the formula written by homer while he is attempting to come up with a series of madcap inventions , including an electric hammer and make - up gun , gives close to the same answer
the the simpsons contains many mathematical jokes like the one above from an early episode in the series this equation above is said to concern the density of the universe but after a minor implosion in his basement homer adjust the equation in an attempt to adjust the balance and prevent further accidents singh has written a book on the maths hidden within the cartoon series the simpsons in fact one of the script writers for the episode , cohen , was responsible for sneaking in the mathematical equations onto the blackboard
the first equation on the blackboard was largely based on his work predicting the mass of the higgs boson - denoted by higgs boson
dr singh said : ' the equation is a playful combination of various fundamental parameters , namely the planck constant , the gravitational constant , and the speed of light
the second line on the blackboard contains an equation that some have claimed is the solution to fermat 's last theorem - although in truth the calculation falls just short
perhaps typically homer also appears to have been thinking with his stomach with a formula that suggests eating half a doughnut makes a whole
dr singh , who has written a book called the simpsons and their mathematical secrets , claims that the the simpsons is the most mathematical tv shows on prime time television
dr singh said he hoped the maths in the cartoon might even help persuade more people to take an interest in the subject
