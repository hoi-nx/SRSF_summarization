sean dillon required six minutes of treatment , and a number of stitches , after coming off second best in a 50 - 50 with the dutch
to compound his frustration , in his absence , kris commons scored the goal which put ronny deila âs side on their way to a 2 - 0 triumph
sean dillon was later sent off for a lunge on emilio izaguirre but felt justice was not correctly served in his earlier confrontation with virgil van dijk
â i think he left his leg in , i did nât like it , â sean dillon stated
â i get the ball , he gets my leg , and they get a throw - in
so that âs very frustrating
sean dillon claimed that virgil van dijk tried to injure him during the scottish league cup final â i âm not going to exaggerate it but it âs a big gash , about three inches long maybe , and i needed seven stitches in it
â but van virgil van dijk hit back at sean dillon âs version of events by insisting there was nothing in the challenge
â no , never , â virgil van dijk countered
â i know we are not going to have the same conversations as we had last week but i can honestly say i did nât do anything wrong
â i did nât leave my foot in , i would never do that on a fellow player
â van dijk had been sent packing by craig thompson at tannadice and only learned on thursday that he was free to take his place at hampden
van dijk helped celtic on their way to a 2 - 0 victory at hampden â it was a very good feeling to win the cup , especially after the tough week i had personally , â said the dutch
â â it gives the manager a boost - but it gives everyone at celtic a boost
dundee united skipper sean dillon saw red later in the game for a foul on emilio izaguirre â we know if we are at 100 per cent we can beat everyone in the country
