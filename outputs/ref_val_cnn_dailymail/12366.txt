a manager at an indiana veterans hospital has been placed on paid administrative leave after sending a " completely and totally unacceptable " email apparently mocking mental illness
the email , sent by robin paul , " in no way reflects the attitudes of our staff toward our patients , " roudebush va medical center director mattice said in a statement posted on the hospital 's facebook page
robin paul , a licensed clinical social worker , had been managing the seamless transition integrated care clinic , which is responsible for assisting new veterans with their veterans affairs benefits , services and programs , to include mental health , according to the vfw
her email , first published by the indy star this week , was sent december 18 to members of her team and shows four photos of an elf in different scenarios
two of the photos have struck a nerve with the veterans and mental illness communities
in one photograph , the elf appears leaning over what looks like a straw and coffee grounds on a paper plate , with a post-it note that says , " out of xanax - please help ! " the caption reads , " self - medicating for mental health issues when a cns would not give him his requested script
" in another , the elf is hanging from a string of christmas lights
hospital leadership was allegedly made aware of the email a couple of months ago , according to the indy star , and had " administratively addressed " the incident with robin paul
matthew conrad on facebook said , " robin paul 's continued employment is an insult to every veteran who has served this country
" mattice announced robin paul 's leave , and a pending investigation , tuesday evening
two of the country 's largest veterans organizations have also criticized robin paul 's actions
mattice , who was not available for comment wednesday , did not elaborate on the investigation into the incident , or why it took so long to move forward with placing robin paul on leave , but instead asked for forgiveness
cnn 's attempts to reach robin paul were unanswered as of wednesday afternoon .
