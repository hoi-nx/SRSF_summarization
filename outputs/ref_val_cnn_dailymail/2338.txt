adrian bailey , chairman of the business select committee , said he was â not very pleased â to hear they had taken the â easy option â of raising stamp prices

â adrian bailey , chairman of the business select committee , said he was â not very pleased â to hear they had taken the â easy option â of raising stamp prices allan , of the federation of small businesses , said the rise in stamp prices would be unwelcome for many companies
mr allan added : â ofcom should carefully monitor how royal mail is doing , and use their powers to fine should customers â expectations fail to be met
royal mail says this expensive obligation is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfil because firms such as whistl â cherry pick â deliveries in more lucrative city locations and can therefore under - cut them on price
adrian bailey felt the royal mail should be trying to make efficiencies instead of raising prices the report said : â we were concerned to note that royal mail were unable to provide a regional breakdown of the cost of the universal service
meanwhile , a royal mail spokesman said they welcomed the report , and shared in some of the committee 's concerns and contribution - including the fact ' ofcom may not be able to respond fast enough to avoid a failure in the universal service , even in the short term '
the spokesman added : ' we recognise and accept the business select committee âs finding that royal mail has done much to improve efficiency , but there is still more for us to do to match the most efficient postal operators
