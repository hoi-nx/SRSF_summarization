â rodwell appeals for a foul but is booked for diving , a decision that led to poyet 's reaction the two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other as the pair locked horns bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in poyet 's direction poyet 's side were lucky to escape with a point and will be fined Â£ 25,000 by the fa after six of their players were booked , including lee cattermole who picked up a two - game ban following his 10th yellow of the season
bruce , meanwhile , did not reveal what poyet had said to provoke his furious reaction
it was nât â have a nice evening , bruce â
