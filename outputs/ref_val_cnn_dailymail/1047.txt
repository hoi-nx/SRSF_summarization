prince charles can often be found in his study late at night writing letters to ministers , civil servants and other prominent figures long after the servants â and his wife â have retired to their beds at clarence house , prince charles can often be found in his study , a lamp burning on the desk as he scratches away in black ink
at his most productive period , his passionate words have poured out at the rate of 1,000 letters a year to ministers , civil servants and other prominent public figures
to regular recipients , this correspondence is known as the â black spider â memos , which have been thumping on to the desks of successive government members for well over three decades
this has been the charles âs modus operandi for tackling the issues of the day for so long now that no one among his staff can remember a time when he was not crafting these often heartfelt missives in the dead of night
â to some , these regal intrusions have become dangerously parti pris and political â a charge charles denies
indeed , there is an argument he would have avoided the controversy over the 27 letters written to seven whitehall departments in a six - month period between september 2004 and march 2005 â and seized back the initiative â by disclosing them in full himself
one former advisor tells me that he would have urged the prince to publish them on his website to allow the public to make up its mind about their content
according to former attorney general dominic grieve , who fought the case all the way to the supreme court because he said the notes risked sacrificing the political neutrality of the future king , they reflect the charles âs â most deeply held personal views and beliefs â
long before these fears surfaced , it was known that charles was at odds with the then labour government
however , long before his fears surfaced , it was known that charles was at odds with tony blair 's ( right ) labour government much more sensitive was a letter leaked to the mail that he sent to lord irvine , the then lord chancellor
in it , the charles railed about new hygiene laws in care homes that forbade volunteer workers from cooking meals in their own homes and then taking them to residential homes for the elderly or hospices to be reheated and served
charles also raised the issue of fire safety doors in homes which legislation decreed should be so firmly sprung to ensure they close that many frail old people were unable to open them
prince charles is believed to have once confronted lord irvine with his concerns over the human rights act the charles also raised the extraordinary but all too realistic possibility â one that he had been told was where current trends were leading us â of a soldier suing his superior officer for making a poor decision in battle which results in his being wounded
â why should any other pilot in that squadron , knowing there is a risk of litigation if he gets it wrong , take any calculated risk , exercise his professional judgment , push himself to the limits or fly in marginal weather , â charles asked
royal aides reacted by saying the charles saw himself as a â dissident â working against the current political opinion
others said charles had become the only effective opposition to the then all - powerful labour government
so will charles now go quiet ? it seems highly unlikely
the charles has received backing from the prime minister to continue writing
