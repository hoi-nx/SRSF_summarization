up in the expensive seats , gerrard looked down on another fruitless appeal for a liverpool penalty and blew out his cheeks
for all their improvement in the second half of the season , liverpool are still capable of throwing in a performance like this from time to time
there are still days when the cogs in the machine do nât run smoothly , days when the absence of any kind of plan b hurts liverpool and hurts them badly
they defended brilliantly , ran hard and stuck to a game plan devised by manager gary bowyer to deny liverpool the space between the defensive and midfield lines that their playmakers love to work in
blackburn rovers defended stubbornly to stop players such as coutinho ( centre ) from having an impact for liverpool gerrard ( left ) was in the stands watching the game at anfield , as was former team - mate and sportsmail columnist jamie carragher gerrard did not play for liverpool due to injury but the supporters are desperate to get to wembley in his final season at the club martin skrtel ( right ) landed awkwardly and play was halted for eight minutes as he was treated by medical staff martin skrtel lies on the ground after contesting a header with the blackburn rovers forward gestede emre can ( centre ) stands over martin skrtel before calling for medical assistance for his liverpool team - mate martin skrtel was moving his arms as he was carried off on a stretcher in the 11th minute of liverpool 's fa cup tie a week earlier here at anfield , barclays premier league champions manchester city found it impossible to plug those gaps
as a result , liverpool âs brazilian coutinho won that game almost on his own
here , though , blackburn rovers found the key and , as a result , liverpool ran out of ideas
the visitors â formation squeezed the life out of liverpool while their two central defenders baptiste and kilgallon cleaned up everything that brendan rodgers â team did manage to throw in to the penalty area
without their much - discussed centre forward josh king â who was injured - the championship side relied heavily on the imposing figure of gestede and he worried liverpool âs back three all afternoon but especially in the first half
perhaps liverpool were unsettled by a nasty injury to their own defender martin skrtel in the very first minute
a header from baptiste ( second left ) brought a fine save from mignolet at the start of the second half mignolet ( centre ) made a superb save to tip the header from baptiste away at the beginning of the second half kolo toure ( left ) hit the back of the net in the first half but his strike was ruled out for offside kolo toure ( right ) replaced the injured martin skrtel and also hit the post with a header in the second half mario balotelli came on in the second half for liverpool but was unable to find a way through the blackburn rovers defence liverpool : mignolet 6.5 , johnson 6 , martin skrtel 6 ( toure 11 , 6 ) , lovren 6 , lazar markovic 6.5 ( mario balotelli 59 , 6 ) , jordan henderson 6.5 , can 6 , adam lallana 5 , raheem sterling 5.5 , sturridge 6.5 , coutinho 5.5 subs not used : lambert , sakho , moreno , williams , ward
blackburn rovers were actually the first to show after martin skrtel âs injury and gestede was the game âs most influential player for 25 minutes
the manner in which he forced liverpool goalkeeper mignolet in to a mistake under a high ball seemed portentous while the dummy he sold raheem sterling to give conway a sight of goal on the overlap soon after was terrific
martin skrtel âs replacement toured did have the ball in the net in the 34th minute after a free - kick dropped invitingly to him six yards out but he was a yard offside
it was notable that they were the first two the blackburn rovers goalkeeper had been asked to make all half

still , though , blackburn rovers had the best chance as baptiste âs header from a corner in the 48th minute was brilliantly touched over by mignolet
blackburn rovers manager gary bowyer shouts instructions to his players during the fa cup game against liverpool liverpool manager brendan rodgers will be frustrated by his team 's lacklustre performance on a frustrating afternoon amid all this , though , there was a more convincing penalty shout , sturridge going down as kilgallon sought to impede his run with an outstretched arm
they may have to be slightly more expansive when it comes to the replay in april but they deserved this draw and will relish 90 minutes against liverpool at ewood park
