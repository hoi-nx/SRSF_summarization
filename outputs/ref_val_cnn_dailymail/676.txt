as the scorer of gilbraltar âs first - ever competitive goal , it was little wonder that history - maker casciaro felt like a rock star when he left hampden park on sunday night
if the outstanding memory of the 2002 champions league final for most people remains zidane âs exquisite volleyed goal , in gilbraltar it was the sight of local businessman beriro invading the park clad in a kilt and a madrid strip
gilbraltar 's players celebrate after casciaro scored their first ever competitive goal on sunday beriro would later appear on gilbraltar âs version of strictly come dancing , before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye
his place as the most famous man in gilbraltar now passes to casciaro after criminal defending by scotland allowed the cop to race clear , fire low past david marshall and utterly stun hampden park
casciaro ( centre ) celebrates the goal that will have made him the most famous man in gilbraltar â it was a gibraltarian who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his madrid shirt in that champions league final in 2002
â it was just a dream come true for me to score that goal
it âs unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for gilbraltar
gilbraltar goalkeeper jamie robba celebrates the goal at hampden park , which levelled the score at 1 - 1 â we have only just joined uefa and started to train on a football pitch
â even two or three years ago i did nât think i would be playing for gilbraltar because i did nât think we would get into uefa
â casciaro ( right ) vies for the ball with scotland 's ikechi anya , who he later swapped shirts with despite ultimately losing 6 - 1 to gordon strachan âs side , casciaro hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions of those who have labelled the minnows little more than a pub team
â last june , the first - ever winning goal scored by the british overseas territory - with a 30,000 - population comparable with wishaw - was slotted home in a 1 - 0 friendly win over malta in portugal
that night the history - maker was kyle casciaro , casciaro âs brother , who was an unused substitute on sunday

casciaro 's brother ryan , who also plays for the national team , shares a joke with steven fletcher â i âm keeping it in the family , â smiled casciaro
â with the benefit of having played all the group d teams now , casciaro feels that scotland and ireland â who meet in dublin in june - will be in a battle for third place behind poland and germany
â germany are the world champions and poland are a very strong and physical team , â said casciaro , who jetted off to paris on holiday after sunday 's game
the sunderland man was scotland 's hat - trick hero as he netted the country 's first hat - trick since 1969 â i thought we showed a good reaction after falling behind
