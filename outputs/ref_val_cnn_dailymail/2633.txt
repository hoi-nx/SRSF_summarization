rangi chase turned on the style in front of australia national coach tim sheens as salford continued their revival with a 24 - 18 win over wakefield to climb into super league 's top eight
the red devils have collected five points out of a possible six since tim sheens arrived to take up a short - term advisory role at the club and it was rangi chase , who was given his nrl debut by tim sheens as a teenager at wests tigers , who once more stole the show on adrian morley 's 300th super league appearance
rangi chase put in a stylish performance for salford red devil in their win over wakefield on sunday the red devils , who were led out by adrian morley , were virtually at full - strength with the return of major close - season signings ben jones-bishop and dobson , and showed signs of becoming a force this year
chase scored a try and set up three for his side as salford moved into the super league 's top eight chase had the chance to help his side open the scoring when he re-gathered the ball from dobson 's high kick but his trademark " no - look " pass found a defender instead of a team - mate and wakefield went on to dominate the rest of the opening quarter
adrian morley then produced arguably the highlight of the match , a 50 - metre break , to set up the position for chase to get centre junior sa'u over for a fourth try , with griffin maintaining his 100 per cent with the boot
