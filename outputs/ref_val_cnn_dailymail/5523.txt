getting to mars is no easy feat : the journey of several hundred million miles takes about nine months , one - way , and a manned mission will likely in total take about three years
but it seems that , aside from an engineering breakthrough , we ca nât really shorten these times - and he thinks it âs unlikely we âll send humans within five decades , not the 2030s as nasa believes
dr bertolami from the university of porto was speaking to mailonline
he studied different types of propulsion that could get humans to mars ( shown )
in total a manned mission would last three to four years , which poses major problems , such as exposure to radiation theoretical physicist dr bertolami from the university of porto , together with his colleagues dr andrã© guerra and dr paulo gil , carried out a study comparing different space propulsion methods for a manned mission to mars
option 1 - a ' giant leap ' from moon to mars - return to the moon - build a lunar base - send humans to the surface of mars option 2-least technological risk - send humans into lunar orbit - visit an asteroid in its own orbit - return to the moon 's surface - explore martian moons deimos and phobos - enter orbit around mars - land on the red planet option 3 - nasa 's current favoured path - robotically capture an asteroid - place it in lunar orbit for astronauts to visit - travel to the moons of mars - place humans in mars orbit - set foot on mars based on the team âs calculations , they found that the total mission time poses serious problems to a potential manned mission
in total the mission will last three to four years , which is â very demanding â and â almost impossible â according to dr bertolami
â despite what people say , we are a long way from reaching mars , â he told mailonline
nasa âs proposal is to send a mission there and back , but dr bertolami said more infrastructure was needed to make the mission possible
â i see no way of reaching mars in five decades , â said dr bertolami
â i would like to be a bit more optimistic , but i âm afraid this is how it is
â various forms of propulsion have been touted for a mission to mars , including chemical , ion ( electric ) and nuclear
shown is an illustration of a concept mars transfer vehicle dr bertolami , who was also part of a science committee for esa 's satellite navigation programme galileo , instead suggests that we should consider returning to the lunar surface and improving our technologies , before attempting a mission to the red planet
for a future manned mission , they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one , which will take two years in total
â in their study , the researchers looked at other methods of propulsion to see if there was any way to make a mars mission more feasible in the near future
â reaching mars is a complicated business , and you have to start with a strategy , â dr bertolami said
shown is a graph of the different types of propulsion for a mission to mars , how much they would weigh and their travel time
nasa actually attempted to build a nuclear - powered engine before , known as nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application ( nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application ) , shown in this illustration , with a view to using it to get to mars , but the programme was scrapped in 1972 according to dr bertolami and his team , the best way to reach mars was a combination of chemical and ion ( shown ) engines - the former to reach orbit , on a rocket , and the latter for the cruise to mars â most people say that nuclear is helpful , â he continued
this is similar to a solar sail but â you carry your sun with you , â said dr bertolami
dr bertolami says a problem arises because , while nuclear propulsion could accelerate to quite high speeds , it needs to brake again to enter orbit around the red planet
nasa 's sls ( sls ) rocket , illustrated , for example will use a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to take a mars - bound spacecraft into orbit â at the end of the day , if you do the calculations properly , you find out that traditional measures like chemical and electrical turn out to be more efficient , â he said
â however , looking further into the future , dr bertolami said if humans were to travel beyond mars - such as to a moon of jupiter - then nuclear propulsion becomes feasible
