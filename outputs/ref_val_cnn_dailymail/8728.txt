the pilots of the delta plane that skidded off a runway at laguardia 13 last week during a snowstorm have told investigators that automatic systems designed to slow down the plane were not working properly
they said the plane 's automatic brakes were set to ' max , ' but they did not sense any deceleration as the aircraft veered toward flushing bay , according to the national transportation safety board
delta flight 1086 from atlanta was carrying 127 passengers , including two lap children , plus five crew members , when it slid off the runway thursday and skidded about 2,000 feet along a normally grassy area alongside the runway that was covered in snow
the nose of the plane ended up over the water for the last 940 of those feet , the plane 's left wing was cutting through and destroying the airport 's chain - link perimeter fence , investigators said
the aircraft came to rest with its nose leaning perilously on a berm that separates the runway from icy flushing bay
