that 's the message out of indonesia , where national search and rescue chief soelistyo announced that the main search - and - recovery operation surrounding doomed commercial airliner airasia flight 8501 officially ended tuesday
" these past two months have been the hardest times for all of us at airasia and for the families of qz8501 passengers , " airasia indonesia ceo sunu widyatmoko said
" he was referring to the nightmare that the airline and , especially , the loved ones of the 162 people on board the airbus a320-200 jet have been experiencing since its crew lost contact with air traffic controllers on december 28
that 's because searchers did find remnants from the airasia aircraft and the remains of some passengers in the java sea
that included the jetliner 's fuselage , the last major piece of which was recovered late last month and brought into a jakarta port earlier this week
there will be a smaller - scale operation , involving divers and three vessels , over the next week , according to indonesia 's national search and rescue agency
