india âs groundbreaking mom has returned stunning images , revealing an enormous canyon and its moon phobos in orbit
this included the switching on of a new methane sensor yesterday , which has allowed scientists to measure the amount of radiation on the martian surface - and could help in the search for life
the odd colour of mars is due to the specific filters used by the camera the latest images , released by the isro ( isro ) , include a spectacular 3d view of arsia mons , a huge volcano on the surface of mars that has its peak 10 miles ( 16km ) high
the isro ( isro ) has released amazing images from its mom ( mom )
among them is this 3d view of arsia mons , a huge dormant volcano on the surface of the planet
volcanic deposits can be seen on its flanks the isro 's mom ( mom ) , india 's first spacecraft launched to mars , arrived 23 september 2014 to study the mars surface and atmosphere and demonstrate technologies needed for interplanetary missions
an equally spectacular image reveals phobos , one of the two moons orbiting mars ( the other is deimos ) , silhouetted against the mars surface
in this close - up view of the surface , the mars colour camera on the spacecraft captured a shot of the huge valles marineris - which at more than 2,500 miles ( 4,000km ) long is one of the largest canyons in the solar system , covering nearly a fifth the circumference of mars this portion of the canyon , known as eos chaos , was also observed by the spacecraft , revealing fracture patterns in the surface
the images could help scientists understand the geological processes taking place on mars at a local scale this week also marked the return of results from the methane sensor for mars ( msm ) payload on the spacecraft , which will detect the presence of methane in the atmosphere
this image , showing the limb of mars against the void of space , was taken using the mars colour camera from an altitude of 8,449km the isro 's mom ( mom ) , illustration shown , is india 's first spacecraft sent to mars
