the report says top - secret documents reveal u.s. government researchers had created a version of xcode , apple 's software application development tool , to create surveillance backdoors
this is according to , investigative news site , the intercept , who claims to have access to top secret files detailing the spying activity these backdoors would have allowed them access into programs distributed on apple 's app store
it said the latest documents , which covered a period from 2006 to 2013 , stop short of proving whether u.s. intelligence researchers had succeeded in breaking apple 's encryption coding , which secures user data and communications
efforts to break into apple products by government security researchers started as early as 2006 , a year before apple introduced its first iphones and continued through the launch of the ipad in 2010 and beyond , the intercept said
it said the latest documents , which covered a period from2006 to 2013 , stop short of proving whether u.s. intelligenc eresearchers had succeeded in breaking apple 's encryption coding breaching apple security was part of a top - secret programme by the u.s. government , aided by british intelligence researchers , to hack ' secure communications products , both foreign and domestic ' including google android phones , it added
last september , apple strengthened encryption methods for data stored on iphones
so far there has been no evidence that they 've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack how would could the government potentially make use of these backdoors ? backdoors can provide access to unencrypted information even if users have chosen to encrypt the data they back up
how do these hidden files work ? the pcapd service starts a ' packet sniffer ' on an ios device which records all data traffic to and from your iphones
now , as reported in readwrite , house_arrest has access to wider app - related data , including photos , databases , screenshots and temporary ' cached ' information
more information about apple 's diagnostic capabilities is available from the firm 's support pages
both companies said the moves were aimed at protecting the privacy of users of their products and that this was partly a response to wide - scale u.s. government spying on internet users revealed by snowden in 2013
' we have also never allowed access to our servers
silicon valley technology companies have in recent months sought to restore trust among consumers around the world that their products have not become tools for widespread government surveillance of citizens last year , a security expert warned apple âs ios software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on iphones and ipad users
speaking at the ' hackers on planet earth ' conference in new york , zdziarski said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iphones data
he added files found hidden within the firm 's software contain a file - relay service that can be used to access the user 's address book , photos , voicemail and any accounts configured on the device
backdoors are not the type of thing an average hacker can easily exploit , and so far there has been no evidence they 've been used for identity theft or a criminal attack apple responded by saying the services identified by mr zdziarski are not deliberately provided for government agencies to exploit
