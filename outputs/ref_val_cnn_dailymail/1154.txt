ozil might have been in good form since returning from injury this season , but he still needs to be better if arsenal are to challenge for the title , according to gunners legend gilberto
gilberto acknowledged ozil 's quality , but insists that he needs to start paying off the faith arsene wenger showed by spending Â£ 42.5m to bring him to the emirates stadium from real madrid
ozil has not found things easy since moving to arsenal , but has improved recently ozil has a shot deflected over the bar against everton , and gilberto says he must offer more ' you speak about arsenal and how they do n't spend big money on a player often but they did with ( mesut ) ozil and it is always a bit risky , ' he said
arsenal have not won the premier league in the 11 years since gilberto and his team - mates went unbeaten , and the 38 - year - old believes they still do n't have the financial firepower to challege chelsea and manchester city
gilberto was a key member of the arsenal team that went an entire premier league season unbeaten in 2004 arsenal have not won the title since their invincible season , but gilberto insists it is now time to challenge but gilberto also stressed that the club should be aiming for the title , and given time arsene wenger can lead his current squad to glory
ozil is the gunners record signing , but in general the club has not tried to compete with rich clubs financially the german playmaker will need to improve if arsenal are to mount a serious title challenge , says gilberto ' it was important for them last season that they won the fa cup but a team like arsenal need more and i hope they find a way to achieve what they always look for
