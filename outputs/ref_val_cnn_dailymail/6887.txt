an unusual nexus of mining interests , relief work in haitian , and a former america first family is raising new ethics questions that could affect clinton 's presidential ambitions
bill clinton 's brother , tony rodham , was a board member of a north carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by former president bill clinton through the clinton foundation
another board member of the firm , vcs , was former haitian prime minister jean-max bellerive , who co-chaired the charitable interim haiti recovery commission with mr. bill clinton
the revelation , smacking of cronyism and back - room government dealing , is part of a forthcoming book by government accountability institute founder peter schweizer , whose work exposing the investment ' insider trading ' habits of members of congress caused national outrage in 2011 even though the practice was legal
the haitian government had n't issued such a permit in more than 50 years
tony rodham , brother of former secretary of state clinton , sat on the board of a company that landed a gold mining deal in haitian after bill and clinton directed millions into post-earthquake relief breitbart news first reported on the investigative nonfiction book 's coming release
' much of the america assistance is provided by the u.s. agency for international development , ' a department of the state department that mrs. clinton led at the time , according to the department 's website
tony rodham 's company got its gold mining rights in december 2012 , according to the vcs press release
breitbart reported that the terms of tony rodham 's gold windfall upset members of haitian 's senate : the government 's royalties under the deal were pegged at just 2.5 per cent , half the customary rate
and vcs mining has an option to renew the terms for 25 years
harpercollins executive editor adam bellow , son of the famed novelist bellow , said in a statement that in peter schweizer 's book , he ' coins a new term to describe the unique way in which bill and clinton tend to mingle their political , personal and philanthropic interests
' ' peter schweizer âs exhaustively researched book raises serious questions about the sources of the clintons ' sudden wealth , their ethical judgment , and clinton 's fitness for high public office , ' bellow added
the law originally did not explicitly apply to electronic communications ; congress updated it after mrs. clinton left her job as america 's top diplomat
