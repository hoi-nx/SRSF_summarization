a tap that sends the water flowing through it into a swirling vortex pattern could help reduce the amount of water used by households
the designer of the swirl tap claims the hollow vortex of water created by the faucet can save around 15 per cent more water than standard taps
the swirl tap sends water from the tap in a symmetrical design that apparently saves 15 per cent more water simin qiu , a student at the royal college of art , said he hoped the design might become popular in hotels and homes
' mr simin qiu is curerntly testing a prototype of his tap , which took him two months to design
the swirl tap uses two turbines inside the faucet ( left ) to send the water into a spiral
the graphic on the right shows how the turbines fit together with push value to provide a spinning vortex of water onto the users hands the tap works by pressing a single button on top , allowing water at a preset temperature to flow out of the tap the tap is operated by touching a switch on the top
' designer simin qiu envisages his tap being used in hotels and luxury homes but it could find wider uses as the swirling pattern it produces in the flow can help to reduce the amount of water used when washing hands
