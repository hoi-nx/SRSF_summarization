six weeks into the murder trial of former nfl star hernandez , jurors in fall river , massachusetts , are getting more pieces of a time line leading up to the 2013 shooting death of odin lloyd , a semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of hernandez 's fiancÃ©e
taking center stage this week -- videotape never before seen in public , taken from hernandez 's own home security system
prosecutors are using that grainy footage to suggest hernandez is holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind police say was used to kill odin lloyd
hernandez is seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after odin lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from hernandez ' boston home
hernandez , wallace , and ortiz are seen on the same security video , recorded at about 3:30 a.m. on june 17 , 2013 , after the men walk into hernandez 's home
the video is time - stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say odin lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car driven by hernandez
aspinwall tells jurors hernandez appears to be holding the pistol by its muzzle as he 's standing at his basement door
hernandez 's lawyers then show a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appears to be a shiny object in one hand , suggesting it may be an ipad
sultan then displays a soft - pellet gun similar in shape to a glock , suggesting it could also be the object hernandez is holding
prosecutors could be laying the groundwork for showing more surveillance video of hernandez -- who at the time was a star receiver for the patriots -- partying with odin lloyd and hernandez 's personal barber at rumor nightclub two nights before odin lloyd 's death
investigators say hernandez was angry that odin lloyd was talking to some people that night
hernandez and odin lloyd are not seen together on a camera pointed at the club 's bar , and they appear to be separated for a time when they leave , but so far there 's no testimony about what may have gone wrong
what might hernandez 's fiancÃ©e say ? akil joseph , a longtime friend of odin lloyd 's who takes the stand , tells jurors he talked with odin lloyd at the club and says he appeared " normal
cameras show hernandez leaving the bar , but they do not show the moment when a parking valet testified he saw what he believed to be a gun in hernandez 's waistband
fortier tells jurors hernandez and odin lloyd were smoking pot. despite her objections , hernandez drives her and the friend to hernandez 's so - called " flophouse " about 20 minutes from gillette stadium , the patriots ' home field in foxborough
