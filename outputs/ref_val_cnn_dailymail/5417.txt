former scotland football captain hendry , pictured arriving at blackpool magistrates , has admitted drink driving ex-scotland football captain hendry is preparing to fight a ban from the roads after blaming his drink driving on a ' rare ' metabolism
the 49 - year old former glasgow rangers and blackburn rovers defender was arrested last month after police stopped him near his home in lytham , lancashire in the early hours of february 21
officers had claimed hendry who was nicknamed ' braveheart ' when he captain of scotland was almost twice the limit after failing a breathalyser test
but today , widowed father of four hendry disputed the reading and asked blackpool magistrates to have the case adjourned so his metabolism could be tested
the court heard that hendry admitted drinking before driving his blue ford focus , but argued the amount of alcohol he drank over a certain period of time should not have put him over the limit
' there are two possibilities - one is because of the fact that he has got some alcohol in his system he is unaware of and the other is quite rare is we have somebody whose metabolism is such they provide a specimen of breath which does not correlate with the reading of blood
' mr hendry might have to be tested for his metabolism in the lab with a reconstruction of the whole evening 's events
' he was stopped by police and arrested near his home in lytham , lancashire in the early hours of february 21 , and was found to be driving his blue ford focus while almost double the legal alcohol limit ( stock picture ) the court agreed to adjourn for a ' special reasons ' hearing in which hendry will call evidence from a forensic service scientist and two civilian witnesses who were with him on the night of the incident
hendry - who arrived for the hearing in sunglasses and a grey suit - had 63 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35mg
