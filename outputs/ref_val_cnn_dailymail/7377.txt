the progress liverpool have made since that defeat at old trafford in december has been nothing short of remarkable
they remain the only unbeaten team in the premier league this year and it owes much to the solidity of a defence now boasting six straight away games without conceding a goal
clearly , it amounts to a tactical triumph for manager rodgers

can has been superb in the role alongside martin skrtel and mamadou sakho , who have also benefitted hugely from a tactical reshuffle that appears to provide them with more security and with it greater confidence
the decision to drop simon mignolet earlier this season has also proved an astute piece of leadership by rodgers
that said , liverpool âs defence also demonstrated against swansea that they remain prone to the occasional mistake
there was a moment at the liberty stadium , which led to the mignolet save to deny gomis , when a neat exchange of passes between swansea âs french striker and wayne routledge left a gaping hole in liverpool âs back three

yes , martin skrtel is proving himself a leader in the liverpool defence
and yes , mamadou sakho and can are now playing to the level we have long come to expect of liverpool defenders
and while the deployment of gerrard as a holding midfielder , and with it a slight change to a diamond formation , gave henderson the freedom to get further forward last night , it was the mere fact that henderson was fit enough and determined enough to make that run in pursuit of sturridge âs flick - on that earned liverpool their goal
