jerusalem israeli did not spy on closed - door talks over iran 's nuclear program involving the u.s. and other world powers , an israeli official said tuesday , denying a wsj report
the newspaper reported late monday on its website that israeli had obtained confidential information about the negotiations to help it argue against a potential deal
" these allegations are utterly false , " the senior official in the israeli prime minister 's office told cnn
" the israeli government 's use of the information it allegedly gleaned -- sharing it with u.s. lawmakers and others to undercut support for a deal -- was what really angered the white house , the wsj reported monday , citing current and former u.s. officials
it is another thing for israeli to steal u.s. secrets and play them back to u.s. legislators to undermine u.s. diplomacy , " a senior u.s. official briefed on the matter said , according to the newspaper
the israeli espionage efforts included eavesdropping and also acquiring information from confidential u.s. briefings , informants and diplomatic contacts in europe , the report says
the senior israeli official told cnn that " the false allegations are clearly intended to undermine the strong ties between the u.s. and israeli and the security and intelligence relationship we share
