somerset âs bats , in particular , chase each other , perform tandem turns and can even slow down without ever hitting each other
researchers from bristol university measured biosonar bat calls to calculate what members of group perceived as they foraged for food
it found the bats interact by swapping between leading and following , and they swap these roles by copying the route a nearby individual was using up to 500 milliseconds earlier dr holderied , of the school of biological sciences at bristol university , studied pairs of daubenton âs bats foraging low over water for stranded insects at a site near the village of barrow gurney , in somerset
these flying mammals perceive their surroundings by emitting loud and high - pitched biosonar calls and listening for the returning echoes
because bat biosonar imaging is much sparser in information than vision , dr holderied was able to accurately measure the biosonar calls of the interacting bats and then calculate what each of the individuals perceived
they swap these leader - follower roles and perform chases or co-ordinated manoeuvres by copying the route a nearby individual was using up to 500 milliseconds earlier
the experts studied daubenton 's bats ( pictured )
they said : ' the bats seem to have adopted a simple trick - once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo [ and ] copy this individual âs flight direction
dr holderied said : ' the bats seem to have adopted a simple trick - once another individual is close enough for your biosonar to pick up its echo , copy this individual âs flight direction within four to five of your own wingbeats
