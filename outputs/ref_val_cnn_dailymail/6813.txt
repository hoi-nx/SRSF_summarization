an 11 - year - old girl was suspended for five days for filming her teacher threatening another child in her science class last week
the fort pierce elementary school science teacher , whose identity has not been revealed , has been fired following the incident and fifth grader brianna cooper still does n't understand why the school has decided to punish her for doing what she thought was the right thing
' do nât let the size fool you
i will drop you , ' cooper recorded her teacher saying with her cell phone
so do n't give me no look , ' said the florida teacher to a student in her class
' i never had anyone tell me , " you can not record , " ' said cooper , who at 11 - years - old does n't have a full knowledge of florida law
