" india 's daughter , " the bbc documentary about the infamous 2012 gang rape in delhi , premiered in the americans last week
many ( i 'd like to think most ) of us cringed at these comments and their garishly clear misogyny
perhaps your first thought when you heard or read those words was , " violence against women is really bad ... in india
reports this weekend of a robbery at a christian school in eastern india , in which , officials said , one of the assailants allegedly raped a 70 - year - old nun , add to the narrative
but as unfathomable as this brutality is , we must resist the temptation to presume some sort of americans violence - against - women exceptionalism , making others the bad guys while crowing about " how far women have come " in the americans
our global human rights organization , based in the americans and india , works to inspire individuals and institutions to drive the culture change needed to make violence against women unacceptable
when i describe our work -- including our campaigns and issues in both countries and beyond -- the questions people ask often reveal their at least initial assumption : that we here in the americans are working solely to stop violence against women in india
yet we do have issues in the americans , issues " like that
we know from " the hunting ground , " documentarian kirby dick 's film about sexual assault on college campuses -- also now in theaters -- that multitudes of women , and many men , have had violated their right to an education free from violence
we know that women are leaving the tech industry , wall street , and internet feminism in droves due to untenable discrimination and violence
and what of the response ? as zak cheney-rice noted , discussing " india 's daughter " in mic.com , " from india to the americans , citizens and officials alike display a troubling inclination to sympathize with rapists and vilify their victims
" a united nations report released last week , marking the 20th anniversary of the landmark women 's rights conference in beijing , confirms that ( as the new york times put it ) " violence against women -- including rape , murder and sexual harassment -- remains stubbornly high in countries rich and poor , at war and at peace
but to imagine that violence against women happens only , or mostly , " somewhere else , " is exactly what keeps the culture of violence alive at home
indeed , " india 's daughter " premiered in the americans with the intent of drawing attention to gender inequality and sexual violence worldwide
