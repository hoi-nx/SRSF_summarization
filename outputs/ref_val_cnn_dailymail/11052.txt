controversial radio presenter laws has revealed he was abused by a paedophile in a public toilet when he was a child
laws , who recently came under fire for his tough on - air interview with a sex abuse victim , reducing the caller to tears , has admitted he was attacked in a public toilet in sydney when he was 10 or 11 years old
it was in a public lavatory at mosman oval
laws criticised brian for not fighting the attacker off and called him a ' wet blanket '
but the radio veteran has defended his comments and said he did not think he had treated brian insensitively
but laws rebuked claims he had no sympathy for those who had been abused and said his reaction to brian 's story stemmed from how he had handled his own experience
brian called laws during his morning radio show on 2sm earlier this month and told him about his sexual abuse he said his attacker was someone he did not know and he was left disturbed by the abuse , adding he would have made it ' very clear ' he did not appreciate it by shouting and yelling
the broadcaster said his advice to brian would have been how he would have reacted in the same situation , describing it as ' tough love '
the shock jock called the elderly man a ' wet blanket ' and suggested he should ' go to the pub and have a lemonade ' in a 10 - minute call , brian told laws about how he had been sexually abused on several occasions from the age of 11 to 14 live on sydney radio station 2sm
brian then told laws he had in fact reported two instances to the police but he was told to ' go away and forget about it
it was at this stage , laws added insult to injury as he told brian that he should have fought the man off , as he himself had done when men had ' had a go ' at him when he was younger
the call outraged people on social media who called for the radio presenter 's sacking after the call a meek sounding brian responded ' no , no probably not
' former hey dad star sarah monahan wants brian to know that he is not alone and people do care brian continued to open up about his years spent in isolation after the attacks , trying to minimise human contact when laws thought it prudent to offer brian some more sound advice
' but do n't be down all the time , do n't be a wet blanket all the time
' no ? well there 's not a lot more i can do , is there ? ' to wrap up the uncomfortable ten minute conversation laws asked brian to thank him for his time
' brian , could you say thank you ? ' the interview draws shocking parallels to a conversation laws had with a female caller in 2013 who had also experienced sexual abuse
twitter has erupted in support for brian as listeners call for the so - called radio magnate to be sacked
sarah monahan , the former co-star of hey dad ! who was among actor robert hughes â child sex abuse victims , chimed into show support for brian and said she hopes he can see that there are people out there who do care
