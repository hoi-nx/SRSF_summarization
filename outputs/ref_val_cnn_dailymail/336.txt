the u.s. military dropped 60,000 copies of a graphic leaflet near the northern syria city of raqqa that depict potential islamic state recruits being fed into a meat grinder
the leaflets , part of an information campaign to discourage people from joining the extremist group , were dropped in a canister by an f - 15 fighter jet last week
' the message of this leaflet is , if you allow yourself to be recruited by daesh , you will find yourself in a meat grinder
the gruesome drawing shows seven young men standing in a line under a sign that says daesh recruiting office
the meat grinder is labeled as daesh , and a sign in the corner says ' now serving 6001
' is it working ? the u.s. military commander for the middle east says isis is ' losing momentum ' in syria warren said this is the only leaflet he knows about
