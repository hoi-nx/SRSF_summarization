manchester city and chelsea are set to challenge manchester united for the services of gareth bale this summer
the pressure on gareth bale at real madrid has intensified in recent weeks and a move back to the premier league is on the cards
it has been assumed that if gareth bale does leave real madrid then a move to manchester united is a ' shoo - in '
but both chelsea and manchester city are in need of attacking stimulus , especially in the context of champions league football
gareth bale is attracting criticism in the spanish capital and chelsea and manchester city are interested the reality is that it will be how each club manage to finance a Â£ 100million deal plus near Â£ 300,000 - a - week wages and stay within ffp rules
chelsea , on the basis of transfer sales and turnover , will have the ability to push the boat out to get gareth bale
chelsea could demand as much as Â£ 20million this summer to let petr cech leave the club
in what may well be a merry - go - round of elite goalkeepers this summer , petr cech is a target for arsenal , tottenham , liverpool , manchester united , real madrid and psg
although petr cech is now chelsea âs no 2 , he is still just 32
petr cech is wanted by a raft of top clubs and arsenal have been urged to sign him by jens lehmann liverpool are prepared to play poker with sterling and his advisors over a new contract
the reds do nât believe there is genuine , firm interest from clubs such as bayern munich , real madrid , chelsea or manchester united as has been reported , as talks over a new Â£ 100,000 a week deal have repeatedly stalled
certainly liverpool believe that if they slap a Â£ 50million - plus price tag on the england forward then none of those clubs would make a move this summer
sterling is reportedly wanted by europe 's elite , but liverpool are n't buying that talks on a bumper Â£ 1000,000 - a - week deal have stalled between sterling and liverpool indeed the club believe sterling constantly being linked with a range of ' platinum ' clubs is part of a strategy from the player âs camp to force their hand and offer wages of up to Â£ 140,000 a week - the sort of level steven gerrard and suarez were on
brendan rodgers bluntly told sterling not to wave goodbye to liverpool it was telling that manager brendan rodgers said pointedly on saturday : â i think it is quite obvious when you look at it is that anyone with his [ sterling âs ] best interests at heart knows his best option is to sign a new deal for liverpool
â the club also does nât want to unsettle the rest of the squad by bowing to sterling 's demands
