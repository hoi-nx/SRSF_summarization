when tania clarence killed her three young severely disabled children â overwhelmed by the terrible strain of looking after them â their tragic deaths shocked the nation and inspired a wave of sympathy for her and her family
four months ago she pleaded guilty on the grounds of diminished responsibility to the manslaughter of her three - year - old twin sons and four - year - old daughter
she was sentenced by an old bailey judge to be detained in a psychiatric hospital until her recovery was complete
now mail on sunday can reveal that she has been allowed to return to the family home where the killings took place
tania clarence , who is being treated for depression , has been seen at her Â£ 1.2million family home with a girl believed to be her surviving daughter just four months after admitting killing her three terminally ill children at the court hearing in november , mrs tania clarence was described as a loving and caring mother who had smothered twins max and ben and daughter olivia while in the grip of a severe bout of mental illness brought on by what mr justice sweeney called the â unbearable pressure â of caring for them
her client âs plea was accepted by the prosecution and the judge imposed a sentence known as a hospital order
he ruled that the 43 - year - old would need psychiatric treatment and therapy â for the foreseeable future â and would not be released until she had recovered from her illness
she was accompanied by another woman and a young girl â thought to be her only surviving child , who was eight years old when the terrible events occurred last april
mrs tania clarence declined to comment when she was approached by a mail on sunday reporter but her husband gary , when told that an article about the family was being prepared for publication this weekend , said : â okay , fine
â family man : clarence with his three - year - old twin sons max and ben
mrs tania clarence , who was severely depressed at the time , lied to the family nanny so she could be alone with the three youngest children while her husband and older daughter were away
the judge said the evidence of her diminished responsibility for the children âs deaths was â clear and convincing â
psychiatrists had explained â in compelling detail â that her mental illness had substantially impaired her ability to form a rational judgment
up to 60 therapists , doctors , nurses and other specialists had been involved with the family over the years , sometimes arriving at the house unannounced and leaving mrs tania clarence feeling insecure and upset , the court was told
