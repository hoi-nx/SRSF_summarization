an horrifically burned 12 - year - old boy was able to tell police it was his dad who started the fatal house fire that killed him and his nine - year - old brother , an inquest has heard
salesman sykes , 44 , lured his two boys paul , 9 , and his brother jack , 12 , to the attic with fun - size chocolate bars to play with a new model railway then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside
the bodies of mr sykes and paul were found in the loft and jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder but died five days later in hospital
jack managed to tell a police officer and hospital consultant before he died from 50 per cent burns : ' it was my dad that started the fire ' and ' my dad did it on purpose
' the fire , which was started deliberately by mr sykes ( centre ) , killed himself along with his nine - year - old son paul ( left ) and jack ( right ) , 12 jack ( right ) and paul sykes were both killed in the house fire after being lured into the loft by their father who then set the home ablaze
' the inquest heard mr sykes , worried over access rights to his children , ' coldly planned ' the fire at his home ' with the specific purpose of ending two young lives '
' the inquest heard that mr sykes felt ' the world was against him ' after a meeting with cafcass - which represents children in family courts two days before the tragedy
mr sykes told his boss spencer in a phone call just over two hours before the inferno that he thought the cafcass visit was a ' waste of time ' and ' they wanted to talk about negatives and did n't want to listen to his agenda '
' an inquest into the death of paul ( pictured bottom left and far right ) and jack was carried out today , where a coroner ruled their deaths were the result of an unlawful killing claire throssell 's son jack clung to life in intensive care with his mother ( pictured ) at his bedside , but died five days later he felt the access arrangements were ' barbaric ' and he mistakenly believed paul only wanted to see him for one hour a week
' she did not believe mr sykes was taking on board what she was telling him
the boys ' heartbroken mother claire throssell ( pictured at her sons ' funeral ) told the inquest her two children had ' meant the world ' to her ' paul said his dad was abusive to him and jack , ' she said
on a skiing trip paul claimed his dad had got him by the throat
' when mr sykes was challenged he apologised for his behaviour but was more focused on getting around a table with his then wife
mr sykes , lived in penistone , south yorkshire , after the split with his wife and his sons lived with her at their grandmother 's in nearby thurlstone
he spent Â£ 600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be ' engine drivers '
mr sykes then bought petrol cans , some petrol and posted letters to family and friends and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home
the inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house , he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door , letting himself in and locking it behind him
mourners stand by as the caskets of jack and paul are carried from a church during their funeral in october mr sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was ' going to be at peace '
two bodies were found in the loft - that of mr sykes and his son paul - and mr paul sykes was declared dead on arrival at hospital
mr sykes and paul died from inhaling noxious fumes
' the coroner recorded a verdict on monday that mr sykes committed suicide
coroner dorries said : ' this fire was set deliberately indeed the whole event was carefully planned by mr sykes to ensure a catastrophic fire while the boys were distracted by model railway equipment and sweets
