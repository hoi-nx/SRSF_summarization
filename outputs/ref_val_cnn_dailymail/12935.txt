the world is watching for what could turn out to be either a historic achievement for international diplomacy -- or , just as easily , a disappointing failure -- as negotiators sit down this week in the tranquil lakeside city of lausanne , switzerland , to hammer out a framework nuclear deal with iran before march 31
in 2013 , tensions between the world powers and iran began to thaw a bit after the election of reformist iran president rouhani , who pledged to end the crippling weight of international sanctions on iran 's economy
in november of that year , officials from the five permanent member nations of the u.n. -- the united states , united kingdom , france , russia and china -- along with germany , began nuclear negotiations with iran officials in switzerland and signed what came to be known as the geneva agreement or joint plan of action , offering limited sanctions relief for iran in return for that country rolling back aspects of its nuclear program
the deal was heralded as an interim step toward a larger , more comprehensive agreement , which would further lessen the economic pressure on iran and give the six world powers -- referred to collectively as the p5 +1 -- certain assurances that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful in nature , as it claims
but this interim agreement has been extended twice over a failure of the parties to meet previous deadlines for a final deal
while both sides stand to gain from a potential agreement , they also have certain " red lines " they are n't willing to cross -- key issues that could sink the prospects of a deal even if everything else is agreed to
they want the international community to lift all u.n. sanctions at the beginning of the agreement , whereas the p5 +1 powers would rather see those sanctions phased out as iran demonstrates its commitment to the deal
iran also wants a high cap on the number of centrifuges and other nuclear hardware it can continue to operate , and for the restrictions imposed on it in the deal to last only a short period of time
and of critical importance , particularly to the united states , is the insistence that iran be held to a minimum one - year " breakout time " -- a technical terms reflecting the amount of time it would take for iran to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon if it decides to walk away from the agreement
the parties are seeking to reach what 's being called a framework agreement -- essentially a political understanding of the main principles of the final deal
the united states would prefer a written accord , but iran has balked at putting anything in writing until a comprehensive deal is reached
there are seven countries at the negotiating table , but far more following along from the outside
israel , for instance , as one of iran 's primary geopolitical foes in the middle east , is watching the talks keenly
israel officials are regularly consulting with their p5 +1 allies on a regular basis and are trying to influence the outcome of the deal
and there are those who fear that a nuclear agreement will spur other countries in the region to develop nuclear programs -- a means of deterring iran if it decides to restart the military dimensions of its newly legitimized nuclear program
in iran , supreme leader khamenei has the final say on any nuclear agreement iran would reach with world powers
