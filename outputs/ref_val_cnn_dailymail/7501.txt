mountain bikers and cross-country runners are at risk from the deadly stomach bug e.coli if they get splashed with mud , doctors warned today
medics at aberdeen royal infirmary say they treated a 23 - year - old cyclist for an e.coli 0157 infection after he was admitted to the hospital suffering from vomiting , abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea
the man - a vegetarian - said he had not eaten undercooked meat or vegetables , nor had he spent time with livestock or visiting farms before falling ill. a man was treated for e. coli which doctors believe he contracted after taking part in a tough mudder event and was splashed with infected mud ( file picture ) but eight days before his symptoms began the man had competed in a cycling event along wet , muddy tracks in eastern scotland
he , along with other competitors , had removed the mudguards from his bicycle to reduce weight , and mud and water had splashed on his face during the race
it is thought this was how he became infected with the bug , which can be found in animal faeces and farm slurry
writing in the research paper , the doctors warned : ' sporting endeavours such as cycling and cross-country running events often take participants through such high - risk areas and may be an important cause of contact with e. coli 0157
' this case highlights the possible risk to participants in sports that expose them to mud that may have been contaminated by animal faeces
health protection scotland warned anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling and crossing areas that might contain animal faeces are at risk of picking up e. coli ( pictured in a petri dish ) a health protection scotland spokesman said today : ' anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling - and events that cross areas that have recently been occupied by animals such as cattle or sheep - should be aware of the risks of picking up a gastro - intestinal infection such as vero cytotoxin - producing e. coli ( vtec ) , more commonly referred to as e.coli
' one of the main risks to humans is from coming into contact directly or indirectly with contaminated animal faeces
