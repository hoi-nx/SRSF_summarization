jerusalem within 48 hours of his election night victory , netanyahu rolled back his pre-election comments that there would be no palestinian state if he were prime minister , but the damage may already have been done to relations with the two other major players in the negotiations : the united states and the palestinian
in an interview with nbc , netanyahu said , " i have n't changed my policy , i never retracted my speech six years ago calling for a demilitarized palestinian state that recognizes the jewish state
what has changed is the reality , mahmoud abbas ( nickhame of palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas ) the palestinian leader refuses to recognize the jewish state , and he 's made a pact with hamas that calls for the destruction of israel
" chief palestinian negotiator erekat says he believes the pre-election statement that netanyahu will not allow a two - state solution
" all netanyahu needs to do to gain the credibility and the trust , not only of me but of the international community , he needs to stand tall and tell the israel people that in order to live in peace with our neighbors we 're going to have to recognize the state of palestine
" erekat says the palestinian may try again for recognition once more at the united nations , a forum where they fell one vote short of recognition as a full united nations member state in december
so where does that leave the united states ? the white house said it would " reassess " the relationship between the united states and israel
but the united states has also used its veto power as a permanent member of the u.n. security council to block resolutions unfavorable to israel
