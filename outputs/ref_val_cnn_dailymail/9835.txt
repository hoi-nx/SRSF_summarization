the parents of private cheryl james - who died from a gunshot wound at deepcut barracks - have accused the police of deliberately delaying an inquest into her death the parents of a teenage army recruit who died from a gunshot wound at deepcut barracks have accused the police of deliberately delaying an inquest into her death
private cheryl james , 18 , was one of four young soldiers who died in unexplained shootings at the surrey base between 1995 and 2002
after fighting for justice for 20 years , her parents won the right to hold a new inquest after surrey police were forced to hand over tens of thousands of pages of previously concealed evidence
they believe the new documents could provide the truth behind how their daughter died after years of speculation , including fears she was murdered or driven to commit suicide after being sexually assaulted
but now the police force â which has repeatedly come under fire for their botched investigation into the deaths â is trying to push back the case by years , the family claimed
the force argued in a hearing earlier this month that james âs inquest should be heard alongside inquests into the deaths of the other three soldiers â a process which could take another three years
des , 66 , and doreen , 63 , cheryl james âs parents , from carreghofa on the shropshire - montgomeryshire border , said : â three weeks ago we thought we were on the way to justice
â you âve got four kids who die on the same site and the police link them all together , even though two of them died almost seven years apart
â james , 18 , was found dead in a copse of trees at the base after she had been on sentry duty in november 1995
private sean benton , 20 , from hastings , east sussex , was also found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in june 1995
and in september 2001 , 17 - year - old geoff gray , from seaham , co durham , was found with two gunshot wounds to his head
private james collinson lost his life in suspicious circumstances at deepcut barracks in march 2002
( clockwise from top left ) private james collinson , private james , private geoff gray and private sean benton all died at deepcut barracks the soldiers â families have refused to accept that all four committed suicide , accusing the army of covering up bullying and abuse
retired company direction , mr james , said he believed the new evidence , which he has seen , could lead to a criminal investigation , adding : â i am fighting to find out everything i possibly can about my daughter âs death
â there is quite simply no evidence that connects cheryl james âs death with the rifle found near her body
but the force has still not handed over 25 per cent of the files on the death of james
mr james added : â if we can make a case with 75 per cent of the files , one must wonder what else is to come and why exactly it has taken surrey police almost ten years to hand it over
â james , 18 , was found dead in a copse of trees at the base ( pictured ) after she had been on sentry duty in november 1995 speaking yesterday , norton , legal officer for liberty , said : â des and doreen have suffered all these years and the case should be dealt with separately as that is what these young people and their families deserve
the high court ruled there was an â insufficiency of inquiry â at the original 1995 inquest into james â death which lasted just an hour
two judges quashed the controversial open verdict last year - a dramatic breakthrough in the family âs 19 - year fight for justice
miss norton added : â in july 2014 des and doreen finally got what they had been fighting for for 20 years when the high court agreed to order a fresh inquest following the disclosure of thousands of pages of new material
â a hearing was held earlier this month to set a date for the inquest later this year , but lawyers acting on behalf of the police called for it be stayed until all of the other cases were prepared
â a surrey police spokesman said : â surrey police is supportive of the view that there should be a thorough inquest into the circumstances in which pte cheryl james died
â at the pre inquest review his honour justice barker was asked to consider the merits of holding any new inquests arising from the deaths of pte cheryl james , pte sean benton , pte geoff gray and pte james collinson , together or individually
