the no. 1 cause of remote control plane crashes is pilot error , according to r / c airplane world
in fact pilot error is commonly disguised as equipment failure ! ' flying surface or control surface failure can also be the guilty culprit in bringing down our planes , especially if the builder did a less than satisfactory job on the hinges ! ' prevention is better than cure , but sadly it takes a crash to figure out what went wrong and hopefully prevent it happening again in the future
