labour mp austin mitchell has been told off by the party âs high command for poking fun at miliband âs two kitchens
mr austin mitchell , 80 , who is standing down as an mp in may , last week mischievously tweeted a picture of his own kitchen â complete with an unpacked bag of shopping and half - full glass of wine on the table â under the heading â this is what a real labour kitchen looks like â
austin mitchell tweeted this photograph with the caption : ' this is what a real labour kitchen looks like ' it is just the latest twist in the drama about mr miliband âs domestic set - up after he and wife justine were filmed for a bbc interview having tea in a very small , empty kitchen with no seating area
in response to criticism , a family friend tweeted that the kitchen in the milibands â Â£ 2million north london townhouse was â lovely â and that this was a â functional kitchenette â for making â tea and snacks â
while most labour mps have resisted comment on the issue , mr austin mitchell fuelled the fire this weekend by tweeting : â labour âs new pledge card promises two kitchens for all by 2030 , two toilets by 2035
â last week , in a jibe at the conservatives â so - called bedroom tax , the veteran mp for grimsby , had said : â tories to introduce spare kitchen tax â
mr turner wrote him a letter , which mr austin mitchell duly published on his website yesterday , which read : â you âre a joke austin
â it is just the latest twist in the drama about mr miliband âs domestic set - up after he and wife justine were filmed for a bbc interview having tea in a very small , empty kitchen with no seating area mr turner , the mp for hull east , added that mr miliband â has one in donny [ his constituency in doncaster ] and mine âs massive in east hull
â mr austin mitchell claimed that as a result , labour was becoming more â family - friendly , gentler â but â less prepared for all - night shenanigans of the parliamentary kind â
