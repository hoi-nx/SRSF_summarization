until next time ! pete jenson : a lot depends on who makes a move and on how much they are willing to pay
if a club bid Â£ 90million for gareth bale or Â£ 65m for cristiano ronaldo ( bearing in mind he is 30 ) , i think real madrid would consider it
ronaldo because it would make economic sense and gareth bale because it would not be unpopular with real madrid supporters
pete jenson : the better players were in playing the el clasico and yet the best goal of the six that were scored came at anfield from juan mata
there were away fans in the liverpool vs manchester united game â that is something that is always missing from a el clasico
pete jenson : fair assessment , yes
he took his goal well and was one of those real madrid players who did nât deserve to be on the losing side
but real madrid pressed so well he did nât see a great deal of the ball
pete jenson : it was the 42nd el clasico he âd played some part in â no barcelona player has played in more
by spanish football standards barcelona vs real madrid games are usually very frenetic and yet he always seemed to have an extra second of time and a extra yard of space
he âll come back to this fixture as barcelona manager one day , you can count on it
pete jenson : the most shameful thing about it is that we have seen incidents in recent years of players collapsing on the pitch and sometimes even dying
pete jenson : he was poor in the first half and it was his miss just before cristiano ronaldo equalised that made the game such a contest

arsenal would give him all the job security he has missed out on at first chelsea and now real madrid
it all sounds perfect , i do nât know why the wheels have not already been set in motion ! pete jenson : in one sense he does nât have to adapt that much because this barcelona does not play like the old pep guardiola , barcelona
pete jenson : no one stays in the job very long
it âs incredible to think that carlo ancelotti has nât been immortalised by adoring supporters after winning â la decima â but he has nât and unless they win the league or the champions league this season there will be a change
zidane will almost definitely manage real madrid one day
pete jenson : gareth bale is at his best when he is given free reign going forward
last night in the first half he was asked to play wide right in a four - man midfield as opposed to up - top in the three of a 4 - 3 - 3
pete jenson : it âs been a long time since i can remember seeing him dive
pete jenson : it was tough for him at first because he could no longer be as single - minded as he was at liverpool
