the chance of a magnitude - 8 quake striking the state in the next three decades jumped to 7 per cent from 4.7 per cent , mainly because scientists took into account the possibility that several faults can shake at once , releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction
while the risk of a mega-quake is higher than past estimates , it 's more likely - greater than 99 per cent chance - that california will be rattled by a magnitude - 6.7 jolt similar in size to the 1994 northridge disaster
brace : a new u.s. geological survey report has increased the likelihood of a magnitude - 8 earthquake hitting california over the next 30 years
above , a photo of an overpass that collapsed in the 1994 magnitude - 6.7 northridge earthquake the chance of a northridge - size quake was slightly higher in california than southern california - 95 per cent versus 93 per cent , according to a report released tuesday by the u.s. geological survey
' california is earthquake country , and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one , ' u.s. geological survey geophysicist and lead author field said
because of this knowledge , the odds of a catastrophic quake - magnitude 8 or larger - in the next 30 years increased
there is a 93 per cent chance of a magnitude 7 or larger occurring over the same period and a 48 per cent chance of a magnitude 7.5 - similar to previous estimates
the report found there is a 19 per cent chance in the next 30 years that a northridge - size quake will unzip the southern section compared to a 6.4 per cent chance for the northern section , partly because it last broke in 1906
