doctors stress the importance of detecting disease early on to give people the best chance of recovery
a san francisco firm has developed a sensor that identifies gases and molecules released in a person âs breath that could hint at an underlying illness
doctor in a stick ? the very early model of the sensor ( pictured ) has been created by san francisco - based boydsense and is on display at this year âs mobile world congress in barcelona advanced software and prediction algorithms are then used with a connected app to reveal any anomalies

in addition to detecting volatile compounds in the breath , the firm said the sensor could be used to identify compounds released by rotting food some compounds , including carbon for instance , are released naturally
boydsense has therefore developed software that can identify at which point the level of a gas or compound is beyond what is considered normal
in the mailonline demo , the boydsense sensor was able to detect an orange within 30 seconds boydsense âs boss thuillier gave mailonline a demo of the technology at mobile world congress
the current sensor is a prototype and syncs with a smartphone via bluetooth - although mr thuillier hopes future models will be embedded into the phones themselves
if attached to a smartphone , the sensor could be placed in a fridge or cupboard and detect if chicken is nearing its best - before date , or if fruit and vegetables are about to turn
