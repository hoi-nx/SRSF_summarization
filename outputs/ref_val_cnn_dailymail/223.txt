the charity race at cheltenham is supposed to be all about the taking part - except when serial winners sir alex ferguson and multi-champion trainer paul nicholls are involved
co-owner alex ferguson and paul nicholls were so keen for the ditcheat trainer âs head lad clifford to ride the winner that his fancied mount rainy city , who cost Â£ 100,000 , had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the cheltenham card yesterday
sir alex ferguson ( right ) and paul nicholls ( left ) were at cheltenham to watch rainy city finish fifth yet rainy city , who is highly thought of in the paul nicholls yard , had no british horseracing authority rating , and rival jockeys were concerned that alex ferguson âs horse was far superior to the rest of the field

nor did the canadian do his image much good by wearing a gb tracksuit top during last weekend âs davis cup triumph over the usa in glasgow â a cardinal sin for a sports administrator
lta chief executive michael downey was not his usual suited self in glasgow - he wore a gb tracksuit top there will be only five more racing days after saturday before clare balding turns her back on presenting the sport following royal ascot
but the clare balding effect has not boosted channel 4 âs viewing figures â quite the reverse
clare balding arrives at cheltenham , but her presence has not helped viewing figures only cheltenham could consider Â£ 30,000 for two season tickets in the cheltenham club good value
