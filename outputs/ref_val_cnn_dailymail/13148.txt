dingzhou , chinese bian carefully pulls back the clear plastic from her tattered photo album
she wants to show me her favorite photograph of her son
it 's from a few years ago
bian was on his way back from singapore after working on a construction site to earn money to pay for his dentist 's license
but his mother is convinced he 's coming back
i know he is still alive , " she says
the news cycle moved on but the families are still here
and all the family members i speak to say their loved ones are alive
" i think psychologically it is understandable , they choose to believe that their loved ones are still missing , so they can still have hope for them to return , " says may lam , a psychiatrist at the university of hong kong
families complain of harassment by local communist party officials , several have been detained by chinese police for holding meetings and some say they have been barred from speaking to the international media
both the chinese and malaysian governments maintain they are doing everything they can to help
i hope he is somewhere alive
