in washington , we are seeing the re-emergence this year of a phenomenon that many america were afraid had gone extinct : real live no - joke bipartisanship
heavyweights from both parties are attending the march 26 bipartisan summit on criminal justice reform
the event is co-produced by gingrich productions ( on the right ) and by my project , # cut50 -- an initiative that aims to safely halve the number of people behind bars within 10 years
attorney general eric holder will be speaking
so will newt gingrich , the republicans former house speaker
sen. cory booker , d-new jersey , will be there
progressives like myself will rub shoulders with representatives from koch
in america today , we have 5 % of the world 's population -- but we have nearly 25 % of the world 's incarcerated people
nearly 1 in 100 america adults is behind bars
one out of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is caged in america 's prisons and jails
( so much for " corrections " ! ) that 's the opposite of limited government -- and liberty
we are incensed by a system that locks up the poor and racial minorities in numbers that are massive -- and massively disproportionate
when any system violates the principles of both " liberty " and " justice , " america of all stripes should stand together to change it
and people who make mistakes , let 's not write them off forever , let 's give them a chance to reintegrate and reenter society
that is a direct quote from mark , senior vice president of koch
on practically every other issue , the koch brothers and i are still fierce opponents
i doubt if we will ever agree on tax policy , campaign finance reform , environmental rules or the keystone pipeline , to name a few
but on criminal justice reform , it 's different
that 's one reason that red - state governors , like georgia 's nathan deal , have acted boldly
criminal justice reform is the one place where many republicans , democrats and libertarians actually agree -- and are willing to work together to get something done
