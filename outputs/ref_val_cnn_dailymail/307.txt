' vettori is still a key member of the new zealand team and has demonstrated his value throughout the cricket world cup with a series of frugal bowling performances and cameo innings '
vettori was at the crease with grant elliott ( right ) as he hit the winning runs against south africa vettori ahead of his test debut in wellington as a 17 - year - old way back in 1997 ' i guess it was potentially his last game on home soil and for him to be out there at the end and be as instrumental and as calm as he was under pressure , it was superb , ' brendon mccullum said
