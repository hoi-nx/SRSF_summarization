it still clearly rankles with steven naismith that injury saw him miss out on a uefa cup final appearance with rangers in what now seems like another dimension , never mind seven short years ago
but the scotland star has revealed that it âs the memory of that heartbreaking episode which is spurring him on to reach this season âs uefa cup showpiece with everton
martinez âs men host dinamo kiev tonight at goodison park in the first leg of their last - 16 tie and the hosts are expected to progress against one of the competition âs lowest - ranked sides
steven naismith consoles kevin thompson after rangers ' defeat in the 2008 uefa cup final steven naismith is determined to make up for that defeat , and missing the final , with everton this season britain âs last remaining representatives in the tournament will have their work cut out to go all the way , with the likes of wolfsburg , napoli , roma and zenit st petersburg also still in contention
but steven naismith is adamant they have what it takes to challenge for the club âs second continental honour after the cup winners â cup was claimed three decades ago - and are ready to go one step better than rangers did in 2008 when they lost to zenit st petersburg in manchester
in his first campaign at ibrox after leaving kilmarnock , steven naismith appeared as a sub in a crucial 1 - 1 draw at panathinaikos that gave walter smith âs side an away goals victory

â i missed the semi-finals and the final and i remember watching the penalty shoot - out in florence that took us through on tv and i did nât feel 100 per cent part of it
it was fantastic but it also makes me think now i âd love to get that feeling again and hopefully go one better , play in the final and win it
' this season when we âve been playing in europe , it has crossed my mind that the experiences i had with rangers can help me , especially at this stage in the tournament
it âs something everton can look to do now too and we âve been similar
â while many english sides have looked upon the uefa cup as a distraction from domestic matters in recent seasons , that has nât been the case at everton
steven naismith wants to get his hands on the trophy he came so close to with his former club rangers that has impacted on the club âs domestic performance and they lie 14th in the top flight - but hopes remain high they can strike a balance on both fronts
steven naismith added : â after working so hard last season and being so close to the top four in the league , this was our reward
i do nât think you can treat the uefa cup as if it âs not worth going 100 per cent for - and the manager has shown that in his team selections
â kiev are nât the same force they âve been in the past but steven naismith still rates them and is wary of the damage they can cause on merseyside this evening
