those thoroughbreds made goal prevention an art. but the italy also pride themselves on their goalscorers
last week an excellent column by gazzetta dello sport 's fabio licari bemoaned the lack of goalscoring options available to national coach antonio conte
italy 's national team are famous for their defenders , such as paolo maldini , who played with style and steel italy are struggling for strikers ... defender giorgio chiellini ( second right ) is top scorer since the world cup euro 2016 is 15 months away and the four - times world champions do n't have a regular source of goals
agricultural defender giorgio chiellini is the top scorer of the antonio conte era ( since the 2014 world cup ) with two strikes
the adored meazza , after whom inter and milan 's stadium is named , shot italy to glory in the 1930s
the italy 's late 1960s and world cup 1970 renaissance owed much to the thunderous force of cagliari idol luigi riva
another granite - faced striker , giorgio chinaglia enjoyed a short but colourful career with the national team in the early and mid- 1970s
perhaps the most famous and popular modern italian attacker , the masterly roberto baggio , played alongside vialli and christian vieri at world cups , bewitching the football - loving world
in the past , players such as meazza , after whom inter and milan 's stadium is named , shone paolo rossi spearheaded italy to the world cup in 1982 with a craftier , more subtle approach elsewhere , giorgio chinaglia ( left , pictured with pele ) and roberto baggio ( right ) live long in the memory state of the nation it does n't help antonio conte that four out of five of serie a 's top scorers are foreign
only luca toni ( verona ) is italian , but he is 37 and his career in the national team ended in 2009
zaza and immobile are antonio conte 's first choice partnership
after a typically honest but fruitless performance in italy 's 2 - 2 draw in rain - lashed bulgaria on saturday , zaza admitted : ' i was not satisfied with my performance
' only luca toni is playing well in serie a at the moment , but he retired from international football in 2009 zaza ( pictured ) , along with immobile , are antonio conte 's current first choice partnership the sassuolo man was subbed after 58 minutes of the euro 2016 group h qualifier
and before you ask , liverpool 's mario balotelli is n't antonio conte 's cup of tea , to put it diplomatically
mario balotelli posted a picture of him in a mask to show his feelings after being left out of the italian squad antonio conte does not have a large pool of strikers to choose from , and many are going through a barren spell the only good news from that draw in sofia was eder 's stunning 84th minute equaliser
the brazil - born sampdoria firecracker , unwanted by brazil chief dunga , has the flair and unpredictability to give italy back its goals and smile
at 28 years of age , it 's unlikely eder will make the impact of roberto baggio or even world cup 1990 saviour toto schillaci
luigi riva still ia nazionale 's top scorer with 35 goals from 42 games , riva 's shots measured 140km/h , which would be closer to 200km/h with modern balls
known as the thunderclap , uncompromising riva was instrumental to the italy side which finished runners - up at the 1970 world cup
christian vieri despite all the headlines regarding his hectic private life , brilliant ' bobo ' plundered five goals in a cautious italy team at the 1998 world cup , and four more in 2002 in japan and korea
