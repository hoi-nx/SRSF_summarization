high streets were given a helping hand yesterday as osborne announced a â wide - ranging review â into crippling business rates high streets were given a helping hand yesterday as osborne announced a â wide - ranging review â into crippling business rates
introduced in elizabethan times , the tax is accused of pushing independent shops out of business by charging punishingly high rates
high street retailers claim it places them at a disadvantage to online rivals because it is only charged on â bricks and mortar â
business rates are forecast to raise Â£ 22.4billion in england in 2014 - 15 , from 1.8million non-domestic properties
but the chancellor announced a review into the controversial levy , saying â you can not create jobs without successful businesses â
â in my opinion , the current system of business rates has not kept pace with the needs of a modern economy and changes to our town centres , â he said
â business rates are currently calculated according to the rental value of the property a company uses
the system also means some small shops on busy high streets pay very high rates , while online giants such as amazon , with large warehouses in cheaper locations , pay less
tax expert richard rose , of bdo accountants , said the review launch was â welcome but long overdue â , adding that â any benefits of change are unlikely to filter through until well into the next parliament â
â it will , therefore , be a watching brief for some time yet , which will offer little respite for mid-market retailers who continue to feel the pain of rates set in 2008
â we need a resurgence of help for independent shops so that we can compete fairly with the big boys , â she added
â it is so expensive to have bricks and mortar and , if we do nât protect them â¦ we will lose that service and face - to - face contact that you will never get online
the review began on monday and retailers and organisations will be invited to give their opinions
joanna elson , of the money advice trust said it was â crucial â that the review considers how the rates system can â better support small business owners who are struggling â
last year , mps on the business , innovation and skills committee suggested the business rates system should be â based on sales rather than the rateable value of a property â
â charlotte balbier , 34 , ( pictured above ) is a wedding dress designer who pays Â£ 28,000 in business rates per year
she has seen business rates rise steadily
the rates affect her own showroom , which occupies two floors of an office block , but also the shops on the high street which she relies upon to stock her dresses
â i would like to see lower business rates and less red tape , â she said
â we supply 350 stores â¦ and they are the shops on the high street who could really stand to benefit from a reduction in rates
â Â£ 143 - a - year tax break for 4.6million who work for themselves the self - employed were given a Â£ 143 - a - year tax break yesterday
the chancellor announced the government would axe a Â£ 2.75 - a - week national insurance contribution ( nics ) â in the next parliament â , for the 4.6million who work for themselves
