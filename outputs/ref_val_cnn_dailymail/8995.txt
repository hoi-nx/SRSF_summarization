now there âs a free app that offers users personalised advice about how to boost their phone âs battery life
a free ios and android app called carat offers frustrated smartphone users personalised advice to boost their phone 's battery life
a screenshot showing distribution information is shown left , and a j-score , which indicates how a device âs battery life compares with others running carat , is shown right called carat , it uses crowdsourced measurements to work out how much of an impact certain settings and apps are having on a specific battery , before advising users what to do
these measurements are sent to carat âs servers and â thrown into a statistical stew â so that the measurements can be used as a benchmark to compare how power - hungry a certain device is
carat uses crowd - sourced measurements ( illustrated ) to work out how much of an impact certain settings are having on the battery and what users can do about it
users who download the app can use their phone normally , and after a week , will start to receive personalised recommendations for improving their battery life carat analyses a specific phone 's energy use , drawing upon crowd sourced information
for example , it might point out that twitter is using an unusually large amount of power compared to on other phones , indicating that either an individual is hooked on the social media app , or that it could contain an energy - sapping bug
a j - score is also given that indicates how a device 's battery life compares with other carat users ' devices
non-identifiable information from phones is collected to build up the main database used as a benchmark for energy consumption
for example , it might point out that twitter is using an unusually large amount of power compared to on other phones , indicating that either an individual is hooked on the social media app , or that it could contain an energy - sapping bug
â the information displayed by carat changes over time as it learns - the longer you use it , the better the results get , â according to the researchers behind the app. users will also see a â j-score , â which indicates how a device âs battery life compares with others running carat
similarly , carat lists some apps under â bug report , â which are associated with increased energy use on an individual user âs phone
the confidence level ( shown right ) indicates how likely it is that closing an app will make a difference to battery life â restarting the app may help if it 's a transient problem , but , if not , you may need to close and avoid the app. â as well as being a tool for consumers , carat is a research project run by computer scientists at the universities of helsinki and university of california
while it 's relatively easy to find a link between energy consumption and screen brightness and connectivity , the experts are unravelling the energy impact of the combination of roaming , high operating temperature , and bad signal strength , for example
recommendations could lead to less charging ( stock image ) while it is relatively straight forward to find a link between energy consumption and screen brightness and connectivity , the experts are unravelling the energy impact of the combination of roaming , high operating temperature , and bad signal strength , for example
