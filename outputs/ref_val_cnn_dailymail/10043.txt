referee mike dean ( right ) had some tough calls to make in chelsea 's draw with southampton some officials may have waved away this penalty claim awarded to southampton , as matic brings down sadio mane , but replays confirmed midfielder had caught the winger before getting the ball chelsea striker costa appeals for a penalty but is denied this time by mike dean replays were inconclusive but pundits felt mike dean was correct
chelsea could also point to a trip by tadic on branislav ivanovic just inside the penalty area in the first half but to the naked eye at high speed it looked like a dive which mike dean did well not to caution
branislav ivanovic went down in the box but in real time it looked like a dive - replays showed contact from tadic but it would have been tough to give costa claims he was fouled by diego fonte - if the penalty was given the defender would be been sent off jose mourinho claims a campaign against his side but mike dean 's performance did nothing to support his theory
