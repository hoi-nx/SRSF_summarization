a spacex rocket carrying the world âs first all - electric communications satellites successfully launched this morning
the huge 22 - story tall booster took off from cape canaveral in florida at 3.50am gmt this morning ( 10.50pm est yesterday ) , the third flight in less than two months for spacex
on this occasion , though , spacex made no attempt to land the rocket again on a floating barge , as they had done previously
it is seen here over the skyline of downtown cocoa beach in a two minute time exposure of the launch on top of the rocket were a pair of satellites built by boeing and owned by paris - based eutelsat communications and bermuda - based abs ( abs )
the satellites are unique in that they are powered solely by ion propulsion , as opposed to chemical propellant that is usually favoured
without the fuel they would normally need - hydrazine - the satellites each weighed less than 5,000lbs ( 2,270kg ) , whereas normally they would have weighed more than 8,000lbs ( 3,630kg ) without an ion propulsion system
this also meant both satellites could be carried by spacex âs medium - sized spacex rocket â had they been laden with fuel , only one could have been taken to orbit on this launch
however , as ion propulsion - also known as solar electric propulsion - is much weaker than chemical propulsion , it will take them months rather than weeks to reach their desired geostationary orbit
â the lighter of the two satellites , abs 3a , will reach its destination by the end of august , while the eutelsat 115 west b spacecraft will take a few weeks longer
the companies are partnering for a second pair of satellites that are due to launch aboard another spacex rocket later this year
the satellites are unique in that they are powered solely by ion propulsion , as opposed to chemical propellant that is usually favoured the rocket flies through brevard county skies in this view from melbourne after its liftoff from cape canaveral
without chemical fuel the weight of the satellites was drastically reduced , allowing both to be launched on the same rocket rather than costly separate launches
