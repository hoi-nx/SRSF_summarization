in the center of chinese 's eastern zhejiang province lies commodity city , which photographer seymour says is the largest small - commodity wholesale market in the world
the shopper 's paradise , in the city of yiwu , covers 46 million square feet and has about 62,000 booths , with 100,000 suppliers exhibiting 400,000 kinds of products
the sheer enormity of the place posed challenges for london - based seymour , who visited commodity city twice last year
" i spent a total of four days constantly walking around yiwu and would n't say i got near to seeing all of the stalls
" seymour 's " yiwu commodity city " photo project began in january 2014 , when he established both the style and content of his photos : the sellers in their environments in addition to the monotony of the market itself
when seymour returned to yiwu in august , he felt well - prepared to begin shooting
" shooting yiwu in a repetitive way , for me , becomes a very interesting way of describing the place , as each store becomes describable only by the items for sale within it , " seymour said
an estimated 40,000 visitors make their way into commodity city every day
because of the large number of visitors and their diverse backgrounds , buyers and sellers typically communicate utilizing translators that work in the market permanently
" there is a broad mix of people in yiwu , buyers and sellers come from all over the world
however just from my own experiences and those of others i spoke to , the fastest growing markets are of middle eastern and african buyers , " seymour said
orders are made in yiwu , but the factories nearby manufacture the items , so what you 're seeing in the market is actually not for sale
just as the city of yiwu is surrounded by mountains , the sellers at commodity city are boxed - in by their very own mountains of commodities
" for me there ( is ) quite a beautiful metaphor in yiwu , there is a kind of beauty in the numbness of the expressions in contrast with their colorful surroundings , perhaps highlighting the perils of untapped consumption , " seymour said
" the " yiwu commodity city " photos are part of a larger series by seymour titled " consumed , " and it was completed in collaboration with the unknown fields division , a nomadic design studio that works to show how distant landscapes connect to the rest of the world
seymour 's photos ultimately leave viewers to reflect upon the possibility that commodity city may in fact be the origin of many of the products they currently own
i 'll often see a particular item whilst walking around london and think to myself , ' i 'm sure that came from yiwu , ' " seymour said
according to chinese 's state - run news agency xinhua , more than 60 % of the world 's christmas decorations are made in yiwu and wholesaled at commodity city
