giant deer that once roamed the prehistoric british isles were thought to have been wiped out towards the end of the ice age
but scientists have discovered that irish elk lived on in siberia for around 2,000 years after it was presumed they had gone extinct
tests on bones found scattered across the frozen russia wilderness are rewriting the evolutionary history of the animal , which stood seven feet ( two metres ) tall and had majestic antlers with a 10 foot ( three - metre ) span

this image shows the skull of the large moose - like animal it had been assumed previously the moose - like animal , which was prevalent in irish and parts of continental europe , was wiped out around 10,300 years ago along with the likes of sabre - tooth cats and giant sloths
analysis of bones unearthed in siberia revealed they are just 8,800 years old and date back to about 6,800bc
it had been assumed previously the moose - like animal ( illustrated ) , which was prevalent in irish and parts of continental europe , was wiped out around 10,300 years ago along with sabre - tooth cats and giant sloths it was thought that the last habitat of the species was in western and north europe , including the british isles and scandinavia , 10,300 years ago ( marked on the map at 1 ) , but new analysis has shown that another population lived on in siberia between 8,800 and 7,900 years ago ( marked at 3 ) â previously we knew that the population of the giant deer was being dramatically reduced from about 12,000 years ago , â he said
â a distant relative of the modern - day fallow deer , the irish elk was a giant animal that lived solely on vegetation
tests on bones found scattered across the frozen russia wilderness are re-writing the evolutionary history of the animal , which stood seven feet ( two metres ) tall and had majestic antlers with a 10 foot ( three metre ) span
an antler from a giant deer is shown neither an elk nor exclusive to irish , it was given its name because the most well - preserved fossils were located in peat bogs in the country
that theory has now been confirmed by new tests on other bones and fossils uncovered across siberia over the past 15 years
a distant relative of the modern - day fallow deer , the irish elk was a giant animal that lived solely on vegetation
a fossil of its upper jaw bone is shown the next step for the scientists in russia is to compile data on every set of giant deer remains found in siberia to see if that can provide further clues to the animal 's evolution
it means the irish elk , presumed to have become extinct in europe , was alive and well in siberia thousands of years later
