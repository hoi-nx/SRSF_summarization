spirit airlines has a new fare deal and is announcing it with sex jokes
the low - cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $ 69 round - trip fares in april and may that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply
but the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy , which obliquely references a sexual act
" we 've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years , " reads the offer on spirit airlines 's website
" you ca n't object to that price point , but you certainly can object to the discount airline 's marketing strategy , which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if spirit airlines 's website was hacked , " wrote aaron rupar of kmsp in minneapolis
" spirit airlines is n't your typical airline and we do n't want to be
" the $ 69 fares must be booked by the end of the day tuesday
based in florida , spirit airlines is famous for charging fees for almost everything it possibly can
