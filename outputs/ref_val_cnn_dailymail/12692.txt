dante , the father of the italian language , is turning in his grave
believe it or not , the land where latin originated and from which many other european languages descend is becoming " illiterate
" not only have italian long forgotten the language of their roman empire , but they hardly know how to speak and write proper italian
" if you take a look at italian language forums and debate websites it 's clear that many italian are clueless on grammar and do n't even know how to use verbs properly
at age 15 , italian students rank below the oecd average literacy level and eurostat reports that italian has the lowest percentage of university graduates aged 30 - 34 in the european union
how could dante 's land become " ignorant " and will the government 's plans to institute yet another education reform succeed in turning some donkeys -- if not into nerds -- at least into smart pupils ? the decline in language skills is a trend affecting most of the western world , but the fact that this is happening in italian , home to some of the world 's oldest universities , is quite alarming
the romans built an empire united by the latin language , but italian seem to have lost such heritage
italian were once " literate " -- as in " latin - speakers and latin - writers " -- grammar - savvy , poetry lovers , rhetoric freaks and great philosophers
true , one could say italian is a tough language , one of the most complex in the world
the italian people 's declining knowledge of their language is turning into a national emergency
when i attended university , the most dreaded exam of all was the essay on italian literature and history
the loss of latin teaching in schools is at the root of the problem
learning latin assists in learning italian and other languages as well as opening the mind to all fields of knowledge
up until 1970 , latin was taught in primary and middle schools : kids learned to translate works by virgil without using a dictionary and to recite chunks of the " divine comedy " and poems by carducci , leopardi and manzoni
but today the teaching of latin is restricted to specific humanist and scientific high schools -- called gymnasiums or lyceums -- and at university level depending upon the faculty
pupils here exclusively speak in latin and are kicked - out if they get caught saying a few words in italian
a series of education reforms in the past few years has lowered the quality of teaching by reducing public resources and the hours of latin and italian language learning , which teaching unions say has had a negative impact on pupils ' text comprehension skills
latin teaching should be given more space but in a new way : not through useless translations ( what do kids care about seneca 's " treaty on birds ? " ) but through open debates and analyses on ancient texts that are still worthwhile studying today
