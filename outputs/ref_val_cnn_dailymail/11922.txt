it âs estimated that two million britons suffer from sad ( sad ) , which is caused by a lack of sunlight - and up to three times more women than men appear to be affected down here , amid the lemon trees and pink , plastic bougainvillea , it âs so tropical that i half expect barry manilow to cha - cha - cha past singing the copacabana
welcome to the cheapest winter sunspot in britons
at the flick of a switch , you can flit between mauritius , miami and bali â or , at least , their sunshine equivalents
dr daya ( pictured ) originally bought the equipment for her own use , having grown sick of britons winter as holidays go , it âs pretty convenient : no passport , no packing and the weather is guaranteed
it âs estimated that 2 million britons suffer from sad ( sad ) , caused by a lack of sunlight , with up to three times more women than men affected
symptoms include low - level depression , lack of energy and a loss of enthusiasm for life
but what if you ca nât afford to ? what if you âre trapped on this cold , damp isle until the spring , whenever that may be ? it was only when a colleague cheerfully announced that he was off to goa , in india , for a fortnight that i thought , hang on , i need some sunshine , too ! which is how i found myself slipping on my flip - flops at dr daya âs wholistic medical centre on that monday afternoon
hers is the only clinic in britons to offer a â real sunshine â room to the public
dr daya 's wholistic medical centre ( pictured ) in central london where you can experience the miami sun the equipment comes from sweden and cost dr daya Â£ 25,000 to install , which seems a lot given that you can buy a desktop light box â which beams out an assimilation of natural light â for Â£ 50
this is the full spectrum â infra - red , uva , uvb and you get the heat , whereas with sad boxes , you just get visible light
commissioned to create a sunlight tunnel for sweden car manufacturer saab to test the effects of the sun âs rays on different paints , he noticed that the factory workers liked to congregate under the sun lamps during their breaks
he realised people could get benefits from sitting under the artificial sunlight he âd created
initially , the biggest demand for sunlight rooms came from the elderly and nursing homes
the first private sunlight room was created in sweden , and there have now been 150 installations worldwide
in britons , 11 have been installed in care homes and there are three belonging to private individuals
â some people really go to town with replicating a holiday feel for their sunlight rooms , â says karl emanuelsson , the britons company representative

in britons , the average is typically less than half that , ranging from 1,364 per year in birmingham to 1,888 in eastbourne
dr daya had heard of sunlight simulators in spas and health clinics , and decided to buy one for herself
there are three settings : an hour of â bali â is the mildest , equivalent to a long sunset , while â miami â , dr daya âs favourite , is 45 minutes of full whack , then 15 minutes of winding down
she finds â mauritius â is the most popular , as it âs the strongest , so that âs what i plump for
but from october to april , 90 per cent of the britons lies too far north to have enough uvb rays in sunlight necessary to make vitamin d in the skin
and one elderly user of a nursing home sunlight room says it helps alleviate aches and pains , especially joints , and has a positive effect on his brain power â it helps him tackle the crossword much quicker
even so , i could still do with a week in mauritius
