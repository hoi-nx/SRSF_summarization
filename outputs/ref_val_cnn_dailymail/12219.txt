ferguson 's police chief is gone
protesters amassed in front of the ferguson police department on wednesday night , demanding the entire force be disbanded and calling for mayor knowles to step down
amid the protests , two officers were shot -- one in the face , the other in the shoulder
so what will it take to calm ferguson ? deray mckesson told cnn that protesters want the entire police department dissolved
on wednesday , police chief thomas jackson announced he 's stepping down , effective march 19
cnn legal analyst o'mara said the entire department needs to be gutted
" the justice department report revealing unquestionable racist bias that permeated the entire department can not be ignored , and the problems it reveals can not be fixed from the inside , " o'mara wrote
" but city officials believe the police department can be reformed without being eliminated , the mayor told reporters
" the city of ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity , " he added
" we are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness
" even if protesters get their wishes -- the resignation of knowles and the disbanding of the police department -- they still wo n't get what they originally wanted : charges against darren wilson
" there is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove darren wilson 's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety " when he shot brown , the justice department report said
darren wilson resigned from the police department in november , citing security concerns
but he remains a controversial figure in ferguson
" it 's not clear who else may resign or get fired after the critical justice department report , which said ferguson operated a vertically integrated system -- from street cop to court clerk to judge to city administration and city council -- to raise revenue through increased ticketing and fining
