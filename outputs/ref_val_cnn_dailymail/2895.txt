now , there âs a coat encrusted with leds that can flash different colours and display scrolling messages that aims to turn any mutt into a party pooch
disco dog claims to be the first led dog vest that can be controlled using a smartphone
â you can choose an animation or type in a message using our disco dog application on your smartphone , â it said on its kickstarter page
there are controls for brightness and colour , including â two - colour gradients that flow across the vest â as well as room to type words ( right ) and even a lost dog mode â it 's a fun way to celebrate your dog , and also keeps her visible and safe when it 's dark out
â if your dog runs too far away and the connection is lost , the vest will show an automatic â lost dog â message , asking bystanders to help the lost pup find her way back , â the company said
