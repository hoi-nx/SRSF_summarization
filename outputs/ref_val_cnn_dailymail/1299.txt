salmond yesterday issued a chilling demand for state control of the bbc in scotland to further the nationalist cause
the former snp leader , who is standing for parliament in the election , was accused of a naked attempt to interfere with the corp âs independence after saying it had a â metropolitan bias â that works against his party âs cause
during last year âs independence referendum campaign , hundreds of nationalist â yes â supporters held a protest outside bbc scotland in glasgow with a banner referring to the corp âs political editor that said : â sack nick â the liar â robinson
â mr salmond said : â what surprised me was the degree to which the bbc allowed themselves to be influenced by headlines in a biased press
â mr salmond also boasted about how closely he could work with miliband as the snp unveiled its support for tax hikes.scotland âs former first minister said that the party had experience in â upsetting the apple cart â , which it would deploy at westminster
mr miliband has claimed that he would not go into a formal coalition with the snp , but the nationalists yesterday backed a string of labour policies in the latest sign of how the parties could work together to push through a left - wing agenda snp deputy leader stewart hosie said : â in the next parliament , snp mps will support the re-introduction of the 50p tax rate for the very wealthiest
â he said he hoped the party would have a â huge group â of mps after may 7 that would also vote with labour to abolish the so - called bedroom tax
mr salmond yesterday said the tories â attempts to portray mr miliband as in his pocket were â fundamentally stupid â
â snp leader nicola sturgeon yesterday confirmed the party would demand an mp on each commons committee , including for devolved issues such as health and education , if it does well in the election

tory mp iain stewart said yesterday : â this is another example of labour - snp collusion
â labour shadow scottish secretary margaret curran said : â this is a naked attempt by salmond to interfere in an institution that no political party would attempt to control
