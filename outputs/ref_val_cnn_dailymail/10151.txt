cameron and osborne are at war over treasury plans to order savage new cuts in britain âs armed forces
the dispute , one of the first to erupt between the downing street neighbours , has been sparked by fears the treasury plans to slash another Â£ 1billion from the mod âs ( mod ) budget
the chancellor is refusing to guarantee to protect the armed forces from cuts after the election , saying it would undermine his attempts to reduce the britain âs debt
the dispute has been sparked by fears the treasury plans to slash Â£ 1billion from the mod âs budget - and chancellor osborne ( pictured left ) is refusing to guarantee to protect the armed forces but the prime minister fears it will damage relations with us president obama , who urged him last month not to set a bad example to other nato nations by cutting spending
the row was revealed on the eve of a tory revolt over defence in the commons this week
up to 30 conservative mps are thought to be backing a bid by john baron , mp for basildon and billericay , to force a protest vote against defence cuts
tory mps claim that if mr osborne gets his way the figure will fall below that level
and the mail on sunday has learned that the prime minister shares the rebels â worries
the prime minister fears cuts will damage relations with us president obama ( both pictured ) â the stumbling block is mr osborne not mr cameron , â said a senior conservative
â osborne has made it clear the mod can not be exempt from cuts
â one tory mp said : â mr cameron has a natural affinity with the armed forces
â but you rarely see mr osborne anywhere near a tank or battlefield
â mr cameron secretly visited the sas headquarters at hereford last week and is said to have returned more determined than ever to win his trial of strength with the chancellor
in a powerful personal plea to mr cameron during talks in washington last month , obama gave him a blunt warning : maintain britain defence spending or weaken nato
â but military top brass fear the treasury will raid another Â£ 1billion a year from mod coffers to try to balance the nation âs books
but mr osborne was defended by one influential tory who said : â we have ring - fenced overseas aid , the nhs and schools
if we do the same with the mod it will mean even bigger cuts elsewhere , such as the home office and policing
â spokesmen for mr cameron and mr osborne said there was no rift
last week we learned that raymond odierno , the top general in the army , is â very concerned â by the falling levels of our defence spending â and even suggested that britain brigades might have to operate within us divisions on future operations
