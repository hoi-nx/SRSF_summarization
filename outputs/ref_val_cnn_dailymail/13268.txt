solar impulse 2 has landed safely in oman on the first leg of its quest to be the first plane to fly around the world fueled only by the sun 's rays
the solar - powered plane took off from abu dhabi in the united arab emirates early on monday with pilot andre borschberg at the controls for the 400 - kilometer ( 250 mile ) flight
the journey was expected to take about 12 hours , but high winds of up to 11 knots delayed its landing , forcing andre borschberg to fly in a holding pattern above muscat until they dropped to safe levels
" solar impulse 2 's visit to oman is a short pit - stop on its marathon 35,000 - kilometer , five month journey across the globe , via india , myanmar , china and the u.s. the plane is expected to be on the ground for just eight hours before it takes off again -- this time with pilot bertrand piccard in charge -- bound for ahmedabad in india
by monday morning , the skies had cleared sufficiently for takeoff , though there was a slight delay while technical checks were carried out , as pilot andre borschberg explained on twitter
andre borschberg and bertrand piccard will spend a total of 500 hours behind the controls over the entire trip , taking it in turns in the tiny 3.8 - square meter single - seater cockpit
andre borschberg added : " bertrand piccard deserves to fly the last leg , and to make the arrival in abu dhabi , completing the vision he created 15 years ago
" the pair will also split ocean - flying duties : bertrand piccard will take on the five - day , five - night journey across the pacific , while andre borschberg will tackle the atlantic
