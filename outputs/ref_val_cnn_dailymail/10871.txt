murray 's campaign to defeat nigel farage struggled to get off the ground today , after being told he was too heavy to parachute into the kent seat where they are both standing for election
the comedian hoped to use the the stunt to reject claims he had been parachuted in to fight the south thanet seat for his new party fukp
but as the media gathered at headcorn aerodrome near ashford this morning he was told that because he was heavier than the 14st 7lb ( 92kg ) limit to was too big to jump
it is already the focus of huge attention due to mr nigel farage 's decision to stand there , despite ukip taking just 5.5 per cent of the votes in the seat five years ago
recent polls suggest he could be on course to win the seat
murray 's decision to stand against him has been seen as an attempt to undermine nigel farage 's pint - swilling image
fukp 's policies include bricking up the channel tunnel , locking up the unemployed and selling beer for 1p per pint
today the dejected star tried to put a positive spin on his inability to parachute into the seat , telling reporters it proved he was officially a ' political heavyweight '
murray is standing against ukip leader nigel farage , who has welcomed the addition of the comedian to the campaign , declaring : ' the more the merrier ' age : 46 born : stewkley , bucks family : father : colonel ingram murray ; great - great grandfather william thackeray education : bedford school ( boarding ) , oxford private life : twice married , father of two quote : ' where would we be without rules , eh ? that 's right , france
and where would we be with too many rules ? germany ' age : 50 born : downe , kent family : father : stockbroker guy justus oscar farage education : dulwich college ( private ) private life : twice married , father of four quote : ' we would not want to be like the swiss , would we ? that would be awful ! we 'd be rich ! ' murrary added : ' unfortunately today 's stunt - and that was exactly what it was , a stunt to garner publicity it might generate - has had to be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances
' it seems that i am too heavy to jump
murray , dressed in his trademark burgundy blazer , said : ' i 'm a true uk man - i neither cry nor weigh myself on scales
' oxford - educated murray has created an action plan in the guise of his patriotic character , in which he promises : ' i pledge that the uk will leave europe by 2025 and the edge of the solar system by 2050
' south thanet , which includes the coastal towns of ramsgate , sandwich and broadstairs , has previously enjoyed a reputation as an electoral bellwether - held at every election since 1983 by the party that has formed the government of the day .
