the first instinct is to think about the alps
but if you want to go away in february half - term - which we did - then the snowiest parts of france , italy and austria can be busy
we happened upon an alternative
fill your snow boots : norway can be an inexpensive alternative to the alps the slopes are snow - sure well into april , prices are reasonable and families are exceptionally well catered for
that 's young to start skiing , but i was told that trysil would do the trick
after an easy transfer from oslo airport , we arrived at the radisson blu , one of two ski - in ski - out hotels
it is also right by the nursery slopes - our first morning found us riding the magic carpet to ski school
easy does it : trysil can be a perfect ski destination for families with young children by the end of the week , both were skiing better than i could have hoped
trysil has four main ski areas , all with excellent nursery slopes - with easy routes down from all points
a draft half - litre of beer cost me Â£ 6.50 and a bottle of wine Â£ 35
downhill all the way : trysil has slopes for skiers all abilities , within quick reach of oslo we also took the girls dog - sledding across a beautifully scenic plateau , and our highlight of the week was a horse sleigh ride with a stop - off in a nordic yurt to cook hot dogs over an open fire
we are already thinking about going back for half - term next year
