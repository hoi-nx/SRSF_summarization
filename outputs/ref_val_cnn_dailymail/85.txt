it 's not every day that you find yourself sitting in the front row while a scantily clad dancer writhes in front of you but that is exactly what happened to the dutch ' maxima last night
the 43 - year - old royal did , however , manage to keep a straight face during the modern dance performance which took place at copenhagen 's royal library
designed to highlight dutch culture , maxima arrived for the event looking wonderful in a patriotic russet gown studded with rhinestones
eschewing her usual up - do , the mother - of - three wore her long blonde hair loose and curled for the event , which was designed to give danish and its royals a sneak peek at dutch culture
sitting on her other side during the performance was willem-alexander , who , like 46 - year - old frederik , was dapper in a dinner jacket
nonplussed : not everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves with some of the audience looking baffled glitzy : all of the royals had dressed up for the occasion , including the sequin - loving marie ( right ) scantily clad : most of the dancers chose to keep clothes to a minimum for the event round of applause : the royals , among them margrethe , politely clapped when the performance ended well done : the dancers enjoy the adulation at the end of their performance not to be outdone , 43 - year - old crown princess mary opted for a striking strapless black dress with a flattering empire - line cut
