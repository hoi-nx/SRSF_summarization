the league cup remains celtic âs achilles heel
since beating saturday 's opponents dundee united in the 1997 - 98 final , the parkhead club have won it a further four times
deila is determined to get his hands on the league cup after sunday 's final against dundee united to celtic , it âs a source of mild failure
and six scottish cups the clubs previous two managers , tony mowbray and lennon , did nât win the league cup at all and lennon âs record in cups was a source of occasional unrest
for deila , then , the first trophy of his celtic tenure would be hugely significant
â it is something we would remember for the rest of our lives , â said the norway
they are big in norway and in scottish and england
â bold and forthright , deila has publicly pledged to win a treble
managers usually play down talk of clean sweeps and banish the very words from their vocabulary
a fatalistic , superstitious streak runs through scottish football , but deila is nât having it
celtic expect to win all three domestic trophies every season
â i am very calm , â said deila with a grin
hopefully it will come on sunday - but we have so many big matches you get used to it
â if this had been a small club , the cup final would be totally crazy
â deila issues instructions to his players during the recent scottish cup quarter - final draw with dundee united in one sense he is correct
celtic have been in many cup finals , too many to mention
â in 2010 , stromsgodset beat a first division team in the final , â he recalled
the cup final is big in norway , there is only one cup and , like the fa cup , it âs the last game of the season and is always sold out
â i have seen crazy things at the cup final
â he believes celtic are favourites to win because they have the bigger squad
â kris trained yesterday ( thursday ) and looked good , â reported deila
â that celtic have the personnel is beyond doubt
dundee united manager jackie mcnamara poses with the celtic boss and the league cup at hampden so edgy and ill - tempered â and hugely enjoyable - was the scottish cup tie between these two teams at tannadice last sunday that people are already looking for â afters
warning his team to keep their discipline , deila recalled : â it was the same against rangers
â chief executive peter lawwell and deila pictured after celtic announce new agreement with new balance he locked his players away in a form of exile at their lennoxtown training ground before the rangers game and has employed similar tactics this week
the scottish league cup gets a bad press
the semi-finals were played on a hampden pitch better suited to chinese rice farmers , but a new surface has been laid for the final and deila gave it the all - clear after a brief walkabout on thursday
the prospect of a new celtic manager going for his first trophy in charge sets a new narrative for sunday
â all i do is go to lennoxtown and then go home , â said deila
