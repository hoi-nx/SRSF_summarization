with mile upon mile of untouched golden beaches , corals reefs ripe for divers , ancient artifacts and a population desperate to impress
somaliland is a country with plenty to offer tourists and it is actively encouraging visitors
but unfortunately , the much - desired tourists are not flocking to the east african outpost , neighbouring ethiopia , djibouti and somalia
for starters , the country does n't exist at all according to the international community , which recognises it only as part of somalia , the troubled nation where piracy is rife and terrorist organisation al-shabaab is based
locals walk along some of the 528 miles of beachfront in somaliland that the country is keen to promote although not officially recognised as a country , somaliland neighbours djibouti , ethiopia and somalia this association with somalia is the reason western governments such as the british and canada call the self - proclaimed independent entity and former british protectorate a no - go zone , claim locals , but this is n't stopping somaliland pushing to bring in the tourist dollar
as far as somaliland is concerned , the country has been independent since 1991 and the only thing holding it back is the fact that is n't being recognised globally
he laments the slow increase in tourists over recent years - figures differ greatly from a few hundred to more than 1000 last year - due to the ' lack of recognition , ' referring to the wait for the world to acknowledge somaliland 's existence
when the barre regime fell in 1991 , somaliland declared their still unrecognised independence
an unspoiled stretch of sand in somaliland which tourism bodies are keen for westerners to explore tourists are welcome in the unrecognised country , but are asked to respect local customs and dress modestly boats stationed off the coast of berbera , the harbour city somaliland has long relied on for its economy while not great in numbers , tourists do come
' somaliland have an 850 km coastline with lots of pristine beaches , beautiful coral reefs , unique archaeological sites , rare birds and mammals , fabulous mountain ranges , and a year - round sunny , warm climate , so we are offering a wide variety of tour opportunities that will allow everyone to experience somaliland in ways that are unique
' while foreign and commonwealth office warnings place the former british protectorate with somalia in the red zone advising against all travel , most experts say the democratically government islamic country is among the safest and most peaceful in its region
' somaliland has been functioning for 24 years , and we 've got lots of places to visit , including 850 kilometers ( 528 miles ) of beaches
somaliland 's advocates are pushing its beaches , culture and history human artifacts such as the laas geel cave paintings , which are estimated to date back to between 900bc and 3000bc
a western tourist takes pictures of the laas geel caves with artwork dating back as far as 3,000bc the caves and other historic artifacts are considered some of the most attractive lures for tourists a guide points out a depiction of a cow and explains its meaning on the walls of the laas geel rock caves a woman displays freshly designed henna tattoos on her hands on the beach in berbera berbera , the port city the national economy hinges upon , is a major draw with its quiet - meaning largely deserted - beaches and chances to snorkel and scuba dive
somaliland is also a strict islamic community , which may be a turn - off for some westerners enticed by the talk of exotic , deserted stretches of sand given the rules that come with that
bikinis are banned and a sundowner with alcohol in it is n't an option as it is illegal in somaliland
' the foreign and commonwealth office ( foreign and commonwealth office ) advise against all travel to somalia , including somaliland except for the cities of hargeisa and berbera to which the foreign and commonwealth office advise against all but essential travel , ' says the advisory for brits
' any british nationals in areas of somalia to which the foreign and commonwealth office advise against all travel should leave
