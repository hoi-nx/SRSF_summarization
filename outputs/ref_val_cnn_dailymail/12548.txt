with the ongoing protests over the shooting death by police of black teenager tony robinson in madison , wisconsin , the racist chanting of fraternity members at the university of oklahoma , and now the inexcusable shootings of two police officers in ferguson , missouri , it 's safe to say that the always - strained race relations in this country are being pushed to the breaking point
and the point with the most stress is the delicate relationship between police forces and the minority communities that they serve
president obama said on twitter , " violence against police is unacceptable
" the cbc issued a statement saying , " the cbc understands the frustrations in ferguson , but a response of violence is not the answer during this transformative moment in our country
" and attorney general eric holder noted , " this was not someone trying to bring healing to ferguson
and it 's about putting law enforcement officers in the community as welcome members of that community -- as guarantors of the safety and security of the people instead of intimidating outside forces
this approach would benefit both the community and the police
i 'm certain that officers would rather be appreciated and valued by the people they serve than be pressured to fill city coffers by issuing unnecessary citations , as noted in the doj report on ferguson
the cop on the beat is not just a quaint notion from old movies , he can be a bridge between police forces and the people they serve
lack of community policing is one of the shortcomings cited in the doj report on ferguson
both police departments and members of the community can take proactive steps to come together on more than a purely professional level
a tech services company in the south bronx recently hosted a video game competition with police officers and residents of the neighborhood
" ultimately , police should be considered members of the community -- a notion that needs to be encouraged by police departments and neighborhoods alike
communities can make the local cops part of their neighborhood celebrations
fear and mistrust among minority communities toward police are the legacy of many decades of racism , unequal treatment , bias , subjective stereotyping and lack of opportunity
