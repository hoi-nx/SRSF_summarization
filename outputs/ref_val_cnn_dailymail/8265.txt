an amusing video shows the pigs leaving the beach and paddling through the crystal clear water as they make their way towards the boat
the pigs swim to the side of the vessel and jockey for the best position as the tourists squeal in excitement
the two pigs swim over to the tourist boat and begin treading water around it before begging for food with the prospect of food and none as of yet being provided , the two animals becoming increasingly demanding as they tread the shallow water
they soon jump onto the edge of the boat , hang their trotters over the side of it and begin begging for food from those on board
jumping up onto the boat the two pigs hang their trotters over the side of it in search of a snack there they are greeted by even more of their kind and collectively make their way over to another boat in the hope of receiving even more food
