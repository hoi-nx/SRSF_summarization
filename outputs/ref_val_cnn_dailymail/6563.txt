rangi chase says he would be happy to switch to full - back for salford , revealing he grew up playing the role in rugby union
the former castleford and england stand - off won the man of steel award in 2011 for his brilliant displays with the number six on his back but an injury crisis has left the red devils without three specialist full - backs for saturday 's game against dragons in perpignan
coach harris has called up youngster jon ford in the absence of kevin locke , evalds and ben jones-bishop but admits he is considering moving chase into the full - back spot
rangi chase , pictured in action for england in 2013 , could be set to play at full - back for salford ' i 'll play wherever , ' rangi chase said
' i grew up playing full - back in rugby union , so i 'm not unfamiliar with it
' chase stepped into the full - back role towards the end of last saturday 's game against hull after evalds went off with a pulled hamstring and harris believes he could perform the role from the start against the dragons
' rangi chase is a versatile player , ' harris said
' he can play a little bit of nine if he has to , he can play in the halves , he can play at full - back
the most important thing is rangi chase being on the field
' chase was in masterful form as he steered salford to their first win of the season against hull but he admits they will be to take a step up against a dragons team who are near invincible at the stade gilbert brutus
