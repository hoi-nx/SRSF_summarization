a church official has apologised after a priest told children and parents at a melbourne primary school that jill meagher may not have met such a tragic end had she been ' more faith - filled '
3aw reported that the priest showed the congregation a picture of jill meagher , the man convicted for the melbourne woman 's brutal rape and murder , before claiming that if ms meagher 's faith had of been stronger she ' would have been home in bed ' instead of ' walking down sydney road at 3am
greg bennet apologised on behalf of the preist and said the ' offensive ' comments did not reflect the views of the church monsignor greg bennett , vicar - general of the archdiocese of melbourne , condemned the homily and said the ' offensive ' comments did not represent the views of the church
' we do not share the sentiment of the homily this morning and we certainly apologise for the hurt that this homily may have caused today , ' he told 3aw
' the reference to jill meagher in particular was offensive and inappropriate and the people of state of victoria and ireland mourn her sad and tragic death
' he said he has spoken with the priest who acknowledges that the homily was not appropriate and apologises for the ' upset ' and ' offence ' it may have caused
the revelations come amid comments from state of victoria police , spurred by the stabbing murder of masa vukotic , warning women to take reasonable precautions when walking in parks at night , and if possible avoid it all together
backlash : twitter users did n't take the ' victim blaming ' comments lightly the priest faced harsh criticism for the comments he made in front of a group of primary school children since his conviction the extent of mr jill meagher 's sordid past has come to light with revelations that he raped a dutch backpacker and a st kilda sex worker in the months leading up to the ruthless attack on ms meagher
