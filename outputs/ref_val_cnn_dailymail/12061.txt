the canadian government has come under fire for allowing the slaughter of nearly 470,000 seals as part of the biggest marine animal hunt on the planet
canada 's annual ' commercial seal hunt ' , which mainly takes place during march and april , sees thousands of young seals clubbed to death for their furs
the annual quota for the seal hunt has gone up in recent years , despite the market for seal pelts collapsing following an near world - wide ban on the furs
the seals are mainly killed for their pelts , but hunters also sell their blubber , which is used to make â seal oil â and sold as a health supplement , and the penises , which are a popular ingredient in aphrodisiacs in some asia markets
in order to avoid damage to the pelts , a majority of the seals are killed with clubs or a â hakapik â â a seal hunting tool which has a hammer head used to crush a seal 's skull , and a hook used to drag away the carcass
although hunters and the canadian government claims these methods are humane , animal rights advocates say an alarming number of the seals are skinned while alive and responsive to pain
looking for seal : bertrand oucoin from magdalen islands aboard the emy serge d for the annual seal hunt death in numbers : the 2015 seal hunt quota to 400,000 harp seals , 60,000 grey seals and 8,200 hooded seals - a total of more than 468,000 animals ' humane ' : a majority of seals are killed with clubs or a â hakapik â to the head in order to avoid damaging the pelt killing : the annual quota of seals has gone up since the nougties , despite the actual number of seals killed going down in the wake of several countries banning import of products from commercial seal hunting threats : animal rights activists are also criticising the high quotas on the base that global warming is threatening all seal species in canada as the ice , where the seals breed , is melting seal hunters are not allowed to kill seal pups which have yet to molt their downy white coat , however , this usually happens when the pup is between just ten to 21 days
as a result , an estimated 95 - 98 per cent of the seals killed during the commercial hunt are three weeks to three months old
the seal hunt quota set by the canadian government has rolled over from last season and the 400,000 harp seal allowance has remained steady since 2011 , up from in 2010 and 280,000 in 2009
the recent number of seals killed is a significant drop in numbers from the mid-to - late noughties with 218,000 harp seals killed in 2008 , 355,000 in 2006 and a jaw - dropping 366,000 in 2004
the reason for the drop in number of animals killed is a near world - wide ban of sales of the seals ' fur , which has seen the global market collapse
â the quotas are going up every year , despite opposition and the market for seal pelts disappearing , â says ottaway of the seal protection action group
