title winner neilson will this week start laying the groundwork for a crack at the premiership âs top six - as he aims to take advantage of hearts â two - month head - start over hibs and rangers
the tynecastle boss will summon in agents to draw up new deals for his out - of - contract stars in the team who wrapped up the championship title before easter , before turning his attention to luring new players for an assault on the top flight
the 34 - year - old believes that by clinching the title so early he has gained a huge advantage over rivals like hibs and rangers , who will not know until after the play - offs â which run from may 9 to june 2 â what division they will be playing in next season
neilson believes winning the scottish championship title so early has given hearts a big advantage delighted to avoid such a scenario , neilson believes alan stubbs or stuart mccall will risk miss out on landing the best players available
neilson said : â if you go into the play - offs , you âre looking at june 2 before you know if you âre going to be in the championship or the premiership
that âs a lot of time to take off your planning for the following season
with any decent players out there , if you âre having to wait until june before you can offer them a contract , the good ones will be away
hearts players throw neilson in the air after they confirmed their status as champions â we âre going to speak to the guys who are out of contract , get their agents in and see what we can do
it âs important to try and get them tied up because they have given us so much this season
we want to push to get into the top six so if that means altering the squad a little , so be it
â hearts strolled to the scottish championship title , losing just once this season , at home to falkirk in january
yet while neilson will keep faith with the core of the team who secured him his first trophy as a manager , he warned them they will need to up their game in the top flight
there are great players here , players with great potential , young guys that are doing great and some older players who have been fantastic
the hearts manager celebrates his side 's league title with club owner ann , who got a standing ovation â we âve got guys now who have won a league and that experience will set them up well for the rest of their careers
there are things we got away with this season that we wo nât get away with next season
â neilson also praised the structure at hearts in which he works as head coach under director of football craig , with chairwoman and owner ann making all the major non-football decisions
neilson believes that rangers and hibs are at a disadvantage when it comes to preparing for next season â long gone are the days when a manager makes financial decisions about what direction the club âs going to go in
