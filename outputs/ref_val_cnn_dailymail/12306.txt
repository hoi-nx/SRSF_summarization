a michigan woman lost her planet fitness membership over the " inappropriate " manner in which she complained about a transgender woman in the locker room , a gym spokeswoman said
rather , it was the manner in which she expressed her concerns that club management felt was inappropriate , resulting in the cancellation , gosselin said
she went to the front desk after someone who looked like a " man " entered the women 's locker room while she was changing
" i wanted to know why there was a man in the women 's locker room , " she told cnn
" if you have male parts you do n't need to be in the women 's locker room
i am uncomfortable with you as a male in my locker room , in my restroom
" she returned to the gym monday , tuesday , wednesday and thursday " to get the word out " to other women that they " let men in the women 's locker room , " she said
" every day i said ' just so you know , there 's a man they allow in this locker room and they do n't tell you that when you sign up , ' " she said
yvette cormier said planet fitness needs to do a better job of informing members of its policy allowing members to use whichever locker room corresponds with their gender identity , which refers to a person 's psychological identification as a man , woman or another gender
" the manner in which this member expressed her concerns about the policy exhibited behavior that management at the midland club deemed inappropriate and disruptive to other members , which is a violation of the membership agreement and as a result her membership was canceled , " gosselin said in a statement on behalf of planet fitness
planet fitness has the right to allow members to use whichever locker room corresponds with their gender identity , alison gill , senior legislative council for the human rights campaign , told mlive
" a transgender woman would be much more at risk for her safety if she had to use the men 's bathroom , " he said
