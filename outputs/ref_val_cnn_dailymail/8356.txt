for the first time in a decade , astronomers have found dwarf galaxies orbiting the milky way - an unprecedented nine in total
they range in distance from 95,000 to 1.2 million light - years , and each contain far fewer stars than our galaxy
crucially , though , the dwarf galaxies could help test theories of dark matter and perhaps bring us a step closer to detecting the elusive particles
move the slider below to see an image of the southern sky before and after the new dwarf galaxies are added astronomers have found nine new dwarf galaxies in orbit around the milky way
this image shows the previously known magellanic clouds with six of the nine newly discovered dwarf galaxies above the paranal observatory in chile the discovery was made by a team of astronomers at the university of cambridge using data from the dark energy survey , a five - year project to photograph the southern sky in extreme detail
the nine dwarf galaxies were spotted in the night sky in the southern hemisphere , near the large and small magellanic cloud , which are the largest dwarf galaxies in the milky way 's orbit
astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy , making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light - years wide
â the newly discovered objects are each a billion times dimmer than the milky way , and a million times less massive
dwarf galaxies are the smallest galaxy structures in the universe , and can contain as few as 5,000 stars - whereas the milky way has around 200 billion
importantly , though , they are thought to contain 99 per cent dark matter and just one per cent observable matter
â dwarf satellites are the final frontier for testing our theories of dark matter , â said dr vasily belokurov of the institute of astronomy , one of the study âs co-authors
â the newly discovered objects are each a billion times dimmer than the milky way , and a million times less massive.this makes them incredibly difficult to find , even in our galactic neighbourhood
on the left in these images is eridanus 2 , in the middle is pictoris 1 and on the right is horologium 1 these dwarf galaxies are the first to be discovered after dozens were found in 2005 and 2006
the closest of the newly discovered dwarf galaxies is being torn apart by the milky way , while the most distant is about to start being pulled in towards us
known as camargo 438 and 439 , the two clusters were found 16,000 light - years below the flattened disk of the milky way
