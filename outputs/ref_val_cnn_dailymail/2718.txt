police , midwives and campaigners remain confused over whether s o - called designer vagina operations fall within female genital mutilation laws , a group of mps have said
the government has previously said the act does not contain any exemptions for cosmetic surgery and it has no plans to amend the legislation specifically to prohibit female genital cosmetic surgery
but in a report on fgm , the committee said despite government reassurances there is still confusion and the act should be amended to make it clear female genital cosmetic surgery would be a criminal offence if conducted on girls under 18 without physical or mental health justification
the government says it has no plans to amend the fgm act specifically to prohibit female genital cosmetic surgery committee chair keith vaz said : ' the law relating to female genital cosmetic surgery is ambiguous and must be clarified
' the number of cosmetic genital surgeries - or labiaplasties - performed by the nhs has risen five-fold since 2001 , with 2,000 operations being carried out in 2010
however , many operations are performed in private clinics , which do not have to submit statistics to the government
labiaplasty is the most common form of cosmetic genital surgery and involves reducing the size of the labia so they do not protrude
it is feared that the rise in demand for cosmetic genital surgery is a result of what doctors have called ' unrealistic representations of vulval appearance in popular culture '
keith vaz said ' the law relating to female genital cosmetic surgery is ambiguous and must be clarified ' the first prosecution under the fgm act resulted in a not - guilty verdict when dr dhanuson dharmasena was cleared of performing the illegal procedure on a woman in a london hospital
mr keith vaz said : ' the dpp informed the committee that she could only prosecute on the basis of evidence , the police said that they could only investigate on the basis of referral , and the health professionals told us that they could not refer cases because their members were not fully trained and aware of the procedure
more than 2,603 women and girls who went through fgm have been treated by the nhs since september 2014 with 499 women and girls with fgm seen in acute nhs trusts in england in january alone
crime prevention minister lynne featherstone said : ' female genital mutilation is a crime and it is child abuse
