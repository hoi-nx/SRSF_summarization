the right - hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 march will travel over europe projection : place a pinhole or small opening in a card , and hold it between the sun and a screen â giant sheet of white paper works â a few feet away
on a mobile device : if the indiegogo project is successful , you could stream a 360 degree , hd view of the eclipse onto a mobile device
the eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in london - and around 94 per cent in glasgow , aberdeen and edinburgh
in london , the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will start at 8.45am gmt. the maximum eclipse will hit at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. by 10.41am the moon will leave the sun 's edge and the partial eclipse will end
