bosses at trendy clothing firm american apparel have been rapped for a ' too sexy ' advert showing a female model wearing a ' thong bodysuit '
the firm , which has more than 270 stores across the world , regularly has its raunchy ads banned by the asa ( asa )
this american apparel advert featuring an underage - looking model has been banned by the asa and this week , the asa again banned an advert showing a flame - haired model wearing a Â£ 30 spandex thong bodysuit covered with lipstick prints
one person had complained to the asa saying they believed the model in question looked under the age of 16 and that it was ' irresponsible and offensive ' as it ' sexualised a model ' who appeared to be underage
bosses at the asa said that despite american apparel saying the model was 20 years old , she looked ' youthful ' and that the ad was irresponsible
' the model was shown looking back at the camera over her shoulder with her buttocks visible
the campaign featured more than one picture of the girl in the bodysuit to ' [ depict ] the thong from various angles ' ' we considered that readers were likely to interpret the model 's expression and pose as being sexual in nature
' we told american apparel ( uk ) ltd to ensure future ads did not include images that inappropriately sexualised young women or were likely to cause serious offence
last september , a campaign for the fashion brand american apparel has been banned for â sexualising school - age girls â
â last year , the fashion company got in trouble for this picture of a ' schoolgirl ' leaning over a car door the campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground , revealing her crotch and underwear , while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh - skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show
