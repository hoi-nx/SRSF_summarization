the new head of the secret service has admitted he has agents with a drinking problem after two were accused of crashing their car while drunk at the white house
clancy , newly - installed director of the agency , made the admission in a stormy session in front of congress as he tried to get their approval to build a replica white house for agents to practice protecting the president
he was told his answers were ' hogwash ' , berated for the string of failures by the secret service , and when he said he had to build the ' trust ' of his employees , told bluntly by republican chris stewart : ' dude , you do n't have to earn their trust
you 're their boss ! ' clancy also admitted he did not know about the crash for five days , and said the two staff were still being fully paid and had not yet been disciplined , although they were on administrative rather than active duty
the hearing itself was to be an exploration of clancy 's budget request for the 2016 fiscal year - including the $ 8 million he is asking for to build a scale replica white house
but ' the 800 - pound gorilla in the room , ' as homeland security subcommittee chairman rep. carter said , was ' what happened the other night at the white house
worse , they appeared to have driven over a ' suspicious package ' that their fellow agents were in the process of investigating

' there 's an element within our agency that does cope with stresses ... by using alcohol , ' clancy said , noting that the agency recently launched an initiative to address stress
' porous border ? an early march off - duty party led to an incident where the agents drove through an active crime - scene investigation and crashed through a white house barrier panel members were impatient when clancy insisted he had to wait to impose discipline until his agency 's inspector general competed its own investigation
what do you think ? ' clancy suggested he had to earn agents ' trust as the new director of the agency , earning a scathing response from carter
' secure ? the secret service has come under fire after a series of embarrassing incidents that call into question its performance protecting the white house and the first famil grilled : clancy insisted that the allegedly drunk - driving officers have been moved to desk duty , but congressmen want them fired clancy 's budget request included $ 8 million to build a scale model of the white house in a maryland suburb for training purposes , in the hope that other institutional face - palm moments might not repeat themselves
in the last year a series of fence jumpers have made it onto white house grounds , including one who breached the building itself while carrying a knife in his pocket
' the secret service currently uses a rudimentary , not - to - scale simulation of the north grounds of the white house , using bike barricades to act as the fencing , ' clancy said
' the carbon copy of america 's presidential mansion , if congress approves , would be built in beltsville , maryland , about 20 miles from the real white house , on 500 acres that already serve as a secret service training site
