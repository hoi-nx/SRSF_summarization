hillary clinton made it clear tuesday that when it comes to her emails , which traveled through a private server during her time at the state department , we 'll all just have to trust -- and she 'll verify
using strong language , the former secretary of state insisted that despite concerns from both sides of the aisle on issues including national security , accountability and transparency , there 's simply nothing to see here
as for everyone else , the question is n't whether clinton did enough tuesday to satisfy house republicans , who will no doubt continue to hammer her on decisions she made while at state
nor is it whether she did enough to satisfy republicans voters , who have a crystallized view of clinton that goes all the way back to the ' 90s
the audience for whom this press conference mattered most was democratic and independent voters , who may admire hillary clinton , but as history has proved , simply can not be counted on to vote for her in 2016 , especially if someone else comes along on her left
remember , clinton was n't defeated in 2008 by republicans
instead of insisting she did nothing wrong and smugly placating nosy reporters , she should have promised these voters that transparency and accountability -- two words she did n't utter tuesday -- are the cornerstones of good government and any future administration she were to run
she should have assured them that the rules do apply to her , just like anyone else , and that in the future she 'll pay closer attention to them
finally , she should have told them that the last thing she wants is to take the trust of the voters for granted , and that she 'll comply with any independent investigation that 's offered
but if clinton wants 2016 to turn out differently than 2008 , she and her surrogates ca n't keep insisting to voters that she is above scrutiny .
