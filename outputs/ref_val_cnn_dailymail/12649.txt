i was finishing my studies when the war began four years ago
i had only two subjects remaining before i graduated from university with a degree in english literature
since i was 10 years old , i have loved english and dreamed of becoming a teacher
they are syrian 's future , and they deserve our significant investment
three years ago , my family was forced to flee our home near damascus , in east ghouta
we stayed in syrian for the next year , moving from one house to another , from one village to another
i 've thought of returning to syrian
when we arrived in jordan , i thought i would return soon to syrian -- in only a few weeks
it 's been two years
and while i still hope to go home one day , my biggest question is : " when ? " i want to return so that i can teach
i think it 's rare for a teacher to instill this so passionately in her students , but i want to try
although i hope to follow in my teacher 's footsteps , my path for now is blocked by the uncertainty of living far from home , by a war that has driven me here , by tuition costs in jordan that are prohibitively expensive
as a syrian refugee , it is nearly impossible to get permission to be officially employed , and i 've no money to complete my studies
in syrian , i was responsible to my parents , now i am responsible for them
while most syrian are not permitted to work , we can volunteer
i found a role with the poverty - fighting organization care in the urban refugee center in east amman , jordan , where i earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work
i want to complete my education -- and reclaim my dream of teaching syrian children
one day , i will tell them of the crisis we faced in the syrian that i left
when those rights are stifled , so , too , is a person 's potential , her opportunities , her power to create a better world , and in my case , a better syrian
