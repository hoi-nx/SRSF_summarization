whether it 's during a speech or in a meeting , helpless laughter is one of our most insightful behaviours , according to neuroscientist sophie scott
in a recent ted in vancouver , professor scott revealed that laughter often is n't to do with comedy value , but with our relationships with others
laughter is often used as a tool for social bonding rather than in reaction to something that has comedy value , according to university college london professor sophie scott
pictured are prime minister david cameron and us president barack obama during a basketball game according to david robson at bbc , scott 's study of people in namibians revealed that laughter is a key cultural mechanism that helps social bonding
when scott asked indigenous namibians and english people to listen to recordings of each other and describe the emotions , laughter was the most recognisable
' people genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people 's jokes , but within a conversation , the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking , ' she told the bbc
the university college london professor 's current research aims to distinguish the difference between fake laughs used during conversation , and involuntary giggles
laughter activates the brain 's mirror regions that mimic other 's actions , and she says this is the reason behind why laughing can be so contagious so far , her research has found that volunteers were almost always able to identify a false laugh
fake laughter triggers more brain activity â in the medial prefrontal cortex , associated with problem - solving â as we try to work out why the person is doing it
but both activate the brain 's mirror regions that mimic other 's actions , and she says this is the reason behind why laughing can be so contagious
' you are 30 times more likely to laugh if you 're with someone else , ' she claims
' sometimes people think that laughter is a ridiculous , trite , pointless topic to research â¦ i think it 's a fascinating social behaviour , it is essential to study
dr mcgettigan said : ' it 's fascinating to consider the way our brain is able to detect genuine happiness in other people
