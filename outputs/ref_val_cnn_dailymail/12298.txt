the president repeated an unfortunate and ill - fated claim while campaigning hard for obamacare
" with that false sloganeering , barack obama made sure he thoroughly owned a piece of the scorn spawned every time an insurance company changed or canceled plans after the obamacare became law
republican leaders are stepping up to offer woefully inadequate stand - ins for obamacare
they 're offering these salves because they 're hoping the supreme court issues a death blow to the federal exchanges that are now facilitating health coverage in 37 states and they want to have a possible alternative
there is plenty of potential the case , king v. burwell , will succeed in halting the insurance subsidies that federal exchanges require to function
a collection of three congressmen , including senate finance committee chair hatch ( r-utah ) , recently acknowledged the dire need for an alternative in the wake of obamacare 's demise and issued a " blueprint " that nods toward some of the key concepts
the plan effectively kills universal access by offering people a one - time chance to sign up for coverage , and it does n't require that anyone obtain coverage , making the individual insurance market unsustainable yet again as primarily those who already know they 're in ill health will flood the market and premiums will become unaffordable
while this outline potentially salvaged some semblance of the broad health care access the obamacare is achieving , senator hatch showed his hand with a subsequent washington post op - ed he shared with two other senators
insisting that " republicans have a plan to help americans harmed by the administration 's actions , " you might be forgiven if you did n't realize the harm was simply enforcing one 's civic duty to purchase affordable health insurance
the senators would generously allow states to develop their own plans , something only the intellectual powerhouse of massachusetts managed to accomplish prior to the obamacare
with most of the affected 37 states having one or more government branches controlled by a party that preferred the status quo prior to the obamacare , such state - level innovation is n't likely
jindal actually thinks the supreme court 's potential decision against the obamacare presents republicans with an electoral " solution " -- the chance to bask in the glory earned by a massive tax cut
the white house got a bit desperate in the run up to obamacare , that much is clear from the poor vetting they applied to president 's own stock stump speeches
it surprised everyone involved with debating and covering the obamacare at the time of its passage , including the lawyers behind this suit , to learn the bill erroneously specifies only state - run exchanges can dole out subsidies
the case is driven by a small nonprofit outfit called the competitive enterprise institute , which while it has tentacles throughout the republican establishment , means that the case itself , at one point , could n't be blamed as the republican 's own strategy
we suffered a rocky transition into the obamacare , no question , but hospital systems , providers and patients are just now getting the lay of the land
in rehabilitation medicine , we 're seeing that serious injuries that once blocked access to insurance are no longer a barrier
