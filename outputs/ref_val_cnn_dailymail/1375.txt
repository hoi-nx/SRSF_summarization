the so - called â health tourism gap â between the amount the nhs collects from eu patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from britons has soared to almost Â£ 700million hospitals â failure to claw back the cost of treating europeans is costing taxpayers millions of pounds a week , figures suggest
the so - called â health tourism gap â between the amount the nhs collects from eu patients and the total hospitals on the continent receive from britons has soared to almost Â£ 700million
it means the britons is now paying out Â£ 15 for the healthcare costs of britons who fall ill abroad for every Â£ 1 it gets back for the nhs treatment of europeans visitors
the prime minister and health secretary have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra Â£ 500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18
released following a freedom of information request , they show that in 2013/14 , britons taxpayers handed Â£ 749.8million to europeans governments to pay for the care of britons citizens abroad
but in the same period , the nhs managed to collect only Â£ 50.3million from europeans countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here
figures which emerged at the weekend show the nhs is still chasing at least Â£ 62million of unpaid bills for foreigners â care

â prime minister david cameron , left , and health secretary jeremy hunt , right , have pledged to introduce tough new measures to recoup an extra Â£ 500million from foreigners annually by 2017/18 part of the gap is due to the fact that so many britons pensioners retire to the continent
there may also be more tourists from britons travelling to mainland europeans than the other way round
but there are more than a million migrant workers from the eu here , against far fewer britons employed in other europeans countries
under eu arrangements , britons citizens can be treated by other nations â health services and the bill is sent back to britons
in theory , these europeans nations should also be billed when their citizens are treated by the nhs
in 2013/14 , the britons paid ireland Â£ 246million for treating britons who fell ill there
a department of health spokesman said : â we want international visitors to feel welcome to use the nhs , provided they pay for it â just as families in the britons do through their taxes
â our authorities must do better to claw back the amount owed by visitors
