the premier league has been the loudest opponent of the world cup in qatar switching to a winter tournament â staged from november 21 to december 18 â that will be rubber - stamped at the fifa exco meeting in zurich on friday
the premier league is resigned to that decision being a formality since the opinions of premier league chief executive richard scudamore and other european leagues chiefs were virtually ignored at the task force summit in qatar which recommended a november - december competition
the dates from the world cup in qatar are expected to be confirmed on friday in zurich qatar will host the world cup in the winter despite opposition from uefa 's big leagues instead , the premier league and their european counterparts will be concentrating on winning concessions for such a disruption to their calendar
the premier league will also be wanting talks about cutting international friendlies , fa replays and two - legged football league semi-finals in that season
however , a december 18 finish would see the premier league restart on boxing day
premier league chief executive richard scudamore has been among the loudest critics of a winter world cup the global sporting director summit at the etihad stadium on april 29 has attracted former england cricket managing director hugh morris , who hardly put a foot wrong during his low - profile tenure that included three ashes victories , as well as paul downton , who has nât put a foot right since taking charge in january 2014
if the beleaguered paul downton were to take any advice from hugh morris he would surely be told to do his work behind the scenes rather than at centre stage all the time
hugh morris ( left ) and paul downton ( right ) will both be at the global sporting director summit in april the football league are certainly in the right place if they were ever to be worthy of news at ten attention
