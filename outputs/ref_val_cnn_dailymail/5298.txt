giant â cannibal â slugs are set to wreak a trail of destruction in gardens across britain , experts have warned
two mild winters in a row have created the perfect conditions for spanish slugs - an horrific , aggressive species which grows up to six inches long - to expand their territory
the species , nicknamed the cannibal slug because of its tendency to feast on the remains of dead relatives , was first spotted in this country in 2012
the giant spanish slug , pictured , was first spotted in the britain in 2012 and is now starting to take hold sightings have since been reported in norfolk , suffolk , essex , kent , london and hampshire
but this year it is expected to tighten its hold on the country and spread even further
dr bedford , the expert who first identified the species three years ago , warned that it is likely to thrive after two very mild winters
â if this warm weather continues and we do not have any cold spells before may we could see very high numbers of the spanish slug this year , â he said
the winter of 2012/13 saw several cold snaps , blizzards and frosts , which hit the new population of spanish slugs hard
slug expert dr bedford , pictured , said britain was on course for record numbers of spanish slugs the slug , pictured , is not able to survive extremely cold winters and frozen conditions the spanish slugs , which are thought to have made it to the britain mainland on imported vegetables , have been recorded feeding on dead mice , meat and each other and can withstand up to 20 slug pellets
â if they spread it could really affect britain farmers
we found in 2012 that farmers were having to replant oil seed rape because of these slugs
