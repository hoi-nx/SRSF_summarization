the world âs leading authority on the detection of banned performance - enhancing drug epo in blood says a particularly low level of the substance is explicable only by renal damage or doping â a conclusion that raises fresh doubts over historic alleged doping by a current staff member at team sky
as mail on sunday reported last week , court documents in french show that an expert at a 2001 criminal trial concluded from a blood sample taken from a dutch rider , knaven , that he had taken artificial epo
knaven has been a â directeur sportif â with vital strategic responsibilities at team sky since 2011 and was a 27 - year - old rider with dutch team tvm when the sample was taken during the 1998 tour de france
dave brailsford , former director sean yates and knaven ( second right ) with bradley wiggins in 2012 - a 1998 sample from knaven showing an epo level of 0.7 was used to convict traffickers in a french court the technical paperwork relating to his blood tests carried out by an expert , francoise bressolle , showed an epo level of 0.7
team sky say their own unnamed experts , paid by them to examine documents unearthed by the mos , have exonerated knaven of any wrongdoing , for reasons unspecified
knaven was never on trial and therefore did not have an opportunity to challenge the medical evidence ; rather his tests and testimony were used to convict epo traffickers
now robin parisotto , who invented the first ever blood tests to detect epo , has told the mos : â the only known causes of such a low epo level in blood [ 0.7 ] is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys can not sustain normal production of natural / endogenous epo and / or the current and previous administration of recombinant [ banned ] epo
â directeur sportif for team sky knaven signed a police statement in 1998 saying he did not contest the epo finding
he said he believed it may have been due to â great exertion â , which expert robin parisotto team sky did not answer our specific questions but gave this statement : â this relates to events over 15 years ago that were contested and well documented at the time
nothing here , including the new medical opinion , causes us , or the experts , to change our view
knaven continues to maintain his innocence and to be a valued member of team sky
' the mos has asked knaven and team sky if knaven had renal damage at the 1998 tour de france
robin parisotto says : â i do nât think that â great exertion â is a plausible explanation for such a low epo level
â french court documentsno 1 : this is an extract from the court expert âs summary , specifically in relation to knaven âs blood and his epo level , saying in her opinion this was a result of the â feedback â phenomenon where the body is now producing such low levels of epo as it had recently stopped taking artificial epo
â no 2 : an extract from the official court summary of the case showing expert witness bressolle had concluded epo use by four of the tvm riders , from blood samples
he says : â i do not dispute this rate [ of 0.7 ]
last week we revealed that mail on sunday had unearthed a collection of documents , never published or reported before , containing detail about the involvement of knaven , team sky âs sporting director , in one of cycling âs major doping scandals
he says the testing francoise bressolle did on knaven âs blood remains credible , concluding : â the only known causes of such a low epo level in blood is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys can not sustain normal production of natural / endogenous epo and / or the current and previous administration of recombinant epo
â did knaven have renal damage at the tour de france in 1998 ? if not , what is his own explanation for that epo reading , which he did not contest as accurate in a signed police statement in 1998 ? question 2 knaven âs urine from july 28 1998 showed irregular levels of a banned drug , cortisone
would team sky today , with a zero - tolerance policy , accept the rider âs explanation â i do nât know how it got there â as a valid defence ? question 3 who are the three â independent world - class â experts cited in team sky âs statement of march 7 who say the court documents are no proof of doping ? question 4 the evidence provided last week by the mos , and studied by these experts , was accepted as valid in a criminal court case where three defendants were given prison sentences in verdicts , never appealed
is it true the experts did nât know the papers related to knaven ? ( his name appears across the papers ) if so , why not ? question 6 knaven explicitly told police in 1998 he had no medical conditions requiring treatment with prescription drugs , yet admitted use of one prescription drug , persantin â a blood thinner â and tested positive for another , naftidrofuryl
