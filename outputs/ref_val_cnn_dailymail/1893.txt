a mother - of - one has told of the horrifying moment she and her family checked into a hotel room on the nsw ' central coast , which she described as a ' crime scene '
sydney woman melanie , her partner and seven - year - old son booked two nights at the apollo resort in wamberal from february 13 to attend a friend 's wedding on booking.com
the cost of staying at the resort was $ 285 in total
melanie and her family checked into the apollo resort in wamberal , nsw and found two pairs of dirty underwear the first signs of trouble came when the young family were escorted to their room up ' terribly old - looking staircase ' and saw the dirty marks on the walls of the ' dimly lit hallway ' , which scared melanie 's son
when they walked into their room the trio found an empty syringe packet on the floor , white stains on the floor and two pairs of dirty underwear in the bin
the family also found an empty syringe packet on the floor near the bed inside the room when they lifted up the sheets they found dry rice stuck to the blanket ' out on the grubby balcony , there was a bottle cap on the ground from the previous guest , cigarette ash and dirt all over the ground , dirty tiles and incredibly cheap furniture - not a " resort " by any means , ' she said
' a strong smell of bleach wafted into the room , which melanie assumed must of been from the ' green and un-swimmable ' pool as described by other tripadvisor reviews
there were also white stains on the carpet
melanie described the room as a ' crime scene ' the window sills were covered in dirt and dust , and looked like they had not been cleaned in a long time the final straw was the airconditioner in the room , which smelt ' terrible ' when it was turned on
our son has bad asthma so we turned it straight off and took a photo of it on my phone , ' melanie said
' then melanie 's partner found two pairs of underwear in the bin - a ' very worn - out pair of male jocks and a torn , small pink female g - string '
but owners of the hotel told news.com.au their staff cleaned rooms every day
the saga of her trouble with apollo resort did not end there for melanie who left the same day she checked - in
despite being told by the manager of the hotel she would not be charged a cancellation fee of $ 285
melanie found a used mini bottle of body wash on the soap dish inside the shower there was brown scaling that had not been cleaned up at the bottom of the toilet on the way up to the room , a dirty hand mark was seen on the wall of the hall way ' this seemed like a kick in the face from the nightmare we experienced
