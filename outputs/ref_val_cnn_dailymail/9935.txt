cia director brennan has ordered a sweeping overhaul of the spy agency , aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into traditional intelligence gathering brennan announced the restructuring to the cia workforce friday
he said the move comes after nine outside experts spent three months analyzing the agency 's management structure , including what deputy cia director cohen called ' pain points , ' organizational areas where the cia 's bureaucracy does not work efficiently
not your grandparents ' cia : the cia is launching one of the biggest reorganizations in its history , aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations into intelligence gathering critical look : cia director brennan said the changes are necessary to address intelligence gaps that the cia is not covering ' there are a lot of areas that i would like to have better insight to , better information about , better access to , ' brennan said
' on the cyber front , the cia chief said he is establishing a new ' directorate of digital innovation ' to lead the agency 's efforts to track and take advantage of advances in cyber technology
us officials said that brennan decided the agency had to increase the resources and emphasis it devoted to cyberspace because advanced communications technology is rapidly becoming pervasive
' pitfall : evidence shows that the cia may have taken too long to find and kill osama bin laden - a mission that was accomplished in 2011 after a decade - long manhunt brennan avoided the term ' cyber , ' a word used by the national security agency , the country 's premier digital spying service the changes come against a backdrop of widespread concern that the cia 's focus on hunting and killing terrorists since the september 11 attacks has led to an erosion of the espionage and analytic capabilities the agency built during the cold war
the agency 's greatest public success of recent years â the 10 - year effort to locate and kill osama bin laden in 2011 â may have taken longer than it should have , according to evidence made public in the recent senate report on cia interrogations
internal cia surveys have cited bad management and bureaucratic frustration as factors in driving talent away from the agency
in the most significant departure , the cia would break down the wall between the operations and analytical arms , a system that typically has required the case officers who recruit spies and run covert operations to work for different bosses , in different offices , than analysts who interpret the intelligence and write briefing papers for the president and other policymakers
the new plan would blend practitioners of those separate disciplines into 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world
under the new plan , each center would be run by an assistant director who would be responsible for the entire intelligence mission within that jurisdiction , including covert operations , spying , analysis , liaison with foreign partners and logistics
most stations are in us embassies , and various cia case officers in embassies may be working on different missions for different centers
the changes do not require congressional approval and will be undertaken within the cia 's current budget , cia officials said
blended : the new overhaul plan would bring cia operatives and data analysts together in 10 centers devoted to various subjects or areas of the world the head of the cia 's operation arm retired abruptly in january after voicing concerns about the plan , say two former cia officials who know him but spoke on condition of anonymity because they were n't authorized to discuss internal agency matters
' but he is changing some names , including restoring the old moniker ' directorate of operations , ' to the spying arm , the name it had before being rebadged the directorate of operations in 2005
