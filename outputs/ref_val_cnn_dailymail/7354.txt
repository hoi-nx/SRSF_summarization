enriquez is currently serving two life sentences for murder.the black hand tattooed on his chest is the symbol of the mexican mafia the lapd used an invalid court order and spent $ 22,000 to bring an imprisoned killer and former gang leader to speak to an exclusive dinner for business executives , according to a report released friday
in all , 38 lapd employees worked about 320 hours to prepare for the january event at a downtown building and protect rene ' the boxer ' enriquez , 52 , while he was there , the inspector general of the city 's police commission wrote
what 's more , the department did n't have authority in the first place to remove enriquez from custody because it used an order from a 2012 murder case that has been closed â and in any case only allowed his release to act as a witness â the departmental watchdog 's report said
enriquez , an ex-mexican mafia leader who has been in prison since 1993 and is serving two life sentences for murder , has gained allies in law enforcement
californian governor jerry brown has acknowledged enriquez 's past cooperation with authorities but denied him parole last month , saying his history of violence meant he still presented ' an unreasonable danger to society if released '
formed in the californian prison system in the 1950s , the mexican mafia has a reputation for extreme violence
enriquez worked his way up from enforcer to a leader in the organization - which is also known as mexican mafia - before his arrest and conviction
after the january event , los angeles police commission president steve soboroff has called for an investigation into the incident and called the episode ' embarrassing '
the lapd used an invalid court order and spent $ 22,000 to bring enriquez , pictured in an undated file photo , to speak to an exclusive dinner for private executives , according to a report released friday he called the lapd 's involvement in the event as ' very , very misconceived and surprising ' and a ' giant waste of public resources '
in recent years , enriquez had talked to various groups of officers and provided valuable information on the transnational criminal enterprise to which he once belonged , lapd deputy chief michael downing said in the days after the event
according to the report , a commanding officer at lapd characterized the event in december as a law - enforcement training session in asking beck to approve the use of department resources , which he did
four lapd officers attended , as did ten other ' high - ranking law - enforcement executives ' from other agencies
los angeles police commission president steve soboroff called the episode in which enriquez was given a police escort ' embarrassing ' once the handcuffs were removed , enriquez explained who he was and how the mexican mafia worked
nbc news reported that a source who attended the session said enriquez had the air of a ' corporate leader ' who provided ' a rare look into life of a criminal corporate executive '
in 1993 , enriquez pleaded guilty to two counts of second - degree murder and two counts of attempted murder and is serving life in prison
' that 's how you carry yourself in the mexican mafia - you walk into a room and everybody knows you 're a leader
