robson has paid smalling a huge compliment by likening his recent performances to those of mcgrath and gary pallister
five years after signing for united , smalling is yet to convince many united fans he and phil jones are suitable long - term replacements for nemanja vidic and rio ferdinand , who left old trafford last summer after long and distinguished careers
united defender smalling ( centre ) has impressed robson in recent weeks robson believes smalling 's passing has been ' crisper ' during his displays against arsenal and newcastle smalling , already on a booking , showed a complete lack of composure by hacking down james milner in the corner to earn his second yellow and united went on to lose 1 - 0 against a city team that was there for the taking
his commanding performance in last week 's 3 - 0 victory over tottenham caught robson 's eye and the former united captain thinks that bodes well for louis van gaal ahead of sunday 's trip to anfield
robson said : ' smalling is a good defender
the end product was not good enough to suggest van gaal has a new beckenbauer in his squad just yet , but robson was so impressed by smalling 's confidence that he felt moved to liken the centre - back to two united greats in gary pallister and mcgrath
smalling kept a close eye on tottenham striker harry kane during united 's win against tottenham the former lifted 10 trophies at united and the latter would have won much more than the 1985 fa cup had he not fought a long - running battle with alcoholism which eventually cost him his place at the club
' mcgrath could do that and so could gary pallister , ' robson said when invited to liken smalling 's display to a figure from the past
robson has compared smalling to former united defender mcgrath smalling has also been compared with gary pallister ( left , pictured with peter schmeichel in 1996 ) ' it 's a great feeling know that people are taking notice , ' smalling said
robson thinks victory against liverpool would deliver a significant blow to the reds ' top - four hopes and is not ruling out a second - place finish for united , who trail city by just two points after their loss at burnley last weekend
