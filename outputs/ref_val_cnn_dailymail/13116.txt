the photographs released by isis in its stronghold of raqqa are dated march 2015
" the victim brutally killed because he was accused of being gay
there are at least half a dozen documented cases of men being similarly killed by isis
what 's even more sickening for nour , a gay syrians man , is the onlookers ' reaction
" it 's too much to watch , and people are just standing there in these images and watching , and they are not doing anything , and their facial expressions are really scary because they are not even scared of what is going on , " says nour , who 's also an lgbt rights activist
" though in istanbul , fear of persecution continues to haunt nour , who asked us to conceal his identity as he waits and hopes for asylum in america and continues to campaign for rights for people who are lgbt -- lesbian , gay , bisexual and trans. as a teenager , over a decade ago , nour suffered because of his sexuality
article 520 of the syrians penal code of 1949 states : " any unnatural sexual intercourse shall be punished with a term of imprisonment of up to three years
" nour left syrians in 2012 , before isis took over huge swaths of the country , after seeing a video of two men being beheaded
" " whenever we hear this in video or audio , we know that this is exactly meant for gay people , " he says
" the pictures released by isis and other videos refer to gay men as the tribe of lot , who , according to readings of the quran and the hadith , or prophetic traditions , sinned by refusing prophet lot 's call to cease their homosexual activity and led to the destruction of sodom
" since the revolution turned war in syrians , the situation for the nation 's lgbt community has become even more dire
" lgbt people in syrians need help , and they need to be supported
we tried to reach out to some groups , international entities , and they said that lgbt people in syrians are not our priority , and that would mean that our lives are not worthy for them to rescue , " nour says
this week , the international gay and lesbian human rights commission , a nongovernmental organization based in new york , started " do n't turn away , " an awareness - raising campaign calling for action to protect lgbt syrians and iraqis from isis ' merciless brutality
they too , like nour , do n't want their identities revealed
" the couple fled to turkey a few months ago , but they ca n't shake the fear that their relationship could cost them their lives
they share housing with other syrians refugees , where they have to continue to pretend that they are straight
when the isis photographs emerged , one of their housemates made a sickening comment
" they say they will never return to syrians
opinion : isis 's warped take on morality
