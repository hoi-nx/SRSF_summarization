from the moment we are born , the first question our parents are asked is , " is it a boy or a girl ? " the answer to that seemingly simple question quickly establishes the child 's path and trajectory for years to come ; however , the question is not simple
the question is tragically flawed and here 's a newsflash for everyone who has ever asked new parents that question : you 're asking the wrong people
why transgender teen jazz jennings is everywhere you see , the doctor told my parents , " it 's a girl , " but he could n't have been more wrong
aside from my biology , i knew i was a boy from the age of 2
keep in mind that this was a time before i had even realized that being a boy trapped in a girl 's body was anything beyond normal , and this was long before i could possibly articulate what was happening
i was a little boy expressing myself based on what was in my heart and mind -- not yet distorted by biology , other people 's confusion , or fear
it was when i was older that other people let me know something was " off
" no matter how many times i was told differently , i was a boy and the people that mattered knew it too , for the most part
i want to address the moment where people , gender , and respectful communication part ways
that is when people get scared , cite religion , start whispering , and disconnect
people have always mocked what they do n't understand , and this is a tough one for most to grasp
the transgender life : what to know , say and understand i can not stress to the world enough , gender and sexuality are two completely different things , and the moment people incorrectly connect them is the moment when most people start looking for an exit or a fight
nothing is completely black or white , hot or cold , here or there , or male and female ; there are varying degrees of everything and the quicker we respect that , the faster we all grow and allow people to be who they are
i first heard the term " gay " in the second grade , long after i had my first " girlfriend " and had proudly written " a penis " at the top of my christmas list
it was n't until i learned that there were people out there that considered homosexuality " abnormal " or that people needed to put labels on our feelings toward others that i became terrified that i was " different
" i knew i liked girls and i was technically a girl , biologically , but i was a boy and my feelings about girls were normal boy feelings
that said , i knew being gay was n't a bad thing , but i also knew it did n't describe me
the most crippling fear came from people not understanding that i was a boy trapped in a girl 's body and simply labeling me something i 'm not
truthfully , i 'm most proud of myself for having the courage to find my own way and owning it , to proudly begin my transcencion from someone i was n't -- into the man i always knew i 'd become
whether i 'm a boy or a girl , white or black , rich or poor , gay or straight , it 's completely irrelevant
what truly matters is the fact that i 'm avery and i 've always known exactly who i was
