a heavily pregnant woman has been hospitalised in french after being assaulted by two men in what her husband claims was an ' islamophobic act '
one of the attackers hit 29 - year - old kedidja , who was wearing a headscarf , several times and threw her to the ground as she dropped her two children off at school in toulouse , la depeche reports
her husband munir says they grabbed her hair and pulled at her veil while yelling ' none of that here ' at the nine - months - pregnant woman who is due to give birth in mid-april
she is now recovering and her unborn baby is believed to be unharmed , but her husband revealed that she has not stopped crying since the attack on tuesday morning
33 - year - old munir described himself and his wife as ' french and muslim ' said the men took offence to the headscarf even though she was dressed conventionally in tracksuit bottoms and a jacket
racially motivated : her husband munir says they grabbed her hair and pulled at her veil while yelling ' none of that here ' at the woman who is nine months pregnant ( file photo , victim not pictured ) banned : islamic clothing has been a divisive issue in french and the country banned full - face veils from all public areas in 2010 ( pictured in 2010 ) ' i condemn this act of extreme cowardice and inhumanity in the strongest terms
but french authorities have been concerned by a rise in islamophobia since the horrific terror attacks in paris in january
in the two weeks following the shootings there were 128 anti-muslim incidents registered , which is almost the same number as in the whole of 2014 .
