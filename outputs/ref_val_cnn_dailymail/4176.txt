the head of the us army has admitted that he is â very concerned â about cuts to british âs defence spending
general raymond odierno warned that the cuts could diminish british âs ability to fight future campaigns
he also called on the government to maintain defence spending at the nato target of two per cent of national income
sir peter wall ( left ) and former defence secretary ( right ) are among those to have spoken out against the chancellor 's plan to reduce military spending to below the nato benchmark of 2 per cent of gdp in his first interview since retiring last september , general sir peter wall admitted that he doubted british politicians had the will to â tackle the really wicked issues â facing the world
and the ex-chief of the general staff urged all the major political parties to promise to protect defence spending at 2 per cent of national income after the general election
he said a fall in funding would lead to cuts in budgets for training , equipment and even military missions â further undermining the british âs global standing
the prime minister has faced criticism over the cuts which , say experts , would ' comfort enemies ' speaking to bbc 's the world this weekend , sir peter wall urged : ' we military folk would like to see manifesto commitments to levels of defence expenditure and it 's of concern to us that all parties would probably be content to have this conversation not happening at the moment
' implicit in what the current government was saying around the time of the nato summit in wales last year where we were suggesting that it was everybody 's responsibility around european to meet the 2 % of gdp for defence expenditure , implicit in that is the fact that that 's what we ought to be doing ourselves
' his views were echoed by former defence secretary fox who suggested foreign aid be redirected in order to increase funds
dr fox added the relationship between british and us had been compromised following parliament 's voting against intervening in syrian following the regime 's reported use of chemical weapons
during a recent visit to washington mr david cameron was told by president obama that reducing british 's defence budget to below 2 per cent would undermine the treaty ' i think there 's a real danger here which is ( that ) you should n't make threats which you 're not willing to follow through on
