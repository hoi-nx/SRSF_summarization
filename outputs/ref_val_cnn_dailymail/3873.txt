boasting nothing more than an empty , concrete shell on the top level , the ' aurora ' soul penthouse has sold for $ 7 million to property tycoon , tony fung
mr tony fung had to beat six other bidders to buy the massive four - floor apartment on the gold coast
the apartment with its own opulent pool , luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque , became australia 's most expensive penthouse , in 2006 when an agreement was reached to sell it for nearly $ 17 million
but the deal with brisbane businessman charlie caltabiano fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute
since then , the penthouse has been stripped of every piece of furniture , every fitting , the walls , the ceiling and even the kitchen sink
the living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance , all fittings and furnishings have been removed , even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the gold coast , though , is still the same the previous fit - out is long gone as the soul penthouse prepares to go under the hammer the soul penthouse is one of the stand - out buildings along the gold coast skyline the 63 - year - old hong kong businessman is no foreigner to expanses in need of some love
the interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting mr tony fung 's personal touch today : the bare bones living area
' it 's unique , a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for buyers - we stripped it right back to a shell , that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too ' mr ledgerwood of selling agents mcgrath told daily mail australia ' it 's similar to buying a vacant house lot , but 220 metres up in the sky and with the highest swimming pool in queensland , ' he said
he says the new appeal of this four - level 1040 square metre property ' is that it is very , very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want , particularly here on the gold coast ' as it once was
the current version shows queensland 's highest positioned pool and spa , but little else they took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $ 16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit - out ' look , we had to admit that it ( the fit - out ) that was there was not very appealing , so we decided that it needed to be ripped up
' ' it 's unique , a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse , so we began by stripping it right back to a shell , that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too , ' mr ledgerwood added
it 's position at more than 220 metres above the ground , four levels ( 70 - 73 ) , boasting ' the highest swimming pool and spa in queensland ' , no less than eight secure basement car spaces ( which have also had fittings removed ) and ' full resort facilities including pools , gym and gardens '
' the auction that saw tony fung one more australia property richer , took place on march 7
' you look up to stradbroke ( island ) and all the way down to coolangatta down south , to be fair the previous lay - out did not do that justice ' said mr ledgerwood with views like this , it 's little wonder mr ledgewood claims ' there has been plenty of local and international interest ' about aurora - the soul penthouse on the gold coast which had been stripped bare
