before stiviano 's recordings toppled donald from ownership of the clippers , she boasted she would be the next mrs. sterling
those predictions seemed like a fantasy on wednesday as donald 's wife went after the $ 3.6 million that she said the younger woman swindled from community property the couple amassed over 60 years of marriage
' stiviano , 32 , will have her own chance to testify on thursday in the nonjury trial in los angeles superior court as to why she should keep gifts that included a duplex , ferrari , jewelry and designer clothes
the trial put the sterling and stiviano together in the same room about a year after the recording of donald telling stiviano not to publicly associate with blacks culminated with his lifetime ban from the nba and the record $ 2 billion sale of the team
he said stiviano had n't contributed ' 50 cents ' to the $ 1.8 million duplex now in her name
donald , 80 , said stiviano , right , had n't contributed ' 50 cents ' to the $ 1.8 million duplex now in her name donald , a lawyer and shrewd businessman who made a fortune buying apartment buildings across los angeles , never explained why he purchased the house , though he made it clear he paid every penny because he said stiviano was poor and her family was on welfare
noting that stiviano is part black and hispanic , he said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending a hispanic bank employee who added her name to a $ 1 million check
stiviano 's lawyer , mac nehoray , said donald gave the gifts when he was separated from his wife and that no real community property was transferred to his client
donald said he only intended to loan a ferrari and a bentley to stiviano , but he put them under her name so he would n't be liable if she killed somebody , adding that she was once charged with drunken driving
