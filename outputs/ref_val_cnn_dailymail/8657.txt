if you 've ever given blood , you 'll know that even the most skilled nurses and doctors can struggle to locate the vein first time
so hospitals in the us are trialling a device that can locate veins inside a person âs arm using harmless near - infrared light
called christie , the device detects veins and then projects the image of them in real - time on top of the arm to help the medical worker know where to put the needle
called veinviewer ( shown ) it uses infrared light to look ' under ' the skin
it can then project a high - definition image of the veins onto the surface of the skin
the device enables doctors and nurses to find a vein immediately the medical system was designed by memphis - based company christie medical holdings
it works by emitting near - infrared light , which is absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood and then reflected by surrounding tissue
