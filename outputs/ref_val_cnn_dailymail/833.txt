travellers could soon fly non-stop from europe to australia - or even further - under plans to change how planes use fuel
a collaborative team of scientists from nine institutions across europe has designed a so - called cruiser-feeder concept that would allow planes to refuel in mid-air
the system would involve a refuelling plane carrying enough kerosene to top up to five passenger planes located at various points along flight routes as the passenger plane approaches , the refuelling jet would take off , fly beneath the plane before connecting specially - designed and made fuel tanks and pumps
the civil concept was developed as part of a wider project called research for a cruiser enabled air transport environment ( recreate )

reducing them and refuelling mid-air could mean ' huge savings ' and figures suggest fuel burn , and therefore the amount needed at take - off , could be reduced by up to 23 per cent for every 6,000 nautical miles flown by a plane carrying 250 passengers
nor is it clear how much the reduction in fuel burn and costs created by causing passenger planes to make fewer stops would offset those used by the individual , heavy refuelling jets
it would then offload the required amount of kerosene before disconnecting and returning to the ground the civil concept was developed as part of a wider project called research for a cruiser enabled air transport environment ( recreate )
the system would also allow for non-stop flights between destinations as far apart as zurich and sydney
the researchers have already tested the concept using simulators to determine that the project is technically possible

however , it is not known how much extra energy , fuel and carbon emissions will be released as a result of having more planes in the sky the recreate project also includes a second , more radical proposal which involves building an air - metro system , with giant aircraft circling the globe , and smaller ' feeder aircraft ' unloading passengers , luggage and waste midair , transporting them to destinations along the way
' the concept has been developed by experts from nlr , amsterdam , dlr braunschweig in germany , foi in sweden , tu munich , tu delft , queen âs university belfast , zhaw in zurich , nangia research associates and nrg in the netherlands .
