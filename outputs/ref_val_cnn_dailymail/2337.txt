researchers found the majority of pensioners are making the most of their later years with a packed diary of social engagements , days out , short breaks , holidays and shopping , as well as time spent outside ( file image ) with such a relaxed start to the day , it âs no wonder that a poll of retirees aged 60 and over found 94 per cent are enjoying their post-work life , while half said they are having more fun than ever before
improvements in healthcare and living standards mean that these days pensioners have the energy to manage a hectic social diary , buoyed up by an average disposable income of Â£ 330 a month , which allows them to go on three holidays , two weekends away and 17 day trips a year
the survey found that 6.30pm is retirees â favourite time to enjoy a tipple or two
a third of those polled said they drink alcohol between 6pm and 7pm , while one in ten prefer a late afternoon drink between 4pm and 5pm , and a hardy one in 20 kick off their socialising between 1pm and 3pm
the study also showed that most pensioners eat out three times a month , but one in ten do so more than twice a week
it âs no wonder then that 20 per cent of those polled said they wish they had retired years ago
shortly after retiring , a third said they booked lunch dates with friends , a quarter revamped their house and one in ten signed up to facebook
andrew robertson , of senior railcard , said : â our poll showed that adults in their 60s , 70s and 80s are determined to make the most of life in retirement and have no intention of slowing down
â for so much of our lives we are restricted by our working hours , so if pensioners are filling their time with holidays , day trips and meals out , that can only be a good thing
