iraq forces say they 've captured key areas in their offensive to take back tikrit , which has been under isis control since june
the security forces , backed by shiite militias , raised the iraq flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city monday night , a security official with the forces in tikrit told cnn
the renewed push into tikrit comes days after a series of u.s. - led airstrikes aimed at isis targets around the city
now security forces and fighters from hashd al-shaabi , a predominantly shiite paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take tikrit back from isis , say they 're gaining ground
iraq forces have tried multiple times to win back tikrit since isis , which calls itself the islamic state , conquered the city in june as part of its campaign to amass an expansive islamic caliphate
the latest push began after iraq prime minister al-abadi on march 1 ordered iraq forces to retake tikrit and salahuddin province
