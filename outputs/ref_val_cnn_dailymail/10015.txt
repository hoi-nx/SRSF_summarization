real estate heir durst was charged on monday in la with first - degree murder durst 's mumblings about how he ' killed them all ' provided the dramatic kick to a documentary about the millionaire 's troubled life and connection to three slayings , but it was words he penned that helped lead to his arrest on a murder charge , a law enforcement official said
analysis linking a letter durst wrote to his friend susan berman a year before her death with one he said ' only the killer could have written ' to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long - dormant investigation , a police source said
durst , 71 , was charged on monday in la with first - degree murder in the shooting of susan berman , the daughter of a prominent las vegas mobster , back in 2000
he could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime
he waived extradition in new orleans , but authorities there charged him late on monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver when he was arrested there saturday
he was also found in possession of a small amount of marijuana
prosecutors believed that durst was a flight risk after the revelations of the documentary and may have been planning to head for cuba
however one of his lawyers , chip lewis , told the la times that his client had left his houston home for new orleans to escape the media and that he had called daily to check in with him , asking for him by name
attorney deguerin said outside court that durst did n't kill susan berman , and is ' ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial '
presented with the two letters in the finale of the jinx : the life and deaths of durst that aired sunday on hbo , the eccentric heir blinked , burped oddly , pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer
analysis linking a letter durst wrote to susan berman a year before her death with one he said ' only the killer could have written ' to point police to her body was new evidence in the investigation , a police source said durst , far right , was escorted into orleans parish criminal district court through a tunnel entrance , in new orleans on monday for a court hearing to extradite him to la to face a murder charge ' any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him , they can use against him , ' said andrea roth , a law professor at the university of california , berkeley
when durst approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera , against the advice of his lawyers , he had already weathered one murder case , winning an acquittal in a gory galveston , texas , dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self - defense
he was still suspected in the killing of susan berman , whose father was a las vegas mobster associated with bugsy siegel and meyer lansky , and the disappearance of his wife , kathleen , who was declared dead long after she vanished in new york in 1982
susan berman was found shot execution - style outside her home in la in 2000
her friend , durst , was charged with her murder on monday kathleen 's brother , jim mccormack , told today on tuesday that he believed durst 's confession was genuine and an admission that the 71 - year - old had killed his sister decades before
the documentary showed filmmaker jarecki confronting durst with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted beverly hills police to look for a ' cadaver ' at susan berman 's address
' then , in the final episode , jarecki revealed another envelope , which durst acknowledged mailing to susan berman , that has similar writing in block letters and also misspelled the address as ' beverley
her brother , jim mccormack , said on tuesday that following the hbo show he hoped durst would have an ' epiphany of conscience ' and tell them what happened to his sister robert a. durst 's attorneys , including deguerin , center , and william p. gibbens , left , speak after leaving court in new orleans on monday
deguerin said durst did n't kill susan berman , and is ' ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial '
