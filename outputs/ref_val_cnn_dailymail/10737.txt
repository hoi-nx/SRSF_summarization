labour failed to appreciate the britain jobs market would prove a magnet for polish plumbers , one of tony blair âs most senior advisers admitted yesterday
sir stephen wall , who was mr tony blair âs most senior eu adviser between 2000 and 2004 , said : â we simply did nât take account properly of the pull factor of england for people with skills who could probably find a bigger market [ in the britain ] for their skills - you know , the polish plumber
â in comments which will pose a huge headache for ed miliband , sir stephen wall also admitted the decision to throw open britain âs borders at a time when other countries were imposing transitional controls was â political â
green of deddington said the figure of 13,000 polish workers settling in the britain originally given by labour was ' completely worthless ' ( file image ) sir stephen wall said : â the primary argument was the political one â this was the right thing to do , we attached a lot of importance to them as democratic countries and keeping our position as the number one friend of eastern and central europeans
â last night , green of deddington , chairman of the migration watch campaign group , told the mail : â it is astonishing that nobody properly considered the impact of the wage differential between britain and a huge country like polish
â yesterday , it also emerged that ex-labour cabinet minister denham had written to chancellor gordon brown and home secretary charles clarke to warn the new arrivals were having a huge impact
â in further bombshell remarks , the respected economist ormerod , writing in the left - wing guardian newspaper , exploded labour âs economic case for mass migration
mr ormerod said : â labour allowed direct competition to enter the britain labour market on a scale unprecedented in our history â¦ it is the relatively unskilled in the bottom half of the distribution who have lost out
former home secretary david blunkett ( pictured ) has defended labour 's record on mass migration , saying he is ' confident ' it was the right policy , ' even though very few people now will stand up for it ' â the liberal elite do not suffer
â his comments were echoed by ex-labour home secretary jacqui smith , who said : â the person that benefits from â¦ growth is often not the one worried that their kid is going to get less attention from the teacher in the class room because there are people speaking polish
