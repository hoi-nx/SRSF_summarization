filmed at home in london , the 20 - month - old boy named max stands in front of his mother with tears streaming down his cheeks
he urges her and his father to take him to the local pub - where he usually receives sweets and hot chocolate - instead of the doctor 's surgery
he said : â i always get a beer and max always gets his hot chocolate
â true to the principles of pavlov âs dog max now associates sweets and hot chocolate with the pub. â my guess as he gets older he 'll feel the same but his choice of chocolate will move to his choice of cask ale
