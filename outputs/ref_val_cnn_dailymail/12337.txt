federal authorities say it 's the largest irs impersonation scam they 've ever seen -- swindling victims out of more than $ 15 million since it began in 2013
" they have information that only the irs would know about you , " said camus , deputy inspector general for investigations with the treasury
" using identity theft technology , the thieves have successfully victimized more than 3,000 people in the past two years , although the treasury cautions that number is only documented cases and the true number might be higher
camus said they 've recorded more than 366,000 reports of contact with the scammers , and it 's increasing at a rate of 10,000 to 12,000 a week
authorities believe the thieves are operating out of india , using phishing technology to make it appear they 're irs agents in washington
call 1 : ' the irs is filing a lawsuit against you ' call 2 : ' your address is under state investigation ' the ftc , which goes after scammers like these from a civil standpoint , and the treasury , which leads the criminal probe , both have open investigations
the largest loss reported was a staggering $ 500,000 , camus said
most have lost about $ 5,000
one of those victims was former nfl player frank garcia , who is now a sports radio host in charlotte , north carolina
" frank garcia says he spent five hours driving to various stores around charlotte , depositing $ 500 each time into a paypal account set up by the woman on the phone
he ended up losing about $ 4,000
he , and other victims , told cnn the swindlers never let their victims hang up the phone
" i have never been arrested in my life and was very scared , " said ko , a new jersey resident who lost about $ 5,000 after he says the impersonator told him he was facing five years in prison , and the irs was about to confiscate his assets : his car , his house and all the money in his bank account
they harness stolen identities and use programs such as google earth to identity locations where their victims can transfer money
" cadenhead told cnn he did n't come to his senses until he 'd signed over $ 16,000
how do i know they are n't stern and serious about everything ? " camus said many people are afraid when they hear from the irs , so they do whatever the caller says
in december , federal authorities found and arrested two u.s. - based " runners " who admitted to transferring almost a million dollars from pre-paid cards to foreign bank accounts
in many cases , victims are warned and stopped from sending more money by bank tellers or clerks at money wiring locations
ko said that it was a bank teller who told him this was a scam when the impersonator asked him to go through a second round of depositing money

treasury officials say if you get one of these calls , the best and simplest way to handle it is to hang up
camus himself , a treasury investigator , even got one
