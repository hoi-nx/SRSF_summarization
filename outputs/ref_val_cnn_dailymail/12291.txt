sanaa , yemen the u.s. military is in the process of evacuating about 100 special operations forces members from the al anad airbase in yemen due to that country 's deteriorating security situation , sources in the region familiar with the situation told cnn
the u.s. closed its embassy in sanaa last month , after houthi rebels took over the yemen capital
for years , the u.s. military has worked closely with yemen 's government to go after aqap , together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent aqap figure anwar al-awlaki
but while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month , these cooperative efforts have been hampered by yemen 's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace
these include the rise of the houthi , their battles with forces loyal to ousted president hadi and the presence of not only aqap fighters but other militants
those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others , according to yemen 's state - run saba news agency
meanwhile , the main players for control of yemen 's government -- those siding with hadi , who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year , and the houthi , a minority group that 's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds
just two days ago , a yemen jet commanded by the capital 's houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden
the airstrikes came on the same day opposing yemen military forces -- some under the houthi , others led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , said aden gov. hobtour
he called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the saudi capital of riyadh , condemning the aden strike and urging yemen troops to refuse orders from houthi officials
al bukhaiti , a top member of the houthi political council , said hadi 's speech wo n't help yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last september to transfer power
" we blame hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved yemen 's ongoing crises , " al bukhaiti said
