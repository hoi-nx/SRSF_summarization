controversial letters sent to ira fugitives granting them an amnesty from prosecution may have been illegal , a damning parliamentary report has found
a commons select committee said the so - called â comfort letters â , which assured 187 republican terror suspects they were no longer being hunted by the police , should never have been written
in a highly - critical report , it said the â one - sided secretive scheme â â which victims said effectively handed paramilitary fighters ' get out of jail free ' cards â had damaged the integrity of the uk criminal justice system
at least 95 recipients were linked to almost 300 murders
but the letters â sent to the so - called â on the runs â after pressure from sinn fein â only came to light during the trial of john downey , the man accused of the hyde park bombing in 1982
uk 's then prime minister tony blair ( l ) meets sinn fein leader gerry adams ( r ) , and chief negotiator martin mcguinness in 2005 - the letters were sent to so - called â on the runs â after pressure from sinn fein but today the commons â northern ireland published a blistering report raising serious questions about the legality of the highly - divisive scheme
â it found that â damage has undoubtedly been done to public confidence in the criminal justice system â
the committee , which took evidence from 55 witnesses , including ex-prime minister mr tony blair , also blasted the decision not to appeal the john downey ruling this had placed â preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system over the public interest involved in continuing the trial of someone accused of carrying out multiple murders , â it said
the report said that during the peace process , sinn fein had pushed for â comfort letters â to be issued and had received promises from mr tony blair
it comes after six ira terror suspects thought to be behind some of the worst atrocities committed on mainland uk are facing major new police investigations despite receiving letters granting them immunity
