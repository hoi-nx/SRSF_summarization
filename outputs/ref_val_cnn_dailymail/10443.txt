compelling : this picture , taken minutes after mh17 blew up , ' shows a buk rocket trail ' an image of a vapour trail taken minutes after a passenger jet crashed in ukraine has been hailed as proof it was shot down by a russian missile
official investigators believe the picture , first published by the mail on sunday last year , holds the key to the fate of malaysia airlines flight mh17 , which was blown apart in mid-air , killing all 298 on board
afterwards , ukraine and russian blamed each other , and still do , and the incident fuelled an increasingly bloody civil war which has seen large parts of ukraine taken over by military forces loyal to russian president vladimir putin
netherlands and australian investigators now believe the image represents evidence that the malaysian boeing was hit by a russian - made buk rocket
they travelled to ukraine to interview the photographer who took the picture from the roof of his block of flats in torez , some 12 miles from the site where the missile was launched , and took away the camera as evidence
they believe the image and others taken by the photographer offer clear evidence of the buk missile attack from a position on the edge of the town of snizhne in pro-russian rebel - held eastern ukraine
amid fears for his safety he was relocated to a safe house and has been under the protection of ukraine âs secret service ever since
analysis by investigators has found the picture was taken at 16.25.48 seconds on july 17
the photographer was questioned in detail by investigators about the time and location of his pictures
speaking on condition of anonymity , he told the mail on sunday : â i was in my flat in a suburb of torez , and heard a loud noise â far louder than artillery or grenades

among the dead : evie , mo , and otis maslin were on board flight mh17 with their grandfather nick when it was shot down leaks from the netherlands probe indicate that investigators believe it likely the buk was fired not by rebels but by russian soldiers
last week a reporter with rtl , another broadcaster in the netherlands , said shrapnel he collected from the crash site was tested by forensic experts , including defence analysts ihs jane âs in london , who said it matched the explosive charge of a buk
