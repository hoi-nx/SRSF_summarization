ipswich ipswich heard polish factory worker lubecki sold the red superman - branded pills over the christmas eve period last year on the streets of ipswich , suffolk
he had supplied the drug to lithuanian machine operator mr justas ropas , who died at home on christmas eve
the same superman pills were linked to the death of lithuanian labour mr gediminas kulokas who died on his 24th birthday on new year 's day
but the court heard that the supplier of the drug to mr gediminas kulokas had not been identified and there was no evidence that it was lubecki
the deaths prompted suffolk police to issue a warning over the superman - branded pills , which contained the drug pmma which is said to be five times as toxic as the usual mdma ingredient mdma
a court heard lubecki sold the red superman - branded pills ( pictured ) on the streets of ipswich , suffolk but pmma which has the full name pmma is slower acting than mdma so some users are tempted to take higher doses
the court heard that a housemate of mr justas ropas had contacted lubecki on december 23 and asked if he could supply some ecstasy tablets
' the court heard how lubecki was arrested and then confessed to police where he had hidden his remaining batch of the drug
' the court heard how text messages suggested lubecki had been supplying drugs to people in ipswich from around last april
he said lubecki had got involved in drug dealing to fund his own drug use , but after what happened to mr justas ropas he did n't want anything more to do with drugs
lubecki was sentenced to five years and four months in prison at ipswich crown court .
