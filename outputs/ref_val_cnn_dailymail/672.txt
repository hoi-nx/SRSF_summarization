yesterday , the mail published a poignant photograph of actress angelina 's family , showing how cancer has claimed the lives of many of her relatives , including her mother , aunt and grandmother
this strong family history comes from a mutation of the brca1 gene , which dramatically raises the risk of ovarian and breast cancer
but while many people know that a greater risk of developing these cancers can be inherited , what is less well known is that it 's not just down the female line ; the risk can be passed on from your father 's side of the family , too
catherine murley , a 44 - year - old commercial manager from rugby , inherited a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer from her father as result of a faulty brca1 gene
she only became aware of the faulty brca1 gene in her family tree last june , after suddenly hearing from her father mike , 68 , a retired teacher , after years of little contact
' when i phoned my dad that evening , he explained that my cousin - his sister 's daughter - had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer , and the family had found out she had the inherited faulty brca1 gene , ' she says
catherine murley inherited the ovarian cancer gene from her father ' my aunt - her mother - had died of ovarian cancer when she was in her 40s
after my cousin was diagnosed at the age of 40 , the rest of that side of my dad 's family went for genetic testing
' that 's when my dad was found to be positive for the faulty gene
' catherine murley 's father was told this meant he had a raised risk of prostate cancer and male breast cancer , and a slightly higher chance of pancreatic cancer
' i was aware of the brca1 connection because i had a close friend with it who died from breast cancer , ' says catherine murley
they do n't recognise the importance of a pattern of cancers on their father 's side , so denying themselves the opportunity for gene testing to clarify their level of risk
' while a faulty brca gene raises a man 's risk of prostate cancer to 10 to 25 per cent , they raise a woman 's risk of ovarian cancer to 15 to 45 per cent , and the risk of breast cancer to 45 to 90 per cent
' after hearing the news from her father , catherine murley contacted her brother and sister , warning them they needed to be checked
her father had waited almost ten months to be tested , but catherine murley did n't want to wait this long
' i was 43 , which felt quite old to find out you have faulty brca1 , ' she says
' it led to the commercial manager having ovaries and fallopian tubes removed and having a mastectomy symptoms include persistent pelvic and stomach pain , bloating and nausea after eating , as well as feeling full quicker
catherine murley paid Â£ 700 to have a test at a private screening clinic , which involved giving a blood sample
there are hundreds of different mutations of the brca1 gene , but as she knew which mutation she might have - as it would be the same one as her father - the laboratory was able to speed up its analysis
three weeks later , catherine murley went back with her husband martyn to be told her test results
' i had a bad feeling from the outset , ' says catherine murley
' catherine murley was told she was at equal risk of ovarian and breast cancer
women with a faulty brca1 gene can have annual mammograms to screen for breast cancer or have a preventative mastectomy
catherine murley quickly decided what she wanted to do
' in september , she underwent keyhole surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes - the operation was performed by dr rosenthal
examination of the fallopian tubes revealed pre-cancerous cells
though her brother is still waiting for genetic testing , catherine murley 's sister heard shortly before christmas that she , too , has the defective gene
