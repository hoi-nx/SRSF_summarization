amazon has blasted federal regulators for being slow to approve commercial drone testing - and warned the u.s. is falling behind other countries in the potentially lucrative area of unmanned aviation technology
less than a week after the faa gave amazon the green light to test a delivery drone outdoors , the company told u.s. lawmakers that the prototype drone had already become obsolete while the company waited more than six months for the agency 's permission
we 've moved on to more advanced designs that we already are testing abroad , ' said misener , amazon 's vice president for global public policy
about 86 percent of amazon 's deliveries are 5 pounds or less , the company said
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making prime air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' amazon has said
misener said amazon had applied on friday for permission to test a more advanced drone system and now hopes for quicker approval
the amazon case illustrates the frustrations of many companies and industry lobbyists , who say the u.s. regulatory process is not keeping up with rapidly developing drone technology that could generate new revenues and cost savings for a range of industries
' the ( faa ) already has adequate statutory authority
what the faa needs is impetus , lest the u.s. fall further behind , ' he added
the faa recently proposed rules that would lift the current ban on most commercial drone flights , but several restrictions attached would make package delivery and other business applications unfeasible
