though tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded , it âs still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories ( pictured : san gimignano and its towers ) johnson would be surprised to see how popular italian cities have become nowadays : visitors are well advised to arrive outside the summer peak when sightseeing can be hard ( and sometimes positively dangerous given the rise of the selfie - stick â the ultimate stupidity of modern - day tourism )
but today âs tourists do nât come to tuscany so much to learn as to â experience â
the treasures of the uffizi or an up - close sight of david in florence âs accademia gallery are stirring in their own right â you do nât really need to know their place in the history of renaissance in order to enjoy them
chianciano terme was called fontes clusinae by the romans , and they made use of its thermal springs in florence you can assimilate the art and savour it , just as you might imbibe a glass of fine italian wine
the problem is that at busy times , it âs hard to find the space to enjoy either the art or the wine
but though tuscany can sometimes seem overcrowded , it âs still possible to return with plenty of treasured memories
mine are of a pleasant three - star hotel in a place named chianciano terme , about 50 miles south - east of siena , which was our base
the romans called it fontes clusinae , and made use of its thermal springs , as visitors still do
i have good memories , too , of the tuscany landscape , with its well - tended fields and vineyards , its olive groves and cypress trees
in this regard , tuscany is rewarding
the â chianti classico â area , which lies between florence and siena , still looks much as it was when it was painted by the great renaissance artists who assumed that the holy land must have looked a lot like tuscany â so this is what you see in the background of various scenes of holy birth and crucifixion
writer john carter 's tour leader called tuscany 's sam gimignano ' a medieval manhattan ' of course , other countries have beautiful landscapes , but few can match tuscany for its sublime , gentle sweetness
leonardo was born in the small town of vinci which lies in this magnificent scenery â a final confirmation that the area is touched by genius
we went to san gimignano , which our tour leader called â a medieval manhattan â â and it was nât the first time i âd heard it described that way , unfortunately
we liked san gimignano , mainly because there were nât so many people , but also because we were left to our own devices and could make up our own minds about the place without being told all sorts of stuff by a local guide
