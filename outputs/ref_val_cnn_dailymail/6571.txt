an illegal immigrant was sliced to death by a ferry 's ' machete - like ' propellor after launching a bid for freedom across the north sea to avoid deportation
albanian artur doda , 24 , plunged to his death alongside fellow countryman leonard isufaj , 27 , after jumping from one of the world 's largest ferries , minutes after it had taken off from uk shores
the pair were said to be ' tantalisingly close ' to the port in harwich , essex , when they decided to launch themselves into the sea
albanian artur doda , 24 , and fellow countryman leonard isufaj , 27 , plunged to their deaths after jumping from one of the world 's largest ferries , the stena britannica ( pictured ) , while being deported from the uk an inquest heard how the pair , who were being taken to holland , were just 500 metres from the port - but that even an olympic swimmer would have struggled to swim through the currents
the incident , which took place in february last year , came after the pair had arrived in the uk with 13 other stowaways hidden in the back of a lorry on a freight ferry
after today 's hearing , the coroner said the incident was part of ' a bigger picture on immigration and how it 's handled '
after border agency checks , all but two women were sent back on the stena britannica 9am ferry the same day to the hook of holland
but , at around 10am , it was reported to the captain that two immigrants had jumped from the ship
but despite an extensive search involving 21 vessels and two helicopters , neither man was rescued
mr isofaj , who died from drowning , was found on march 20 , 2014 , washed up on a beach in felixstowe
mr artur doda 's badly decomposed body was found floating in the north sea on april 29 , 2014 , and could only be identified by dna from his mother in albanian
the two men had been deported from harwich international port , essex , to holland when they decided to jump into the north sea
a huge search operation was launched but neither man was found alive inspector willis , from essex police , told the inquest that the sea would have appeared deceptively calm , instilling a false belief that it would be possible to swim to shore
mr willis said a tide heading out to sea at about four knots met another northerly tide at about the point where the men jumped
' pathologist dr ian calder , who performed a post-mortem examination on mr artur doda , described his injuries saying : ' this was a very forceful cut across the vertebrae by a sharp , curved blade
she said : ' on face value it is easy to conceive of a situation where they jumped off the ferry in their desperation intending to drown , but there is no evidence of that
speaking after the hearing , mr leonard isufaj 's cousin , besnik vata , 33 , from north london , said the case highlighted the plight of many other immigrants he added : ' they had come to the uk for better a life and it seems they were determined to stay
