three children from a remote mountain village in china travel on horseback for three hours a day in order to attend their nearest school
the eight - year - olds endure the 16km round trip every day accompanied by their elderly grandparents - who walk for six hours a day to ensure their grandchildren get the education they themselves were denied
the grandparents of huang shijun , huang chenbin and huang lingyan take the children from their remote home in mudong village to school every day on horseback , leading the animals along the muddy , rocky and winding track 1,300m above sea level
the grandparents take it in turns to lead the horses along the trail , which is 1,300 metres above sea level the journey can be dangerous , particularly when it is icy - then the children have to stay at home the children , all from the yao ethnic minority group , are all ' left - behind children ' - which means their parents have left them in the care of their grandparents while they look for work in towns and cities miles from their village homes
the people 's daily online reports the youngsters have ridden the horses along the muddy and often dangerous road to school for the last three years
huang shijun , huang chenbin and huang lingyan are all aged just eight - and travel 16km a day to school huang lingyan ( left ) said she loves going to school by horse - and all her friends are jealous of her transport the muddy road from mudong to liuli village was only built in 2010 , supported by government grants and can not carry cars
he said the three families had three horses and use them to carry their children to school
during busy seasons for farmers one elderly person takes all three children to school on behalf of the three families
the children often get soaked through on their daily excursions as they can not carry umbrellas when it rains after arriving at school , the horses are tied in front of the school 's field to graze and the elderly people return to their village
at 3pm the grandparents walk back to the school to take the children home
now the three children have to share two horses to get to school
huang fengjun said : ' rain will wet their clothes and shoes , so we use plastic sheets to cover the kids and then take them slowly on the horses to school
' but when the weather takes a turn for the worst and the mountain pass freezes it becomes too slippery and dangerous to travel on
' huang fengji , her grandfather , said : ' basically , i can not do other work as long as i need to send her to school
