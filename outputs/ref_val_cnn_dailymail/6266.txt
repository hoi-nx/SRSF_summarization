the premier league will have to wait at least three seasons before video technology can be possibly be introduced
it is the dutch fa ( fa ) who are leading the way in trials of a system to aid referees
however , their bid to introduce the technology in cup matches from next season was rejected by the ifab ( ifab ) last month
should the ifab give the go - ahead for trials of this system â or another one â in competitive matches during the 2016/17 campaign , they would then want to see it used in a fifa age - grade tournament before giving permission for video technology to be implemented in the premier league and elsewhere around the world
fa chairman greg dyke will offer his full backing to any attempts to expand the use of video technology and will even volunteer english football to operate trials
i suspect we would like to do an experiment , but you âd have to get that throu fa chairman greg dyke has backed any attempts to expand the use of video technology in football
