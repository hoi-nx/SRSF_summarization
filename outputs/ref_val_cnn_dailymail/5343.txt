anti-police : lawyer akunjee with a woman believed to be his wife great orator , reads a glowing reference from one of lawyer akunjee âs appreciative former clients
the testimonial is included on mr akunjee âs cv on a professional networking site ; the person who wrote it is named , so it âs not made up
in any event , mr akunjee âs skills as an â orator â , for want of a better word , have been much in evidence on the national stage recently
you might have heard mr akunjee in full flow on the radio or caught a glimpse of him on the evening news earlier this month in his ( very lawyerly ) charcoal - grey , three - piece suit and swish purple silk tie
mr akunjee , 37 , was giving evidence to mps on the home affairs select committee with his latest clients : the families of the three girls from tower hamlets , london , who fled the british to join islamic state
mr akunjee denounced the authorities for allowing kadiza sultana , 16 , and 15 â year - olds shamima begum and amira abase to leave british and reach syria after going missing in december
â relations can be built after they have broken down only after an apology , â mr akunjee insisted loftily
for we now know that the father of amira abase , one of the missing schoolgirl â jihadi brides â , is himself a supporter of militant islam
images posted online show abase hussen taking part in a notorious islamist rally back in september 2012 in london , when flags of israel and the american were burned
also in attendance that day was hate preacher anjem choudary , as well as michael adebowale , one of the two muslims converts who went on to murder soldier lee rigby
abase hussen ( circled right ) , whose daughter fled the british last month to join isis , was pictured at an islam protest alongside lee rigby killer michael adebowale ( circled left ) vicious : in 2012 , abase hussen ( left ) marched at the head of a violent rally held by muslims extremists in london , taking part in the burning of an american flag akunjee has gone on record in the past to declare that no muslims should co-operate with the british police force because the government âs prevent counter-terror policy is â straightforward , paid - for spying on the community â
he once asked in an internet rant : â does she [ home secretary theresa may ] have nazi blood in her veins ? â imagine the furore if someone had insulted a muslims leader in the same vein
the wider public might not have heard of mr akunjee until now but behind his self - righteous performance in the commons , behind his fancy legal credentials , behind his respectable upbringing ( his father and two younger brothers are all doctors ) , is an individual with links to what some might describe as the â who âs who â of islam extremists in british
consider , to begin with , a cartoon posted on his facebook page on january 12 , less than a week after the charlie hebdo atrocity in paris
that message reinforced a previous facebook entry on the day of the paris attack itself
â could there be a more inappropriate way of behaving , given his profession ? mr akunjee ( right ) , 37 , gave evidence to mps on the home affairs select committee alongside mr abase hussen and his family mr akunjee âs father arrived in this country from bangladeshi in the seventies
mr akunjee said lee rigby killer adebolajo was ' created ' by the security services in an article carried on the cage website , he also claimed that the security services â created â adebolajo â who with michael adebowale killed woolwich fusilier lee rigby â by â making his life so difficult â
mr akunjee represented a close friend of adebolajo , who was sentenced to three years for terrorist offences in 2013
might the same yardstick be extended to the company a person keeps online ? among his other facebook friends are a notorious hate preacher , a former member of banned terror group al-muhajiroun , a one - time guantanamo detainee , and , almost inevitably , asim qureshi , the leading figure in cage , the man who for years was in regular contact with jihadi john , to name but a few of mr akunjee âs unsavoury contacts
mr akunjee â as the mail has revealed in previous articles â is part of a network of extremists spreading poisonous propaganda that is turning the heads of so many young muslims
the solicitor is also friends on facebook with asim qureshi - the leading figure in cage who was in regular contact with jihadi john we now know that the father of amira abase , one of the missing schoolgirl â jihadi brides â ( pictured ) , is himself a supporter of militant islam he studied law at two of its universities : he was an undergraduate at sussex uni and a postgraduate at westminster
mr akunjee is pictured in the vicinity on facebook in the company of an attractive blonde
how mr akunjee , who is based on the other side of london , came to be representing the families or why they should need a lawyer in the first place is not clear
are nât they , and not the police , the ones who are really driving so many young british muslims into the hands of is ?
