wardens at windsor castle ( pictured here collecting flowers laid by well - wishers following the death of the queen mother ) claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties for visitors for no additional money wardens â main duties are to meet and greet visitors , tell them about the history of the windsor castle , and hand out free audio guides
but the public and commercial services union ( pcs ) said many are asked to go above and beyond this for no extra pay , including leading paid - for guided tours at the windsor castle
other workers administer first aid or speak to tourists in a foreign language without being paid extra , they said
