" wait up 2015 fit nation and dr. sanjay gupta -- you want me to climb up stone mountain -- that is over 1,500 feet straight up
this is actually what i signed up for when i uploaded my video to the fit nation website in december
to look and review your intake and replace it with other foods such as fruit and vegetables -- these small steps can be major impact on your training
my training schedule has also been an uphill battle
but luckily i have been inspired by my 2015 fit nation teammates to keep me on track
their updates have been truly inspiring and have helped me think about the struggles i face in my training activities
my team members of the fit nation have been there for me
i actually lost 20 pounds
what ! really ! uphill battles are hard to see when you are in the middle of them
just like that sunday afternoon in january , i could not wait to be on the mountaintop and see the view from stone mountain with the members of 2015 fit nation
