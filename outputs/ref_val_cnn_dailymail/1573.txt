millions still use easy - to - crack passwords such as â qwerty â and â 123456 â , but many people are choosing to use more complex sets of characters for our online accounts
however , a new study has found these seemingly random passwords may be more obvious to hack than you realise
they spotted that a number of complex passwords were being used by multiple people , such as â mnbvcxz â , â qaz2wsx â and â adgjmptw â
this is because each of these words follow a certain pattern , or ' walk ' on a keyboard ( shown ) the analysis was made by hosting firm wp using 10 million passwords recently released by security consultant mark burnett
as with previous studies , researchers discovered the most common passwords are still â 123456 â , â password â , â qwerty â and â 111111 â
they also went a step further and listed all 50 of the most used words , which additionally included â superman â and â letmein â
these lists were then divided into sections including the top 10 colours , days of the week , fruits and animals used as passwords - which are â red â , â friday â , â apple â and â fish â respectively

more than one in five people who added numbers to a word simply chose ' 1 ' for example , â qaz2wsx â was in the top 30
they also noticed that a website called zxcvbn scored these words as zero , or low , for so - called entropy
this is because each of these words follow a certain pattern on a keyboard , known as â keyboard walks â
people born in the 1980s were the most likely to use the word â love â somewhere in their password
almost 1.5 per cent of these passwords belonged to women compared to 0.7 per cent of men âs elsewhere , nearly half a million - or 420,000 ( 8.4 per cent ) - of the 10 million passwords ended with a number between 0 and 99
on average more women had passwords with an entropy score of 25 and above and people born in the 1980s were the most likely to use the word â love â somewhere in their password
