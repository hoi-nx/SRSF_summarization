he 's out : city unanimously voted on a resolution to part ways with city manager shaw , 39 , effective immediately the city manager of ferguson , missouri , has resigned in the wake of a justice department probe that found a wide range of systemic racially biased practices by the police and municipal court
this evening , the city unanimously voted on a resolution to part ways with city manager shaw effective immediately
shaw , 39 , was among several individuals heavily criticized in the scathing justice department report issued last wednesday
shaw had held the position in the st. louis suburb since 2007
the justice department launched an investigation into ferguson 's police department and municipal court after the august 9 shooting death of unarmed black teenager brown by a white police officer
the statement also said a nationwide search for shaw 's replacement would begin immediately
' i believe that the city of ferguson has the resolve to overcome the challenges it faces in the coming months and emerge as a stronger community for it , ' shaw , 39 , said in a statement included in the release
the justice department report repeatedly cited shaw 's role in encouraging his police force to aggressively ticket motorists as a means to generate revenue
in one instance , he responded to a jackson email about a record - setting month for court revenue â nearly $ 180,000 in february 2011 alone â with the exclamation , ' wonderful ! ' catalyst : the justice department launched an investigation into policing practices in ferguson after officer wilson ( left ) shot and killed 18 - year - old brown in august city divided : analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed african - african-american make up 93 percent of arrests and when jackson told shaw in january 2013 that municipal court revenue had exceeded $ 2million the previous year , the city manager was similarly excited
shaw 's resignation comes a day after ferguson municipal judge ronald brockmeyer stepped down to help the divided city ' begin its healing process ' and to promote public confidence in the court system
us attorney general eric holder called the justice department 's report ' searing , ' saying the investigation found the ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be ' disproportionately harmful to african-american residents
' embarassement : last thursday , two ferguson police department commanders also quit after racist emails were released during the justice department 's investigation speaking out : us attorney general eric holder called the justice department 's report ' searing ' ferguson mayor james knowles said friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the justice department , reuters reports
speaking at a town hall event in south carolina two days after the release of the justice department report , president obama said the ferguson probe exposed a ' broken , racially biased system
strong words : president obama said the ferguson probe exposed a ' broken , racially biased system ' the justice department report cited cases of racial profiling and bigotry by the predominantly white police force in the mostly black st. louis suburb
