los angeles american 's skid row sits in downtown los angeles
this pocket of 2,000 men and women constitutes the nation 's biggest concentration of homeless people living and sleeping on public sidewalks , in scattered camps under tarps
this quarter of despair is now at the center of national attention for another reason : this week , los angeles police and a homeless man in a tent engaged in a confrontation , ending with officers fatally shooting the man known only as " africa , " an apparent reference to his home continent
" skid row is a 54 - block area that has the largest homeless number of individuals in the country , " said jones , executive director of the national coalition for the homeless
he 's based in new york city
" new york city has the largest homeless population , but los angeles has the highest unsheltered population in the country , which has led to the destitution you see today , " he added
new york city 's unique right - to - shelter mandate ensures " temporary emergency shelter to every man , woman , and child who is eligible for services , every night , " the city 's website says
but not in los angeles , where two - thirds of the county 's 40,000 homeless people are unsheltered , jones said
so many live on the streets of downtown los angeles -- and elsewhere
in some american minds , los angeles may conjure up images of a great american city cursed with an abandoned urban core
today , downtown los angeles enjoys a renaissance , right down to the new hotels and mall surrounding the staples center , where professional basketball and hockey are played , often to championships
the triple - digit number of social service agencies , however , is often cited as one reason that los angeles endures as the nation 's skid row capital : there 's a $ 54 - million - a - year charitable infrastructure anchored to the poverty district
" skid row has become less transient , " navales said
" the century - old midnight mission now serves 3,000 meals daily to the homeless , navales said
" he now wears a suit , on skid row 's front line , trying to relieve and unravel the nation 's gordian knot of poverty
