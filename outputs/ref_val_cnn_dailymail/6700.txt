the home was in a state of chaos and disrepair - a far cry from the way her friend strack said farrenkopf liked to keep her home
scene : neighbors said they helped clear the driveway and mow the lawn while they believed farrenkopf was still in the home , though many eventually moved away world traveler : farrenkopf traveled to england and scotland , as well as around the us , while working programming banking software for alltel information services ' her house was well - kept , very clean , very tidy , ' strack said

farrenkopf was n't always shut in her home , though it was often unclear where she was
there 's no record of farrenkopf after the 2009 cash withdrawal , and investigators , who checked credit card statements and subpoenaed bank , phone and health records in a ' massively thorough ' search say her cause of death is undeterminable
' medical records showed farrenkopf , who was 44 when investigators believe she died , smoked more than a pack a day and in spite of being worried about her liver , drank regularly
but the tank in the car still had two gallons of gas left , which led investigators to rule out carbon monoxide poisoning and her organs were so mummified , according to deputy medical examiner dr bernardino pacris , making a toxicology report impossible
