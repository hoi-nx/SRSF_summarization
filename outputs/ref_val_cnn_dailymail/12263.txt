on saturday , just hours after four suicide bombers set off a series of blasts in the northeastern nigerian city of maiduguri that left at least fifty people dead and scores more wounded , the militant organization thought responsible for the attacks , boko haram , reportedly announced that it was swearing allegiance to the so - called islamic state in iraqi and syria ( isis )
according to a report quoting the site extremist monitoring organization , an audio recording purportedly from boko haram 's leader , shekau , hailed isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi as " caliph " and declared : " we announce our allegiance to the caliph ... and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity
in fact , the " shout - outs " exchanged regularly between boko haram and isis were not just rhetorical flourishes , but indicative of a veritable courtship as the former appropriated more and more of the latter 's symbolism , tactics , and ideology
this is n't the first time that boko haram has adapted itself to conform with a larger extremist network that could aid it : previously the group underwent a similar evolution after shekau took over from its slain founder , muhammad yusuf , in 2009 and aligned it with al-qaeda 's affiliate in africa , aqim ( aqim ) , which gave boko haram training as well as facilitated its carrying out of nigerian 's first suicide bombings in 2011
despite the assistance that boko haram received from aqim and other aligned groups in the years since , the nigerian militants ' ideology and brutal tactics have progressively drawn closer to those of isis
like isis , boko haram has progressed far beyond asymmetric terrorist attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in its successfully overrunning and effectively controlling large parts in northeastern nigerian and displacing millions of people
so what does the pledge mean moving forward ? at least in the short term , the merger will not have much immediate impact on the battlefield : the different social and political contexts in which each operates and the vast geographical distance separating the two groups means that each will have to face its foes with little more than moral support from each other , notwithstanding some evidence of possible collaboration in cyberspace and in terms of media production
there is the risk that fighters from africa and other areas finding it harder to migrate to the isis caliphate 's territory in the levant , may well choose to move to the boko haram emirate instead
all this suggests that it remains to be seen whether the potential benefits of affiliation with isis -- including possible new streams of recruits , funding , and media and other support -- will offset boko haram 's recent battlefield losses or outweigh the damage that it will incur as result , including greater attention from western militaries and security agencies
