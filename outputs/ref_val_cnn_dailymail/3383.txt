british will invest Â£ 180million over the next ten years in defending the falklands against a â very live â threat from argentina , defence secretary michael fallon said today
mr michael fallon said british âs military presence on the south atlantic territory would be â beefed up â following the findings of a review by top brass
there are fears of an invasion of the falklands after it emerged vladimir putin could be helping to re-arm the south american nation by leasing them 12 long - range bombers but later he told mps that there would be no more troops or fighter planes sent to the british territory after the review found british âs military forces were at the â level required â to ensure its protection against any threat
former defence minister sir gerald howarth said the reported deal with vladimir putin was â very serious â
speaking before he addressed mps in the commons , mr michael fallon told bbc radio 4 âs today programme : â the threat remains
we have to respond to it
â however in the commons he admitted that no more troops would be sent , nor would any more fighter jets be deployed after a review concluded current defence of the garrison was sufficient
he told mps : â i have endorsed the assessment â¦ that the current military presence is broadly proportionate to the threats and risks we face
â our forces in the south atlantic are entirely defensive , and are at a level required to ensure the defence of the falklands against any potential threat
â british must build up its defence capabilities in response to the threat posed by russia president vladimir putin
there are claims he is ramping up tensions in in the falklands , which have been heightened in recent years under the presidency of cristina fernandez de kirchner a source said : â i think the defence secretary meant to say â modernising â rather than â beefing up â
â amid threats from argentina , mr michael fallon said the army would deploy two raf chinook helicopters which were used in afghanistan and which would replace the search and rescue sea king helicopters already in the region
former defence minister sir gerald howarth said the reported deal with between russia and argentina was â very serious â he also announced the british would deliver enhanced operational communications to better â enable to the sharing of real time operational data â
but only four raf typhoon jets are stationed there permanently and there are no plans to increase those numbers , mr michael fallon admitted
