the police force that guards the desert state of utah will soon ask for volunteers from among its members for a particularly macabre duty
five - man firing squads are to be formed and trained in preparation for a move that critics say risks dragging u.s. back to a ' more barbaric past '
facing a crisis in the lethal injection system by which most death row inmates are normally executed , utah 's leaders have just approved a solution that harks back to the violent spirit of its wild west past
pictured is the utah firing squad execution chamber , where death row inmates are strapped into the seat in front of a wooden board to stop bullets , and beside sandbags that absorb blood splatters the state has become the first to bring back the firing squad
gary herbert , utah 's republican governor , conceded that he found the concept ' a little bit gruesome ' , but stressed that it would be used only if injection drugs are not available 30 days before a scheduled execution
thirty - two states still have the death penalty , and u.s. 's death row are clogged with more than 3,000 condemned prisoners because of a string of botched lethal injections
many of the most effective drugs are made only in europe , but the eu has told manufacturers they can not sell them if they are to be used for lethal injections
u.s. drug manufacturers have already stopped making them , worried about being associated with executions as a growing proportion of u.s. come out against the death penalty
the result ? in 2014 , 35 people were executed in the u.s. â the fewest since 1994
last july , appalled witnesses described how convicted arizona double murderer joseph wood lay gulping and gasping like a landed fish for two hours as a cocktail of drugs failed to do their job of sedating him and then stopping his heart
now , with utah 's dramatic announcement , opponents of capital punishment are questioning whether even joseph wood 's fate is less barbaric than a squad of shooters blasting away at someone tied to a chair
witnesses described how double murderer joseph wood ( pictured ) lay gulping and gasping for two hours when a cocktail of drugs failed to sedate him although a firing squad may sound like a long - gone relic of frontier justice , the largely mormon state of utah did use one five years ago
in 2010 , gardner , a convicted murderer who had killed a lawyer during a court escape attempt , threatened to sue utah if it did n't allow him to be shot
the state had stopped offering death row inmates the option of a firing squad in 2004 â but because gardner had been convicted before the law was changed , he was still able to choose it
screwed to a raised platform 25ft from the shooters ' wall , a chair is flanked by sandbags to absorb blood and prevent ricochets
following a utah tradition which means no marksman knows whether he has fired a lethal shot , one of the rifles contains a blank round made of wax
this occurred in utah in 1879 when a firing squad missed murderer wilkerson 's heart
utah 's death penalty supporters insist that a well - trained firing squad would be faster and more humane than the protracted deaths caused by botched lethal injections
in the past , politicians have also complained that condemned men have chosen a firing squad as a last burst of attention - seeking
in utah , condemned men have opted for it over lethal injection because it seems more manly
in 1977 , gilmore , one of the most notorious death row inmates of modern times , became the first person executed in the u.s. after a ten - year moratorium was lifted by the supreme court
) utah , in fact , has dispatched all three of the prisoners killed by firing squad in the u.s. since the death penalty was restored in 1976
utah â a state founded in bloodshed between mormon settlers , native tribes and federal troops â may have a sentimental attachment to the law of the gun
but other states are proving no less ruthless in their determination to find an alternative to lethal injections
death by lethal injection remains the most common method of state - sanctioned execution
pictured is the gurney at the oklahoma where death row inmates are injected politicians in alabama and tennessee have voted to bring back the electric chair , while wyoming 's state assembly passed a bill to reintroduce firing squads
even texas , which in some years executes more people than the rest of u.s. put together , recently announced it is down to its last dose of lethal injection
will a well - aimed shot to the heart kill a man as surely and humanely as a lethal injection in the arm ? the next man to find out may be former cult member ron lafferty , utah 's longest - serving death row inmate , who claimed god told him to kill his sister - in - law and her baby daughter in 1984 because she opposed his belief in polygamy
lafferty has requested a firing squad â no doubt when the time comes , his execution will spark a fierce bout of soul - searching in a nation that longs to be regarded as modern and compassionate , but on this issue is dragged back to its blood - soaked pioneer past .
