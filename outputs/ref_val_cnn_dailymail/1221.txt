have i said too much ? by carole does carole âs name sound vaguely familiar ? it is probably because you saw her in the model agency , channel 4 âs 2011 fly - on - the - wall documentary series about premier , which she founded in 1981
her colleagues â affectionate nickname for her was â the witch â
fag in hand , with a voice like a corncrake , a vocabulary that would make a navvy blush and a skin tanned to the texture of a prada handbag , she made ab fab âs patsy and edina look like maiden aunts
and her new autobiography confirms that the real world of high fashion is more outrageous than any tv drama
supermodel , linda evangelista ( pictured ) , was one of the internationally renowned models on premier 's books in the eighties as a teenager in the swinging sixties , carol had a brief career as a lucie clayton model , but gave it up because she felt self - conscious in front of the camera
at 19 , she took up with an unsuitable boyfriend ( she admits to a weakness for handsome bad boys ) and became pregnant with her daughter simone
having met a more suitable chap , she married him and landed her dream job as a booker at her former model agency , lucie clayton
the marriage did nât last , but the job did
leaving her daughter in kent with her parents ( â i did nât get to see much of my poor little simone at that time â ) , carole flung herself into a bohemian world of models , rock stars and endless wild parties
just before christmas 1981 , bobtons , the king âs road agency where she had been working , went bust , leaving â about 20 worry - faced models currently without representation â
ten days later , with Â£ 10,000 loaned by her brothers , carole signed up the bobtons girls and premier was born
a week after that , eileen ford , the tough doyennne of the new york modelling world , swept into the office to take a look at the new upstart agency , and suggested they do business
â the eighties saw the rise of the supermodel , and , with linda evangelista and naomi campbell on its books , premier was â really rocking â
in 1990 , after evangelista , christy turlington , naomi campbell , cindy crawford and tatjana patitz appeared together on the cover of british vogue , premier brokered the deal for the models to appear in george michael âs â freedom â video , in which they lip - synched the lyrics
