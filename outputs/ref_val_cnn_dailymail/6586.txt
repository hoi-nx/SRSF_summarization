' mr baines is passionate about creating meaningful experiences for those who volunteer , the workplaces who send them , and the charity , in order that everyone involved gets the ' best value ' out of the exchange
while it may seem a clinical approach to giving back to the community , mr baines said that it is crucial for businesses and individuals to make decisions about how to contribute with both the heart and head , so that the biggest impact is made on those who need it
' for companies involved in csr it would be much more effective to give 50 employees a day off each week or month to volunteer so that they are plugged in and contributing , rather than giving 300 employees one day off a year , where many will not be interested or adding value , ' mr baines said
