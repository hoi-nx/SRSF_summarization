durst 's wife has not spoken to him since explosive documentary , the jinx , aired and is now living with his lawyer , it has been revealed
in the aftermath of the documentary , which outlined the life of real estate scion durst and his possible involvement in multiple murders , many wished to know more about his wife of 15 years , charatan
charatan , a self - made real estate executive , was briefly featured in the documentary in a clip from years earlier as she gave testimony to police pertaining to the her husband 's murder of black in galveston , texas , but other than that did not participate in the film
now it has been revealed that charatan not only advised durst against participating in the documentary , but also has not spoken to him since it premiered and has been living with his lawyer
authorities are now looking to question charatan as they believe her husband is responsible for murdering his friend susan berman on christmas eve of 2000 , just two weeks after he wed charatan
because of their marriage however , charatan can not be compelled to testify against her husband as he faces possible new charges in the death of susan berman , and even if she did , durst would likely have her testimony blocked
charatan , who wed durst ( above in his booking photo following his arrest for the black murder ) in 2000 , is said to have advised durst against doing the recent documentary the jinx meanwhile , reports that charatan could also face aiding and abetting charges stemming from durst 's recent arrest in new orleans as authorities believe he was trying to flee the country for cuba , seem to be unfounded as she not only was not speaking to to him at that time but also was not responsible for sending him the $ 117,000 in cash that arrived shortly after he was taken into police custody on a warrant from los angeles county who wished to extradite him and charge him with murder in the death of susan berman
charatan has never said much about her husband , frequently refusing to comment about the man who she met at a real estate dinner in 1988 , and has kept a very low profile in recent weeks as new charges have been brought against him
both durst ( above ) and charatan admit that they only wed so she could eventually receive durst 's inheritance , though she also now can not testify against him in court durst was said to be drawn to the fact that she had worked her way up in the male dominated industry , and helped her out financially as she went through a difficult divorce and custody hearing as well as numerous lawsuits from agents who claimed they had not received their promised commission from charatan
she remains involved in real estate now , having recently taken her $ 20million share of durst 's $ 65million settlement from his claims against his family trust , to start a new company with her son , who she reconnected with roughly 10 years ago after not having spoken to the boy for 15 years
