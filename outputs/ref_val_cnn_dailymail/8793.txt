robots will use humans as pets once they achieve a subset of artificial intelligence known as ' superintelligence '
this is according to spacex - founder musk who claims that when computers become smarter than people , they will treat them like ' pet labradors '
his comments were made in a recent interview with scientist neil degrasse tyson , who added that computers could choose to breed docile humans and eradicate the violent ones
neil degrasse tyson : ' a pet lab ' musk : ' i have a pet labrador by the way
' neil degrasse tyson : ' they 'll keep the docile humans and get rid of the violent ones
' neil degrasse tyson : ' and then breed the docile humans
but in his latest interview , musk said his fears revolve around something known as superintelligence
' ' i mean , we wo n't be like a pet labrador if we 're lucky , ' musk told neil degrasse tyson , adding that we may become lab pets to them
neil degrasse tyson theorised that robots will ' get rid of the violent ones ... and then breed the docile humans '
musk also said humanity needs to be careful about what it programs superintelligent robots to do
' it may conclude that all unhappy humans should be terminated , ' musk said
