mcilroy has worn the air of a man intent on peaking at the right time this week
everything is about the build - up to augusta where the masters begins in a little over a fortnight âs time
mcilory has been tuning up for the masters this week at the arnold palmer invitational this week 's arnold palmer invitational at bay hill is mcilroy 's last competitive action before augusta the masters is the one major that mcilory is yet to get his hands on having won the other three despite his uneven form in the last month , mcilroy , 25 , has looked and sounded like a man who is exactly where he wants to be in the run - up to the tournament where victory eluded him three years ago when he collapsed on the back nine of his final round
it was important to him to play here at bay hill , partly to honour arnold palmer , who has seemed hurt in recent years when mcilroy decided to skip the tournament
