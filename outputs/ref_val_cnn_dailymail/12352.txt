the family of todashev , an associate of tamerlan tsarnaev who was killed during an fbi interrogation , plans to sue the agency
todashev 's parents filed a " notice of claim " monday , saying they plan to seek $ 30 million in a wrongful death lawsuit
the claim argues the fbi has given " no viable justification " to account for shooting and killing todashev during a 2013 interrogation in todashev 's apartment in orlando , florida
the interrogation occurred about a month after the boston marathon bombings and centered around another crime linked to bombing suspect tamerlan tsarnaev : a 2011 triple homicide in waltham , massachusetts
todashev admitted to his direct role in slashing three people 's throats in waltham and said tamerlan tsarnaev was involved as well , a federal law enforcement official told cnn in 2013
it was during that interview that todashev was shot dead
the council on american islamic relations florida filed the notice of the todashev family 's intention to sue on monday
" we are seeking answers and justice for someone who was shot seven times by an fbi agent in his own home after hours of interrogation , " said kurnaz , a spokesman for the civil rights group
" the fbi did not immediately respond to a request for comment
one law enforcement official said todashev attacked the fbi agent with a broom handle , gashing his head before the agent opened fire
" the elder todashev suggested his son may have been provoked
last year , florida state attorney ashton said after an investigation the fbi agent 's actions were justified
