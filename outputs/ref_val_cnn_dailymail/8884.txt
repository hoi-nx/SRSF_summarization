the trend for fresh , local , unprocessed foods could be putting people at risk if they opt to drink raw milk
this is according to a new study that claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill than the pasteurised version
raw milk is associated with more than half of all milk - related food borne illnesses , even though only an estimated 3.5 per cent of the population in the us drink it
but a new study claims raw milk makes people 100 times more likely to get ill raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment
advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients , such as folic acid
they also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma , hay fever and food allergies in children
advocates believe that raw milk , which contains more natural antibodies , proteins , and bacteria than pasteurised milk , is healthier , cleaner , and tastes better

they claim it can put people at risk of microbial contaminants commonly found in milk including infectious salmonella , campylobacter , and listeria species along with the most dangerous form of e. coli
cheese made from raw milk may also contain these bugs researchers at the johns hopkins center for a livable future conducted an analysis of 81 published scientific journal articles , ' ultimately , the scientific literature showed that the risk of foodborne illness from raw milk is over 100 times greater than the risk of foodborne illness from pasteurised milk , ' says report lead author benjamin davis , also a graduate student in environmental health sciences
' the study comes as incidents on three farms selling raw milk led to e. coli poisoning in five children aged one to 12 and one adult aged 28
