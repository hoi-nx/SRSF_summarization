elena serova was the first russian female cosmonaut to work on the station in two decades construction of the iss began on 20 november 1998
the soyuz tma-14m spacecraft , which brought them back to earth , departed from the space station at 10.44pm gmt on wednesday

extracted from the capsule , which was charred on re-entry , the three were seated in semi-reclined chairs ( shown ) for a breath of fresh air and first medical checks , bundled up in blankets to protect them from frigid temperatures russian 's space agency ground personnel check the soyuz tma-14m capsule shortly after the landing ' everything is great , thank you
the guys are great and worked very well , ' said a smiling elena serova , pictured here , while a female doctor measured her pulse and blood pressure the soyuz capsule landed 91 miles ( 146km ) southeast of the town of zhezkazgan , or zhezkazgan , in kazakhstan at 2.07am gmt ' everything is fine
one of several key research focus areas during expedition 42 was human health management for long - duration space travel , as nasa and roscosmos prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station
on 27 march , nasa astronaut scott kelly and roscosmos cosmonaut mikhail kornienko will undertake the first year - long stay aboard the iss , to prepare astronauts for long - duration missions to mars
the mission is designed to see how astronauts cope with such a prolonged stay in space - previously , crews only spent a maximum of six months aboard the station before returning to earth
it has been continuously manned since 2 november 2000 the soyuz tma-14m spacecraft is seen as it lands with the expedition 42 crew near the town of zhezkazgan , kazakhstan today

during his time on the orbital complex , barry wilmore ventured outside the space station with nasa astronaut terry virts on three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future us commercial crew spacecraft

flight engineers anton shkaplerov of roscosmos and samantha cristoforetti of esa are continuing station research and operations until their three new crewmates arrive in two weeks
