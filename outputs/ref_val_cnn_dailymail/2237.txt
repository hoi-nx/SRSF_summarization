cameron , hague and michael gove were left humiliated last night after commons speaker bercow survived an attempted tory coup
the prime minister and his senior colleagues immediately faced criticism over the ' grubby ' plot â in which they wanted to change the rules to make it easier to remove a speaker from parliament
one of mr bercow 's few friends on the conservative benches , walker , wept as he gave a speech in support of the speaker
senior tory said the debacle meant mr michael gove was certain to be moved as chief whip after the election
the prime minister , who raced back from an election campaign visit to take part in the vote , also faced criticism from opponents
mr cameron , who has a personal feud with mr bercow and referred to him as a ' dwarf ' in a speech in 2010 , was heard declaring as he strode into the commons : ' i would n't miss this for the world ! ' however , some of the speaker 's friends conceded it was clear that parliament is bitterly divided over his stewardship
former conservative vice chairman michael fabricant , a critic of the speaker , said : ' the question now being asked by labour mps is will bercow survive the confidence vote on the first day after general election ? ' unpopular with senior tory and lib dem ministers because of his intemperate outbursts , critics wanted to replace mr bercow with deputy speaker lindsay hoyle or the dup 's nigel dodds immediately after the election
commons leader hague today defended the move which labour branded ' petty and spiteful ' the coalition parties wanted to change the rules so that mps who vote to remove a speaker can do so in a secret ballot
labour sources revealed last night how mr bercow gave them extra time to draft mps back to parliament in sufficient numbers to save him
with labour having already let many of its mps leave parliament early to take part in election campaigning , it initially appeared the government would pass the reform with ease
cameron was all smiles as he visited a factory with boris johnson this morning , but in the commons his attempt to ambush mr bercow dramatically back fired but mr bercow 's decision to allow three separate urgent questions gave the opposition crucial hours to haul mps back to the commons
some 23 tory also voted against the government â saving mr bercow 's skin â including 1922 committee chairman graham brady , former leadership contender david davis and former frontbenchers bernard jenkin , cheryl gillan and sir edward leigh
during raucous exchanges at pm 's questions , mr cameron was shouted down by labour mps and interrupted by mr bercow
senior tory mps got so fed up with bercow 's rudeness last year that they formed what has been called ' the bbb club ' , members of which complain they have been ' bol * * * * ed by bercow '
