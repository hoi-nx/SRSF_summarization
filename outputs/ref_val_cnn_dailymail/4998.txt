tragic : five - month - old leo died on june 4 2010 , hours after his mother phoned for help a baby died from meningitis after the on - call doctor asked to examine him failed to turn up and instead left his worried parents a phone message to say he was â very busy â , an inquest heard
leo âs mother had rung nhs direct after the five - month - old boy was taken ill overnight with a high temperature and heavy breathing
a call handler from the privately run go-to - doc. scheme passed the call to duty gp dr tahghighi with a message saying he needed to visit the family because they had no transport to get to hospital or money for a taxi
instead of instructing his driver to take him to their address , however , he left two voicemail messages on leo âs mother âs mobile phone asking her to contact him
when she failed to answer , he assumed the family were asleep and that leo was ok , made a â likely diagnosis â of a viral illness and concluded that a visit was â not necessary â , the hearing was told
but four hours later , leo developed a tell - tale rash on his forehead , and although his parents called an ambulance he died later in hospital
after being challenged over what happened , dr tahghighi initially lied about having attended the house and claimed the lights were switched off when he arrived
his mother , corry , now 23 , told the hearing in manchester that in the hours before he died in june 2010 , leo had become unsettled and started making a â whimpering noise â while out in his pram
shortly before midnight she rang the nhs direct helpline , which has since been replaced by the non-emergency 111 service , and then told a health adviser from go-to-doc about leo âs condition
left , leo 's parents corry and kaine radcliffe leo âs exhausted parents then fell asleep , and when miss corry woke up four hours later she realised she had two voicemails
â symptoms : leo , pictured , had been suffering a high temperature and heavy breathing her partner called an ambulance but leo died later that day at royal manchester children âs hospital
his family has since received an apology from go-to - doc. dr tahghighi , 47 , from wilmslow , cheshire , was later suspended for 12 months for misconduct by the medical practitioners tribunal service
â dr tahghighi said that at the time he had been working an â excessive number of shifts â , including six that required him to cover if a doctor rang in sick as well as seven days at his surgery in bramhall and five overnight shifts lasting from 11pm to 7am
