when nick knight asked morgan , moments after the defeat by bangladesh , whether england were obsessed with stats , you half - expected morgan to hit back with : ' yes , but only 23.54 per cent of the time ! ' not long after , a shattered - looking moores told nasser hussain : â we âve got to have a look at the data â
and , hey presto , england âs latest cricket world cup fiasco had its epitaph
the raw data of this cricket world cup â four humiliations sandwiching a win against scotland â confirm what most non-ecb observers worked out a long time ago : england are not naturally inclined towards the one - day game , and make things worse by talking about a â brand â of cricket that bears no relation to the one they play or to the players they select
a solemn - looking england captain morgan arrives at sydney on tuesday morning the australians press has predictably stuck the boot in hard on england 's cricket world cup flops ian bell wears a sorry look as the batsman arrives in sydney ahead of the game against afghanistan jimmy anderson walks onto the team bus after flying from adelaide , scene of england 's latest humiliation mike atherton said that england were not as reliant on stats as some claim
but even if the truth lies somewhere between morgan âs denial and moores âs unwitting revelation , it seems clear that no other team talks numbers with as much pseudo-religious relish
and if it is true that england encourage the players to trust their gut instinct , why then do they bat as if they âve been told it âs ok to score at 4.5 for 20 overs ? if moores ca nât see that this is a team frightened by their own shadow ( and , no doubt , by their own shadow âs bowling average ) , then things are going to get worse before they get better
moores insisted he was still keen on the job , and downton â the man who once called him â the outstanding coach of his generation â â later declared â i âve got every faith in moores â , as if the chairmanship of a football club was the job that got away
but will the incoming ecb chairman colin graves and chief executive tom harrison share downton âs faith â or even have any faith in downton himself ? moores ( left ) was ridiculed for saying ' we 'll have to look at the data ' following defeat by bangladesh morgan shows the strain after england were dumped out of the cricket world cup before the quarter - finals bangladesh bowler rubel hossain ( centre ) celebrates during his team 's 15 - run victory on monday the case for moores âs defence revolves around the fact that england have been mainly hopeless at one - day cricket since the 1992 cricket world cup
but moores is nearly a year into his second stint , and england are going backwards
for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on twitter : @ the_topspin moores is a genuine and decent man , as ego - free as any coach on the international circuit
he did nât write the ecb âs strategic plan , which cited winning this cricket world cup as one of its â key measures â
for moores , the results are beginning to look as wasteful as an eu butter mountain
is it any surprise that his batting has disintegrated ? then there was the tinkering for england âs tournament opener against australia
what possessed moores to demote james taylor from no 3 , and replace him with gary ballance , who had just returned from injury , rather than with alex hales , a proven match - winner in limited - overs internationals ? moores is due to rouse the likes of stuart broad for ashes in the summer - but will he still be in a job ? joe root was one of five top - order batsmen caught behind against bagladesh in test - style dismissals old foe mitchell johnson ( centre ) and the mighty australians await england again in the ashes and what of the tendency to err on the side of caution ? against bangladesh , five of the top seven were out caught in the slip cordon , as if they were playing test cricket
if these things are not moores âs department , what are ? graves must now decide whether england can risk giving the downton / moores ticket a crack at the ashes â victory in which , by the way , also forms part of the ecb âs strategic plan
colin graves may be unimpressed with england âs out - of - date tactics in australia , and equally concerned to hear downton tell sky sports : â what has struck me has been how much influence t20 is having on one - day cricket , and a lot of our players do n't play much t20 cricket , so that is clearly something we have to look at
that was the week that was kevin pietersen on the money kevin pietersen âs views may not be welcome at high command , but he had a pertinent point to make after england âs 15 - run defeat by bangladesh
â we played a back to back ashes to make sure england played 6 months of odi 's before this wc ! â and he âs right
far from helping england in either event , the rejigged schedule has , in successive winters , produced the joint - worst ashes defeat in history and their most miserable exit yet from a cricket world cup
a home loss to australia this summer and the ecb will have presided over quite the hat - trick
