the growing number of dance studios around australia offering classes to children as young as four has sparked criticism from advocates against the sexualisation of young girls as well as the australian family association , but many in the industry claim pole fitness is purely about exercise
' unfortunately in australia pole is still associated for the majority as something that takes place in a strip club , [ but that ] is an adult stereotype that is placed on a perfectly legitimate workout , ' lisa singh , who runs classes for children from her studio in melbourne 's east , told daily mail australia
while the studio also offers classes for adults , she maintains that none of the moves that the juniors are taught could be considered sexual and that the activity is a fantastic activity for children and teenagers
' for a lot of parents it can be difficult to motivate teenagers to exercise and get involved in sports , pole is just another avenue that can be utilised to help build strength , stay healthy , active and build confidence , ' she said
