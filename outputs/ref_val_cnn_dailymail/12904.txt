jerusalem a newly released isis video shows a child shooting a man the group claims is an israeli spy
the video identifies the man as 19 - year - old musallam , an israeli citizen of palestinian descent
in the video , isis shows musallam 's israeli passport and claims he 's an agent sent to infiltrate the group
the 19 - year - old 's family told cnn tuesday that he had no ties with the mossad , israeli 's spy agency , and had , in fact , been recruited by isis
" musallam told me and his brother that isis took him , " according to said musallam , his father
" it was n't long before musallam 's family members did n't recognize him when they talked to him on skype
but his son never made it back to israeli
a video posted tuesday on isis - affiliated social media accounts shows a man who appears to be musallam on his knees , wearing an orange jumpsuit
an issue last month of isis ' english-language propaganda magazine , dabiq , included a purported interview with musallam and described his alleged work for the israeli spy agency
in the isis video , musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession , saying he is an israeli intelligence agent working for mossad , sent to infiltrate isis
musallam 's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video , forced to lie about ties to israeli intelligence
an isis propaganda video released in january -- one that cnn could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head
last august , a photo posted to twitter from an isis stronghold showed a 7 - year - old boy holding a man 's severed head and his father 's words , " that 's my boy
human rights watch says isis and other extremist groups " have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions
