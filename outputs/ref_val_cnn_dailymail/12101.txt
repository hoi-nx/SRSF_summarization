the video shows emwazi , identified last week as the islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in syria , being chosen by a classmate to join in with a game of lunchtime football
the previously - unseen footage was filmed 11 years ago at qunitin kynaston academy , the secondary school in st john 's wood , north london , where emwazi was educated
in the film , obtained by channel 4 news , the ' football mad ' teenager , thought to be around 15 at the time , is the second person to be chosen for the team
one of his fellow pupils can be clearly heard shouting ' football mad ' emwazi ' , beckoning over the future jihadi
but he also appears to be painfully shy , instantly raising his arm to cover his face when he knew the camera was focusing on him
channel 4 news said emwazi had been identified in the video by two different people that he knew at the time
according to a former friend of his brother omar , emwazi and two bearded associates abducted two gang members in 2008 , while he was living on the notorious mozart estate in west london
' since being identified , emwazi has emerged as a fun - loving young boy , who adored the simpsons , playstation games and eating chips
he was also said to have wanted to become a premier league star , scoring goals for manchester united by the age of 30
but , a decade later , emwazi had shunned british life and was a ' known wolf ' to mi5 , having already taken the path towards becoming isis ' most notorious murderer
in a chilling twist , in a school yearbook from when he was 10 , emwazi lists his favourite computer game as shooting game ' duke nukem : time to kill ' and his favourite book as ' how to kill a monster ' from the popular children 's goosebumps series
he also lists his favourite band as pop group s club 7 , and when asked what he wants to be when he is 30 , writes : ' i will be in a football team and scoring a goal
' emwazi also listed his favourite colour as blue , his favourite animal as a monkey , his favourite cartoon as the simpsons and chips as his favourite food

but , at some point during his lifetime , emwazi was radicalised and was soon on the radar of mi5
