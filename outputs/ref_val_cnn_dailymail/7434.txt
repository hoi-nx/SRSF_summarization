six months ago kobane was a city in panic as the kurdish were desperately fleeing isis forces as they bared down on the border town , fearful that they would be slaughtered like the yazidis before them if the settlement was overrun by the fanatical jihadis
the battle for kobane was the fiercest and most bloody battle of the war against isis to date , and represented the group 's first major defeat after months of virtually unopposed victories which saw them take swathes of territory in iraq and syrian
victory was secured at the end of january after the last isis fighters were forced from the city 's suburbs and into their strongholds along the euphrates river
the residents who survived or have returned are now faced with living in conditions like this pride : a syrian kurdish woman sweeps rubble out of what is left of her home after isis fighters fled the city of kobane
now they can return , but little of their previous home remains desperate : with little or no access to water and electricity , this young girl is forced to light a fire underneath rubble in the street to keep warm and cook her food shattered : a kobane sign riddled with bullets and shrapnel marks mirrors the condition of the few building that are left standing around it homecoming : after four months of fierce fighting the kurdish , who were facing near extinction at the hands of isis , are able to return to what is left of their home town and begin rebuilding it flattened : a girl rides in a trailer being towed into kobane by tractor as rows of levelled houses can be seen in the background
the city was heavily bombed by coalition warplanes during six months of fighting in order to dislodge isis troops taking cover there all gone : a kurdish man looks out over the destroyed city of kobane from the balcony of his bullet - riddled home , just over a month after the last isis fighters fled for their strongholds along the euphrates river littered : a woman stands among the ruins of her old home , as the streets around her are scattered with rubble , clothes , and ruined cars destroyed : the remains of another tank are testament to the ferocity of the fighting in kobane
