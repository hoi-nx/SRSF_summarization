mention the words " sand " and " golf " together , and the chances are you 'll leave many players shuddering at the memory of being trapped in bunkers after another wayward shot
but in other parts of the world , sand golf is a version of the game in its own right
half a century ago , expat oil workers with an enthusiasm for golf had nowhere in abu dhabi to play
if the ball lands outside them , it 's in the sand golf equivalent of the rough -- stony terrain that the unwary player may soon find is home to a few snakes and a lizard or two
greens ? well , they 're known as " browns , " built from clay and topped with a mixture of sand and oil to provide a true putting surface , a formula arrived at through trial and error
back in 1961 , determined british oil workers created a sand course on an atoll known as das island , around 100 miles off abu dhabi in the persian gulf
as the expat population grew , so did the demand for the game , and in 1971 sand golf moved into abu dhabi proper with the opening of a course near the sea palace
but although many sand course players changed surface and took up the more conventional game , several battled on and the 18 - hole al ghazal sand course was created near abu dhabi airport , with its front nine occupying part of an archaeological site , in 1997
sand golf also exists in parts australia and africa but al ghazal ( which translates as " gazelle " -- gazelles peer from behind a fence by the second brown , ) is the only one that can be described as " world class , " says cox , an expert on the game , because the scale and scope of its layout rivals its grass counterparts
maybe that 's understandable when you consider some of the extra elements involved in the sand game -- the browns , for example , must be swept for a few minutes after use so that they are left smooth and footprint-less for following players , while unexpected hazards can include burrows dug by desert lizards
david bachmann , who formerly worked at the austrian embassy in the city , wrote on his in tripolis blog about the experience of playing sand golf in and near the city
" for now , and against the odds , fans of this form of the game will just have to make do with being kings of their very own sand castles .
