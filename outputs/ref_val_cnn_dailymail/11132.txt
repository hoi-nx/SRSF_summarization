a toddler has been dubbed the real - life elsa from the disney film frozen because she faces a daily battle to keep warm
gracie , two , suffers from raynaud 's syndrome , and turns blue when she is exposed to the cold
the condition occurs when small blood vessels in the extremities are over-sensitive to changes in temperature , interrupting the blood supply
during an attack , the extremities become first white and dead looking and may then turn blue and finally red and burning when the blood flow is restored
gracie is so badly affected she has been given special gloves for extra protection during an attack , the extremities become first white and dead looking and may then turn blue and finally red and burning when the blood flow is restored most patients can cope by wrapping up warm , although some develop painful weeping ulcers , which can become infected

her mother laurie , 27 , said : ' when she gets cold , she turns blotchy blue
' gracie 's condition means even normal activities such as going outside can become a challenge , and she is not allowed to eat ice cream or consume very cold drinks
' the winter months are awful , ' said her mother , who takes gracie 's temperature three times a day to check it does n't drop too low
' gracie 's condition means even normal activities such as going outside can become a challenge , and she is not allowed to eat ice cream or consume very cold drinks her mother said : ' when she gets cold , she turns blotchy blue
it starts in her hands then travels up her arms , feet , legs then face ' gracie also frequently suffers raynaud 's attacks at bath time
her mother added : ' it 's scary
' gracie , from barry , south wales , was diagnosed with raynaud 's a year ago when she was 16 months old - despite her mother noticing from birth she was often cold and turning blue
gracie is now learning to cope with the condition - helped by snow queen elsa from the disney film frozen
her mother said : ' gracie absolutely loves frozen and when i noticed that she was a bit like elsa , she thought it was brilliant ' raynaud 's condition , triggered by a sudden drop in temperature , causes the blood vessels in the fingers and toes contract , cutting off blood supply
typically , raynaud âs causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb
then , as the blood flow returns , they turn blue and eventually red , accompanied by a burning sensation
although attacks peak in the cold winter months , symptoms can be triggered by everyday tasks such as taking food out of the freezer , air conditioning , or even stress â all of which cause blood vessels to contract
