i brought you the manchester united haters test a few weeks ago â you can read it here
â what âs the first thing you think about when you hear the name rooney ? a ) how close he is to breaking scoring records with manchester united and england b ) any of the following - being punched in his kitchen by phil bardsley , demanding a massive salary at manchester united or barking into the camera at the 2010 world cup and at west ham
rooney played a key role in manchester united 's win over tottenham on sunday rooney scored the third goal for manchester united in their win at old trafford liverpool ca n't expect any loyalty from raheem sterling if they are not prepared to offer him the same deal as daniel sturridge chelsea look knackered ... jose mourinho must start putting his faith in youth or he 'll blow the premier league one thing i have discovered about england is that if you come from humble beginnings , but go on to improve your lot in life , the reaction of the rest of the country will be split
and rooney is a classic example
i take one look at rooney âs career and i âm seriously impressed
rooney celebrated by mocking the story that he was knocked out in a playful fight with phil bardsley rooeny collapsed to the floor after scoring in reference to being ' knocked out ' by phil bardsley video van gaal refuses to discuss ' ridiculous ' rooney story but others concentrate on things away from the football pitch and twist them into a reason to condemn rooney
i even had one twitter clown so obsessed with bringing rooney down that he told me he had a violent streak â just because he fouled someone
so if you are a football lover , what was the big story on sunday ? was it rooney leading manchester united superbly , scoring a brilliant goal and getting three crucial points against tottenham ? rooney was criticised by some fans for swearing into a tv camera after scoring at west ham in 2011 rooney is closing in on goalscoring records for both manchester untied and england or was it rooney messing around in his own home with a mate and doing absolutely nothing wrong ? rooney âs celebration said it all
but is it a reason to hammer rooney ? and should he be judged as a footballer because of it ? those who ca nât handle rooney âs success need to look at themselves
are they upset because he achieved in life while they did nât ? or do they dribble and drool over their keyboards because they hate everything about manchester united ? rooney gets into every team in the world â from manchester united to munich to madrid and man city
unless you hate manchester united , or you âre jealous of rooney âs success and wealth
