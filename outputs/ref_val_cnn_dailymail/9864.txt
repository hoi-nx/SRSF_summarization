a teenage girl has been beaten to death and set on fire in a nigeria market after being accused of being a suicide bomber
police officers said a second suspected teenage girl was also accused of being a suicide bomber and was arrested at the muda lawal market , the biggest market in bauchi in north east nigeria
a yam vendor said people discovered one of the girls had two bottles strapped to her body so they clubbed her to death , put a tyre doused in fuel over her head and set it on fire
but police spokesman mohammad haruna said it seemed doubtful the girl was a bomber and described her as the victim of ' mob action carried out by an irate crowd '
a spate of such attacks has been blamed on nigeria 's homegrown boko haram extremist group , which wants to enforce strict islamic law across nigeria
last year the terror group kidnapped hundreds of schoolgirls from the town of chibok - sparking fears they are being used to carry out the suicide bombings

this incident was the first in a wave of suicide attacks by women and girls in nigeria
