ban : new new machar school in aberdeenshire , above , will not allow children to watch the eclipse on friday in mr paul rooke 's letter , he wrote : ' it is with disappointment that i need to advise you that we will no longer be purchasing the solar eclipse glasses and viewing the eclipse as a school
' this is after further careful consideration of the health and safety advice , alongside guidance from aberdeenshire 's health and safety colleagues
' clearly the school will never take any risks around pupil safety and wellbeing
mr paul rooke referred to an online report which suggested the protective glasses may be too big to be worn securely by children , and that children under ten should only watch the eclipse on tv or with an indirect viewer
the partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on friday , march 20 , and will be visible for thousands of kilometres parents of the pupils at newmachar primary in aberdeenshire said they were disappointed they would miss out on witnessing the phenomenon , which will not reoccur in uk until 2026
' i understand that it 's for the kids ' safety , but if the glasses fit my kids correctly i 'd let them see it
my daughter kirsty was looking forward to seeing the eclipse , but the school has got to put safety first really
' maria walker , aberdeenshire 's director of education and children 's services , said : ' schools will decide individually on activities to watch the eclipse and will do so safely
local councillor fergus hood added : ' some might say this is health and safety gone mad but i think the school is doing the right thing to protect the children 's eyesight
' new new machar is not the first school to make the ruling
whitchurch primary school in cardiff said it will not let children watch the natural display outside , even if they have bought special glasses with solar filters
instead , the primary school will show the eclipse on a live feed inside the school premises
' that 's not to say that you ca n't watch the eclipse on friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection
