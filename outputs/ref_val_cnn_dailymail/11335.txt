william tallon was more than just the mother âs favourite servant
he rose from impoverished beginnings to become her confidant and close friend
as the first part of a remarkable new biography revealed last week , william tallon was also a predatory homosexual who breached royal security by bringing young men back to clarence house at night
here , in the final extract of backstairs billy , we reveal that courtiers took their revenge by banishing him from the mother âs side , shamefully disregarding her wish that he should be allowed to live at clarence house for the rest of his life
and whatever became of his meticulous diary , the â black book â of life with the royals ? so close : backstairs billy with the mother on her 88th birthday in 1988 ( right )
he cuts a lonely figure in 2003 ( left ) , a year after her death within days of william tallon âs death in november 2007 , a small group of men were seen entering his flat in kennington , south london
all backstairs billy âs possessions were boxed up and put in storage
would you expect your former employer to visit your house and go through your things ? we do nât know for sure , but that âs what we think happened â the royal household had sent a team to go through backstairs billy âs possessions before they were sold ... â william tallon would tell anyone who listened that the mother had promised him that his little gatehouse cottage at clarence house would be his home for life
â rumours : backstairs billy said he knew princess diana was having affairs while still married to charles some months after the mother âs death in march 2002 , backstairs billy received a short letter telling him that gate lodge had to be vacated
backstairs billy did nât find his new life easy
for years he had organised lunches and dinners for the mother , but he had never had to make his own meals
backstairs billy had developed a taste for the finer things in life and he was suddenly cut off from them all
backstairs billy was an amusing man with a remarkable history and he was invited to an endless series of parties , which gave him a faint glow of the life he had once enjoyed with the mother
â backstairs billy spent night after night in his local pub , the dog house , where he would get drunk and invite all and sundry back to the flat â anything was better than being alone
a friend recalled : â backstairs billy sometimes went into terrible glooms that were alleviated only by alcohol
it was a habit he had got into at clarence house
â despite being regaled as the grand old man of royal service , his friends say that backstairs billy became a humbler figure in exile
â the household disliked me because i was too close to the mother
â in his most bitter moments , he recalled how , in the mother âs last months , when she was too confused to know what was going on around her , he became so frustrated by repeated refusals to let him see her that he became hysterical
close friends : the loyal servant dancing with the mother at balmoral as prince charles watches royal advice : the queen mother ( pictured with queen elizabeth , left , and princess margaret , right ) had told backstairs billy to ' never trust anyone ' â i was upset and they did nât care , â he said
â perhaps backstairs billy , more than anyone , should have heeded the advice given to him by the mother , who told him at the beginning of their relationship : â whatever you do , william tallon , never trust anyone
a close friend of backstairs billy âs said : â he was definitely writing something , which is perhaps why so many odd things happened after he died
â i âm sure that in the same way that someone probably destroyed the mother âs instructions that backstairs billy should be allowed to stay on at gate lodge , they also destroyed whatever it was he had written about his life at clarence house
another oddity is that not a scrap of written material survived the visit by the unidentified team of young men seen visiting his apartment , including the memoir he was thought to be writing â and especially his â black book â , as his diary was known
william tallon would tell anyone who listened that the mother had promised him his little gatehouse cottage at clarence house ( pictured ) would be his home for life his solicitor , who was also his executor , clearly felt a few letters and mementos were unlikely to fetch a fortune
the highlight was a short , handwritten letter from the mother to backstairs billy asking him to prepare for an outdoor lunch on a trip to scotland
