surgeons often describe the tricky operation to remove a brain tumour as â trying to pluck a spider out of jelly â
take out too little and the cancerous â legs â remain and regrow â but take out too much and there is a risk of cutting away healthy tissue and leaving the patient disabled
now a british hospital is trialling a laser that bleeps like a parking sensor on a car when the scalpel gets to the edge of the cancerous areas , letting surgeons know their margins for error
in a world first , neurosurgeons at london âs imperial college healthcare nhs trust have started using the pen - like probe , called the core , which shines a near - infrared light on to a tumour and scans for subtle differences between healthy and cancerous tissue
about 16,000 british are diagnosed with a brain tumour every year , and more children and adults under 40 die from the condition than from any other cancer
the probe was used for the first time during brain surgery at imperial last week as part of a trial that will involve 30 patients over the next year
surgeons believe the pen - like probe could shave up to 30 minutes off the average three - hour surgery time ( picture posed by models ) instead of taking a physical sample , a surgeon holds the core over the area being operated on and a beam is emitted from the tip of the probe , scanning for changes in the chemical composition of brain tissue
mr vaqas believes using the core could shave up to 30 minutes off the average three - hour surgery time
â having a device that takes less than a second to tell the difference between healthy and cancerous tissue means we could potentially avoid taking unnecessary biopsies , and also perform more surgeries in a day , â he says
