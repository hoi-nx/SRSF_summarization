a mother whose son suffered brain damage at birth has been awarded Â£ 5.2million after a 16 - year battle with the nhs
scotland âs highest court had twice rejected nadine montgomery âs claim that medical negligence caused her son âs physical disabilities
but in a landmark legal ruling seven judges of the supreme court in london upheld the 40 - year - old mother âs claim in what was described as â the most significant medical negligence judgment in 30 years â
nadine montgomery , whose son suffers from cerebral palsy after he was starved of oxygen during birth , argued she was not properly advised on having a cesarean by medics at nhs lanarkshire mrs nadine montgomery expressed delight yesterday that the care of her son , sam , who suffers from cerebral palsy , was now guaranteed
â first - time mother mrs nadine montgomery gave birth to her son in bellshill maternity hospital , run by nhs lanarkshire , in october 1999
shoulder dystocia occurs when a baby becomes stuck during delivery , potentially starving the infant of oxygen and leading to brain defects
ms nadine montgomery , a type 1 diabetes sufferer , said the risks of natural delivery , and the prospect of having a cesarean , were not discussed with her
her son , sam , suffered from shoulder dystocia during birth , and now has cerebral palsy
he was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy , caused by permanent brain injury at birth
at an earlier hearing , judges heard it was not dr mclellan âs â practice â to discuss the potential risks of shoulder dystocia , claiming that the risk for the baby was very small , and that cesarean were not in the â maternal interests â of women
her claim for compensation was twice rejected by scotland 's highest court , but she was yesterday awarded Â£ 5.2million after london 's supreme court overturned the ruling ( file image ) â there can be no doubt it was incumbent on dr mclellan to advise mrs nadine montgomery of the risk of shoulder dystocia if she were to have her baby by vaginal delivery , and to discuss with her the alternative of delivery by cesarean
i believe that i have a right to know of all the risks surrounding sam 's birth and i am pleased the supreme court has recognised that
