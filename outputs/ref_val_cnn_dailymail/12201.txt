london previously secret correspondence between britain 's charles and government officials is to be made public after a supreme court ruling thursday
the guardian newspaper had been fighting for the communications to be released since 2005
charles is next in line to the britain throne and as king would constitutionally be required to maintain strict political neutrality
after the judgment was released thursday , guardian editor - in - chief rusbridger said the paper was " delighted " about the supreme court 's decision after what he said was a " brilliant 10 - year campaign by guardian reporter evans
" " the government wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to cover up these letters , admitting their publication would ' seriously damage ' perceptions of the charles 's political neutrality
" these were private letters , never meant for public consumption , which is why the charles 's office has resisted their release , " he said
" prime minister david cameron said the judgment was " disappointing " and the government would now look at how to release the letters
" the charles 's official residence , clarence house , issued a brief statement about the decision
" in a statement issued on the eve of the decision , smith branded the monarchy one of britain 's " most secretive institutions
" evans , the guardian reporter , had been fighting a legal battle to get the letters published since 2005 when he requested disclosure of communications between charles and various government departments under the britain 's freedom of information act and environmental regulations
the guardian reported in 2009 that charles had written to treasury , foreign office and education department ministers over the previous three years and that his aides had also written letters to government officials
the upper tribunal ruled in 2012 that many of the letters , " advocacy correspondence , " should be disclosed , but its decision was vetoed by britain 's attorney general , who issued a certificate overriding it
" the guardian challenged the veto in court , but three high court judges dismissed it , so evans appealed to the supreme court , which on thursday ruled that the attorney general was not entitled to issue the certificate .
