a survivor of the columbine high school massacre lost his state football championship ring a decade ago and had it returned to him by a homeless veteran in california
todd , 31 , who was the first person shot in the library during the april 20 , 1999 shooting spree in colorado , lost the ring while on a speaking tour in california in 2003 or 2004

bobby smith , 60 , a homeless veteran returned the ring engraved with todd 's name last week after finding it among stones in a creek in san luis obispo , california while searching for arrowheads
