barrington , new hampshire u.s. sen. ted cruz was delivering his normal rhetoric during a new hampshire speech on sunday , hitting the current administration on the economy , obamacare and national security
" and the obama - clinton foreign policy of leading from behind -- the whole world is on fire , " the senator from texas declared
ted cruz took it and ran with it
" the scene -- while cute -- captured ted cruz 's determination to remain unwavering in his views and language , never backtracking
" ted cruz is bringing the resolute disruptor brand that he 's built in congress out on the trail as he lays the groundwork for a white house bid
this weekend , he was on a two - day swing through new hampshire , stopping sunday afternoon at an event put on by the strafford county gop
in the same way ted cruz challenges establishment republicans in the senate , he 's trying to build a campaign that breaks from the mold and showcases his firebrand conservatism
for example , his first question from the audience came from a woman who wanted to know how ted cruz was going to make campaign finance reform a reality , a huge issue in the first - in - the - nation primary state
while nearly every other potential candidate expressed at least some measure of support for the mandate , ted cruz flatly opposed it , saying in front of close to a thousand iowa farmers that he does n't think the government should be involved in the private sector
" ted cruz got heavy applause when he said he wanted to " repeal every word of common core , " a set of testing standards that bush staunchly defended when he appeared at a nearby event in dover , new hampshire just two days earlier
still , ted cruz played somewhat coy with his white house aspirations , aware of the tight federal regulations that would start holding contenders to different standards once they admit they 're running for president
when voters pressed him sunday to make a white house bid , ted cruz told them to " stay tuned
" but he truly charmed the crowd when he said that after he and his wife got their daughters a puppy recently , one of the girls gave her approval for ted cruz 's presidential aspirations
in terms of energy and turnout , sunday 's event stood out from other events held by potential white house contenders who were in new hampshire this weekend , in part because it was open to the public , unlike other events headlined by walker and bush
halfway through ted cruz 's remarks , a small - business owner in the audience was called on to ask a question but instead stood up proudly next to the senator and went off into a two - minute rant about how other republican in washington are n't representing their conservative constituents
" it is d-day in u.s. folks , " he said , getting the crowd on their feet
" for those who believe in miracles , this gentleman just threw his wallet at a politician , " ted cruz said , getting a big laugh from the crowd
one man , higgins , stood outside in the snow for four hours hoping ted cruz would meet his goat named izak , an apparent fixture on the campaign trail which was wearing a hat that said " i voted " and who happened to bite jon huntsman in 2011
ted cruz waved hello at higgins as the senator exited the building sunday afternoon but did n't stop to greet the goat
