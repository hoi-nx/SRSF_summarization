a ' nearly pristine ' 600 million - year - old sponge has been uncovered in southern china
its discovery pushes back the start of the evolution of multicellular animals to before the cambrian explosion 541 million years ago
a ' nearly pristine ' 600 million - year - old sponge has been uncovered in southern china.scientists believe the sponge â which represents the most primitive creature on earth - is the oldest ever found the cambrian explosion , around 541 million years ago , was a wide variety of animals burst onto the evolutionary scene
before about 580 million years ago , most organisms were simple , composed of individual cells occasionally organised into colonies
it ended with the cambrian - ordovician extinction event , approximately 488 million years ago
the latest discovery pushes back the date of multicellular animal evolution to 60 million years before the cambrian explosion started
estimates range from 700 million years ago to a time known as the cambrian period , which took place 541 million to 485 million years ago
the latest finding would place the sponge around 60 million years before the cambrian started
the sponge , found in the doushantuo formation in southern china ( left ) , suggests the date of multicellular animal evolution was 60 million years before the cambrian explosion started
lead author maoyan zhu told ibtimes uk that the find suggests that animals on earth began diversifying 600 million years ago
