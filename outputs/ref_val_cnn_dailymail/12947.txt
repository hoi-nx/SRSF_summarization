american floyd mayweather and filipino manny pacquiao are set to officially announce their heavily anticipated boxing match at a press conference in los angeles wednesday
" nowadays you have to be on social media to launch the fight and to build hype , " says boxing promoter sauerland , ceo of team sauerland
" thirty - eight year old floyd mayweather ( 47 - 0 , 26 knockouts ) , who favors the moniker " the money man " or " tbe " ( the best ever ) , boasts nearly five million instagram followers , 5.65 million followers on twitter and 9.2 million facebook likes
he famously confirmed the fight via shots , a photo sharing social media application that he 's invested in , and displays links to his clothing brand , the money team , on all his accounts
along with professing to the be the best fighter of all time , he could also stake a claim to be one of the greatest social media users in sports
you 've got the guy who throws the money around ( floyd mayweather ) , that 's his image , and manny pacquiao , he 's the hope of a nation
" although manny pacquiao ( 57 - 5 - 2 , 38 knockouts ) also sports millions of followers , his social media numbers lag behind that of his opponent
has this disparity had an impact on manny pacquiao 's share of the fight 's heady purse , which is reported to be split 60/40 in favor of floyd mayweather ? " if you have five million twitter followers it does give you power in negotiation , because it reflects popularity , " says sauerland
" but floyd mayweather needs manny pacquiao too ; you need a storyline to make a good fight ... ( manny pacquiao ) is the route to make it the biggest purse in history
" manny pacquiao is a little bit more of a private person ; he 's not going to be as outspoken and give away as much , so he 's always going to have a smaller following , " he says , while noting that instagram is less popular outside of north america and europe
" if the only place you can find out what 's happening behind the scenes in the lead - up to the fight is via their social media feeds , you 're going to follow them , " mclaren says
" if you have the choice between a different number of athletes to sponsor , and one has a million instagram followers while the other does n't go on social media , then it 's a no - brainer
