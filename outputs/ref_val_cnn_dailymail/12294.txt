the next time the people of capracotta , italian , hear the folks in boston complain about a snow season of more than 100 inches , they 'll be like : " that 's nice
" in 18 hours , actually
it 's not an official record yet , but it looks like the italian village got 100.8 inches ( 256 centimeters ) on thursday , setting the all - time mark for most snow in 24 hours
one of the photos posted on meteoweb , the italian weather website that reported the immense snowfall , showed a resident standing on top of the accumulation shaking hands with a neighbor
the world meteorological organization will confirm whether the snowfall actually surpassed the 24 - hour snowfall record -- 75.8 inches -- from silver lake , colorado , set in 1921
meteoweb reported that the snow fell in 18 hours and that in unpopulated areas at higher altitudes , it is likely accumulations were much more significant
