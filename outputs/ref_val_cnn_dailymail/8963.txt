a big question looming over corden 's americans chat show debut is : ' will the audience get his humor ? ' but it seems the first major hurdle facing the british comedian is whether some americans even recognize him
the employee asks for corden for an identification badge , but corden is forced to explain he has just got back from lunch , while patting down his pockets
a frustrated corden then starts arguing with the man , saying he is the host of the chat show and points to a huge poster of his face on the side of the building
reaching boiling point , corden tries to muscle his way past the guard , but he gives up , throws his hands up in the air and says : ' i 'm calling the building
corden is refused entry to the cbs building in los angeles because he does n't have a badge the british comedian ( far right ) tries to replicate the face he is making on the massive poster hanging on the wall of the studio at one point corden asks the employee : ' what do you mean there is no resemblance ? it looks exactly the same as me
