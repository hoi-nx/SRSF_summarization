last week she was unveiling her new clothing collection for dorothy perkins in newcastle and today she 's modelling her summer range , so is amy essex 's most successful export ? it would appear so
the beautician - turned - designer , who found fame on towie , became a millionaire thanks to her burgeoning brand - and there 's just no stopping her
speaking to femail about her chic new range of springtime skater dresses , peplums , strappy tops , and feminine blouses , amy , 23 , said : ' i âve really branched out for ss15
' amy has certainly been shaking things up in the wardrobe department and says while she believes people sometimes see her as one dimensional , she says that behind closed doors she 'd love to go wild with her style
' amy says that she wanted to give the ' lovely ladies ' something to dress up in that updated their wardrobe but also flatters and admits she 's been thinking long and hard about her new designs while her former towie co-stars do support her fashion career , amy has her sights set on hollywood and would love to dress khloe kardashian and dakota johnson in her designs despite her successes , amy still believes that , like victoria beckham , it 's difficult to be taken seriously as a designer after finding fame in another industry
' i âve tried hard to break out of that towie box and i think i âve done that , ' she said
' i was only on there for two seasons but people instantly pigeon hole you as " essex " , but that âs not what i âm about and my collection is for everyone ; i do nât just design for towie fans
' while her former co-stars do support her fashion career , amy has her sights set on hollywood
' i âd love to dress dakota johnson , ' she admitted
khloe kardashian is another one - she has such amazing curves and is so stunning
' so what kind of relationship is amy looking for ? ' one like the beckhams ' , ' she said
