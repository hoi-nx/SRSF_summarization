last week he was the face of comic relief , fronting the annual fundraising telethon watched by millions that raised Â£ 1billion for good causes
but now the leftwing firebrand russell brand has launched an astonishing attack on the very same charity , claiming he felt ' compromised ' by accepting the gig
during his show at london 's proud archivist on sunday , russell brand , 39 , asked : ' is it right to do comic relief ? plus is any f * * * er watching it ? ' he said
' he then appeared to launch a scathing attack on uk charities , claiming they were ' part of the problem '
during the charity telethon , russell brand said : ' i 'm in the unfortunate position of having to ask you to donate money to buy syringes , literally the exact opposite of how i spend most of my time , and the previous two decades of my life , ' he said
the comedian and self - styled revolutionary said : ' ultimately taking responsibility away from the centralised powers of created government , corporations and alleviating that stress and tensions by placing the burden once more on ordinary people
' is charity part of the problem ? ' despite his bizarre rant , russell brand admitted those behind ' comic relief had ' good intentions '
just two days after the comic relief gig , and asked an audience at his show at london 's proud archivist ( pictured ) if charity was ' part of the problem ? ' the comedian and self - styled revolutionary has been an open supporter of several charities and has joined protests against austerity cuts including occupy london last october ( pictured ) ' it 's not clear what mr russell brand 's proposed solution is
mr russell brand has , in his own particular way , highlighted an age - old philosophical debate about where the boundaries of the state 's responsibility should lie , which has never had a clear answer ' charities run high - quality , innovative services that are responsive to the needs in different areas
' a spokesman for comic relief said : ' russell brand has been involved in comic relief in many brilliant ways over the years and we 're enormously grateful
' last december , russell brand was accused of hypocrisy after he ranted about rising rents in london even though he lives in a Â£ 2million bachelor pad owned by a firm based in a tax haven
the millionaire comedian and self - styled revolutionary flew into a rage when it was suggested he was part of the housing problem in trendy hoxton , east london , where he rents a Â£ 5,000 - a - month loft
but russell brand lost his temper when tv reporter o'brien asked him whether the super-rich buying up property in london was driving up prices for everyone else
' simon cowell labelled russell brand a ' hypocrite ' last year accused of being ' part of the problem ' of rocketing housing prices , russell brand , 39 , said : ' i am part of the solution
' he suggested his fame meant he was able to ' amplify the voices of ordinary people '
asked again about his house , russell brand pointed his finger in o'brien 's face and said : ' it 's rented
' refusing to answer further questions about his own housing costs , russell brand terminated the two - minute interview and accused the reporter of trying to wreck his campaign , saying : ' snides like you , mate , undermine it
simon cowell also labelled russell brand a ' hypocrite ' last year after he accused the comedian of accepting large hollywood film salaries whilst campaigning against the uk political system
the music mogul told russell brand to give up his multi-million pound salary if he was planning to continue his campaigning streak
