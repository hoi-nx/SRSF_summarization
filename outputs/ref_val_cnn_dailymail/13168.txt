my vote for father of the year goes to schilling
the former major league baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually - explicit comments about schilling 's teenage daughter
the drama started , innocently enough , on february 25 , when schilling played the role of a proud father
he sent a tweet congratulating his daughter , gabby , on being accepted to salve regina university , where she 'll play softball
it read : " congrats to gabby schilling who will pitch for the salve regina seahawks next year ! ! â schilling ( @ gehrig38 ) " almost immediately , responses came in from young men , complete strangers who apparently followed schilling on twitter
but not before schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog
these misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity , the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites , where you feel free to be a despicable human being because , you think , no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words
according to schilling , who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are , two people have already paid a price due to their tweets
concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide , schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved
i 'm sure that , all across america , dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at schilling 's self - control
so what additional insights can we draw , and what larger lessons can we learn , from this unexpected but predictable collision of old - fashioned parenthood and newfangled media ? there are a few
but schilling would n't let them
at their best , social media sites like twitter , facebook , instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community
we need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability
if you do n't have social skills , you do n't belong on social media
this whole drama unfolded because schilling was proud of his daughter
