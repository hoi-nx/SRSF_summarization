islamic state terrorists could launch a chlorine gas attack on british - a weapon used to kill thousands of british troops in the world war i trenches , an expert said today
colonel de bretton-gordon believes that every british isis fighter will have been given chemical weapons training in the hope they will come back to launch an attack
the retired head of chemical and biological weapons for the iraqi army believes the tube or sporting events could be the target
scotland yard said that last year five british a week were heading to syria and an estimated 500 of them may have returned to british
fears : colonel de bretton-gordon , left and right in 2007 , recently retired head of chemical and biological weapons for the iraqi army , is worried that isis might launch a chlorine attack in british colonel de bretton-gordon , who is now managing director of avon protection , believes that isis terrorists returning to the british are ' highly likely ' to use the gas , because it is easier to get hold of than weapons like guns and explosives
he has spoken out to warn the public what to do if there is an attack on british soil and believes that it would be ' very survivable and a lot less dangerous than bombs and bullets '
he told mailonline : ' i am convinced that is fighters are all being given training in chemical weapons and the british ones , who are likely to be more educated , will all be targeted in the hope they may return home
acquiring weapons and ammunition is very difficult in the british but you can get up to 90 tonnes of chlorine without any licence
' the authorities must keep a close eye on those fighters returning to the british , especially if they have a background in chemistry , and in particular anybody buying toxic chemicals '
chlorine was used 100 years ago during the 2nd battle of ypres in april 1915 , where the gas was vapourised into a cloud
mr de bretton-gordon says that chlorine is being used on an ' industrial scale ' in syria and iraqi but that taking simple steps would help people survive an attack
chlorine is readily available in british , used in swimming pools and decontamination in industry
' my working with british charity syria relief has focused in syria on giving civilians the basic know - how to avoid chlorine
the same advice applies to british , ' he said ' chlorine is not very toxic and the green and yellow clouds are easy to see and avoid
' it is key that isis do nât get the advantage of an unexpected chemical attack in the british
â fear of toxic chemicals and chemical weapons is the killer not the toxicity of the agents
â it is 20 years since the sarin attack on the tokyo underground , but it took three years and $ 10m dollars to create 1kg of sarin and i think it is highly unlikely that isis or anyone else has the capability to do that in british '
evidence : a gas canister lies at the site of a bomb attack on a road between mosul , iraqi , and the syria border in northern iraqi , believed to have been used by isis target : experts fear that the tube or other packed areas may be subject to attacks by isis militants in the british crude roadside bombs filled with toxic chlorine gas are now being used by islamic state terrorists , it has been claimed
mr de bretton-gordon said : ' islamic state are all over these chemical weapons
' i believe they will do anything to hold mosul , and this will include chemical weapons use '
' terror : chlorine was first used in the world war i and because it is heavier than air the clouds of killer gas would drop into trenches and wipe out troops chlorine was used by the british in the world war i , but it proved to be unreliable
in one attack in 1915 the gas blew back into british trenches after canisters of the chemical were fired from heavy guns at the germany
chlorine , a chemical used in industry and water purification process , was first introduced as a chemical weapon at ypres in world war i with disastrous effects because gas masks were not easily available at the time
by 1918 chemical weapons had proliferated on both sides â including phosgene , cyanide and mustard gas
in october , iraqi officials said islamic state ( is ) militants used chlorine gas during fighting with security forces and shiite militiamen in september north of baghdad
