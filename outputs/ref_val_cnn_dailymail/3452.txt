liverpool defender sakho admits understanding the english language changed his fortunes on the pitch
the france international struggled to settle in during his first 18 months after arriving from paris saint-germain for Â£ 18million in the summer of 2013
sakho ( right ) says learning the english language has helped him improve at liverpool however , since returning in mid-december he has been a virtual ever - present , missing just five matches with another injury , and has made a noticeable improvement
the 25 - year - old puts much of that down to him learning english
the france centre back has been an ever present for liverpool in the second half of the season ' some people said that i should be speaking france and that would allow me to release the tension a bit , except that when i spoke in france on the pitch nobody understood what i was saying
' sakho has put his fit of pique ahead of the first derby this season behind him and is grateful fans appear to have forgiven him also
