pressure is mounting in moscow to exhume the bones of the tragic last russian emperor and his family amid doubts expressed by the church as to their authenticity
the bones which are believed to belong to murdered nicholas , his empress alexandra and three of their children were dug up in 1991 and are now buried in a crypt in st petersburg
the famous ruler was forced to abdicate his throne during the first world war in 1917 before he and his family were exiled to western - russia by the bolsheviks revolutionaries that overthrew him
the romanov family : there is growing pressure on the russian government to dig up the bodies of russia 's last emperor nicholas ( pictured ) , his wife tsarina alexandra ( centre ) and daughters olga ( left ) , tatiana ( top ) and anastasia ( right ) - his other daughter maria and son alexei ( both pictured ) were never buried remains : the skulls of nicholas ( right ) , his wife tsarina alexandra ( left ) were discovered in 1979 and buried in a crypt in st petersburg in 1998 - along with their daughters olga , tatiana and anastasia forgotten : although his sisters olga ( left ) and tatiana ( right ) received a state burial at peter and paul cathedral , alexei 's ( centre ) remains were never buried and mailonline can also reveal that eight years after the discovery of the alleged remains of crown prince alexei - brutally shot aged 13 with other members of his family - they have still not been laid to rest
many will see this as the final indignity to a boy born to be tsar , pictured here in remarkable private family photographs , who was deprived of his throne by the two russian revolutions of 1917
exhaustive dna tests were conducted in britain and the us involving matches with living relatives , including prince philip , after which they were interred in a crypt in the peter and paul cathedral in royal capital st petersburg in a 1998 ceremony
objections : the church refuses to accept the opinion of leading dna experts who say the bones are those of the tsar nicholas ( top left ) , his german - born empress alexandra ( bottom right ) and their children concession : a senior official in putin 's government mironenko says ' it is necessary to listen to the church ' and dig up the royal family 's remains
pictured are the remains of alexei and his sister maria , 19 , discovered in 2007 and still have not been buried the bolsheviks justified the andrei romanov 's murder by claiming their royal relatives were supporting the ' white armies ' - as nicholas 's cousin was king george of britain
' now grand duchess maria vladimirovna - a claimant to the defunct throne - has made clear the russian imperial house would not oppose exhuming the remains of the tsar and four other members of his family if deemed necessary by putin 's government and the church
' behind the controversy is the church 's refusal to accept the opinion of a host of leading dna experts in russia and the west who say the bones originally found buried in 1979 in the urals forest are those of the tsar nicholas , his german - born empress alexandra and their children
the discovery of two further sets of small fragments of male and female human remains in 2007 - shown by dna tests to be haemophiliac alexei and his sister maria , 19 - added to the historical mystery
the church refused to bury them with the rest of their family , claiming the scientific proof was insufficient , yet genetic experts say it is ' 80 trillion times more likely ' that the male 's bones were alexei 's than not
regal : for three hundred years , the romanov family - eventually led by nicholas - was regarded by millions of russian as the living embodiment of the russian nation taken : had history taken a different route and the andrei romanov 's not been executed , alexei ( pictured ) would have become emperor and autocrat of russia - as well as head of the church ironically had history taken a different route , alexei would have become emperor and autocrat of all the russia 's - as well as head of the church
lawyer for the russian imperial house , german lukyanov , said that if the russian government requires it the andrei romanov 's descendants would ' not be against further examination ' of the bones
' in 2011 , the russian investigative committee - its equivalent of the fbi - completed a probe into the royal deaths , and concluded based on dna evidence that the bodies found in the urals were genuine , including alexei and maria
the dismembered bodies of their servants yevgeny botkin , 53 , anna demidova , aged 40 , aloizy trupp , aged 62 , and ivan kharitonov , aged 48 were also there - while alexei and maria 's bodies were dumped 230ft away
proof : in 2011 , the russian investigative committee concluded on dna evidence that the andrei romanov bodies found in the urals were genuine doomed : within a year of this photo being taken , the russian revolution swept across the country and forced nicholas to abdicate however others contend that while they were originally thrown into garina yama , the royals were later removed to a new burial place by the bolsheviks to hide them from the white forces which soon retook the area
proof : in 2011 , the russian investigative committee completed a probe into the royal deaths and concluded based on dna evidence that the bodies found in the urals did belong to nicholas ( left ) and his family when the other remains were found in 2007 , analysis only confirmed the previous findings , say the scientists
finally , a blood sample from a shirt worn by nicholas during the japanese attack - stashed in a st petersburg museum - showed matching dna
