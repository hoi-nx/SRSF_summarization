alice moffat received a parking ticket after leaving her car in front of her own family 's driveway - despite displaying her visitor 's badge a driver was left furious after she received a parking ticket for pulling up outside her parents ' home
alice moffat was hit with the Â£ 25 fine after she parked her car across the driveway while visiting april and steve moffat at their house in yeovil , somerset
the 23 - year - old , from redhill , surrey , had even placed the visitor 's permit in the window just in case and left it overnight
but she was shocked when she returned to the car the next morning to find a traffic warden had slapped a ticket on the red renault because it was parked just centimetres outside a marked bay
ms alice moffat , whose family have lived in yeovil for 15 years , said : ' i drove back to the family home late , and parked over my parents ' drive as i almost always do when i know they are not needing to go out that night
' just to be on the safe side , i also put the visitors permit in my car - not that it really needs to be there as i 'm over my parents ' drive
' my younger brother immediately asked why , he said ' the permit is in , it 's my sisters car so we 're allowed to park over our own drive ' but the parking warden simply replied saying the car was ' outside of a marked bay
the 23 - year - old had parked in front of the drive in yeovil , somerset ( pictured ) but was given a fine after being told she had not parked in the correct bay ' i nearly always park over my parents drive , i had a permit in my car to be sure it was okay , and if i was a few centimetres forward , it would not have affected anybody or any car
the Â£ 25 fine , issued by a council civil enforcement officer has since been cancelled ' they pay their way , and do n't expect their family to get fined for parking over their own property
