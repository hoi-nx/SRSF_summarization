a 94th - minute goal by substitute martyn waghorn rescued a championship point for wigan in a 1 - 1 draw at home to bolton , who looked as though they were going to pull off the classic smash - and - grab
the home side had dominated for the vast majority of the contest , only to fall behind 20 minutes from time when walker 's shot was deflected past a helpless al habsi for the opener
a 94th - minute goal by substitute martyn waghorn rescued a point for wigan against bolton but they stuck to their task in the second period , and after amos had denied pennant with a stunning stop , the goalkeeper then tipped a clarke header on to the bar as well as clawing away a ojo effort
it looked like time would run out on wigan , but in the fourth of five added minutes , martyn waghorn equalised with a goal that could yet save their season
wigan had started the game on the front foot , with bolton content to play on the break

but with 20 minutes to go , the unthinkable happened and wanders took an undeserved lead in extremely fortuitous circumstances
it looked as though bolton were going to hold on for all three points before , in the fourth added minute , martyn waghorn sent an overhead kick in off the bar to rescue a point for the hosts .
