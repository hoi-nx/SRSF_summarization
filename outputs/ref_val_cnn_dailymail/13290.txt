we have no problem taking wall street executives to task for decisions that leave american families financially devastated , yet we give silicon valley billionaires a pass when they do the same thing
american needs to realize that instead of creating jobs , silicon valley is erasing them , leaving millennials financially stranded before their careers can get off the ground
silicon valley is tossing millennials aside like yesterday 's laptop
but despite falling unemployment , college grads age 22 to 27 are stuck in low - paying jobs that do n't even require a college degree
the percentage of young people languishing in low - skill , low - paying jobs is 44 % , a 20 - year high
only 36 % of college grads have jobs that pay at least $ 45,000 , a sharp decline from the 1990s , after adjusting for inflation
if this comes as a surprise , that 's because images from popular culture push the idea that young college graduates are shrugging off bad employment prospects with their do - it - yourself attitude
in our collective imagination , millennials are saying , " no jobs ? that 's ok â i 'll create my own ! " and then they solve their own problems by heading to silicon valley with little more than an iphone and an idea to create the next hip app that supposedly will turn them into overnight millionaires
but wait â wo n't the digital economy eventually lead to better jobs ? after a period of adjustment , wo n't things get better ? unfortunately that 's not the path we 're on
one of the biggest misconceptions about the digital economy is that for every middle - class job rendered obsolete by technology , there 's a new , equally good ( or better ) job created by silicon valley
the digital economy is vaporizing the good jobs and replacing them with two kinds of jobs : minimum wage jobs ( think amazon warehouse employees ) and so - called " sharing - economy jobs " ( think uber drivers )
the sharing - economy jobs are even worse than minimum wage jobs because they offer no stability or protections for workers
sure , silicon valley does n't owe american jobs
" put simply , silicon valley 's utopia is the rest of american 's dystopia
and those who are punished more than anyone else are recent college graduates , whose lifetime earning potential has already suffered an irreversible setback
first , we can stop glorifying tech titans and start talking openly about silicon valley 's questionable tactics and its real job creation record ( i.e. , just follow the numbers )
third , we can elect leaders who are vocal about holding silicon valley accountable for their power over the entire american workforce , including white - collar employees
and if we want a better future for millennials and the generations after them , we need to challenge the prevailing silicon valley ethos before it 's too late .
