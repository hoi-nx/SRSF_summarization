but when it turns on next week , some scientists are betting the lhc will detect something just as exciting ; a parallel universe
this is according to a new study that claims miniature black holes - a key sign of a ' multiverse ' - could be detected in cern 's lhc in geneva
but when it turns on next week , some scientists are betting the lhc in geneva will detect something even more exciting ; a parallel universe the rainbow gravity theory suggests that gravity 's effect on the cosmos causes different wavelengths of light to behave differently
one consequence of rainbow gravity is that our universe stretches back into time infinitely with no singular point where it started
' we predict that gravity can leak into extra dimensions , and if it does , then miniature black holes can be produced at the lhc
' professor faizal and his team have calculated the energy at which they expect to detect these mini black holes in gravity 's rainbow , according to a report by lisa zyga at phys.org
' if we do detect mini black holes at this energy , then we will know that both gravity 's rainbow and extra dimensions are correct , ' added professor faizal
when it 's activated , the energy with which the lhc smashes particles together will be twice what it was during the time when it made the discovery of the higgs boson
if extra dimensions do exist , the study suggests that they would lower the energy required to produce black holes which the lhc could pick
professor faizal suggests the reason these black holes have yet to be detected is because our current model of gravity gets modified at very high energies
according to phys.org , in the latest study , the new theory of gravity 's rainbow has been used to account for why the lhc has not yet found tiny black holes
the new theory of gravity 's rainbow has been used to account for why the lhc has not yet found tiny black holes
gravity 's rainbow says that space and time curve differently for particles of different energy einstein 's theory of relativity states that gravity is caused by space and time curving
using gravity 's rainbow , the scientists found that more energy is required to detect mini black holes at the lhc than previously thought
so far , the lhc has searched for mini black holes at energy levels below 5.3 tev
instead , the model predicts that black holes may form at energy levels of at least 9.5 tev in six dimensions and 11.9 tev in 10 dimensions
if mini black holes are detected at the lhc at the predicted energies , not only will it prove the existence of extra dimensions and by extension parallel universes , said ahmed farag ali from florida state university
' if black holes are not detected at the predicted energy levels , this would mean one of three possibilities , ' mohammed khalil explained to phys.org ' one , extra dimensions do not exist
