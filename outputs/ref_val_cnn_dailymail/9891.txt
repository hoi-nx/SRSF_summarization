jyoti 's death sparked a period of deep soul searching in india , where equal rights for women are enshrined in the constitution but rarely effective in practise
but even today , mukesh singh remains unrepentant
in an in - depth interview with filmmaker udwin , as part of a documentary to be broadcast on bbc four , he blamed jyoti for daring to fight back against her attackers
she should just be silent and allow the rape , ' he said
' mukesh singh and his accomplices treated jyoti no better

it was this outpouring that inspired the documentary about jyoti 's death for filmmaker ms udwin it was not the horror of the attack that compelled her to make her documentary , but the outpouring of anger in india at the social conditions that allowed it to happen
' mukesh singh , who denies raping jyoti but admitted driving the bus where she was attacked , and three others are currently awaiting the outcome of appeals against their convictions
