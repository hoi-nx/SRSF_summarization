millions of male workers who leave their rural homes to work in large cities can only have sex with their wives for a fortnight every year
at least 47 million women live in rural china while their husbands work away - leaving them desperate for intimacy when they return
' all i can think of when returning home for chinese new year is sex , ' one migrant claimed
and now a series of photographs , taken in shangnan county in shaanxi , has captured the moment many of these migrants return to their own bedrooms

. mr wang works in a gold mine in lingbao , henan , in central china

in 2013 , mr wu spent Â¥ 36,000 ( Â£ 3,820 ) buying a five - bedroom house for his family
