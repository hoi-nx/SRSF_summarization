the shocking decline of young english players in the premier league is revealed by new research published by the mail on sunday which shows that the academies of the premier league âs current 20 clubs have produced just 57 first - team regulars over the past 10 years
in the week in which fa chairman greg dyke attempted to persuade premier league clubs to increase the quota of home - grown players in their squad from eight to twelve , the new figures show that the nation âs elite clubs are producing fewer than three players per club on average over a decade with the league âs biggest clubs having some of the worst records
chelsea have produced no home - grown first - team regulars since john terry emerged at the start of the millennium
manchester united , arsenal , liverpool , manchester city have had less than a handful each

the new research on home - grown regulars produced in the past decade shows that only southampton and aston villa , with seven such players each , and newcastle , with five , had produced five or more since the start of the 2005 - 06 season
the new research considers how many players the current 20 premier league clubs have nurtured between the ages of 15 - 18 who have then gone on to be â regulars â for that team

greg dyke created the an commission in 2013 to explore the reasons for the low number of english players in the premier league and suggest solutions to address the issue - with the stated aim of helping to improve the england team
a commission report last year highlighted how there is a particular â bottleneck â for english players aged 18 to 21 , limiting first - team opportunities at premier league clubs
minutes played by english players aged under 21 in the premier league have fallen by more than half in 10 years , and englishmen in the champions league are a relatively rarity despite england have joint-most teams competing each season
