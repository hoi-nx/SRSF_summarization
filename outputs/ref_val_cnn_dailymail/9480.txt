spanish neuroscientists claim low alcohol red wine produces more brain activity in â taste processioning â areas , then stronger tipples
but spanish neuroscientists claim that red wine with a low alcohol content produces more brain activity in â taste processioning â areas , then stronger tipples
while the low alcohol bottles may not contain more flavour per se , people pay more attention to â fruity bouquets â and â woody notes â so the wine appears to be tastier
neuroscientists led by frost , of the basque centre of cognition , brain and language in donostia-san sebastian , spanish , wrote in their study , published in the journal plos one : â over the last few decades , wine makers have been producing wines with a higher alcohol content , assuming that they are more appreciated by consumers
to reveal that stronger wines are nât necessarily better , his team measured the brain activity of 21 volunteers in a fmri scanner
during the scan , the volunteers had the enviable task of sipping samples of different red wines where one was low alcohol and another stronger , but they tasted similar
the researchers measured the brain activity of 21 volunteers in a fmri scanner while they sipped red wine
they found : contrary to expectation , significantly greater activation was found for low - alcohol than for high - alcohol content wines in brain regions that are sensitive to taste intensity , including the insula as well as the cerebellum
an image from the study showing brain activity triggered by wine is shown â contrary to expectation , significantly greater activation was found for low - alcohol than for high - alcohol content wines in brain regions that are sensitive to taste intensity , including the insula as well as the cerebellum ' , the researchers wrote
in fact , there was no part of the brain that responded more strongly to the more alcoholic wine , meaning that strong wines â induce weaker activation relative to the low - alcohol content ones â
