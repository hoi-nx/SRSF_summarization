carlo ancelotti 's real madrid are in a mini-crisis mode , with world stars like ronaldo and bale struggling for form
in those three games â the copa del rey final and the champions league semi-finals â real madrid played with a 4 - 4 - 2 formation that allowed them to defend properly and counterattack at the earliest opportunity
ronaldo looks on in horror after atheltic bilbao score to consign real madrid to another defeat a sorry real madrid forward line kick off after artiz aduriz sends san mames wild by putting bilbao ahead real madrid employed a 4 - 4 - 2 to devastating effect against bayern in last season 's champions league the team âs attacking trio of ronaldo , bale and benzema did not feature together on two out of those three games , the other one being the return leg against bayern in the allianz arena
injuries to bale ( a 1 - 0 win against bayern at the santiago bernabeu ) and ronaldo ( copa del rey final ) forced carlo ancelotti to use a 4 - 4 - 2 system that proved to be so solid that the italian coach played bale as a midfielder on real madrid âs historic 4 - 0 win in germany
carlo ancelotti knew what he had to do , he used that same 4 - 4 - 2 formation with james and isco on the wings , and real madrid were able to come back and earn a convincing 3 - 1 win against messi and co. considering how badly the team have struggled against valencia and atletico madrid since 2015 started , it âs not surprising to see that several polls around the spanish media prove that the fans want to see that 4 - 4 - 2 formation again
welsh star bale has provoked the ire of the real madrid fans for his percieved selfishness many real madrid fans are calling for bale to be the odd man out if they are to switch back to the 4 - 4 - 2 system the Â£ 86million bale tries in vain to turn around his side 's fortunes in saturday 's disappointing loss if that happens , carlo ancelotti will either be forced to move one of the bbc to the bench or play bale in a much more defensive role
given that ronaldo is real madrid 's best player and that benzema is the team 's only centre forward , it would be reasonable to think that bale would indeed be the one moving to the bench if carlo ancelotti decides to use this 4 - 4 - 2 formation , and that would be the right call
after the whistles , the welsh player is not attempting nearly as many shots as he was when things were working out well for him , so carlo ancelotti will surely use bale 's experience as a good example to change real madrid 's shape and improve the way his team is defending
