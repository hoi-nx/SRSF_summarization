a first trophy as celtic manager was a huge , significant step for ronny deila
celtic âs first league cup since 2009 is the platform for ronny deila to become only the third celtic boss to win a domestic treble
the celtic players celebrate on the podium with the scottish league cup after beating dundee united 2 - 0 at hampden park celtic manager ronny deila gets ready to lift the scottish league cup with his players as celtic kicked off their celebrations a scottish cup replay against dundee united â who else ? â beckons on wednesday and that ensured there was no prospect of glasgow âs fast - food outlets cashing in on a celtic team session last night
â we should enjoy the moment , â said a relieved ronny deila after an eventful , if unremarkable , final
the celtic skipper escaped punishment for the tackle which triggered two red cards â both rescinded â when these teams met at tannadice last week
his manager then overlooked the front - page pictures of a night of rabble - rousing in edinburgh before the final
yet the greatest let - off of all might have been here when referee madden denied dundee united â who ended the game with 10 men and a strong sense of injustice - a penalty kick

celtic were ahead at the time
they had exploited their opponents being down to 10 men when skipper sean dillon collided with virgil van dijk and left the pitch in 23 minutes to receive stitches
â sean dillon would eventually leave the pitch on a permanent basis in the second half for a reckless challenge on emilio izaguirre in 56 minutes
thereafter , celtic dominated , scoring again through james forrest and emphasising why the tayside club were so willing to wait for their captain when he left the pitch for lengthy treatment
he was nât to blame for the insipid paul dixon free - kick which allowed craig gordon to gather and trigger a celtic counter
but it was from his position that stokes â who had a fine game - chipped a left - foot cross that was prodded towards goal by kris commons , changing direction as it came off the inner thigh of jaroslaw fojut
somehow cierzniak in the dundee united goal clawed it brilliantly on to the post , but tiring commons would not be denied , thumping the rebound emphatically into the net with his right foot for 1 - 0
â if we had scored from that paul dixon free - kick , everyone would be saying it was a great decision not to substitute him and give him a little more time
â there was more cause for dundee united regret in 36 minutes when ryan dow , chasing a through ball into the area was pushed in the back by scott brown , a villainous figure through tannadice eyes

â in contrast , dundee united foamed with frustration and knew they were done for when they went down to 10 men in 56 minutes
paton âs proved to be a nonsense , but sean dillon âs here was inarguable
the defender lunged into a dangerous challenge on emilio izaguirre
dundee united captain sean dillon ( right ) is sent off for this late challenge on celtic defender emilio izaguirre sean dillon ca n't hide his devastation after the dundee united captain was sent for an early shower having been sent off at hampden park in stokes , johansen and nir bitton , they had the best players on the pitch
james forrest and guidetti started brightly enough , the winger sweeping the critical second goal into the net from 16 yards in 78 minutes after the swede teed up a johansen cut - back
kris commons managed to fire celtic ahead from an acute angle during the first - half , as ronny deila ( right ) roars in celebration commons put the celtic ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions with celtic commons is congratulated by his team - mates having put the scottish premiership leaders in front during the league cup final referee madden showed no hesitation when james forrest was pulled back by paul dixon
an unimpressed ronny deila explained afterwards : â both of the players who were going to take a penalty , leigh griffiths and kris commons , were off the park
james forrest earned celtic a penalty late on under this challenge from dundee united 's paul dixon in the closing stages several celtic players wanted guidetti to take the spot - kick but james forrest insisted and eventually missed his penalty â it is stupid
