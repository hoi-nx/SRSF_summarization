i âd been apprehensive , not liking the idea of scuba - diving with skeletons
i âd stumbled out of the typically tiny airport to be confronted by a flat concrete car park blotted with bollards and a whiff of hot tar and thyme
but while this might have been the stomping ground of spartans leonidas , helen , latterly of troy , and menelaus , there was very little that was spartan about it
wonderful : travelmail explored one of the 89 wrecks littering the seabed in the bay of navarino luxe : the westin hotel at costa navarino proved the perfect base for an undersea adventure private : each suite has a private pool and stunning sea views tempting though spending most of my time ensconced beside the pool was â and believe me , that âs what most do â i had a date with a diving instructor to attend
in reality , there âs plenty to see beneath the greece waves , whether shoals of tropical fish or the wrecked seabed remains of the many cultures and peoples who have passed through
pylos , a scallop - shaped stretch of gleaming cobalt water freckled with azure patches of coral is no exception
the bay has been the site of several naval battles , the first in 426bc when an athenian fleet destroyed a defending spartan fleet in a bloody encounter
later , during the world war ii , pylos was the site of italian attacks on greece shipping â among them the ship i was about to see , 30ft below the waves of the bay
one of 89 wrecks that litter the sea bed , the greece merchantman was the victim of an italian bombing strike , albeit a spectacularly cack - handed one
timeless : away from the beach , the landscape looks much the same as it did during spartan times wildlife : as well as wrecks and tropical fish , the clear waters are famous for sea turtles the second run hit the target , breaking the ship âs back and consigning it to a watery grave
the fishermen who risked their lives to save the sailors returned to pylos âs main harbour of pylos to a heroes â welcome
today , the men of pylos , a picturesque little village set around a honey - stone square dotted with cafes , are largely employed in the tourist trade â including as dive masters
one such was yannis , a genial six - footer with curly hair and a penchant for cigarettes who ferried us out into pylos
stunning : pylos is dotted with beaches , including the scallop - shaped voidokilia beach further out , the debris gave way to rocks and fish and as the land sloped away , to delicate shells and vast grassy stretches of seaweed
a school of transparent , tiny fish
back on the boat , we took a detour on the way back to pylos to inspect a smattering of spartan graffiti etched onto the pink rock of another small cove â a reminder , if ever there was one , of the long history of this spot
