she was the first person to contract ebola in the u.s. , and now she 's suing the hospital where she got infected
nina pham , a nurse at texas health presbyterian hospital dallas , filed a lawsuit monday against the hospital 's parent company , texas health resources
" texas health resources ignored ebola warnings , its chief medical officer " made numerous patently false statements to congress , " and the company " wholly failed to ensure that appropriate polices , procedures , and equipment were in place , " leaving health care providers untrained , unprotected and at risk for exposure , the lawsuit says
" i was hoping that texas health resources would be more open and honest about everything that happened at the hospital , and the things they did n't do that led to me getting infected with ebola , " pham said in a statement
" nina pham and so many others of you served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of ebola to arrive in a u.s. hospital 's emergency room , " the statement read
" according to the suit , the hospital chain failed to provide proper training to handle ebola
pham contracted the disease last fall while treating duncan , who started showing symptoms after arriving in dallas from liberia
" in a cruel twist , after watching mr. duncan go through the horrific and painful course of the disease as she desperately tried to save his life , nina pham herself was diagnosed with ebola just two days after mr. duncan 's life was taken by it , " the lawsuit states
pham also claims that the hospital failed to provide her with the necessary protective equipment , despite cdc warnings
texas health resources spokesman wendell watson issued a statement in response to the lawsuit : " nina pham served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of ebola to arrive in a u.s. hospital 's emergency room
" comparing the conditions facing nurses to what one would expect in a poorly developed country , the suit further states that after duncan died , pham was told she was at " no risk " for ebola " and that she could freely see her friends and family
the pr department was trying to release information and use nina pham as part of its texas health resources - corporate - driven # presbyproud campaign , " the lawsuit says
pham 's lawsuit also says texas health resources violated her privacy by sharing her medical records
in his letter to employees , berdan said the company had pham 's permission to release information
" texas health resources was sensitive to nina pham 's privacy , and we adhered to health insurance portability and accountability act ( health insurance portability and accountability act ) rules in determining what information to share publicly , " the ceo said
" we had nina pham 's consent to share the information about her that was released
" another nurse treating duncan , amber vinson , also contracted ebola
both nurses recovered after being sent to hospitals specially equipped and staffed to handle ebola -- pham at the national institutes of health in maryland , and vinson at emory university hospital in atlanta
she is still suffering fatigue and body aches , but her lawyer told the affiliate it 's not clear whether the ailments are from ebola or from the experimental drugs pham received
