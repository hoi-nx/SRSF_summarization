it 's a revival of a period drama classic , so the seven million viewers who tune in to bbc1 âs new hit ross would be forgiven for thinking they had seen some of the characters before
the one show , which christine bleakley used to present , just became the two show ... doubles : helda reed , left , who plays ross 's first love elizabeth , has stunning similarities to christine bleakley ( right ) handsome leading man aidan turner oozes the same rugged , brooding sex appeal of tragic inxs frontman michael hutchence in his portrayal of captain ross
ross - a - likes : he 's been turning heads as the new poldark and it 's easy to see why when he looks like tragic inxs frontman michael hutchence the australian rocker may have sung never tear us apart â¦ but in this case never tell us apart might be more accurate
choirboy faces : kyle soller , who plays francis poldark ( right ) is the double of aled jones just do nât try to imagine him singing walking in the air in a dubious cornish accent ... ross âs drunken servant jud paynter and his buxom wife prudie have a couple of comedy doppelgangers
what a couple : podark 's servant and his wife look similar to a couple of other familiar characters ( below ) albert steptoe , played by wilfrid brambell and edney , aka dawn french , could be mistaken for poldark characters jud and prudie paynter ( above ) phil davis âs scoundrel resembles sitcom rag - and - bone man albert steptoe ( wilfrid brambell ) , and edney looks like vicar of dibley star dawn french as she appeared in lark rise to candleford
