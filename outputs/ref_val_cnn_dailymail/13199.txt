except this is 2015 and " who squeezes them in harelbeke ? " is the poster strapline for the elite e3 harelbeke competition in belgium , accompanied by that gloved cyclist 's hand poised to pinch a woman 's bottom
it 's inspired by previous winner slovak peter sagan , who pinched a podium girl 's behind at the 2013 tour de flanders -- something he later apologized for , saying " i promise to act more respectfully in the future
" a week earlier , he was also pictured on the e3 harelbeke podium , making an ass - grabbing motion towards another flower girl
e3 harelbeke 's organizers chose to celebrate his antics in their 2015 campaign , sparking a global debate about sexism in cycling that has raced far beyond the billboard
" old boy 's club " " a guy grabbing a woman 's ass is very much indicative of a level of sexual assault , " said bertine , former professional cyclist and director of " half the road , " a documentary about female racers
" this poster makes cycling look very outdated
" judging by e3 harelebeke 's provocative standards , the poster could even appear tame compared to previous years
more baffling was last year 's poster featuring a woman straddling three other females curled into the shape of a bike
" " a playful nod " cycling 's world governing body , the uci ( uci ) has since requested the poster be removed , to which the e3 harelbeke organisers have agreed -- not that they necessarily see it as offensive themselves
" personally , no i do n't think it 's sexist , " marc claerhout , e3 harelebeke manager , told cnn
" the organization has since withdrawn the poster , releasing an official apology to " anyone who might find it intimidating , discriminatory or sexist
removing the poster is one thing -- but the uci missed an opportunity to make an example of a tournament which has used seemingly sexist campaigns for years , said olympic road race champion , cooke
" a whopping fine and canceling the race would have sent out the strong message that there is no place for sexism in cycling
similarly , belgium 's institute for the equality between men and women , said the image violated 2007 anti-discrimination legislation and " incited sexual intimidation
" it 's unlikely the same image would have been used in a female tournament
" not only is the poster sexist -- this race does n't even have a women 's field , " said bertine , who has long campaigned for a women 's edition of the tour de france equal to the men 's -- a race often seen as the ultimate prize in cycling
" it seems that rather than a podium girl 's bottom , the one being put under the spotlight at this year 's event , will be the organizers themselves .
