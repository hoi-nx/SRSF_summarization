over the course of his career , chopra âs net - finding abilities have cost clubs in excess of Â£ 9million in transfer fees
once tipped as alan shearer âs heir apparent during his formative days at newcastle , he made a fortune in english football , lost a chunk of it through a well - publicised gambling addiction , and most recently played in the indian super league with kerala blasters
now , in a move that caused scotland football to perform a collective double take , chopra has joined championship strugglers alloa athletic until the end of the season
chopra appears for alloa athletic for the first time against rangers at ibrox on tuesday the 31 - year - old made his debut as an injury - time substitute during tuesday night âs 2 - 2 draw with rangers at ibrox , confirming that this remarkable coup by a part - time club had nât actually been some form of elaborate hoax
among the many questions that sprang up from his appearance in a black - and - gold jersey , a simple one seemed the most obvious : why ? â once i finished in indian , my main objective was to get back and i âve been looking around at what leagues i could play in , â said chopra , a former england youth international who was most prolific during two spells at cardiff
â the last week i âve been training at port vale and i got a phone call on monday asking if i would like to come to alloa athletic , and i jumped at the chance

people ask me if i even knew of alloa athletic but i did â i actually watched them beat rangers 3 - 2 on the telly earlier in the season ! â i loved it at ibrox the other night when i got a couple of minutes
i ca nât believe alloa athletic are where they are in the league
â honestly , i played for blackpool admittedly during some hard times for that club ( last season ) but this alloa athletic team is better than that blackpool one

â chopra hopes his influence will also be felt outside of match scenarios
â i remember when i was at newcastle and i was a young boy , i was playing with alan shearer , michael owen and patrick kluivert and they gave me the best experience possible , â recalled chopra

chopra also claimed the main reason he joined sunderland in 2007 was because the signing - on fee would pay off his debts
â chopra is nât discounting still being at alloa athletic next season and clearly has a genuine hunger to be scoring again after an injury - scarred spell in indian
chopra ( left ) shakes hands with alloa athletic caretaker manager paddy connolly at ibrox on tuesday â i heard chopra could be available through my contacts and , after that , i did a bit of homework â including speaking to chris hutchins , who was assistant manager at ipswich when chopra was there â and got glowing references , â said ebden
â we âve made a massive statement because we are desperate to stay in this league and then look to do better next season when , who knows , chopra could still be with us
