the eu is set to lift a ban on imports of chicken from the usa which are washed with a suspect acid disinfectant
usa producers routinely wash raw chicken following slaughter with a substance called peroxyacetic acid ( paa ) to remove harmful bacteria
the eu has lifted a ban on usa chickens which are washed in an acid it is feared helps cause superbugs the proposal has alarmed consumer groups , who say it is at odds with european policy , which has been designed to remove harmful bacteria from the birds on farms , rather than relying on disinfectants
just last week , the chef and food campaigner , jamie oliver , warned that british and european risk importing inferior food from the usa under a new free trade deal called ttip
mute schimpf , food campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said : â the eu âs approach to food safety is under attack , even before any trade deal with the usa is agreed
consumer groups argue that these same safeguards should be applied to the use of paa and imports of chicken cleaned with the disinfectant
the european consumer organisation beuc insists that health and safety should be put ahead of a desire to improve trade relations with the usa
it said : â as the eu and the usa are engaged into talks for a free trade agreement , we look to eu authorities not to let their decision driven solely by trade considerations but to put food safety and consumer protection first
â the european food safety authority has ruled that paa is not toxic to humans , although it can trigger asthma and allergies in workers at processing plants where it is used
consumer groups have said shoppers do n't like the idea of their meat having been washed in chemicals the group said there is also sound research showing shoppers do not like the idea of their chicken being treated with an acid wash
' european food safety authority has confirmed that peroxyacetic acid is safe to use in food production , but british poultry producers are not yet convinced its use is in the best interests of consumers compared to our farm - to - fork system
