labour mps are said to be hatching a secret plot to stop the party brokering a coalition with nicola sturgeon 's snp labour mps are hatching secret plans to wreck any deal with the scottish nationalists by holding an emergency summit after the election
a meeting of the entire labour party ( labour party ) would be convened in order to veto any attempt by mr ed miliband to win downing street by brokering a deal with nicola sturgeon âs snp
labour mps say the possibility of forming an alliance with a party which wants to break up the united kingdom is already alienating many of their core voters on both sides of the border
cryer , chairman of the labour party , is understood to have told mr ed miliband âs aides that his mps will not tolerate a repeat of the situation after the 2010 election , when gordon brown tried to stay in power by striking a deal with nick clegg , but without consulting his party
mr ed miliband publicly insists his only concern is to achieve an outright labour majority
â ed miliband insisted that talk of an agreement with the snp was ' nonsense ' but stopped short of ruling it out labour âs former home secretary , alan johnson , said on thursday he did not know why his party had not ruled out a pact , adding that it â could nât possibly do a deal with a party that wants to be out of the united kingdom and give up our nuclear deterrent â
labour nerves have been rattled by the successful launch of a new tory campaign poster , which shows a miniature ed miliband in the top pocket of former snp leader alex salmond , who is expected to win a westminster seat
one labour mp told the mail on sunday : â we will not tolerate coalition negotiations taking place above [ our ] heads again , and certainly not if it means getting into bed with the snp ... this has been accepted in principle by ed miliband âs office
