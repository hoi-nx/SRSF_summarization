a startling video has emerged showing an officer putting his hand around a woman 's throat then forcing her to the floor at a massachusetts police station
the footage , taken in february 2013 , was released this week following a $ 1 million federal lawsuit filed by the woman , maylene maldonado , against the chicopee police officer , daniel major
the footage shows him and two other officers restraining maldonado , who was arrested for allegedly slapping a police officer after she admitted to drinking and smoking pcp , mlive.com reported
arrest : maylene maldonado can be seen screaming as she is taken into custody in february 2013 attack : one of the officers , sergeant daniel major , then abruptly grabs her neck and holds on but as she continues to scream , major suddenly grabs her around the neck and continues to hold on as his fellow officers do nothing
while on the floor , major shouts : ' shut the f * * * up ! ' maldonado was charged with resisting arrest and assault and battery on a police officer
in her lawsuit , which also names the other officers , maldonado has accused the officers of assault and battery and civil rights violations , and accuses the city of failing to properly train its officers
maldonado , from springfield , was arrested after her friend 's car got stuck in a snowbank in chicopee and officers , who were called to the area following reports about a man with a knife , saw her running to a nearby gas station and went to check on her
holding on : she struggles as daniel major holds on to her neck - while the other officers stand back and do nothing ' attack ' : the officers then push maldonado to the ground , where daniel major says : ' shut the f * * * up ' she slapped an officer across the face and apologized , according to the criminal complaint , but was arrested and taken to the police station where the alleged assault unfolded
charette , the acting chief at the time of the 2013 incident , defended daniel major 's actions as appropriate because maldonado was high on pcp and allegedly spat blood during her arrest
daniel major , in court in november 2013 , was charged with assault but an internal review found he did nothing wrong , which the current police chief has disputed
daniel major has since retired but now faces a lawsuit from the woman but because internal affairs investigation found no wrongdoing , former chicopee mayor michael bissonette told abc that his hands were tied
