brazil came from behind to see off france in a friendly at the france , with goals from chelsea midfielder oscar , barcelona forward neymar , and wolfsburg defensive midfielder luis gustavo
france had taken the lead through a raphael varane header , and looked to be in total control before oscar 's well - worked equaliser , but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half , and could have scored more as the game wore on
neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game , made it 43 , firing past mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the french keeper , before luis gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner

brazil come from behind in style to seal a 3 - 1 win against france and gain a tiny bit of revenge for their world cup final defeat 17 years ago
raphael varane gave the hosts the lead with a powerful header but strikes from oscar , neymar and luis gustavo secured a deserved victory for dunga 's men
brazil 's subs still working hard to close down france every time they get the ball
and there 's number three ! luis gustavo gets away from his marker and heads the corner beyond mandanda and into the corner
awful defending but brazil probably deserve a two - goal cushion
the visitors move up the pitch at speed with willian and neymar both involved
within a minute of raphael varane 's miss - with a jefferson save from sissoko sandwiched in between - benzema misses a sitter
another dangerous free - kick from france goes all the way through to raphael varane but he does n't connect with his shot properly and the ball rolls harmlessly wide
they work the ball around france 's half before willian tries to play a killer ball to neymar
it 's played into the centre and luis gustavo strikes a low shot from about 20 yards which mandanda does well to save
this time valbuena picks up possession on the left side of brazil 's box
france are struggling to get hold of the ball as the first half draws to a close
willian combines with danilo but the right back 's pass inside is poor and france clear the danger
willian runs on to a pass down brazil 's right , takes a touch and delivers a cross
brazil are lacking a physical presence up - front and it 's obvious here as mandanda claims under no pressure whatsoever
he makes some progress but is eventually crowded out and loses possession on the edge of france 's area
neymar takes the resulting corner but france clear up
brazil now have a free - kick inside france 's half after a foul on neymar ... elias finds some space 25 yards from goal but his shot is high and wide
france take the lead ! another inswinging corner from valbuena is met powerfully by raphael varane and his header flies into the bottom corner
another mini spell of possession for brazil but it ends when oscar inexplicably fires a long pass across the pitch to absolutely nobody
the chelsea man escapes a booking , probably because it 's a friendly
neymar closes down france 's defence and makes an interception but the ball gets away from him and the hosts survive a scare
neymar drops deep to pick up possession but he 's eventually crowded out and loses the ball in a dangerous area
moments later firmino finds some space on the edge of france 's box but his low strike is blocked
france should have the lead
brazil have n't had possession since neymar lost his footing - and the ball - inside the first minute
brazil get us underway at the france
france , brazil and everyone inside the stadium take part in a minute of silence in respect to those who lost their lives in the germanwings plane crash this week
the stadium appears pretty packed considering it 's a friendly - looks like brazil still have plenty of pulling power despite that defeat to germany last summer

quite what transpired in the hours before the match , particularly with star player ronaldo who was taken to hospital and left off the teamsheet only to be reinstated before kick - off , is one of football 's most enduring mysteries
