humans started dominating the planet causing irreversible damage around the year 1610 , scientists claim
but british researchers have now pinpointed 1610 because of the impact felt by an irreversible transfer of crops and species between the old worlds
british researchers have now pinpointed 1610 because of the impact felt by an irreversible transfer of crops and species between the old worlds and old worlds the anthropocene is the name of a proposed geological epoch that may soon enter the official geologic time scale
researchers at ucl said that 1610 - when shakespeare 's cymbeline was first performed - marked the start of the human - dominated geological epoch known as the anthropocene
such a marker - like the chemical signature left by the meteorite strike that wiped out the dinosaurs - is called a golden spike
comparing the major environmental impacts of human activity over the past 50,000 years against these two formal requirements just two dates were in the running - 1610 when the impact of the discovery of the americas began to be felt and 1964
scientists said the 1492 arrival of europeans in the americas , and subsequent global trade , moved species to new continents and oceans on an unprecedented level , resulting in a global re-ordering of life on earth
they also found a golden spike that can be dated to the same time - a pronounced dip in atmospheric carbon dioxide centred on 1610 and captured in antarctic ice - core records
geologists have named the 1610 dip in carbon dioxide the ' orbis spike '
' we humans are now a geological power in our own right - as earth - changing as a meteorite strike
' he added while 1964 saw a peak in radioactive fallout following nuclear weapons testing , it was not - in geological terms - an earth - changing event
