if you enjoy laughing at the england football team -- calling all germans and scotland -- and you have a spare $ 900,000 , then sotheby 's has the very thing for you
the auction house is offering an untitled work by italy sculptor maurizio cattelan that chronicles -- in painstaking and painful detail if you are england -- every defeat suffered by the england team between 1874 and 1998
maurizio cattelan has carved all the defeats into a large ( and it would have to be , would n't it ? ) piece of black granite , meaning the lucky buyer can be constantly reminded of a succession of ignominious afternoons and evenings
current england boss roy hodgson is known to be a bit of an italophile , but the former inter milan coach needs to be quick if he wants catch a glimpse -- maurizio cattelan 's work is on public exhibition at sotheby 's new bond street galleries until tuesday 10 march
