dolce have come under fire again , this time for an ad that depicts the gang rape of a woman
just days after designers dolce and dolce called children born through ivf ' synthetic , ' critics of the brand have publicized the brand 's highly controversial spring / summer 2007 campaign ad that showed a woman being restrained by a bare - chested man as a group of men in various states of undress look on
when the ad was first pulled in spain , the design duo referred to the people of that country as ' a bit backward
the duo also depicted a group sex scene featuring all men in another ad that was slightly more graphic , though the man , unlike the woman , was not being restrained
parents of ivf babies , among them elton john , al roker , and ricky martin , came out against the two following these statements , as did celebrities including victoria beckham and courtney love
kelly cutrone ( left ) posted the old ad on her twitter , attacking dolce and dolce ( right ) elton john wrote on instagram following then incident ; ' how dare you refer to my beautiful children as " synthetic "
dolce meanwhile have said their statements were taken out of context , with dolce saying ; ' i am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one i 've known
