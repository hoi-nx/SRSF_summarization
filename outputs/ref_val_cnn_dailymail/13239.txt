that may sound like an esoteric adage , but when zully broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger , her generosity paired up with big data
it resulted in six patients receiving transplants
" i thought i was going to help this one person who i do n't know , but the fact that so many people can have a life extension , that 's pretty big , " zully broussard told cnn affiliate kgo
but the power that multiplied zully broussard 's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor - recipient pairs
in late march , the medical center is planning to hold a reception for all 12 patients
say , your brother needs a kidney to save his life , or at least get off of dialysis , and you 're willing to give him one of yours
but then it turns out that your kidney is not a match for him , and it 's certain his body would reject it
your brother can then get on a years - long waiting list for a kidney coming from an organ donor who died
alternatively , you and your brother could look for another recipient - living donor couple like yourselves -- say , two more siblings , where the donor 's kidney is n't suited for his sister , the recipient
but maybe your kidney is a match for his sister , and his kidney is a match for your brother
that 's called a paired donation
but instead of a square dance , zully broussard 's generous move set off a chain reaction , like dominoes falling
on friday , the last donor will give a kidney to someone who has been biding time on one of those deceased donor lists to complete the chain
that changed when a computer programmer named jacobs received a kidney transplant
he had been waiting on a deceased donor list , when a live donor came along -- someone nice enough to give away a kidney to a stranger
but this chain would n't have worked so quickly without zully broussard 's generosity -- or may not have worked at all
