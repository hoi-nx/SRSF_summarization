a louisiana judge ruled monday that robert durst , the millionaire real estate heir charged with first - degree murder , will be held without bail
in 2001 -- the last time he was accused of murder and released on bail -- robert durst fled to pennsylvania , where authorities caught him after he tried to shoplift a sandwich from a supermarket
as the attorneys sparred in court and witnesses testified monday , they revealed new details about the investigation that led to robert durst 's march 14 arrest , and set the stage for what will surely be a fierce legal battle
after the hearing , robert durst 's attorney , deguerin , spoke with cnn 's jean casarez
here are some key details from monday 's hearing and the interview : robert durst , who appeared in court wearing an orange prison uniform and shackles , was arrested after federal agents tracked his cell phone , according to information presented in court monday
" they had no indication of his movement , " said o'hearn , an investigator for the new orleans district attorney 's office
that 's where fbi agents found and arrested him
last week , court documents revealed robert durst had a loaded .38 - caliber revolver , 5 ounces of marijuana , his passport and birth certificate , a neck - to - head latex mask with salt - and - pepper hair attached and more than $ 40,000 cash , mostly in $ 100 bills
it 's a case robert durst even has made himself
in " the jinx , " the hbo documentary that featured him , robert durst said : " you ca n't give someone charged with murder bail because they 're going to run away , of course
" in a seconds - long news conference after the hearing monday , durst attorney deguerin said he had no hope for bail and the judge 's decision was not surprising
deguerin cast doubt monday on the validity of the los angeles arrest warrant that led to robert durst 's detention , and argued that items found in the hotel room search should n't be admissible because detectives may not have had a search warrant at the time
he also said a detective and prosecutor interrogated robert durst for three hours without his attorney present
since the weapons and drugs charges robert durst faces in new orleans are based on what investigators say they found in his hotel room , this is likely to come up again
but the bigger courtroom fight will likely unfold in los angeles , where the district attorney filed a first - degree murder charge against robert durst last week
robert durst awaits extradition to los angeles to face that charge
prosecutors accuse robert durst of " lying in wait " and killing berman , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she " was a witness to a crime
" berman was shot in the head in her beverly hills , california , home in december 2000 , shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of robert durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack durst
robert durst has long maintained he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance
" i just do n't think that they had sufficient evidence to have him arrested , " deguerin said monday
" it 's not the first time robert durst has been accused of murder
fbi agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where robert durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said
on monday , police said there was a connection between robert durst and a college student who disappeared from vermont 's middlebury college in 1971
in response to a question at a tuesday news conference from cnn , middlebury police chief hanley said : " there 's nothing in the files to indicate ( robert durst ) was questioned " at the time of her disappearance
robert durst owned a health - food store in middlebury , and lynne schulze was last seen across the street from the store near a bus stop
robert durst was placed on suicide watch , according to police , but deguerin said last week that robert durst needed to be in a hospital setting , not because of the possibility of suicide , but because he has serious medical conditions
deguerin also said that robert durst is " mildly autistic " and has received treatment in the past from one of the country 's leading experts in asperger 's syndrome and autism
