the homeland security department is investigating two senior secret service agents accused of crashing a car into a white house security barrier
mark connolly , the second - in - command on president barack obama 's security detail , and george ogilvie , a senior supervisor in the washington field office , reportedly drove a government car into the barricades after drinking at a late - night retirement party last week
secret service spokesman robert hoback said recently appointed director clancy has been briefed on the march 4 incident and that clancy has asked the homeland security department 's inspector general 's office to investigate the incident
officers on duty who witnessed the incident reportedly tried to arrest the agents and conduct a sobriety test , but a supervisor said to let the men go home
president barack obama is aware of the incident and the investigation
the washington post reports that the men had been at a bar to celebrate the retirement of departing secret service spokesman edwin donovan
mark connolly and george ogilvie have declined to comment , though it is believed that the incident was likely caught on secret service video , which feeds to the agency 's command center
in 2013 a civilian who crashed into a barricade at the white house was chased by police and shot and killed
' the secret service is aware of the allegations of misconduct involving two of our employees at the white house complex , ' said secret service spokesman brian leary , a spokesman for the secret service
' also commenting on the situation were house oversight chairman jason chaffetz of utah and member elijah cummings of maryland who said in a statement ; ' the fact that this event involved senior - level agents is not only embarrassing but exhibits a clear lack of judgment in a potentially dangerous situation
the panel recommended an agency outsider to replace pierson , but barack obama earlier this year tapped clancy , a retired agent who led the agency on an interim basis after pierson 's ouster
the shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to secret service director julie pierson 's resignation
