human rights commissioner triggs has again defended her decision to give $ 350,000 to a refugee who killed his pregnant wife
in a senate estimates hearing on friday , ms triggs was grilled by coalitions senators after she backed her recommendation that john basikbasik should receive $ 350,000 in compensation for being ' arbitrarily ' held in a detention centre after the government ruled he was too dangerous to be integrated back into society
ms triggs said it was her role to remind the government of their ' international obligations ' and hold them accountable for breaching human rights
the human rights commissioner was forced to defend her decision in a senate estimate hearing after she recommended $ 350,000 be awarded to a man who killed his pregnant wife ' while the government of course has an executive power to detain someone , that executive power must be exercised in a way that is necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate aim , ' she said
' i think most fair - minded australians would say that holding someone for eight years after he has served his prison sentence is something that does require at least the regular consideration of his case , and regular consideration of whether or not alternative forms of detention or supervision might be used
' ' his human rights have been breached , and where there has been a breach , there is a recommendation for compensation ' ms triggs confirms his detention was lawful however her report claims the compensation estimate reflects the level of indignity mr john basikbasik suffered through losing his freedom and liberty
mr john basikbasik was held in villawood detention centre for eight years after a serving a seven year sentence challenging the government for her apparent trial by media ms triggs said they always had the opportunity to challenge her decisions , however rarely did
tony abbot has repeatedly called for ms triggs to resign from her position as human rights commissioner tony abbot publically slammed ms triggs for her 315 - page report into the treatment of children in detentions centres
