it âs the margin via which , according to the scorer iniesta , spain regained self - esteem and belief by winning at old trafford in 2007
beating england , to those who were charged by luis aragonã©s with installing a â new â form of play , put spain on the map again , iniesta told me
alvaro morata capped his spain debut with the winner against ukraine on friday night one - nil , the scoreline , against the usa which saw spain booed out of the country before euro 2008
one - nil to spain , world champions 2010
but , friday night in seville at the beginning of holy week ( holy week ) was something different
one - nil over ukraine
a debut goal , after only 38 competitive minutes , for alvaro morata
alvaro morata has all the hallmarks of an old style centre - forward who finishes on another night , one of those â accident nights â which hit every team every so often , spain would have lost this one
quite where spain are in that process is debatable
brazil in the confederations cup final , holland at the world cup â spain were to be bullied , pushed around , made to chase , pressed to within an inch of their lives
the striker has struck up a ' thing ' with pirlo at juventus but there âs no doubt that renovation is afoot
isco , madrid âs gem of a midfielder , should have been at the world cup , should probably have been a starter
yet spain , europe âs reigning champions , are fighting for their dignity and automatic qualification from this group because they could not control a 1 - 1 situation in slovakia last year
they are sore and should be contemplating this midweek âs friendly against holland with queries in their minds because they could neither augment , nor control , friday night âs 28th - minute lead against a ukraine side which at first came to defend and play on the break
then , sniffing glory , piled runners forward through the spain midfield , robbing possession and launching assaults on casillas â goal
what spain require , even above some restored arrogance and self - confidence , even above key players avoiding injury , is for a prolific striker to emerge
alvaro morata has also been likened to madrid and france striker benzema in raãºl âs day , his goals patched up the fact that spain did nât have a world - class xi. good , but not great
when david villa and fernando torres took charge they would , regularly , add the goal or goals which gave sense , confidence , and purpose to spain controlling play via xavi , david silva , iniesta , xabi alonso , marcos senna and sergio busquets
meantime there âs alvaro morata â once of madrid , lately of juventus
his former madrid mentor , michel , himself a mighty forward , recently said that alvaro morata , whose debut goal on friday was more valuable than it was beautiful , was â part van marco van basten , part benzema â
it âs meant to mean that he has the direct no 9 repertoire which accounts for his 32 goals for spain at junior levels and his tournament top - scoring performance last time la rojita won the european under-21 championship
with spain , just like at manchester united , that âs a special number
â i dream of scoring my first goal for spain , â alvaro morata said on thursday
