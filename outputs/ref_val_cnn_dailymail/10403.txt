a mechanic carrying out a standard mot test on a mercedes smashed it through a garage wall after accidentally stepping on the accelerator
the unnamed owner was sitting in the waiting area when he heard an ' almighty bang ' and ran out to see his pride and joy lodged in the wall
the mercedes now needs a new front end - and the garage was left in need of a bricklayer
