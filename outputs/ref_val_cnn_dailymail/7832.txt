' ' we , the families of missing schoolgirls , pray for the immediate safe return of our beloved daughters
' with respect to the disappearance of our children we have been disappointed by the handling of this matter by the school , met police and the local authority , all of whom we feel failed to act appropriately and pass on vital information to us or indeed between each other
had we been made aware of circumstances sooner , we ourselves could have taken measures to stop the girls from leaving the uk
' looking to the future , we hope to work with the relevant authorities to rectify the situation , and we will continue to do everything we possibly can to ensure our girls are brought back to us safely
