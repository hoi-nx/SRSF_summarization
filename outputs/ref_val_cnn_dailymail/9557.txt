she credits her as her â greatest inspiration â â yet the one person model - turned - artist tali has never painted is her popstar mother tali
the 22 - year - old , who is preparing for her first solo art exhibition in new york , has received critical acclaim
â last week the 22 - year - old faced criticism for posting self portraits of herself as a bruised and bloodied victim of domestic violence online she has painted her close friends , her sister , even her boyfriend , new york - based photographer ian jones : â i like to paint people i know rather than strangers , as i have a deeper understanding of their expressions and what each one means
â the youngest daughter of the scottish singer and her second husband , israeli film producer uri fruchtmann , tali grew up in london âs notting hill
yet despite her high - profile parents , she describes her upbringing as â sheltered â , saying : â people find it hard to believe , but my childhood was really quite normal
â it was only when tali and her older sister lola first accompanied her on a world tour that they realised just how fÃªted their mother was
thousands of people would be singing along to her music â i think it was then that it hit home to me how famous she was
â tali would later go into modelling , starring in big budget campaigns for burberry and prada
two years ago , she put her modelling career on hold to move to the us and become a professional portrait artist
but still makes sure she speaks to her mother every day : â i love to talk to her about what i am doing
i do nât always listen to other people âs feedback on my art , but with my mum i do listen
i never feel embarrassed showing my mum my work , even self - portraits that are quite raw
â her self - portrait show , layers of life , opens next week at the catherine ahnell gallery in new york âs trendy soho area
tali has inherited her mother âs love of pushing the boundaries and some of her paintings have sparked controversy
art attack : tali prepares for her first solo exhibition at the catherine ahnell gallery in soho new york last week , she faced criticism that some of her self - portraits , which showed her as a bruised and bleeding victim of domestic abuse , were in â very poor taste â
yesterday , speaking from her studio in new york , the young artist , whose mother actively campaigns for women âs rights , explained that she wanted to shine a light on â every trait of human nature â
my mother campaigns on the issue and the most recent figures are really shocking
â in a world where everything is instant and accessible , and people put out fragments of themselves on social media , i search for moments of authenticity and am inspired by those who strive to be who they are
art is in the eye of the beholder
â tali has been drawing and painting for â as long as i can remember â
while she admits she loves to sing , and would watch her mother with admiration as she belted out songs at the grand piano that took pride of place in the family home , her sketch book was always at her side
the model turned artists said that art has always been her passion since a young age her â unexpected â move into modelling at 17 changed the way she looked at beauty
â i love singing and am not bad at it , but i do nât think i have what it takes to make a career out of it
â art has always been my passion , since i was very young â it is like meditation and the feeling of satisfaction and closure you get when you complete a painting can not be beaten
i have always painted people
â the 5ft 10in beauty admits it was the pressure to look a certain way that turned her off modelling full - time
â she added : â a part of modelling is great and fun , but it is also about chance and whether someone wants you and that brings a lot of pressure
tali admits it was the pressure to look a certain was that finally turned her off modelling â i had never planned to model
â tali hopes her exhibition will show the world she is more than just a â privileged â girl who likes to paint
i know i have had a very privileged life , but it is important to me i am not put in a box and am seen as more than the daughter of a famous singer
tali said : â she is my greatest inspiration and i am so glad she will be there
â tali revealed she has also been taking acting lessons , saying : â i love acting
