a connecticut 17 - year - old who was forced to undergo nearly six months of chemotherapy to treat hodgkin lymphoma is in remission , her attorney said monday
" cassandra , " as she is identified in court papers , was diagnosed with hodgkin in september
she was removed from her mother 's home and placed with a relative
a judge then allowed her to return home under the supervision of department of children and families on condition she agree to complete the recommended treatment
her mother , jackie fortin , who said she is opposed to chemotherapy , said her daughter did n't want the treatment because she did not want to put the " poison " in her body
in december , a judge returned cassandra to the custody of department of children and families after hearing testimony from her attorney
doctors surgically implanted a port in cassandra 's chest to administer chemotherapy medications , which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them
now , she has just two treatments left , according to her state appointed attorney , michtom , who said she is feeling well and she is in good shape as far as her health is concerned
in january , he and an attorney for cassandra 's mother failed in their effort before the connecticut supreme court to make the case that cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decision
michtom said he will return to juvenile court next week to try to persuade a judge that cassandra should be returned to her mother 's custody
