thick fog forced authorities to suspend the air search wednesday for seven marines and four army aircrew , feared dead after their uh-60 helicopter crashed into waters off the florida
the helicopter was first reported missing at about 8:30 p.m. ( 9:30 p.m. et ) tuesday
the air search is expected to resume midday thursday , the spokesman said
base spokeswoman porterfield did n't specify what was found , noting the search - and - rescue mission remained underway
" " we will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for
" the air force , coast guard and civilian agencies participated in the intensive search focused on where they believe the aircraft went down , in waters east of the town of navarre and the navarre bridge and near eglin testing range site a- 17
" " we 're working closely with all the parties involved to locate our marines and the army crew that were onboard , " added capt. morris , a spokesman for the u.s. marines corps special operations command
" and , really , just our thoughts ( and ) prayers are with the marines , the soldiers and the families of those involved in the mishap
there was heavy fog in the area when the aircraft went missing , though the eglin spokeswoman said it 's too early to tell whether that had anything to do with the crash
" according to morris , the service members -- all men -- were involved in a seven - day training exercise of amphibious operations
it involved small boats and inserting and extracting marines from the water via helicopter
morris would not say in which phase of the training the marines were on tuesday night
the uh-60 helicopter was n't alone when it went down
" morris said the marines involved in the crash were all " highly - trained " members of that service 's special operations command
in january , two marines died when their helicopter went down at the marine corps air ground combat center in twentynine palms , california
this week 's crash involved a uh-60 - 60 uh-60 , a twin - engine helicopter introduced into army service in 1979 in place of the iconic uh-1 huey
the army 's uh-60 helicopter , which has a maximum speed of 173 mph , has an airframe " designed to progressively crush on impact to protect the crew and passengers , " according to the service
