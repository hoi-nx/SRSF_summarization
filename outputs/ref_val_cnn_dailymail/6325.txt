the evidence for mars once being habitable is steadily growing , as samples collected by nasa âs curiosity have revealed a key ingredient for life in mars rock
scientists found traces of nitrogen compounds known as nitrates , a vital source of nutrients for living things on earth
nasa scientists in california found evidence of nitrogen on mars
findings were made by curiosity 's ( shown ) sample analysis at mars instrument
the scientists found nitrates - a source of nitrogen for life on earth
it was likely created by asteroid impacts or lightning in volcanic plumes the findings were published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences
the earth âs nitrogen - rich atmosphere made life possible , but the origins of the air we breathe have long been a mystery
while scientists knew that plant life was responsible for the build up of oxygen , which makes up one fifth of the earth âs atmosphere , the nitrogen content - which accounts for 80 per cent of air - had remained a mystery
the latest evidence was found by using the sample analysis at mars ( sam ) instrument on the mars science laboratory mission ( mars science laboratory mission ) , more commonly known as curiosity
â shown is curiosity 's sample analysis at mars instrument
this could have provided a biochemically accessible source of nitrogen for life on mars this follows news in december 2014 when the rover identified spikes of methane that scientists believe may have come from bacteria - like organisms on the surface
since it landed , conclusive evidence has been found that mars once had water on its surface , and now scientists are hoping to provide an answer once and for all to the greatest question : was there , or is there still , life on mars as well ?
