scientists have discovered that navigational cells in the brain are just as active when we are asleep as when we are awake
the finding builds on last year 's discovery of the brain âs â gps system â which comprises clusters of cells that give us a sense of direction
scientists have revealed that navigational brain cells ( an illustration of neurons is shown ) are just as active when we are asleep as when we are awake
they made their discovery in the brains of mice researchers from nyu , in new york , focused on the ' head direction system ' in mice , which acts as a compass
the researchers studied brain activity in mice during deep , or rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep , that âs a stage known for intense dreaming activity in humans , during which brain electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from that when awake
they found that during deep sleep , the ' needle ' of the brain compass in the mice moved at the same speed when they were asleep , as when they were awake
the researchers studied brain activity in mice during slow - wave and rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep , that âs a stage known for intense dreaming activity in humans , during which brain electrical activity is virtually indistinguishable from that when awake
during slow - wave periods of sleep however , when brain activity significantly decreases , they found a 10-fold acceleration of activity , so that the mice were â looking around â even more than when they were awake
â the finding could lead to new treatments for navigational problems , which are among the first major symptoms of alzheimer âs disease and other neurological disorders
lead author of the study , dr adrien peyrache , said : â the coordinated activity during the majority of sleep likely represents a consolidation of places , events and times , a sort of navigational backup system in the brain , during which the brain stores a map to memory
the finding could lead to new treatments for navigational problems , which are among the first major symptoms of alzheimer âs disease and other neurological disorders
