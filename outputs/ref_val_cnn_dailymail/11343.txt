we 've all been tightening our belts for a few years and judging by the chancellor âs trousers , so has he in fact , his half - mast turn - ups attracted almost as many comments among twitter users as some of his budget measures
some accused him of looking like a schoolboy while others pointed to the fact that his navy blue suit , unusually , had three buttons rather than the standard two and curiously high lapels
the budget suit â accessorised with a sombre , pale grey tie - provoked the strongest reaction on twitter yesterday
george osborne 's half - mast turn - ups attracted almost as many comments on twitter as his budget measures some even accused mr osborne , 43 , of wearing make - up , pointing to what appeared to be a tell - tale foundation line along his jaw , while his hair was compared to that of hollywood star antonio banderas
it is not the first time his appearance has attracted comments
his look yesterday was a far cry from his appearance back in 2010 , when he first took up the government post and favoured a slightly more old fashioned hair - cut and suit .
