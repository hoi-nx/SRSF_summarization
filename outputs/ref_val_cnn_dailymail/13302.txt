the sack and pillage of the mosul museum by the so - called islamic and syria displayed a violence rarely seen since the destruction of the buddhas of bamyian
the bulldozing of the archaeological site of nimrud marked a new step in the cultural cleansing underway in iraq
these acts are a deliberate attack against civilians , minorities , heritage sites and traditions
in the minds of terrorists , murder and destruction of culture are inherently linked
it is appalling to see the ravages of this violent extremism in a region that is a cradle of civilization , whose temples , palaces and frescoes have born witness to the glory of iraq and mesopotamian for the last 3,000 years
it is important we understand the true nature of this conflict
this war against culture is a war against people
it is part of a strategy to crush free thinking and to ensure domination through oppression
and we also call on all people everywhere -- and especially youth , in iraq and elsewhere -- to claim this heritage as their own
pre-islamic heritage in iraq belongs to all iraq , just as the pyramids are written into the identity of all egyptians
