dhanusha , nepal at kathmandu 's tribhuvan international airport , hundreds of migrant workers line up daily at the immigration counters , clutching newly printed passports and boarding passes
this time , however , i 'm at the airport to follow up on the repatriation of the most unfortunate of these migrant workers -- far too many of them make the return journey in caskets
almost every day , the remains of three or four workers arrive back in nepal from the middle east , according to bhola prasad siwakoti , the secretary of the nepal ministry of labor and manpower
every other day , at least one dead body arrives from qatari , he said
" nepal migrant workers have the lowest per capita income in qatari , " says mishra , who served as ambassador to qatari from 2007 to 2012
" they get exploited the most out of all the migrant workers
we are waiting for the body of kishun das , who left nepal for qatari only eight months ago
the 38 - year old was his family 's breadwinner and the father of five children
his younger brother , bishun , is at the airport to receive the body
he also works in qatari and is in nepal on leave
" we do n't have money to bring other family members to receive the body , " he says
" with more than 350,000 migrant workers , nepalis make up the second - biggest community in qatari , after indian , the embassy in qatari claims
when contacted about the deaths of foreign workers in qatari , a spokesman for the labor ministry said that all workers deserve to be protected against exploitation
al-mraikhi estimated that some 400 indian and nepal workers die each year in qatari
" it is desperately unfortunate that any worker should die overseas , in a foreign land , away from their family , " the spokesman said
" while the vast majority of workers in qatari are fairly treated , we recognise that a minority are not
before qatari won the right to stage the fifa world cup in 2022 and embarked on a hugely ambitious , holistic construction plan to support it , it was a single flight a day
" they are mostly migrant workers returning home , " an airport official tells us
we spot a cargo worker transporting a bright red box carrying the body of kishun das
the coffin is loaded on to a jeep provided for free by the nepal government
the nepal government has eight vehicles designated to deliver coffins
all of us eat except for kishun das ' brother
" back in qatari , where alcohol is banned , he and his friends manage to fulfill their needs courtesy of the local black market , he tells us
dozens of villagers have already gathered at kishun das ' home
mishra , the former ambassador , says 55 % of nepal migrant workers deaths in qatari are from " sudden " cardiac arrest , 20 % die from work - related accidents , 15 % from traffic accidents and an alarming 10 % commit suicide
nepal government records show more than 290 workers have died in the gulf state in the past 420 days
put another way , two nepal workers die in qatari every three days
" in kishun das ' village , almost all the men we meet have spent time working in the middle east
many had recently returned from qatari
and again , amongst the keening and wailing of his distraught family , no one is sure how kishun das , brought back home in a red coffin along hazardous roads , met his end in qatari .
