the new delhi gang - rape victim 's father has called on all countrymen to watch a banned documentary which showed his daughter 's killer blaming the student for ' being out at night '
india 's daughter was described as the ' bitter truth ' by the young woman 's father after it quoted the views of her rapist mukesh singh , who is on death row over the 2012 attack
the film by award - winning briton udwin , who produced 1999 indie hit east is east , was due to air on the bbc and india news channel ndtv to mark international women 's day this sunday
but it was dropped by ndtv following a ban on the film by the india government , and the bbc brought forward its screening to last night , citing a strong public interest
' the hour - long documentary aired as part of the long - running storyville series on bbc , and is believed to have been accessed by many in india on sites such as youtube
today the victim 's family showed their support for the film , saying the rapist 's comments had to be be exposed because they expressed how many people still think
the victim 's father , who is named in the documentary but kept anonymous by some international news agencies , told ndtv the film was ' the bitter truth '
horror : the crew obtained an interview with killer mukesh singh , who said the student was to blame ' everyone should watch the film , ' he said
' if a man can speak like that in jail , imagine what he would say if he was walking free ? ' the victim 's mother added she did not object to the ban but believed mukesh singh 's views were widespread in india
' mukesh singh was one of five men convicted over the rape and murder of the physiotherapy student , who was lured aboard a bus along with a friend in december 2012
once inside , bus driver mukesh singh , his brother ram , gym instructor vinay sharma , 20 , bus cleaner akshay thakur , 28 , fruit - seller pawan gupta , 19 , and an unnamed teenager launched the attack
' he claimed ' you ca n't clap with one hand - it takes two ' and insisted : ' a decent girl wo n't roam around at 9 o'clock at night
now , everyone is going to want to see it ' protest : jyoti 's death sparked outrage in india with many taking to the new delhi streets to demand better protection for women and a change in a culture which sees them as second - class citizens ' a girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy
the rapists ' own defence lawyer ml sharma told the documentary : ' we have the best culture
' home minister rajnath singh said of the film : ' under no circumstances should this be telecast ' a second defence lawyer , ap singh , said if his daughter or sister ' engaged in pre-marital activities ... in front of my entire family , i would put petrol on her and set her alight '
home minister rajnath singh told parliament yesterday that the government sought the ban because mukesh singh 's comments were ' highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women '
' mass protests : the december 2012 gang - rape and murder of a young physiotherapy student highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in india and led to a major reform of the country 's rape laws
