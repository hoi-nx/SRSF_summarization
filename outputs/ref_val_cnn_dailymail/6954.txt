last month , the fast - food chain began looking at how it could make breakfast available later in the day , said jeff stratton , head of mcdonald 's usa
offering both the breakfast menu past 10.30am alongside the lunch menu had been considered logistically impossible , given the tight kitchen spaces of the restaurants
