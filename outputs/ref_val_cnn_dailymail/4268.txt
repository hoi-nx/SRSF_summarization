a radical extension of lady thatcher âs flagship housing policy is set to be included in the conservative manifesto as tories bid to woo working - class voters
the reform , backed by senior conservatives including iain duncan smith , boris johnson and david davis , is expected to be included in a â big doorstep offer â on housing from the tories

the coalition has increased right to buy discounts , meaning more council homes are already moving to the private sector
prime minister david cameron ( pictured left ) is a big supporter of right to buy , a downing street source said , and the reform is backed by senior conservatives , including the mayor of london boris johnson ( right ) but housing associations have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing
right to buy , introduced in 1980 , led to more than 1.5million council homes being sold at discounted rates
senior tories believe a â right to own â would attract more â c2 voters â â the skilled working classes that helped deliver lady thatcher âs election victories
