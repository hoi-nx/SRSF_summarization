just as chancellor george osborne ratcheted up company car tax for thousands of motorists , german giant bmw unveiled its new ' budget buster ' â its first mainstream plug - in petrol - electric hybrid suv
it 'll help keep company car tax far lower than for a conventionally fuelled version
the new ' green ' bmw x5 xdrive40e ( pictured ) can be charged at home , can run on electric power only and switches constantly between petrol and electric power while on the move it has a top speed of 131 mph , will sprint to 62mph in 6.8 seconds and will be launched at next month 's new york motor show
average fuel consumption of up to 85 mpg and co2 emissions â on which company car tax and road tax are based â are a low 77g/km
bmw says : ' short , everyday journeys in urban areas can easily be completed with zero exhaust emissions , while actual fuel consumption is reduced substantially when driving for distances of up to approximately 15 miles in urban traffic
' however , the budget measures also mean most company car drivers will be thousands of pounds worse off
there will be a 3 percentage point hike in the tax in 2019 - 20
it means a higherrate taxpayer with a Â£ 28,000 nissan qashqai 1.6 - litre company car will be Â£ 1,008 worse off after just five years with a total annual benefit - in - kind tax bill of Â£ 3,360
city accountant deloitte says the hikes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four - year deals who ' in good faith ' chose a frugal model , only to find it re-classified just a couple of years later as ' a gas - guzzler ' , and taxed accordingly
