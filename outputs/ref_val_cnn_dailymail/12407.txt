but this list was apparently made by the three uk schoolgirls suspected of traveling from london to syria to join isis , according to uk 's guardian newspaper , which has seen the document
the girls ' families told uk lawmakers tuesday they had no idea what the girls were planning , and said they were baffled by the teenagers ' decision to leave their homes and families
relatives also had harsh words for police , who they said failed to keep them informed after a close friend of the girls headed to syria in december
amira 's father , hussen abase , told lawmakers at a hearing of the home affairs select committee that he had no idea his daughter was planning to go or that she might have been radicalized
who are the missing uk girls ? the families ' criticism of law enforcement hinges on a february 5 letter from the police which was given to the three girls to give to their parents , rather than being sent directly to the parents
metropolitan police chief hogan-howe apologized for his officers ' failure to get the letter directly to the parents , in his testimony before the committee
but he also pointed out the difficulties for police in conducting what was at that time a missing person inquiry for the first girl who left , with no sign that these three were planning to follow suit
he said subsequent police investigations indicated the three girls had paid in cash for their plane tickets to turkey at a local travel agency , using money linked to the theft of jewelry from their families

asked how the uk might be able to get the girls back , rowley cited an incentive : as long as they 're not connected to terrorist offenses , they 'll be able to return to their families

who has been recruited to isis from the west ? the list was reportedly found in the bedroom of one of the girls and handed to police after her family realized she was missing
over the weekend , the girls ' families asked for an apology from london 's metropolitan police over the force 's handling of the case
a deputy principal at the girls ' school was present for the meeting and afterward contacted the parents of the seven girls , on the advice of police , and told them that the girls ' friend , referred to only as " girl 1 , " had been reported missing
an officer who then spoke to the same group of girls on february 5 gave them the letters addressed to their parents asking for further help from their daughters , the police statement said
" with the benefit of hindsight , we acknowledge that the letters could have been delivered direct to the parents , " the police statement said
