next time someone asks you how wide the milky way is , you might want to rethink your answer of ' 100,000 light - years '
astronomers have discovered that a strange ring of distant stars may actually be part of our galaxy , making it 50 per cent bigger at 150,000 light - years wide
this is based on re-analysis of a distant ring that surrounds our galaxy , which the astronomers think is now actually part of the milky way
astronomers in new york have revised the size estimate for our galaxy ( shown )
they now say it is 50 per cent bigger in size at 150,000 light - years wide , not 100,000 light - years
this is based on re-examining a ring of stars in the so - called monoceros ring the team of scientists from rensselaer polytechnic institute in new york studied the monoceros ring , which is a long ring - like filament of stars that â wraps â around our galaxy three times
it is located 65,000 light - years from our galaxy âs centre , and in total is 200,000 light - years in length
previously it was thought to be a stream of stars torn from the nearby canis major dwarf galaxy due to interactions with the milky way
