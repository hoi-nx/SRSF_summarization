archaeologists have long speculated that the enormous manmade structure in wiltshire was an ornate grave or a ceremonial altar used in rituals the neolithic period - also known as the ' neolithic ' - spanned from around 4000 to 2,500 bc and was characterised by the adoption of agriculture and a more sedentary style of living
gods : new importance was placed on religion , and ritual ( neolithic religious monument pictured ) the preceding period of the last , post-glacial hunter - gatherer societies is known as the mesolithic , or middle stone age
it was believed that the introduction of farming into britain was the result of a huge migration from mainland europe , but genetic research suggests that the influx was probably small - somewhere around 20 per cent of the total population
the earliest of these are the chambered tombs of the early neolithic but later stone circles were built , a trend that continued into the bronze age
