new zealand are on course for a first ever world cup title after a thrilling semifinal victory over south africa , secured off the penultimate ball of the match
chasing an adjusted target of 298 in just 43 overs after a rain interrupted the match at eden park , grant elliott hit a six right at the death to confirm victory and send the auckland crowd into raptures
it is the first time new zealand has ever reached a world cup final , and it will play either australia or india on sunday
te pair face each other in sydney on thursday
south africa were motoring with the bat before a two - hour delay for poor weather
though its total was escalated by the duckworth / lewis method -- used to calculate a revised target in the event of a rain delay -- new zealand held firm thanks to grant elliott
" i do n't think this win is for myself or the team , but everyone here , " grant elliott said at the post-match presentation
when you have 45,000 fans screaming at you every ball ... " it has been an absolute pleasure playing in front of this crowd
it is the first final we have been in as new zealand
" south africa , who themselves have never reached the final , have been accused of choking in past installments of the one - day competition
but that indictment can not be leveled at it after one of the most dramatic matches in world cup history
new zealand 's target was upgraded via duckworth / lewis , a calculation that takes into account how many overs were left and how many wickets had been lost , to 298
kiwi skipper mccullum got it off to a fast start with a 22 - ball half - century but after he was dismissed it wobbled , and needed 139 from 22 overs
but grant elliott was the steadying hand , judging his innings perfectly
and though he was dropped in the penultimate over , he struck the telling blow off steyn to seal victory and inflict a fourth semifinal defeat on south africa
" what a great innings from grant elliott
we do n't mind whom we face in the final
" should australia beat india at the sydney cricket ground , then the joint hosts of the world cup will meet in the final in melbourne
