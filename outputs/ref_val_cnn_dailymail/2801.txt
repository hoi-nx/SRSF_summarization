niall and his biological sister fran , pictured during their first meeting last week , when they were reunited 50 years after being separated a brother and sister who were separated as babies and put up for adoption five decades ago have been reunited after realising they grew up just 500 metres apart
niall , 51 , a radio presenter in dublin , met his biological sister who now lives in london , fran , 49 , for the first time this weekend after finding each other online last year
niall , who has a show on irish radio station classic hits 4fm , hit the headlines last year when he spoke about discovering that his birth mother had a little girl when he was just 13 months old in 1965
he said he only learned that he had a sister when the information was disclosed â casually â in a letter from the adoption agency
niall had been adopted from st patrick âs home on dublin âs navan road by frank and lily boylan , and grew up in raheny with the couple âs biological daughter geraldine and a younger brother arthur , who was also adopted
his decision to speak out last year led indirectly to the reunion with sister fran , who had begun the process of finding out more about the circumstances of her own birth
in recent years , fran âs sister told her that her birth mother had turned to the courts to try to keep her
â fran went on to meet her birth mother four years ago , an encounter she describes as â overwhelming â
however , her birth mother did not tell her about the existence of brother niall
last year , she was contacted by an adoption agency telling her they had received a letter from her older brother who wanted to get in touch
â st patrick 's mother and baby home on the navan road in dublin , where niall and fran 's mother was living with them as babies and from where they were adopted niall when he was a baby ( left ) and as a toddler ( right )
he was adopted by frank and lily boylan , and grew up in raheny with the couple âs biological daughter geraldine and a younger brother arthur , who was also adopted niall 's original birth document , which registers his birth at st patrick 's home on september 21 , 1963 she flew to meet her brother for the first time last weekend , along with her partner , and the pair went for dinner and a night out together
â his sister , who has two adult children , said : â to meet niall after all these years is wonderful
fran , who works as an estate agent and has a son , 27 , and daughter , 22 , said : â i was born in november 1965 , just 13 months after niall and we would have been in st patrick âs at the same time
â fran âs adoptive family , the kavanaghs , who she is no longer in touch with after her adopted parents died when she was a teenager , moved from glasnevin to raheny , where niall lived , in 1969
â niall is a radio presenter on irish station classic hits 4fm
it was through his high media profile that fran was easily able to track him down and contacted him through his email on the station 's website the pair found out about each other after being sent a letter from an adoption agency
fran was given the name of her brother and began searching for him online and came across the irish dj and got in touch she pointed out that one of niall 's best friends even dj 'd at her 21st birthday party
both niall , a father of three , and fran have met their biological mother in recent years
she eventually married and had a fourth child , and raised her two youngest children with her husband , who was never told of the existence of niall and fran
niall said : â i feel sorry for my mother : she âs old and does nât remember a huge amount
â fran explained that she had little interest in discovering her background until recent years
fran ( right ) with her 27 - year - old son ( centre ) and her 22 - year - old daughter ( left ) together recently â i âm delighted now that i found out
â the pair plan to meet up again the future and fran , who will be 50 this year , is holding her birthday party back home in dublin .
