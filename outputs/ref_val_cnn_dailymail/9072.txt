easterby , 34 , says she no longer takes daughter alexis to sure start centre , darlington , after she was told to take her buggy outside council bosses have come under fire after barring parents from bringing their prams into a mother and baby centre for ' health and safety reasons ' , telling them to use an outside buggy park instead
the angry parents say staff at the sure start centre in darlington are forcing them to leave expensive prams chained up in freezing weather , and fear they could become a target for thieves
it is thought the buggy park has been in place for around three weeks , despite previous government advice saying there is no need for a ' blanket ban ' on prams inside children 's centres
' there is no way i 'm going to leave the pram chained up outside , i could n't afford to replace it if it was stolen and i do n't want to put my baby into a freezing cold buggy when we come back out
' if word gets out that we are leaving our prams outside then we could be targeted
' after refusing to leave her pram unattended , natalie henderson , 28 , claims she was told to take her baby to another centre to be weighed
' i 'm not putting my baby into a freezing cold pram - it needs sorting , i ca n't get my baby weighed
' i needed to take him in to be weighed so i agreed but when i came back out and put him in the buggy he was freezing and developed a cold as a result
' i understand that the ban wo n't be such a big deal in summer and i went back last week and explained that i could n't leave my buggy inside again
the government 's health and safety executive responded to similar cases by saying : ' there is no health and safety reason for a blanket ban on buggies and prams in a children 's centre
' darlington 's mp jenny chapman said : ' only a crazy person would insist parents wake their sleeping children before they 're ready
' we 've asked people to use their judgement , particularly at busy times , and park their prams and buggies in the covered , on - site buggy park
