george osborne yesterday boasted that this year families will be Â£ 900 better off than in 2010 , while labour claims workers are Â£ 1,600 worse off
the tories ' focus on real household disposable income takes into account the effect of tax and benefit changes , and suggests incomes overtaking 2010 levels by the end of 2015 chancellor george osborne argues that families will be better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 one of the big surprises of the budget yesterday was george osborne 's announcement that incomes this year would be higher in real terms than in 2010
after years of austerity and slow growth , many tories had given up hope being able to go into the election with voters feeling the benefits of the recovery
' now , the facts show households on average will be around Â£ 900 better off in 2015 than they were in 2010 â and immeasurably more secure for living in a country whose economy is not in crisis anymore , but is instead growing and creating jobs
' labour 's ed balls claims wages are worth Â£ 1,600 less in real terms than they were in 2010 labour has long argued that wages outstripped by inflation have left workers feeling poorer
they argue that average weekly earnings have fallen in real terms from Â£ 453 in 2010 to Â£ 418 in april 2014
the attack is based on the claim that austerity choked off the recovery in 2010 , leaving employers unable to give pay rises
each year that prices rose faster than wages , workers saw that they cash did not go as far each month as it used to
in the commons today , ed balls declared : ' for all the chancellor 's hubris , yesterday 's budget has changed nothing for working people in our country
' the chancellor spent an hour telling people they have never had it so good but working people are still gbp1 , 600 a year worse off on average after five years of the tories
george osborne used real household disposable income , which is the amount of money a family has after tax and benefit changes take effect
figures published by the office for budget responsibility show that real household disposable income is lower than in 2010 in every year until the end of 2015 , before rising annually towards 2019
technically it means that incomes will not be above 2010 levels until the end of this year , not before the election
ed balls uses gross weekly earnings , which is the amount workers are paid before tax and benefit changes take effect
labour 's figures also only cover the period up to april 2014 , compared to mr george osborne 's date at the end of 2015
paul johnson , director of the ifs , said : ' average household incomes have just about regained their pre-recession levels
real incomes should be above their 2010 level as mr george osborne says
