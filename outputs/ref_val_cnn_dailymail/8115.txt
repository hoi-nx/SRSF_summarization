anorexia nervosa sufferers - and those who have recovered from the eating disorder - are being asked to donate their blood so scientists can investigate the condition 's hereditary links and why there is a spike in cases when women are going through puberty and menopause
the world 's largest and most rigorous investigation into anorexia , led by international researchers , hopes to identify and better understand the disorder 's causes and ultimately help lead to a treatment or cure that could help the estimated 53,000 australian suffering from it
amongst those who plan to roll up their sleeve in sydney on tuesday is 27 - year - old founder of website lazylaw.com and blogger kate horman , who suffered from anorexia for ten years before she turned her life around
' world - leading anorexia nervosa researcher , professor bulik told daily mail australia that new research has revealed that people living with anorexia nervosa had four - times the number of relatives with anorexia nervosa than those who have never had the illness
i was utterly gutted , ashamed and heartbroken ' ' we still do n't have effective treatments or medication that target anorexia nervosa and we really need to start looking at this illness through a new lens
' she said research has shown that anorexia nervosa is astonishingly six times more common in mothers , four times more common in siblings and five times more common in the children of people living with the illness
but world - leading anorexia nervosa researcher , professor bulik said around 60 per cent of the reason for an individual succumbing to the eating disorder is genetic : kate horman ( pictured ) , who once weighed 30kg at the height of her illness , now estimates she weighs a healthy 55kg ' we have been doing family and twin studies so we know anorexia runs in families and we know it is inheritable
' ms kate horman believes that a number of contributing factors led her own condition to develop , including her father abandoning her when she was 11 - years - old , a level of abuse she experienced as a child and her own ' high achiever ' attitude
standing alone , neither genetics or environmental factors are wholly responsible for an individual succumbing to the eating disorder anorexia
the research hopes to identify and better understand the disorder 's causes and ultimately help lead to a treatment or cure that could help the estimated 53,000 australian suffering from it ( stock image ) ' so , if someone who is predisposed to anorexia nervosa goes on a diet because of sociocultural reasons , that could then unlock the predisposition to the disease resulting in an eating disorder , ' she added
this could lead to massive breakthroughs in early detection and intervention , while also explaining the biological pathways that send such different messages about food
prof bulik explained there 's a ' fundamental difference ' in how people with anorexia nervosa react to hunger
' we still do n't have effective treatments or medication that target anorexia nervosa and we really need to start looking at this illness through a new lens , ' professor bulik said ' while some people may feel angry , nervous or stressed when they are hungry , people with the predisposition to anorexia feel like that at meal time instead and find that starvation actually calms them
while 1,100 australian have already rolled up their sleeves and donated to the the study professor bulik is hoping to recruit at least 2,200 blood donors within the next two years , in australian alone
ms kate horman said she turned her life around by changing everything about her life - quitting her job , breaking up with her boyfriend of eight years , moving out of her home and going overseas on her own she said there were a lot of people getting involved because they felt it may help them in the future but most of the time it 's because the community who have been affected by this devastating disease would give anything to make sure someone else does n't have to go through the same tramatic experience
ms kate horman has encouraged anorexia sufferers and those who beat the illness to take part in the study ms kate horman , who said she turned her life around by changing everything about her life - quitting her job , breaking up with her boyfriend of eight years , moving out of her home and going overseas on her own - is imploring others to take part in the research
' there was really nothing out there for me in terms of help except my mum and my gp , that 's why this study is so important to me , because there 's a real lack of funding for anorexia
' anyone who has suffered or who is suffering or an eating disorder i would absolutely encourage them to give blood because without them this study is not going to be able to move forward.the more people we have the better the scientists and doctors will be able to map the genetic profile and the more accurate the study will be
