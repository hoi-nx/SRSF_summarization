the day before george osborne delivers his budget to the nation the lta came up with its rough equivalent â the latest long term plan to revive the state of the game in britain
chief executive michael downey finally unveiled his vision for the governing body , and in budgetary terms the big winner will be those people involved in marketing the sport and trying to get more people playing it
over the next four years there will be a 50 per cent uplift in money spent on marketing , so that by 2018 around Â£ 26 million will be spent on promoting the sport of tennis in the british
michael downey reaffirmed the lta 's laudable , broad policy of building the game from the bottom up by concentrating on participation and talked through a range of worthy and sensible measures to help achieve this
not that michael downey , the former head of tennis canada who was appointed 18months ago , pulled all of his punches in presenting the latest of what have hitherto been doomed long - term plans for the british game
lta chief executive michael downey has unveiled his long term strategy to rejuvenate the game ' our sport is declining and some people have a problem hearing that , ' he said at the start
what he was specifically referring to was the problems tennis , like most other ball sports , has with declining participation numbers
despite the hundreds of millions gleaned from wimbledon championships profits and that event 's ever growing popularity , there has been an average drop of 5 per cent in adult participation over each of the past five years
among the smorgasbord of measures to improve things , there will be a drive to increase participation in parks tennis
' i think the old lta would have driven by the parks and straight into the clubs and schools , ' he said
the lta receives millions annually from funds generated by the wimbledon championships there were other sensible ideas
with tennis participation peaking in july , there will be a concerted effort to get people to start playing earlier in the year
andy murray 's victory at sw19 in 2013 spiked interest but there has been a five per cent fall in adult participation ' if you are 27 years old and still playing futures i do n't think you are going to be a top 50 player
