shadow health secretary andy burnham has demanded full details of the reports be published , after they were leaked to the the mail on sunday nhs bosses have been accused of covering up plans to close a&e units and cut hospital beds â after paying Â£ 10million for reports they are now refusing to publish
they have paid management consultants including kpmg a total of Â£ 10,282,593 for advice on â improving long - term affordability â across 11 regions that cover 13million people
such concerns are stoked by an official , watered - down summary of the project , which mentions the need for â tough decisions â to balance the books in the 11 â challenged â areas , where budgets are being overspent
shadow health secretary andy burnham last night demanded the full details be published before the election , saying : â the public , who have paid for these reports , have a right to see them before they go to vote
health secretary jeremy hunt likes to lecture the nhs about transparency , but it is clear he does nât put his money where his mouth is
â kpmg , whose advisers include former nhs chief executive sir david nicholson , was paid to produce two of the 11 reports last year
the the mail on sunday has seen the one covering staffordshire , which was leaked to a labour mp
however , nhs england has refused to publish the 11 reports , despite admitting there is â in general a strong public interest in information being made as freely available as possible â
a leaked copy of one of 11 secret reports recommended the closure of all emergency services at one hospital and the removal of potentially hundreds of beds instead , it has answered a freedom of information request from the mail on sunday , which has campaigned for more than two years to save casualty departments , by arguing that releasing them now would â prejudice the outcome â of work to draw up five - year plans for the areas
