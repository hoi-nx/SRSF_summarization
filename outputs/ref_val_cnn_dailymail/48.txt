president obama challenged republicans who oppose affordable care act to come up with an alternative at an event today celebrating the fifth anniversary of the law
in a subtle jab at republican presidential candidate ted cruz , who has zealously fought to repeal the affordable care act , obama said , ' folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law , you âve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free
' ted cruz led a 2013 filibuster in the senate that he hoped would result in a successful vote to defund the health care reform law , making it easier to legislatively dismantle
to ' folks who are basing their entire political agenda on repealing the law , ' he said , ' you âve got to explain how kicking millions of families off their insurance is somehow going to make us more free ' he and his allies were eventually defeated in that effort after a two - week stand off with democrats , who held the majority in the upper chamber at the time
but he has continued to fight to have the law nullified and named repeal a top priority in a speech announcing his candidacy for higher office on monday
the white house was wo n't to react that afternoon to ted cruz 's entry into the 2016 brawl but it did rib him over his campaign promise to throw out the sitting president 's signature policy achievement
' well , there was a presidential candidate who ran in 2012 promising to repeal the affordable care act , and that campaign pledge did nât work out very well for him , ' obama 's spokesman , earnest , told reporters , referring to that year 's republican nominee for president , mitt romney
in a twist of irony , ted cruz said tuesday that he would sign his family up for affordable care act
previously included in a plan in the name of his wife , a goldman sachs employee , ted cruz 's family will lose its health care soon as she leaves her job to join him full time on the campaign trail
earnest resisted taking a shot at ted cruz over the matter on wednesday , saying that if he does apply for a plan via the government marketplace , ' he will find is what millions of americans across the country have found , ' which is that there are good quality healthcare plans available because of the health care reform law
at the event on wednesday , obama said critics of the law need to explain ' why forcing millions of families to pay thousands of dollars more will somehow make us more secure
' defending the affordable care act , commonly called affordable care act after its biggest backer , the president , obama said , ' it âs not the â job - killer â that critics have warned about for five years
the comment was a subtle jab at republican presidential candidate ted cruz , who has zealously fought to repeal the affordable care act
ted cruz , pictured here on monday at his campaign kick off , led a 2013 filibuster in the senate that he hoped would result in a successful vote to defund the health care reform law , making it easier to legislatively dismantle obama said the reason that republican are having such a difficult time coming up with an alternative to his plan to reform the healthcare system is because it was ' pretty much was their plan before i adopted it
' repeating past claims , obama said the affordable care act is ' based on conservative , market - based principles developed by the heritage foundation and supported by republican in congress , and deployed by a guy named mitt romney in massachusetts to great effect
the president acknowledged that his administration has ' made our share of mistakes since we passed this law
' ' so if anybody wants to join us in the spirit of the people who have put aside differences to come here today and help make the law work even better , come on board , ' he said , trolling republican
to republican lawmakers who want to get rid of the law , he pointed to 28 - year - old affordable care act recipient ha , a philadelphia business owner who was present for his remarks , made from the south court of the eisenhower executive office building , which is located next door to the white house
why pay a doctor just to tell her she âs okay ? ' ha bought healthcare insurance from the federal marketplace that was created by affordable care act at the behest of her mother , he said
