any mother who is charged with getting a young family ready in the morning knows exactly how physically demanding it can be
before lili , from barnet , north london , even heads out to school in the morning she has to help to get three people dressed , as well as put on the wash and make breakfast for her family
sarah is separated from lili 's father graeme and has two other younger children , three - year - old tyler , who suffers from adhd ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ) and two - year - old kaya , who , more often than not , lili is charged with taking care of
' sarah ( left ) says she feels guilty that she has to ask lili to help with family life
lili ( right ) can prepare family meals including pie and mash and spaghetti bolognese and knows how to use a knife safely an average day continues with kaya preparing ' coco pops and milk ' for her little sister and making her mother a cup of tea
the organisation has launched a new website , babble.carers.org , specifically for children who are caring for siblings or grown ups
the charity adds that many children feel they ca n't share the burden of what 's happening at home , with up to 39 per cent of young carers not admitting to a teacher that they are looking after someone
another harrowing statistic is that children caring for others often face bullying , with 68 per cent of young carers saying they have faced name - calling at school
lili is a dab hand in the kitchen but says she does n't feel like she 's missing out : ' the only time i feel a bit jealous of other kids is when i go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps ' for lili , school offers some respite from the relentless routine at home
when the school bell rings in the afternoon , lili can often find herself head of the kitchen , preparing family staples such as spaghetti bolognese and pie and mash
although sarah arranges for food shopping to be delivered , little lili is no stranger to running errands and is a familiar face at the local shops
' i feel constantly guilty that lili does so much for me and the other kids , ' says sarah
' sarah says the situation was made worse when she split with her partner graeme in 2014 , quickly plunging lili into the role as key carer
sarah ( left ) separated from her partner graeme last year , leaving lili ( centre ) a key ally in caring for her younger children kaya ( far left ) , now 2 and tyler , ( far right ) now 3 time for fun : sarah makes sure lili ( above right ) is well supported
the eight - year - old is part of a local group for young carers and has access to a counsellor if she needs it ' she 's always been so grown up and capable
' i do worry lili will end up resenting me one day
' in a bid to inject some fun into lili 's life , sarah ensures that her daughter is as well supported as she can be
