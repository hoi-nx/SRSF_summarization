it will be trebles all round on sunday night when two of the most expensive forward lines of all time come face to face in the nou camp â barcelona âs three - pronged attack of luis suarez , neymar and lionel messi up against real trio cristiano ronaldo , gareth bale and karim benzema
but with luis suarez missing the first two months of the season and lionel messi out of form before the turn of the year , there is a feeling that the barcelona strike - force gave their real counterparts a head start and are about to go past them
cristiano ronaldo , gareth bale and karim benzema have scored 56 league goals between them this season in the 2008 - 09 campaign barcelona 's front three of henry , samuel eto'o and lionel messi scored 100 goals both attacks had a tendency to come good in the clasico and henry played in one of the most famous real - barcelona games in 2009 with barcelona winning 6 - 2 at the bernabeu , henry and lionel messi both scoring twice
real âs â bbc â forward line are a little more out of sorts with karim benzema , gareth bale and cristiano ronaldo having scored five each since the turn of the year
