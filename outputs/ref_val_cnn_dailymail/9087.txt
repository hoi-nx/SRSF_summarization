they found that worms would choose to respond to a nearby odour depending on what they were â thinking â about - suggesting they have free will just like humans
the study was carried out by scientists at rockefeller university in new york
they found roundworms ( pictured ) would sometimes ' think ' for themselves
all the neurons within this microscopic roundworm are highlighted , with the large cluster at one end representing the brain the research was carried out by scientists from the rockefeller university in new york who studied the brain of the microscopic roundworm caenorhabditis elegans
worms spend their time wandering , looking for decomposing matter to eat - and when they smell it , they usually stop making random turns and travel straight toward the source
as the worms pick up the alluring fruity smell of isoamyl alcohol , the neurons in the network transition into a low activity state that allows them to approach the odour
but sometimes the neurons remain highly active , and the worm continues to wander around - even though its sensory neuron has detected the odour
they found that , if offered a ' delicious ' smell , the roundworm will usually stop its wandering to investigate the source - but sometimes it wo nât
just as with humans , the same stimulus does not always provoke the same response , even from the same individual
â we found that the collective state of the three neurons at the exact moment an odour arrives determines the likelihood that the worm will move toward the smell , â said study author dr cori bargmann â so , in essence , what the worm is thinking about at the time determines how it responds
â the researchers also found that by changing the activity of the neurons individually , and in combination , they could pinpoint each neuron âs role in generating variability
in humans , the research may suggest ways in which our brains process competing motivations
' for humans , a hungry state might lead to you walk across the street to a delicious smelling restaurant , ' said author gordus
when the researchers shut off rim and ava individually and together , they found aib âs response to the odour signal improved
