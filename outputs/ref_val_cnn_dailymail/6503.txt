penn is adamant that he has no reason to apologize for making a green card jibe at the expense of mexican director alejandro iã±ã¡rritu while handing him his academy awards for birdman
when the time came to reveal to the academy awards that alejandro iã±ã¡rritu had triumphed , penn asked ' who gave this son of a bitch his green card ? ' before announcing his film as the winner
the joke prompted a storm of outrage from critics who branded the comments xenophobic - but penn has today said he has ' absolutely no apologies ' and that the only reason anyone could be offended is their own ' flagrant stupidity '
he called the reaction ' flagrant stupidity ' according to penn , the jibe was part of his friendship with iã±ã¡rritu , with whom he has worked in the past - and even a way to let him know of his victory seconds before everyone else
speaking at a promo event in beverly hills for one of his own movies , penn said of the reaction to the joke : ' i 'm always surprised by flagrant stupidity
' alejandro iã±ã¡rritu directed penn in the 2003 film 21 grams and the two remain close
