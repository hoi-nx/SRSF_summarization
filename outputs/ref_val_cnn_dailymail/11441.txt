eating too much salt may be bad for your heart â but it can protect against skin infections , research has found
a high - salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin , boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections , say scientists
in an experiment , german researchers discovered that mice which were fed a high - salt diet healed infections in their feet more quickly
too much salt may be bad for your heart but it can protect against skin infections , new research found this is because the salt had raised the activity of immune cells called macrophages , making their immune systems more responsive
the findings , published in the journal cell metabolism , may also highlight how salt was once effectively used to ward off infections before antibiotics were invented
' a high - salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin , boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections , say scientists the researchers found that infected areas in patients with bacterial skin infections also showed remarkably high salt accumulation
but in experiments high salt diet mice had increased immunity against microbial infections by boosting the activity of immune cells called macrophages
