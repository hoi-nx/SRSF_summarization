in three weeks britain will undergo a pensions revolution allowing older workers to cash in their pension pots and spend the money as they wish , rather than having to buy an annuity
but the ico fears it could be a bonanza for sharks and ' snake oil salesmen ' targeting older people with texts and cold calls to try to get their hands on their pension pots
anyone who hands over their investment as a result of scam messages could be left penniless â and still facing a huge tax bill
criminals are urging pension savers to invest in scams ranging from dubious wealth funds to overseas homes that do not even exist
there is already growing evidence that scammers are gearing up for the april 6 pension ' liberation day '
the number of spam calls and texts related to pensions reported to the watchdog rose by 66 per cent in february
pensions minister mr steve webb has in recent months admitted he himself was cold called and sent spam texts about pensions
yesterday pensions minister steve webb , architect of the reforms , said anyone cold called by a firm offering them a free pensions review should ' put the phone down ' last month he told a conference he had received a text saying : ' if you have a frozen pension prior to 55 you are entitled to a free review
' yesterday the ico served a legal notice on a company in swansea , uk , for sending nearly 190,000 spam texts including many thousands about pensions
one message said : ' as you have over 10k in your pension , your pension has lost Â£ 3,219.43 over the last few years , to get back & find out your payout reply review
new rules which come into force on the same day as the pensions reforms will allow the ico to impose fines of up to half a million pounds on cold call and nuisance text firms
chief executive lesley titcomb said : ' the people behind pension scams are often agile , sophisticated and organised
a text might typically offer a ' free pension review ' , ' one - off investment opportunity ' or promise of ' upfront cash '
their prize is your pension pot â and they need you to agree to sign a funds transfer form to get their hands on it
legally , your original pension provider â usually an insurer â can only agree to transfer the money on the condition it will go straight to another registered pension plan.however , the scammers â acting as the broker â do no such thing
they 'll take the money and then release only a chunk of it to you as a loan or cash sum
