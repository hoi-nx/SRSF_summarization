a weekend report claiming that a top adviser to president obama leaked to the press that the political heavyweight and fellow democrat hillary clinton was using a personal email address during her time as secretary of state is ' baloney , ' the white house said monday
the new york post on saturday claimed that valerie jarrett , a close confidant of both the president and first lady michelle obama , divulged details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the white house
the bad press was reportedly timed to become public just as clinton was planning to announce her candidacy for president
according to the new york post article , authored by klein , a source close to the white house disclosed that ' obama and valerie jarrett will go to any lengths to prevent hillary clinton from becoming president
' sources claim that the long rumored tension between obama and the clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the democrat party refused to be seen campaigning with president obama
jarrett is reported to have commented that the defections were linked to the clintons , who she believed had begun ' marginalizing the president ' and were ' trying to wrestle control of the democratic away from obama
then , shortly after the midterm elections , she , the president and the first lady , reportedly sat down with clinton and told her in no uncertain terms that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president
jarrett has reportedly been speaking to martin oâmalley ( above ) , the former governor of maryland , about running in 2016 she has also reportedly reached out to senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts about entering the primary klein , the author of blood feud : the clintons vs. the obamas , also says he spoke to a friend of the clintons , who told him that bill said ; ' my contacts and friends in newspapers and tv tell me that they âve been contacted by the white house and offered all kinds of negative stories about us
all of this , i 'm told , is prompted by valerie jarrett and the president , who do not want to see hillary clinton become president of the united states
' jarrett , 58 , is one of president obama âs longest serving advisers
