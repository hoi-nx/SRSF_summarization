betrayed : controversial critic sewell revealed once - trusted friends have stolen his paintings he has built an impressive art collection over a decades - long career as britain âs most - feared critic
but now sewell has revealed that some of the works he has accumulated have gone missing â stolen by once - trusted friends
â how untrustworthy friends can become
â none of mr sewell âs light - fingered visitors are likely to face justice since he has decided to not report the matter to police
the critic , who is suffering from cancer , refuses to identify those he holds responsible for betraying him but makes it abundantly clear that he knows who they are
the thefts have occurred over the past ten years and came to light recently when he started sorting through his belongings , bagging up old clothes for charity and consigning other unwanted items to the bonfire
friends and acquaintances visiting his home in wimbledon , london , have made off with paintings and drawings , he says , and , when challenged , have denied all knowledge
however , sewell has confessed that he occasionally indulged in similar behaviour himself when visiting friends â homes â though on a much smaller scale
i have a theory that only men steal books , although when i proposed that to a woman a month or two ago she was absolutely outraged
â the 84 - year - old has admitted to disliking children but loving animals â ironically as his latest book is aimed at youngsters
