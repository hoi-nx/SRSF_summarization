yesterday , as she dazzled in diamonds and a crimson floor - length dress , mexican first lady rivera looked regal enough to rival the queen
but while the 45 - year - old might look like the consummate political wife , her telenovela acting career has repeatedly come back to haunt her
ms rivera , who initially counteracted the claims by insisting that the reason the title deeds were not in her name was because she had n't finished paying for it , was forced onto the back foot as more revelations came to light
all change : yesterday saw ms rivera , resplendent in a cream ensemble , meet the queen in london honour : she later attended a state dinner at buckingham palace with the queen and prince philip chic : ms rivera won plaudits from critics for her striking choice of outfit , including serious jewels interestingly , days before the report emerged , a high speed rail contract handed to constructora teya , an affiliate of grupo higa , was mysteriously cancelled
peã±a nieto , who had come to power pledging to end the bloody rule of the drug cartels , mishandled the situation , say critics , when in september last year , 43 students were kidnapped in iguala
expenses : the latest scandal is about a 2010 house purchase , while ms rivera was still a soap actress soap star : ms rivera was once a familiar face on mexican tv thanks to her soap acting career performer : ms rivera in destilando amor ( left ) and dressed up for the red carpet at a press event ( right ) the crime immediately sparked nationwide protests which intensified when iguala 's mayor , josã© luis abarca velã¡zquez , and his wife marã­a de los ãngeles pineda villa , were accused of masterminding the massacre
and the controversy is still not over - even as the embattled peã±a nieto and ms rivera flew into london on monday , critics were questioning whether the visit should go ahead
such controversy is all a far cry from the early days of ms rivera 's career when , as a fresh - faced 17 - year - old in mexico , she entered a newspaper modelling competition and won
ms rivera was still married at the time that early success launched a career that would go on to include a brief spell as a swimwear model followed by a move into acting , starting in 1989 when she won a small part in telenovela dulce desafã­o
a long - and apparently lucrative - career , most of it spent at mexico 's largest broadcaster televisa , was born , with ms rivera going on to star in succession of low - budget soaps , among them alcanzar una estrella ii and , most recently , destilando amor
ms rivera , then still married to her ex-husband , tv producer josã© alberto castro , with whom she has three daughters , was smitten by the charismatic peã±a nieto
lucky break : ms rivera in bridal white at her wedding to president peã±a nieto in 2010 support : during the 2012 presidential election , ms rivera was a constant presence at peã±a nieto 's side first lady : since peã±a nieto took office , ms rivera has embraced a more conservative style of dressing following peã±a nieto 's election in 2012 , the washington post noted of his marriage to ms pretelli , who died in 2007 , that : ' women love him and he had extramarital affairs
' presumably , those ' extramarital affairs ' are now a thing of the past , with ms rivera now in charge of an increasingly public portfolio , not least her installation as president of national system for integral family development ( national system for integral family development ) in 2013
the acting career is also gone , with ms rivera declaring her intention to focus on ' this great responsibility by his side ' shortly after her husband was elected
