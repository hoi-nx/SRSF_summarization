a tumour growing inside of amanda caused a headache so severe that it drove her to stab herself in the head with a knife to try and relieve the pain
what is even more shocking is that surgeons found hair and teeth inside her tumour when they removed it from her right ovary
amanda 's ordeal started three days before christmas when she went to work with a blistering headache
amanda , from rutherford in nsw , was struck down with a headache just before christmas a tumour found in ovary caused her to stab herself in the head and go into a psychosis
amanda 's ( left ) sister , rachael ( right ) , had to watch her sister go through the ordeal as the day wore on and the pain did not go away , amanda , from rutherford in nsw , texted her sister - rachael - who told her to go to the sick bay
when rachael , 27 , visited her later in the day , she became concerned when amanda complained there was ' something in my head ' and she needed to get it out
the 27 - year - old told that 's life ! amanda 's forehead did look swollen so she took her to hospital , where doctors did some tests and found nothing wrong with her
it took specialists weeks to diagnose amanda 's condition , which caused her to experience mood swings amanda before the tumour took over her body and drove her to take up a knife and stab herself in the head to relieve the pressure of her headache frantically , she rushed to be at her sister 's bedside but nothing prepared her for what she would see when she walked into amanda 's room
the tumour found on the ovary is named a teratoma , which could possibly have teeth , hair or brain tissue
this tricks the body 's immune system into attacking the brain
her father told rachael that amanda had tried to stab herself in the head with a knife
surgeons found an 8cm tumour on amanda 's right ovary , which had hair and teeth inside it amanda and partner nathan who stayed with her throughout the ordeal in hospital one time rachael fed her sister water and she spat it out at her
amanda would also throw abuse at her loved ones and hospital staff

surgeons removed the 8cm tumour on her ovary , but there was another surprise inside it - hair and teeth
' despite the months that have passed , rachael thinks her sister is still not back to the amanda she knew
