and with rugby âs six nations tournament reaching a climax yesterday , you longed for a brief pause in which the referee could consult a fourth official who could adjudicate on the red card â he would have probably concurred â and then ensure the right man is sent off

west brom might have felt a little more aggrieved for the second goal on 40 minutes â though it too involved some dreadful defending
joe hart collides with west brom defender olsson as he comes out to try and punch the ball clear joleon lescott leaps in behind pablo zabaleta but sends the ball over joe hart 's goal following a rare west brom attack berahino somehow hit the crossbar with this header , with joe hart nowhere near it â i think our fans believe we can do it , â said manuel pellegrini
