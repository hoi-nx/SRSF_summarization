footage showing murderer jodi arias pleading for her life in a secret testimony has been released , in which she says she regrets stabbing her boyfriend to death , and calls her attempts to cover it up ' revolting '
arias spoke before jurors in phoenix , arizona , last year - but only after demanding that journalists and film crews be barred from the court
she escaped the death penalty after jurors failed to reach a verdict in a sentencing retrial last week - because one member of the jury held out against executing her as punishment for killing jodi arias in 2008
arias , shown above on different days of the testimony , spoke on condition of media not being allowed to film - but a legal challenge forced the court to hand over records the footage , recorded in october and november of last year , was only released after media organizations challenged the decision to allow the secret testimony , and asked for full records
authorities at the maricopa county superior court have now released video footage of arias , in which she is questioned by defense attorneys
the questioning began with arias openly admitting the murder - but saying she did not admit her guilt to anybody until 2010 because she was so shocked at herself
when asked why she did not confess immediately , she said : ' because what i did was so horrific that i could n't have - i could never have imagined myself doing that to another human being
' alexander , 30 , was found dead in a shower in his phoenix - area home in 2008
together : the secret testimony included questions about arias ' time with alexander , whom she repeatedly stabbed , then shot she was then asked for her reaction to hearing of the grief of alexander 's family - and said that it made her wish she could undo the killing , which she claims was an act of self - defense
she also admitted lying to a detective , whom she called of her own volition , about the murder
' i was lost - i think of what just those lies put so many people through , and i just wish i could - there are a lot of things i wish i could do over again , but that is just one of them
