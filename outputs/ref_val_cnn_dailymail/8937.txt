louis van gaal admitted on tuesday that it may take big - money summer signing angel di maria one year to adapt to life at manchester united
the former real madrid midfielder has suffered a severe slump in form after a bright start to life at old trafford and was even hooked at half - time by the manchester united boss against sunderland last week
sportsmail 's man in real madrid pete jenson , who kept a close eye on di maria during his four - year spell in the spain capital , assures manchester united fans the Â£ 60million man will come good
angel di maria was substituted against sunderland after a poor performance in the opening 45 minutes louis van gaal claimed it may take record signing di maria a full year to adapt to english football when it comes to putting his medals on the table angel di maria has the silverware to silence the critics
di maria has had a difficult season after making a fast start to life at old trafford following his move the midfielder had a particularly bad afternoon against sunderland last week before being hooked it should be remembered that his glorious last campaign also came with a mid-season glitch
ancelotti stuck with di maria during a slump and he eventually helped them win champions league di maria played a starring role during the champions league final against atletico last season di maria celebrated with the champions league before he moved to manchester united last summer it is that willingness and versatility that first attracted mourinho and he made him one of his first signings at real madrid for Â£ 20m from benfica
di maria played in the first pep guardiola v mourinho clasico in november 2010 and was as culpable as any of his team - mates as real madrid went down 5 - 0 in one of the worst humiliations of the portuguese manager 's career
di maria made an exciting start to his career at old trafford , pictured here celebrating a goal against qpr the midfiedler also scored against everton and all three of his league goals were scored by early october mourinho âs judgement is rarely off and the same can be said for ancelotti 's
a first - season dip after a brilliant start is also nothing new for a player in his first season in the premier league
mesut ozil suffered the same at arsenal after his high - profile move from real madrid and di maria has more excuses than most to have dropped his performances levels
di maria played a key role for argentina as they reached the final of the world cup in brazil last summer the former real madrid midfielder starred for argentina in a 4 - 2 win against germany in september he played 52 of real madrid âs 60 games last season and then played a big part in argentina âs world cup campaign
he might have foreseen a more relaxing season this time but he had to move his family to manchester from real madrid in the summer and has the added stress of a further temporary move into a hotel after the recent attempted burglary at his cheshire home
being hooked at half - time against sunderland does not look good on di maria âs resume but alongside his olympic gold medal ( scoring the winner in the final ) his champions league medal and the glowing references from mourinho and ancelotti , there is more than enough to remind everyone that while his current form is off , his class will eventually shine through .
