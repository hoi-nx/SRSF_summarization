saudis and allied warplanes struck rebels in yemen on thursday , with saudis threatening to send ground troops and inserting itself into its southern neighbor 's civil war , potentially opening up a broader sectarian conflict in the middle east
the swift and sudden action involved 100 saudis jets , 30 from the uae , 15 each from kuwait and bahrain , 10 from qatar , and a handful from jordan , morocco and sudan , plus naval help from pakistan and egypt , according to a saudis adviser
what do those countries have in common ? they 're all predominantly sunni muslim -- in contrast to the houthi rebels , shiite who have taken over yemen 's capital of sanaa and on wednesday captured parts of its second - largest city , aden
the saudis consider the houthi proxies for the shiite government of iran and fear another shiite - dominated state in the region
" what they do not want is an iran - run state on their southern border , " cnn military analyst lt. col. rick francona said of the saudis
the airstrikes did not include warplanes from the united states , which has worked with yemen governments -- including that of recently deposed but still battling president hadi -- to go after al qaeda
how did yemen get to this place ? houthi supreme leader abdul malik al-houthi spoke live thursday night in yemen on al-masirah tv , saying , " if any army try to invade our country , we will prove that yemen will be a grave for those who invade us
afkham , a spokeswoman for the country 's foreign ministry , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to yemen 's monthslong internal strife
" this is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , " afkham said , according to a report in iran 's state - run islamic republic news agency
the houthi are a minority group that has emerged as the most powerful player in yemen
in addition to airstrikes , the saudis adviser said 150,000 troops could take part in an operation in yemen
just a day in , the coalition airstrikes are already costing the houthi
while sanaa was a focus -- airstrikes destroyed the houthi ' combat and control operations there , the saudis adviser said -- it was n't the only place struck
by thursday afternoon , the saudis controlled yemen airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter yemen ports
specifically , the strikes aim to support hadi , who was ousted in january after talks with the houthi faltered , but still claims to be yemen 's rightful leader
" we are determined to protect the legitimate government of yemen , " said jubeir , the saudis ambassador to the united states , in announcing the beginning of the military campaign
" why is saudis bombing yemen ? jubeir told cnn 's " the situation room with wolf blitzer " that saudis was concerned that the houthi had control over yemen 's armed forces ballistic missiles and air force , and the fact that iran backs the houthi was troubling
" this is really a war to defend the legitimate government of yemen and protect the yemen people from takeover by a radical militant group aligned with iran and hezbollah , " he said
" but at least one major player in yemen besides the houthi -- the general people 's congress , which is the party of longtime leader ali abdullah saleh -- thinks the saudis and their partners should stay out
meanwhile , some 3,000 to 5,000 troops from the saudis - led coalition are expected to reach aden , the yemen city that was hadi 's last known location , in the next three days , according to the officials
