some 1,200 of the reagan 's crew will be executing what the navy calls a three - hull swap , serving aboard three different carriers in one tour of duty as the service juggles assets to meet mission requirements
the 1,200 are calling themselves " the three presidents crew , " as they will serve aboard three of the navy 's carriers named after presidents : the reagan , the uss washington and the roosevelt
" i am honored that my art will be a part of the legacy of this ' three presidents ' crew , and i hope that it will bring attention to the hard work of all the sailors who are involved in this crew swap , " he said
the washington will go from its home port in japan to san diego , where a crew swap with the reagan will take place
while the washington crew takes the reagan to replace the washington in japan , the three presidents crew will board the washington , which will be headed for norfolk , virginia , and an overhaul
the 1,200 will sail with the washington around south america , then they will fly back to san diego to crew the roosevelt , which is taking the reagan 's current spot there
" think of how difficult a three - hull carrier swap would be to carry out , " capt. chris bolt , the commander of the reagan , said in the ship 's publication , the 76er
as one commenter on the reagan 's facebook page said , maybe next time , the navy could add a fourth carrier to the hull swap and come up with ... the uss mount rushmore
