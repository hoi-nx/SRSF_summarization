a man whose girlfriend ran off with his stepfather and gave birth to a baby nearly four years ago has spoken of his delight after dna tests proved the baby is actually his
love rat stan , 47 , and rachel , 18 at the time , set up home together and rachel then gave birth to a baby daughter , whom stan believed was his
but recent bombshell dna tests showed that the baby , living in chorley , lancashire , actually belongs to her former partner , and stan 's former stepson , ashley mercer , 27
ashley mercer ( left , pictured in 2010 ) was heartbroken when his girlfriend rachel began an affair with his stepfather stan ( both pictured right )
rachel had a baby shortly after moving in with stan and recent dna tests have proved that the child is in fact ashley 's stan , 47 , with the baby daughter he believed was his until recent dna tests proved otherwise the affair between stan and rachel shattered ashley and his mother , mandy , who has astonishingly now forgiven stan for the affair
' i have forgiven stan
' both men were left reeling from results of dna tests which show that ashley - and not stan - is the father of rachel 's daughter
ashley says : ' i feel very bitter towards stan
' i 'm buzzing to find out i am the baby 's dad - and stan is n't
' love rat stan with ashley 's mother mandy rourke , 47 , whom he was married to for ten years ashley mercer was in a relationship with rachel 's sister kelly before he met rachel , and the pair have a son , pictured , now seven kelly delaney , rachel 's sister , with her son with ashley ashley has five children with five different women - including a son with rachel 's sister kelly
ashley was single for just three months before he moved on from kelly to her half - sister , rachel , in 2010
rachel , then 16 , began working at the family firm : a lancashire tattoo parlour
ashley says : ' rachel was very similar to her sister , but she was naughty
' rachel soon became part of the family and ashley 's mother , mandy , grew fond of her
but ashley began to suspect an affair between rachel and his stepfather stan , confiding in mandy , who at first dismissed the idea as outrageous
rachel and stan when they first got together : their relationship fizzled out 18 months later and dna tests have now proved that ashley is the baby 's biological father stan and rachel set up home together , and rachel then gave birth to a baby daughter , whom stan believed was his ashley says : ' i saw them in the car together , play fighting , but then they were getting too cosy
stan and my mum had been married for ten years and i called him dad
' horrified by her son 's claims , mandy turned detective and began checking the mobile phone belonging to the tattoo parlour - which rachel took home with her each night
' she confronted rachel and found intimate text messages between her and stan
horrified , she threw stan out and ashley finished with rachel
mandy says : ' at first she said it was ashley 's baby , then she said it was stan 's
' rachel eventually announced that the baby , born in march 2011 , was stan 's , and the couple set up home together
mandy ( pictured with younger son josh , now 19 ) turned detective and began checking the mobile phone belonging to the tattoo parlour , which she ran with stan mandy ( left ) says : ' i spoke to stan and he became very defensive and shifty and i knew , instantly , there was something going on ' ; right : rachel pictured in 2010 but rachel and stan 's relationship fizzled out 18 months later and dna tests have now proved that ashley is the baby 's biological father
perhaps most surprising of all , stan and mandy are friends again , though she vows she will never forgive rachel
' rachel says : ' i wanted the baby to be stan 's
