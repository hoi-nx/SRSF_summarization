saucy : the athena poster that led to the apology it 's the cheeky poster that adorned the bedroom walls of countless teenage boys in the 1970s and 1980s
whether athena 's tennis girl is a suitable adornment for the genteel surrounds of the wimbledon lawn tennis museum is another matter entirely
following a volley of criticism and cries of sexism on social media , the all england club was forced to apologise for using the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition
earlier yesterday they had tweeted a photograph of the dress worn by the blonde model and her racket , alongside the famous image , to promote its powerful posters exhibition , due to open tomorrow
' roger federer fans who call themselves ' fed 's angels ' on twitter , posted : ' come on wimble ! i thought you were the classy slam ! ' the offending image was swiftly deleted from the official twitter account and a new post went up which said : ' we apologise for offence caused by the athena tennis girl poster
' the all england club used the iconic poster to promote a forthcoming exhibition however , a twitter user responded with the comment : ' the poster does n't show the history of tennis , the girl is n't a tennis player , you are just publicising sexualisation of females
he added : ' we 're aware that the poster has generated debate on social media and we decided to respond to some of the comments raised since we want to be clear that it is not a reflection of how we view women in tennis
' use of the saucy shot on the official twitter page immediately raised eyebrows on twitter last night tennis fans were questioning whether the poster , one of the world 's best - selling , really is that controversial after all
