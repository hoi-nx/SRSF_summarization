in some ways , america 's president pilots our ship of state as a captain pilots a jumbo jet , and this analogy suggests one possible way to avoid a repeat of the germanwings massacre : give the plane 's flight crew certain powers akin to those given to america 's cabinet in the rare and terrifying situation when the president and vice president are at swords ' point
this is why airlines across the world hardened cockpit doors after 9/11 and why america of all stripes are outraged by stories that the secret service on several occasions has failed to maintain proper security at the white house
hence the need for a vice president at the ready , able to take over at a moment 's notice
in case of sudden death , the vice president or co-pilot simply takes over immediately
in case of a temporary disability -- say , a scheduled surgery under general anesthesia -- the president can hand over control to the vice president and then take back control when the disability ends
it is exactly what happened when president bush underwent planned colonoscopies in 2002 and 2007
on both occasions , bush handed the tiller to his trusted co-pilot , dick cheney , and then resumed control when ready , under rules clearly laid out by the u.s. constitution 's 25th amendment -- an amendment drafted and ratified after the shocking assassination of president john f. kennedy
but what happens if a president is unable to predict his own future disability , or unable to recognize a genuine disability when it arises ? the 25th 25th amendment allows the vice president to take over control in this situation , but to do so , the vice president needs the support of a majority of cabinet officers -- officials previously appointed by the president himself and thus unlikely to support any inappropriate vice presidential power grab
( some airlines get around the problem with a rule that a flight attendant must replace a pilot so that there will always be at least two people in the cockpit
) but suppose instead that airlines were to borrow sensibly a page from america 's u.s. constitution
but the need for an override is also obvious
