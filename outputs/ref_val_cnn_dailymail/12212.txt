the terrorists who attacked the bardo museum in tunis , tunisia , last week were wearing suicide vests but failed to detonate them before being gunned down by police , tunisia 's president told cnn
" they had them , but they did n't work , because the police turned up and they were shot down and they did n't have the time to get these vests to work
because had they done so , we would have had major catastrophe , " president essebsi told cnn 's amanpour
essebsi told amanpour 15 arrests had been made since wednesday 's attack , in which 23 people were killed
essebsi said he believed the attackers were members of isis who had been trained in libya
this echoed comments made by tunisia 's security minister rafik chelly on friday , who said two attackers had been given weapons training at libya camps and had been activated from sleeper cells
