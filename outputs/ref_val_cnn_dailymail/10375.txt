cameron today compared himself to action hero tom cruise in his mission to overhaul britain 's relationship with europe
it came after donald tusk , the polish president of the european council which represents eu leaders , said rewriting the eu treaties to curb migration would be ' close to mission impossible ' for mr cameron
but the pm told a press conference in brussels : ' tom cruise normally prevails in the end
' cameron , pictured in brussels today , has compared himself to action hero tom cruise in his bid to overhaul britain 's relationship with europe mr cameron urged voters to the election as an ' opportunity to make sure the problems that bedevil britain 's relationship with the eu are dealt with ' , he said
i want to sit at that negotiating table with a mandate from the united kingdom people to reform the eu and fundamentally change britain 's relationship with it
' mr cameron said there were other eu leaders ' who will breathe a sigh of relief ' if he is not re-elected
the prime minister 's remarks came after mr donald tusk said he was ' ready to help cameron ' â but dismissed his chances of negotiating a new europe treaty within the next two years before holding an eu referendum
the former polish prime minister said it would be hard to find agreement among all 27 eu leaders that would satisfy mr cameron
but mr donald tusk added : ' i am sceptical when it comes to changing the treaty
' donald tusk , the polish president of the european council which represents eu leaders , greeted mr cameron today after claiming that his bid to rewrite the eu treaties to curb migration would be ' close to mission impossible ' mr cameron wants a new brussels treaty to nail down a series of changes allowing britain to limit benefits for eu migrants
the pm has insisted that new rules are needed to help the crisis - hit eurozone , giving britain the chance to renegotiate its relationship with brussels
but mr donald tusk said : ' my intuition is that treaty change is close to mission impossible today because it 's not only about rationality , about good argument
' mr donald tusk said : ' first of all we need more precise concrete [ details ] about united kingdom demands
it 's not only about the arguments of cameron
' but he said : ' we need , also for the united kingdom , a good solution for cameron and britain under existing law , ' he said
