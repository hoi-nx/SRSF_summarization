the ' frog menu ' signature dish will feature a deep fried amphibian , sandwiched between a black bun burger , complete with legs dangling out the side
guests will be able to see 25 live different poisonous animals from around the world at yokohama , in south toyko , before heading to the cafe to devour a frog of their own
thankfully the frog is less toxic than its exhibition counterparts , and the black bun can be attributed to a bamboo charcoal dye
orbi yokohama is not the first place to use the dark bun , with burger king in japan launching a range in 2014
other poisonous animals at the exhibition include spiders , stingrays , puffer fish and other animals
