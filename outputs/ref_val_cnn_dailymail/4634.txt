david will be one of the ' awkward squad ' asking searching questions if he is elected as britain 's fifa vice-president , fa chairman greg dyke has claimed
gill , the former manchester united chief executive , is standing against wales ' trefor lloyd hughes for the position , which is being elected by uefa 's 54 members at its congress in vienna on tuesday
greg dyke , who has made clear his opposition to fifa president sepp blatter continuing in the position , said gill would act as a counter-balance to the ' acolytes ' on fifa 's executive committee
the fa chairman said : ' david will be the sort of person who will do the job as a fifa executive committee member properly
david , pictured with sir alex ferguson in 2011 , is running for britain 's fifa vice-president ' there is a feeling that there have been too many acolytes and not enough people asking difficult questions and ensuring that decisions are taken in a transparent , ethical and business - like manner
' michel platini ( uefa president ) was very keen for david to stand for the position and to represent uefa on the fifa executive committee
' fa chairman greg dyke claimed that gill would not be afraid of asking appropriate questions the football association of wales has claimed its english counterparts have reneged on a deal agreed in 2011 which would see a welsh nominee replace northern ireland 's jim boyce as fifa vice-president
gill said the agreement became void after fifa reforms , which saw the britain fifa vice-presidency elected by all uefa members instead of just the four home nations
