a barcelona firm has designed a biodegradable urn that is planted in the ground and can be used to grow ash , oak , beech or gingko trees
the environmentally - friendly vessel contains the seed of a tree in the top half that germinates before the roots grow through the section containing the ashes in the lower half
it said it wanted to create something that changed the way people saw death , instead of it being ' the end of life ' it would become a ' return to life ' the bios urn have been developed by barcelona - based moline and his brother roger at design studio estudimoline
relatives or pet owners begin by choosing what kind of tree they want , and seeds currently available include pine , gingko , maple , oak , ash and beech
the ashes are placed inside the urn and the seed is mixed with soil in the top capsule
the urn is then buried in the ground and starts to biodegrade when the roots are strong enough to come into contact with the ashes
