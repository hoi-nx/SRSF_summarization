despite the fact it 's illegal in the british , at least 65,000 british girls are at risk of having female genital mutilation as they are taken out of the country during so called ' cutting season ' aka the school holidays
many of the girls are too scared to admit they have suffered fgm and can be stigmatised by their community for speaking out
' another british survivor interviewed for the documentary said : ' i do n't think there 's any word i can use to describe that moment
' the practice first began in ancient egypt and remains a rite of passage in many africa and middle eastern countries and some parts of asia
the idea that fgm is necessary and makes a woman more virtuous and attractive is so ingrained in some communities that mothers who have endured it themselves - and continue to live with the physical and mental consequences - will still happily arrange for their daughters to suffer the same fate
nimco ali was subjected to fgm as a child and said many british girls are at risk leyla explains : ' the cutting season in the british means holidays
' the anonymous victim added : ' it 's a business for the person doing the cutting and the family as once the child has been through fgm , whoever they will marry will pay a higher dowry , it 's all about money
' actress zawe , who presents the bbc documentary , flew to kenya to meet one of the women making money as a result of cutting thousands of girls who are taken to her from around the world
despite suffering the pain of fgm herself as a child , the elderly cutter said she 's happy to cut others - using a pair of sharp scissors she carries around in her handbag
' she added why her community believe fgm to be so important : ' if the girls are n't cut , they will start to love and start to chase men , they should be cut before they are 12 otherwise they will start to get horny
after she was cut , she was sewn back up with and left with a hole no bigger than matchstick that has left her with a host of health problems - and infertile
' actress zawe , right , travelled to kenya for a bbc documentary to meet agnes pareyio , left , the founder of comic relief funded project which helps girls escape fgm hoda 's stomach pains where due to the fact she could n't have a normal period because of the tiny hole she had been left with
' she added that many people may be surprised to learn she 's a victim of fgm because of her western appearance but she said many british girls like her are at risk
we describe ourselves as the " fgm " survivors
nimco ali , 31 , who lives in east london , campaigns against fgm after having it done to herself as a child , agreed that the practice is more rife in the british than people realise
zawe with some of the children who are being helped by the comic relief supported project in kenya ' they are the girl at the back of your classroom or the girl you could bump into on oxford street but you do n't know they have just been through fgm
in an east london school , fgm workshops are held to educate young men and women on why it 's wrong , while border police operate at airports to try and stop girls they deem to be at risk leaving the country
at least 60p from each Â£ 1 nose goes to help transform the lives of some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people in the british and across africa
sainsbury âs is the official retailer of red noses and red nose day merchandise zawe sees that change is also happening in kenya where it has also been made illegal and where education is helping to empower girls and break the cycle of fgm
comic relief is supporting their fight against fgm as well as those working to end it in the british
