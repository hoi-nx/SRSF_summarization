he has already made abolishing the obamacare the centerpiece of his young presidential campaign , and once spoke for 21 hours straight on the floor of the senate in a bid to block its funding
but now cruz says he and his family will be the latest to use the system , signing up for medical insurance coverage through the obamacare law 's government - run marketplaces
cruz 's wife heidi has taken an unpaid leave of absence from her job at goldman sachs to campaign with him â and lost her employer - funded plan in the process
as democrats gleefully mocked the irony , though , cruz insists he 's just following the law
obamascare : cruz announced his presidential run on monday , the same day his wife took a leave of absence from her job â forgoing the family 's medical insurance pediatrics on line one : the cruz daughters , catherine ( left ) and caroline ( right ) need a health plan and for now the obamacare system will have to do â while their father works to ' rip it out , root and branch ' transition : heidi cruz left her goldman sachs ' cadillac plan ' behind when she took a leave of absence to campaign for her husband ' we will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care and we 're in the process of transitioning over to do that , ' cruz , a gop senator from texas , told the des moines register on tuesday
the exchanges , created by the obamacare law , are designed to be state - specific insurance marketplaces where the uninsured can find coverage
the obamacare originally left members of congress alone , but iowa grassley senator grassley famously inserted a ' poison pill ' amendment requiring them â and their staff members â to participate like other american if they lacked insurance from other sources
democrats did n't budge , and the provision now requires cruz to join millions who have signed up for obamacare - brokered coverage
it has defended the obamacare law , largely because it forces insurers to provide contraception coverage
' we encourage others to follow presidential candidate cruz to www.healthcare.gov and get covered
glee : the democratic national committee piled on , but never called cruz a hypocrite the ' h ' word : abortion lobby planned parenthood heaped on the scorn at cruz 's predicament the washington city government extends congressional offices a sweetheart deal that 's not part of the obamacare itself , allowing federal lawmakers and their aides to enroll through the city 's small business health options program
' ' it 's one of the real differences â if you look at president obama and the lawlessness , if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change , ' cruz said
but cruz still believes the obamacare law should be killed â ' ripped out , root and branch ' is how he put it during an iowa event in january
