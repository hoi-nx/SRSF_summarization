world championship boxing âs return to mainstream terrestrial television could hardly have been more dynamic than frampton âs five - round demolition of chris avalos on another wild saturday night of the jackal in belfast
frampton lands a powerful right hand on his way to stopping chris avalos in the fifth round frampton was joined by fellow world champion quigg ( right ) in the ring as they build towards a fight both quigg and frampton are confident they will finally meet in a super-bantamweight unification clash frampton and his folk - hero svengali mcguigan are willing to help make that happen by modifying their financial demands for a fight brought closer to fruition by quigg âs watchful presence in the aptly named odyssey arena
frampton is on a journey to potential greatness and his message to his rival from bury as they posed for photographs in the ring was this : â do nât be greedy and we can share an audience of millions
â mcguigan , whose own world championship exploits printed the road - map for his protegee âs rise to the ibf super-bantamweight title , understands the long - term benefits of the exposure which galvanised viewers on the britain mainland and around the world as frampton put on a performance against avalos which smacked of greatness in the making
mcguigan said : â although i believe frampton will beat him , quigg is also a very good fighter and a nice lad
â we are prepared to be reasonable to make this happen and i hope quigg and his promoter eddie hearn will see the long - term value of doing that rather than us taking this fight to pay - per - view
â mcguigan regards that as desirable : â it âs time for the quigg fight and it âs time for frampton to go on show to the rest of britain and then american

when chris avalos tried to turn it into a gutter brawl all he succeeded in doing was giving frampton the opportunity to demonstrate how he has added punishing close - quarter in - fighting ability to his impressive repertoire
the belfast boy has accepted that crowd - appeal has to be a factor in his ascent to stardom , saying : â i took some stick for one fight in which i thought i boxed really well to win virtually every round with hardly being hit
