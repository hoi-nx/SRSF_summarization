looking at someone who is overweight or obese can alter our sense of smell to make the scent of the world around us appear less pleasant , scientists have found
researchers discovered viewing images of fat people caused participants in a study to rate odour samples as smelling worse - even though they were actually fragrance free
the scientists believe the effect may be caused by inbuilt negative bias that many people have towards those who are overweight and obese
does looking at this image of an obese man on a bench conjure up a foul odour ? you may have an inbuilt prejudice if it does , according to a new study by scientists at the university of california , los angeles surprisingly they also found that those who had a higher bmi themselves tended to give the scent samples a lower rating
this suggests that people who have their own weight problems are perhaps also the harshest critics of others who are fat
now scientists believe they have discovered a way to â melt â the excess white fat in muffin tops by turning it â brown â
dr ayako tomiyama , an assistant professor of psychology at the university of california , los angeles , said : ' you would nât think that not liking someone âs weight could then be seen in a totally different sensory modality
' the researchers conducted two studies by showing participants two sets of images of people who were either overweight or normal weight
the researchers , whose work is published in the international journal of obesity , found that when images of overweight or obese people were displayed on the screen , participants gave worse ratings to the scent samples
writing in the journal , the researchers , who are also presenting their results at this week 's american psychosomatic society , said : ' the results showed that the substances were perceived to smell worse when they were paired with images of heavy individuals than when they were paired with images of thin individuals
the researchers say that subconscious disgust at obesity may be manifesting itself in people 's sense of smell ' the effect was most strongly manifested by participants with higher bmis ' the researchers claim the results could be a subconscious signal of disgust
stigma in society against fat people can be a barrier to them changing their lifestyle , according to scientists rodriguez said that while some people are overtly biased against people who are overweight , others may not be aware that they harbour negative feelings
