â but there was more than a little sense that ian ritchie was playing to his audience at twickenham
and not only because the rfu âs affable chief executive quoted hamlet when describing the â slings and arrows of outrageous fortune â he experienced watching the engrossing six nations denouement
his public pronouncements were designed to strike a chord with those still uncomfortable with the six - year contracts served to england âs coaches last year

no fewer than 11 players were ruled out of their opening win over wales in cardiff and first - choice stars manu tuilagi , joe launchbury , ben morgan and owen farrell were absent for the duration
