' the failure to detect a fracture on an x-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in a&e , ' says kelly , an orthopaedic trauma surgeon shirley johnstone had mixed feelings when the a&e doctor said the x-ray of her elbow showed no sign of a fracture
but i was in agony â i could nât move or straighten my arm , and felt i needed more than just paracetamol and a few days off work , â recalls shirley johnstone , 60 , a chef from great wakering in essex
â six days after she was seen at a&e , shirley johnstone received a phone call from the hospital
doctors had reviewed the x-ray and there was a fracture after all , in the olecranon , the protruding bone that forms the tip of the elbow
it was a mistake that , four years on , is still affecting shirley johnstone âs life
but a year after the operation she developed a painful infection because fluid had built up around the fracture
â shirley johnstone has never had a proper explanation for the delay in spotting the fracture
â one doctor told me , â i âm afraid sometimes these things get missed â , â she says
but research suggests that thousands of patients walk out of a&e with doctors having failed to spot their fracture
â numerous studies have shown that failure to detect a fracture on an x-ray is the most common diagnostic error made in a&e , â says kelly , consultant orthopaedic trauma surgeon at north bristol nhs trust
â you can identify a major fracture of a large long bone across the room , â says mr kelly
â about half the 20 million or so visits to a&e involve having an x-ray , mostly to check for bone injury a study published in the british medical journal in 2002 showed that junior doctors in a&e miss up to 39 per cent of â clinically significant abnormalities â on x-rays
this is why many , but not all , hospitals have introduced a safety net : all x-rays should be reviewed by a specialist â either a radiologist ( a clinician specialising in interpreting scan images ) or a specially trained radiographer , whose main job is taking x-rays
a study at north tyneside general found that people whose fractures were reviewed only by an a&e doctor were ten times more likely to be wrongly given the all - clear
and patients whose x-rays were checked by a specialist before they left a&e were three times less likely to have a missed fracture , according to a 2013 study by the university of bradford school of health studies
however , there is currently no time - based target for specialist reviews , which can be postponed for weeks
a recent audit of missed fractures and abnormalities at one london hospital revealed that , at worst , it took 48 days before x-rays were reviewed
meanwhile , a survey of a quarter of nhs radiology departments last year revealed it had taken more than 30 days before over 80,000 x-rays were reviewed by a radiologist
â this suggests that nationally about 300,000 patients are waiting more than a month for their x-rays to be analysed , â says dr giles maskell , president of the royal college of radiologists
certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed in x-rays certain types of fractures are more susceptible to being missed
like shirley johnstone , jacqui hunt suffered after a fracture was missed in a&e
â two months later , when the cast was removed , a further x-ray showed a second fracture â she had also broken the ulna bone ( which enables the wrist to rotate ) , but it had been missed
