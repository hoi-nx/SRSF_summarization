in these fantastic images you can see mars and its moons , an amazing nebula and even the surface of a mysterious world covered in water
or can you ? these might look like pictures of space at first , but they âre actually just shots of glasses of water and food in a photocopier
the amazing photography trick was performed by 34 - year - old freelance photographer navid baraty from new york
new york photographer navid baraty has created fictional images of space using ingredients found in the kitchen
in the images he used common kitchen ingredients to make the cosmic images
- glass containing water and food colouring - salt , cinnamon , baking powder - cat fur , cumin , tumeric - coffee , corn starch , butter he told mailonline that the images were made by placing objects on an epson photo scanner and then doing a scan with the lid open
and mr navid baraty says he intends to continue take the photos , so people can keep following the fictional progress of the wander probe â i thought it would be fun and exciting to frame the project around the idea of this imaginary spacecraft roaming around the universe taking photos of its encounters , â he said
the moons are silica gel and food colouring , while the stars are made of sugar , cinnamon and cumin this supercluster is made of flour , sugar , salt , olive oil , cumin , turmeric , cinnamon , curry , garlic powder and water â i had a whole story going for a while of how i was selected to be the lead image processor for the wander mission since i 'm a photographer but have a degree in engineering and that this was a real spacecraft out there taking images
â a lot of people actually thought it was reall ! eventually i decided to tell people how i really make the images and that wander is entirely fictional
â he added : â i 'd like people to look at these images and think could my fictional creation of a planet or moon or galaxy actually exist somewhere in our universe or possibly even beyond ? â i 'd like for the imaginary explorations of wander to inspire others about the cosmos and actual space exploration
