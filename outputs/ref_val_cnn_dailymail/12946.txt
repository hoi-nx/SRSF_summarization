i think back to 56 years ago : what if ? if my father had not been brave and hungry for a better future in american , there would be one fewer public administrator , one fewer third grade teacher and one fewer student in medical school in my family
had so many young people not given their youth , their energy , their strength and their love for this country , the american we know would not exist
i owe the american i know to my father and the many men that toiled long ago in the fields of our past
i owe my success to my father herminio , mother juanita and countless others that dreamed of a better tomorrow
as a teenager , my father left his life of poverty in mexico for the promise of a new life in the american in 1959
the hard , physical work of picking crops in the fields of california , arizona and texas , earned him less than a dollar a day , once room and board was subtracted
the braceros program granted him a work visa and when he finished the program , he began his path to citizenship
in that era in mexico , you had to pay for school past a certain grade and my father 's family could n't afford it
unlike my father , i was n't born into a life destined for backbreaking labor
the sky was truly the limit and for the first time in his life , my father had hope -- for us
our upbringing was humble , but my parents provided for all 12 of us children
my father created paradise in a modest , two - bedroom home in the inner city of san antonio , texas
i was the first in my family to get a college degree -- i 'm the seventh out of 12 children
i work to remove those barriers so that every one of my students has a chance at a life like the one that was given to me by my parents
i am now responsible for helping many young children reach their potential and live a life our ancestors could only dream of
