and it 's a theory that persists today , with many people believing that a full moon is more likely to coincide with hectic periods in hospitals or in birth wards
but dr jean-luc margot , a professor of planetary astronomy at the university of california , has carried out a study that proves that the concept is essentially rubbish
dr jean-luc margot said that when life is hectic on the day of a full moon , many people remember the association because it confirms their belief - but they do not remember when nothing in particular happens on such a day his research was carried out to illustrate how intelligent and otherwise reasonable people develop strong beliefs that are not aligned with reality
' the absence of a lunar influence on human affairs has been demonstrated in the areas of automobile accidents , hospital admissions , surgery outcomes , cancer survival rates , menstruation , births , birth complications , depression , violent behaviour , and even criminal activity ' , dr jean-luc margot writes
' the moon is innocent , ' dr jean-luc margot said
dr jean-luc margot cited what scientists refer to as the ' confirmation bias ' - people 's tendency to interpret information in a way that confirms their beliefs and ignore data that contradict them
' some nurses ascribe the apparent chaos to the moon , but dozens of studies show that the belief is unfounded , ' said dr jean-luc margot , a ucla professor of planetary astronomy dr jean-luc margot said the societal costs of flawed beliefs can be enormous
' vaccines are widely and correctly regarded as one of the greatest public health achievements , yet vaccine - preventable diseases are killing people because of beliefs that are out of step with scientific facts , ' dr jean-luc margot said
' perhaps we can start by correcting our delusions about the moon , and work from there , ' dr jean-luc margot added
