one of those is ethanol -- with corn often a key ingredient
" do n't mess with the rfs , " gov. terry branstad said saturday , offering a not so subtle warning as he kicked off a daylong agriculture summit that featured a string of likely gop presidential candidates
the rfs is a major issue that white house hopefuls are forced to address whenever they visit the no. 1 corn - producing state that also goes first in the presidential nominating calendar
