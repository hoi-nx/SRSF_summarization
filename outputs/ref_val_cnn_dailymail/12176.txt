three and a half decades after calling for homosexuals to be stoned , former bju president bob jones iii has apologized
" i take personal ownership of this inflammatory rhetoric , " bob jones iii said
" the weekend apology came days after the conservative christian school in south carolina received a petition asking for an apology for a statement bob jones iii made to the associated press in 1980 at the white house
" i 'm sure this will be greatly misquoted , " bob jones iii said at the time
" when he made the comments , bob jones iii was part of a group of fundamentalist ministers who went to the white house with 70,000 signatures on a petition opposed to extending provisions of the civil rights act to homosexuals
the petition by bjunity , a group that bills itself as a network " for lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer , questioning , intersex and straight affirming people affected by fundamentalist christianity , " garnered more than 1,900 signatures
