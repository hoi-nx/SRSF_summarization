new figures show childhood obesity rates double while children are at primary school , with one in five leaving primary school obese one in 10 children are obese when they start primary school at the age of four , shocking new figures have revealed
and in the space of five years , childhood obesity rates double , with one in five children leaving primary school obese
experts today warned that not enough is being done in schools to tackle the childhood obesity epidemic , urging the government to increase compulsory physical activity levels
the new figures , published today by the hscic , show 9.5 per cent of reception class children , aged four to five , were obese in 2013 - 14
in year 6 , the proportion of 10 to 11 - year - olds who were obese was 19.1 per cent in 2013 - 14 , up from 18.9 per cent the previous year , and also a rise from 17.5 per cent in 2006 - 07
he told mailonline : ' the huge doubling between children aged four and 11 is particularly disastrous
' mr fry warned by the time children reach 11 it is ' recognised they have more or less made up their minds about their lifestyle '
' those 11 - year - olds are probably going to end up as obese adults , ' he said
' it means every year there will be more and more obese adults adding to these statistics
' he said in scotland the nhs has been forced to re-evaluate its obesity forecast figures , predicting that 50 per cent of the nation will be obese by 2030 - 20 years earlier than previously estimated
mr fry , who is also chair of the child growth foundation , told mailonline the blame for spiralling primary school obesity rates , in part , lies with a failed education programme
' he rejected the tendency of politicians to lay blame solely at the door of parents , noting the period where child obesity rates rise is when they are in primary school - and so spending the majority of their time away from home
and he warned an added concern is not knowing how children are spending their pocket money at corner shops and on their way home
experts say the exercise programme in schools ' is n't working ' and today called for the government to introduce more pe lessons into the curriculum ( file picture posed by models ) ' if only schools were to have proper physical activity , these numbers would reduce significantly ' mr fry said
the pe and sport survey , conducted in 2009 - 10 , found 55 per cent of pupils in years one to 13 participated in at least three hours of high - quality pe and out - of - hours school sport each week
for the first time in 2011 , the chief medical officers in the uk published guidelines for children under the age of five
' obese children are more likely to experience bullying , low self - esteem , anxiety , depression and have a higher risk of becoming obese adults and developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease as a result
