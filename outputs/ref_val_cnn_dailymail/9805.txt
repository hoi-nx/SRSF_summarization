bacteria growing on particles of magnetic crystal may form natural rechargeable batteries , according to new research
scientists at the university of tã¼bingen in germany have found that colonies of two types of bacteria can grow on a mineral called magnetite
they found one species of bacteria could dump electrons onto the crystals while another harvested the electrons from them depending on the amount of sunlight they received
scientists have found that colonies of two types of bacteria can grow on a mineral called magnetite
one species of bacteria dumped electrons while another harvested from them depending on levels of sunlight the scientists said that in the wild this may allow the magnetite crystals to act like natural rechargeable batteries for the bacteria
dr byrne , who led the work at the university of tã¼bingen , said bacteria could be genetically engineered to increase this activity
' in our study we only looked at iron metabolising bacteria , but we speculate that it might be possible for other non-iron metabolising organisms to use magnetite as a battery as well - or if they can be made to use it , through genetic engineering , ' he said
' could engineering the bacteria increase the energy production or is it limited by the magnetite itself ? ' the magnetite itself will only hold a maximum number of electrons , which is one of the limiting factors
rhodopseudomonas palustris removed electrons from the magnetite , causing the charge to fall while geobacter sulfurreducens added electrons to increase charge on the mineral during the night these were grown on nano - sized crystals of magnetite - an iron oxide based mineral found in rock formations that was used to make lodestones
they found that during the ' day time ' rhodopseudomonas palustris bacteria harvested electrons from the magnetite , reducing its electric charge
during the night , the geobacter took over and dumped electrons back onto the magnetite crystals , recharging it
the researchers grew the bacteria on nano - sized magnetic particles of magnetite ( left ) , which can be seen gathering on the inside of the bottle beside the magnet on the right in a solution of purple bacteria dr byrne said the findings suggest a way in which bacteria could survive in extreme environments deep under ground
' the flow of electrons is critical to the existence of all life and the fact that magnetite can be considered to be redox active opens up the possibility of bacteria being able to exist or survive in environments where other redox active compounds are in short supply in comparison to magnetite
this diagram shows the conditions that the scientists believe leads to the bacteria ( marked in pink ) adding or removing electrons to the magnetite ( the black circle ) according to water levels and sunlight available these are generally found on seabeds and river beds , using energy in its purest form to power the reactions inside their cells
these bacteria , however , appear to harvest energy directly from the electrons freed as they grow on the surface of iron minerals
most living species use a complex cascade of biochemical reactions to release the energy they need from their food but the studied bacteria appear to harvest energy directly from the electrons as they grow professor andreas kappler , another of the authors of the study and secretary of the european association of geochemistry , said : ' this may have some interesting geochemical applications
