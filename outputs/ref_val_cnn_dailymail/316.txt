but senior business leaders warned the plan would encourage employers not to take on staff
it is the latest in a string of damaging clashes between labour and business leaders â who have lined up to predict that miliband is a potential ' catastrophe ' for the country

' the labour policy would mirror the situation in economically feeble france , where companies with more than 50 employees have extra obligations , such as the establishment of a workers ' council
charlie bradshaw , managing director of matrix apa , a product design company with 60 staff , said : ' forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees , just as france seeks to repeal similar laws , will threaten jobs ' simon walker , of the institute of directors , said : ' we can not believe that the labour leader will take such an obviously counterproductive measure seriously
' employee profit sharing can work well for companies who choose it , but it has to be up to them
