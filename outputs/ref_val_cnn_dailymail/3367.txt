she made a rape allegation to metropolitan police in january 2013 against wealthy financier , alexander economou , 35 , claiming the incident had happened just before christmas 2012

the cps took over the case but decided against using its powers to throw it out , leaving her frightened and devastated
the inquest into her death was originally opened in november last year , but was adjourned so the director of public prosecutions alison saunders could personally investigate the cps 's decision to prosecute
she had accused alexander economou ( right ) of raping her but the allegations were dropped due to lack of evidence ' in view of the importance of this case and its tragic consequences , we need to make sure that existing guidelines and practices were adhered to and that any shortcomings in these guidelines and practices are identified and remedied so that no other vulnerable young women and their families have to suffer as we and de freitas did
' lawyers for the family said they are hoping the inquest will explore the impact the case had on miss de freitas taking her own life and the wider public interest of prosecuting rape complainants for perverting the course of justice
the inquest into her death will resume tomorrow deborah coles , co-director of support charity inquest , said : ' this case raises important issues of public importance regarding the treatment of rape complainants
but wanting to clear his name , mr alexander economou used his own money to launch a private prosecution against miss de freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police
