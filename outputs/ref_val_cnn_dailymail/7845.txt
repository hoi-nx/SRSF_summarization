killer co-pilot lubitz was living â on the edge â because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot âs licence , the mail on sunday can reveal
investigators believe his eyesight problems â coupled with a breakdown in his relationship with his long - term girlfriend â triggered the â madness â that ended in mass murder
lubitz , 27 , masked his true condition â described by police as â severe burnout syndrome â â from his employers and was aided by germany confidentiality laws which forbade his doctors from revealing just how mentally ill he really was
it is understood he once planned to marry pretty blonde teacher kathrin goldbach , 26 , but she called time on his increasingly erratic and controlling behaviour which made her fearful for her own safety during his rages
one friend said : â he tried to order her what to wear , what men she could speak to , even the length of her skirts
he was a control freak of the highest order
â another friend added : â she said he was very kind and attentive , but that he had problems with mood swings
â the break , according to friends , came just weeks ago
she still lived with him but it is understood she was on the lookout for a bachelor - girl flat
frantic that he would lose her , lubitz splashed out thousands of pounds buying two audi cars

â yesterday , it was revealed by police that lubitz suffered from a â severe psychosomatic sickness â that required the care of several neurologists and psychologists
desperate : frantic that he would lose her , lubitz splashed out thousands of pounds buying two audi cars they particularly want to know if his blurred vision was a contributing factor to his catastrophic psychological collapse which led him to pilot his a320 airbus into a french mountainside , killing himself and 149 innocent passengers and crew
the disintegration of his eyesight , according to investigators , fuelled his chronic anxiety that his flying career â the career he lived for since he was a teenager â was coming to an end
as the jigsaw puzzle of his complex and disturbed personality was reconstructed by investigators , the agony of his murder - suicide mission struck at the heart of his home town of montabaur , for ever changed because of the actions of a jekyll and hyde figure whose warped personality made him lead two lives
recovery : rescue helicopters continued to search the french alps today for further signs of wreckage on the surface , he projected stability , confidence and calm : the cool pilot who turned up at his grandparents â home wearing his crisp germanwings uniform
but his insecurity demanded constant attention â which led him to betray kathrin goldbach with a five - month fling with a germanwings stewardess conducted in cheap hotels where they stayed while working
