ferguson city manager ferguson resigned tuesday in the wake of a scathing department of justice report
the report blames ferguson , missouri , police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets african americans residents
" and while i certainly respect the work that the department of justice recently performed in their investigation and report on the city of ferguson , i must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target african americans , nor falsify charges to administer fines , nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor
along with other officials , ferguson was heavily criticized by the department of justice report , which found that authorities in ferguson frequently saw residents as " sources of revenue
the department of justice 's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager michael brown , who was shot by ferguson police officer darren wilson in august
darren wilson , who was not indicted on any charges , has resigned from the police department
but when ferguson resident schmidt defended darren wilson at tuesday 's city council meeting , she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd
" i 'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe darren wilson an apology , " schmidt said , prompting laughter by some in the audience
