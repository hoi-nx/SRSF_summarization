do i welcome the news that next is about to overtake m&s ? sales at next grew 7.2 per cent last year , to Â£ 4 billion , while it âs predicted that clothing sales at m&s will have drooped like so many m&s gypsy skirts when figures are announced later this week
i loved next , the brainchild of george davies , when it launched in 1982
it gave us the revolutionary next in 1988 , a classy precursor to online shopping , and of course in 1998 pioneered selling fashion online , becoming the largest â etailer â in europe
but it has always thought on its flatform - shod feet , while m&s seems to lumber , and is offering quality , yes , but at prices women now habituated to cheap fashion baulk at
( remember the recent Â£ 345 all - wool winter coat ? ) after comparing the two giants â ranges here , i think it âs time belinda earl âs style director belinda earl went five days a week from her current three , do nât you ? the smart outfit for a wedding ... or for work next : foil pleated skirt ; Â£ 45 blush formal jacket , Â£ 34 this accordion pleated midi skirt is a couple of years too late , but i love it , and i love , too , the soft pink jacket
m&s : m&s collection double breasted crãªpe drape coat , Â£ 65 ; cut - out rear panelled skater dress , Â£ 45 a trench may seem strange for a smart wedding , but it could work with a hot coloured dress poking out below
the ' casual gypsy ' look casual gypsy : next steals the win by a whisker with an ochre crochet trim top ( left ) over m&s 's fringed kimono next : ochre crochet trim top , Â£ 28 ; flared jeans , Â£ 20 the jeans are almost identical to m&s âs , but crucially cheaper
the summer dresses summer dresses : m&s 's per una lace shift dress ( right ) wins hands down over next 's sack - like printed folk dress ( left ) next : paisley print folk dress , Â£ 30 a little bit sack - like , but i can see this with a tan and gladiator sandals being worn on holiday by the young and leggy
m&s : per una lace shift dress , Â£ 75 this dress is lovely : a very current , sub-erdem print , a scalloped hem that softens the knee area , and a bit of a sleeve , which is what women told m&s âs style director belinda earl they want â plus it âs easily smart enough for a wedding
the suede persuasion suede persuasion : m&s win by a country mile with the autograph suede skirt ( right ) while next 's effort ( left ) completely missed the boat on the trend next : suedette tassel jacket , Â£ 55 dark denim flared jeans , Â£ 20 next completely missed the boat on this trend : all they have in suede is this jacket with tassels , just Â£ 55 as it âs faux
suede and leather always do well for m&s and this will shoot off the rails : it âs not mumsy , and feels luxurious
and the winner is ... m&s , by a country mile : real skin at next would be prohibitively expensive , so in a way it âs great they do nât even try
the funkiest of the accessories funky accessories : next takes the win by a nose with accessories including a fringe rucksack and flatforms ( left ) over m&s 's faux leather cross body bag and sling backs ( right ) next : denim flatforms , Â£ 35 ; suede fringed rucksack , Â£ 62 ( flared jeans , Â£ 28 ; blush utility jacket , Â£ 55 ) much funkier than m&s , next has done lots of small , neat saddle bags , too , which were all over the catwalk
