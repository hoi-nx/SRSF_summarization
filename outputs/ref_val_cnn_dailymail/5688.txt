and something surprisingly blue , in the hue of northern ireland âs jerseys
thankfully for scotland , there was no off - colour outcome
let âs just say that no - one who sat through this 90 minutes will be feverishly petitioning for the return of the home internationals
ritchie made his first appearance for scotland against northern ireland on wednesday night not that there were nât points of interest prior to christophe berra âs late winner
a debut for ritchie was the headline act
ritchie âs admission that he had never actually set foot north of the border caught the attention when he was called up last week
yet there was also no mistaking the pride felt by the hampshire - born bournemouth winger , who qualifies for scotland through his father alex - originally from edinburgh
the 25 - year - old has been an integral part of his club âs highly promising bid for promotion to the land of milk and honey that is the barclays premier league
he already has an assist to his name after plonking the match - winning corner onto christophe berra âs head
ritchie operates on the right but is almost all left foot
it was tailor - made for shaun maloney , hardly noted for his aerial prowess , but his header back across came to nothing
bournemouth winger ritchie qualified for scotland through his father alex the former swindon man has 11 goals for bournemouth this season and offered a glimpse of that direct threat just after the hour mark
while the hamilton goalkeeper was just about the busiest man in michael o â neill â s line - up , the polar opposite was true for gordon
he had played the second half of the 3 - 1 friendly defeat from england at celtic park to earn a 41st cap , but this was his first start for the national side in more than four years
for long enough , it had seemed that 3 - 0 win over faroe islands at pittodrie in november 2010 might just have marked the end of his scotland career
yet he openly admits the dream of returning to a scotland shirt provided another level of motivation on the long road back to fitness
christophe berra gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for scotland to grab them , he will have to hold off the sizeable challenge presented by marshall and mcgregor by continuing to impress
in his 45 - minute outing , gordon was so under - deployed he could have scribbled out autographs to the supporters sitting behind his goal
the most excitement he got was a brief sprint out of his area to intercept a long through - ball and feed a pass to craig forsyth
like scotland as whole , he simply got the job done .
