as if he did nât already know , schmidt found out the hard way last saturday that 80 minutes can be a long time in rugby
ireland were riding the crest of a wave arriving into cardiff
ten successive wins and the grand slam there for the taking
they led the table with a huge points difference and , after england fell short of eclipsing that target in rome , there were no outside complications weighing on ireland âs mind in that evening âs tournament closer : beat french and the title was theirs
jared ( left ) , iain henderson ( centre ) and jordi murphy warm - up during ireland training on thursday ireland flanker sean o'brien fires out a backhand pass during ireland 's session at their base in carton house jonathan sexton ( centre ) and his fellow irish players are gearing up for their crunch clash against scotland twelve months later they are in an awkward bind â second on points difference with no exact clarity on what type of win is needed to retain their title given that england will be last into action tomorrow
adding to ireland âs anxiety is their inability to get over the try line
whereas 16 were scored in the title run in 2014 run , there have been just four in 320 minutes this term
schmidt , though , claims not to be worried about the drought , adding that a level of tolerance must be shown towards the development of his new midfield combination now that brian oâdriscoll has retired and gordon dâarcy has been omitted for the six nations
â the game is very fickle , â he claimed after announcing a team to play scotland showing two changes from wales with luke fitzgerald and cian healy getting in ahead of simon zebo and jack mcgrath
ireland coach joe schmit will put his friendship with scotland boss vern cotter to one side on saturday â one of the frustrations from last week is that we did create three really clear try - scoring opportunities that we did nât convert
â trying to make sure we get on the right side of those margins all the time is difficult and it is something we âre working really hard on , â claimed the attack coach whose specialist role in preparing the team is now under scrutiny as ireland âs meagre try tally is the joint worst in the tournament , level with french and seven tries fewer than top scorers england
schmidt and vern cotter ( above ) worked together with clermont in french and in new zealand with bay of plenty â we do have a little inexperience at 12 but i do nât think you could fault robbie âs form right through the championship and he will grow into that first - receiver role when it âs demanded of him a little bit more as he gains experience
â schmidt , who revealed training on tuesday was as flat as it had ever been but was fresh on thursday , insists that guaranteeing victory in scotland â not focusing on the margin of a potential win â has been his approach , so much so that he admits he is nât much inclined to pass much heed of how wales fare in rome prior to saturday âs 2.30pm start ( wales need a +22 win to have bettered ireland âs points difference )
