engineers are working on the bloodhound - the supersonic car that 's faster than a speeding bullet which is hoped to break the land speed record
bloodhound is being put together at its design centre in avonmouth , bristol as part of a private venture although it has substantial in - kind support from the uk government and is being used as a education resource with the hope that it will encourage more pupils to follow science and technology - related courses
a jet engine is moved underneath a body panel of the bloodhound vehicle currently taking shape at its design centre in avonmouth on march 5 kayleigh williams from the royal electrical and mechanical engineers and build technician rupert byrce-morris put the cockpit glass cover in place as they work on the bloodhound the uk - made vehicle , which is powered by a eurofighter jet engine and a rocket , is being built as the fastest car in the world to beat the 763mph ( 1228km/h ) current record which was set by thrust supersonic car on 15 october 1997 a mock up of what the completed supercar will finally look like goes on display in a uk street to the amusement of passersby and a police officer the car has a slender body of approximately 13.4m length with two front wheels within the body and two rear wheels mounted externally within wheel fairings it weighs 7.5 tonnes and the engines produce more than 135,000 horsepower - more than 6 times the power of all the formula 1 cars on a starting grid put together engineers work on the carbon - fibre body of the bloodhound vehicle , which is powered by a massive eurofighter jet engine and a rocket it is hoped that when finished , the bloodhound car , which is powered by a eurofighter jet engine and a rocket , will break the current land speed record of 763mph or 1228km/h the huge ej200 jet engine ( pictured ) is so powerful it would be able to suck all the air out of an average sized house in three seconds engineers work on the wiring loom in the rear end of the bloodhound vehicle which is a private venture although it has substantial in - kind support from the uk government the supersonic vehicle is also being used as a education resource with the hope that it will encourage more pupils to follow science and technology - related courses the project team consists of some of the world âs most revered engineering talent , led by project director richard noble and the car will be driven by andy green work continues on electrical components for the bloodhound a private venture led by project director richard noble with support from the government engineers work on a body panel of the bloodhound vehicle currently taking shape at its design centre in avonmouth in bristol engineers are working on the bloodhound - the supersonic car that 's faster than a speeding bullet which is hoped to break the land speed record the car is a mix of car and aircraft technology , with the front half being a carbon fibre monocoque like a racing car and the back half being a metallic framework and panels like an aircraft the bloodhound will travel 150 metres in the blink of an eye and could cover the distance of four and a half football pitches in one second kayleigh williams from the royal electrical and mechanical engineers and build technician rupert byrce-morris put the cockpit glass cover in place as they work on the bloodhound royal airforce engineers work on a tail fin of the bloodhound vehicle , which is powered by a eurofighter jet engine and a rockets the vehicle 's tail fin takes shape under the watchful eye of a team of royal airforce engineers who are hoping to create the world 's fastest car the bloodhound is so powerful that if it was fired into the air , the rocket and engine would blast the car to an altitude of 25,000ft royal airforce engineers work on a tail fin of the supersonic vehicle which is faster than a bullet fired from a magnum and can cover the length of four and a half football pitches in one second an engineer work on a body panel of the bloodhound vehicle which will be able to go from 0 to 1,000mph in 55 seconds during the record attempt , where the team will try to break the current land speed record of 763mph or 1228km/h , the rocket will reach a blistering 3,000 degrees - twice the temperature of inside a volcano the incredible bloodhound car , which is powered by a eurofighter jet engine and a rocket , is being built to be the fastest car in the world
once complete , the car will be able to travel from 0m to 1000m in just 55 seconds and can travel faster than a bullet fired from a magnum 357
