the doomed mh370 was taken on an emotional â last farewell â fly - past of the pilot âs home island of penang before being deliberately landed on the water and sinking intact thousands of miles away , according to a britain pilot who claims to have identified its final resting place
the unusual overflying of penang is â perhaps the only clue to the perpetrator â he says
the theory of hardy , a senior boeing 777 captain with a major commercial airline , has gained support from one of britain âs top flight safety specialists , learmount of the respected flight international magazine and flightglobal website
he has concluded that the search in the vast indian ocean being conducted by the australian transport safety bureau ( australian transport safety bureau ) is about 100 nautical miles away from the where the aircraft actually is
he also believes the riddle of the aircraft âs odd dog - leg flight path immediately after take - off from kuala lumpar is down to the aircraft performing a final â fly - past â of malaysia âs penang island to allow someone to have â a last emotional look
â captain hardy notes from his research that the captain of the lost boeing 777 777 - 200 , shah , came from penang , while first officer mh370 was from selangor
captain hardy says that after taking off from kuala lumpur at 16.41 gmt on march 7 last year , flight mh370 lost contact with air traffic control at a point over the china sea where four flight information regions intersect
captain hardy said the flight did something â quite remarkable â by flying in and out of the airspace of malaysia and thailand eight times noting : â i âve never seen anything like that but it is a good way to cause confusion between the controllers
australian investigators said they had been in touch with captain hardy and described his theory as â credible
â flight magazine âs mr learmount said : â since capt hardy revealed in flightglobal / flight international his calculations about where mh370 is likely to have come to rest , the australian transport safety bureau â leading the mh370 search team â has spoken at length to him
