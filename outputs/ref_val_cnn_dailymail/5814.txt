kris boyd has insisted that even jose mourinho himself would have struggled to change rangers â fortunes if he were in charge at ibrox
after their dismal 1 - 1 draw at home to livingston on saturday , the govan club languish in third position in the championship table â 24 points behind runaway leaders hearts â and face an uphill task if they are to secure promotion via the end - of - season play - offs
however , kris boyd believes that with the club now on its third manager of a farcical season , the time has come for all those on the playing staff to give themselves a brutal reality check â before they end up costing yet another man his job
manager stuart mccall puts rangers , third in the championship , through their paces in training kris boyd said it would not matter if chelsea manager jose mourinho ( pictured ) was in charge at ibrox â we âre now on our third manager and it gets to the stage where you have to ask questions of the players , â said kris boyd , ahead of rangers â league meeting with alloa on tuesday night at ibrox
â it does nât matter if you were to go and bring in jose mourinho â he would still have the same players to deal with
and i âm willing to bet the majority - if not all the players - would say the same thing
kris boyd in action for rangers in their 1 - 1 draw with livingston on saturday â we have a period now until the end of the season where everyone on the playing staff needs to get a grip
â after admitting recently that his second spell at ibrox had been a failure on a personal level , with only three league goals to his name , kris boyd has certainly not tried to shy away from the grim reality surrounding the club
