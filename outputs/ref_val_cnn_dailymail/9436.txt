businessman van vuuren , 87 , who had suffered from cancer , warned his sons daniel , 60 , and marius , 55 , that unless they quit the habit they would not get a penny from him
' two sons have been disinherited for not giving up smoking when their father told them to do so in his will the two contested the will , saying that their father , from pretoria , south africa , had only written it as a warning , but had then died suddenly , leaving it the only signed will in his possession
at the high court in pretoria , daniel said he and his brother spoke about this prior to their father 's death , but they laughed about it as they thought it was funny he said : ' the truth is my father did admonish me on many occasions during his life that he would disinherit me if i did not stop smoking
however , it was ruled by judge pretorius to be mr van vuuren 's true will
van vuuren 's secretary signed it as a witness , as required by law
