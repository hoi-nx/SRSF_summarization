lily was n't moving when rescuers found her , hanging upside down in her mother 's smashed car
it had flipped over into a frigid utah river half a day before , and the baby was still strapped in her seat
as officer jared warner dashed with the 18 - month - old in his arms to an ambulance , she was barely alive
right now she 's watching ' dora ( the explorer ) ' and singing ' ( the ) wheels on the bus ' with grandpa
she is smiling and laughing for family members
we 're blown away by lily 's progress and so grateful to her rescuers , " they said
lily 's mother , groesbeck , died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the spanish fork river
lily might have died unseen with her mother , had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot saturday
the angler waded into the river around noon , then noticed the car wheels - up in the water
" where the car was , you could n't see it from the roadway , " police lt. slaymaker said
" she was definitely unconscious and not responsive , " jared warner said
she was still strapped into her seat , where she may have been for 14 hours , if the wreck occurred when police believe it did
the angler came along around 12:30 p.m. on saturday , 14 hours later
groesbeck 's death is tragic , but the survival of baby lily is a story filled with hope
but just how did the baby survive the ordeal ? above all , said cnn senior medical correspondent elizabeth cohen , the biggest factor was the car seat
lily was in the proper car seat and the seat appears to have been properly attached , elizabeth cohen said
another factor may have been that the girl , as a toddler , has baby fat
lily apparently survived for 14 hours in extreme cold , without food or drink
" the four of us heard a distinct voice coming from the car , " jared warner told cnn
the child was unconscious , but her eyelids were fluttering , and the rescuers knew she was alive , jared warner said
" the river is 10 feet deep in some places , police said , but the car hit a shallower spot
lily was not submerged , said police lt. matt johnson
then jared warner took lily into his arms
a tow truck hauled groesbeck 's car out of the river , and it will be inspected for possible mechanical failures
groesbeck 's family has set up a gofundme page for donations to help with medical expenses for lily , and funeral costs for her mother
