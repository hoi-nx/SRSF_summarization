the intact iron age organ was discovered inside a decapitated skull in york seven years ago and since then experts have conducted tests to explain how the tissue could have stood the test of time
tests have revealed that the brain and other remains are 2,600 years old and have survived because the head was buried in a sealed clay pit devoid of oxygen , soon after its owner âs death
the intact organ ( pictured ) was discovered inside a decapitated skull in york seven years ago and since then experts have conducted tests to explain how the tissue could survive in 2009 , archaeologists from york archaeological trust uncovered a skull with the jaw and two vertebrae still attached to it , in heslington , york
at first , archaeologists thought they had found a normal skull and it was not until the bones were cleaned that they came across ' something loose ' inside
â an archaeologist at the university of bradford confirmed the tissue was brain and experts from york hospital âs mortuary they were able to remove the top of the skull in order to reveal the astonishingly well - preserved human brain
here , dr o'conner examines the remains experts ca n't be certain but think that the delicate brain tissue survived the ravages of time because of a mixture of a sealed clay pit and fats and proteins linking together
while over time , the skin , hair and flesh of the skull rotted away , the fats and proteins of the brain tissue linked together to form a mass of large complex molecules
they have now carbon dated the jaw bone to confirm the man probably lived in the 6th century bc. an examination of the teeth and skull revealed he was between 26 and 45 years old when he died
it appears that he was first hit hard on the neck , which was then severed with a small sharp knife , according to marks on the vertebrae , but experts can only guess why the man died such a violent death
this x-ray shows the position of the shrunken brain inside the skull speaking two years ago , sonia o'connor , research fellow in archaeological sciences at the university of bradford , said : ' the hydrated state of the brain ( pictured ) and the lack of evidence for putrefaction suggests that burial , in the fine - grained , anoxic sediments of the pit , occurred very rapidly after death ' ' this is a distinctive and unusual sequence of events , and could be taken as an explanation for the exceptional brain preservation
experts believe the head was cut from the man âs body almost immediately after he was killed and buried in a pit dug in wet clay - rich ground
in 2009 , archaeologists from york archaeological trust uncovered the skull with the jaw and two vertebrae still attached to it , in heslington , york , ( marked on this map ) the skull was found face - down in a pit without any evidence of what had happened to the rest of the body
this image shows archaeologists sifting through the muddy pit at the site near the university of york where the brain was found while over time , the skin , hair and flesh of the skull rotted away , the fats and proteins of the brain tissue linked together to form a mass of large complex molecules
' this is the most thorough investigation ever undertaken of a brain found in a buried skeleton and has allowed us to begin to really understand why a brain can survive thousands of years after all the other soft tissues have decayed
