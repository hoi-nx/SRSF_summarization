the hormone , dubbed mots - c , has been proven to work in mice and clinical trials on humans could begin in three years the discovery of mots - c - a molecule that acts as a signal for the body - was made by scientists at the university of southern california
mots - c works by increasing insulin sensitivity , allowing the body to more effectively process glucose sugars , researchers claim
the hormone mainly targets muscle tissue , where it restores insulin sensitivity , counteracting diet - induced and age - dependent insulin resistance
but researchers say its real benefits are in tackling age - related diseases , such as diabetes ' this represents a major advance in the identification of new treatments for age - related diseases such as diabetes , ' said pinchas cohen , a researcher at the university of southern california

the mots - c intellectual property has been licensed to a biotechnology company , and clinical trials in humans could begin within the next three years , researchers said .
