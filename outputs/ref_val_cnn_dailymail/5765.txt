ahead of super saturday , sportsmail 's sir clive woodward rates the three contenders for the 2015 six nations title ... england why they can win it i âm increasingly encouraged by their intent to attack and the willingness to keep the ball moving
despite missing chances against scotland , for the first time in a while our strike runners consistently found clean air to run in
george ford has brought confidence to this backline and it helps having two of his bath team - mates starting alongside him
most importantly , i believe england will win because they need to
bath fly half george ford has brought confidence to the england backline this season england and wasps flanker james haskell runs with the ball during training at pennyhill park on thursday lancaster has been in charge of england for four seasons but has yet to secure a six nations title they have the points advantage , they are playing last and they are also the only contender playing at home
i expect england to play well
why they might blow it i still rate the england pack very highly , though they need a bit more pace in the back row and the recycling of possession must be quicker
geoff parling coming in is the right call , but i am amazed there is no specialist second row on the bench
if there âs an injury early on , can we expect nick easter to play most of the game there against france ? that could cost england
england forwards coach rowntree oversees a ' live ' scrummaging session between his two packs there have been many examples recently where england have made the wrong decision which has cost them points and the opportunity to build a score
england will have to be ready for a colossal physical encounter
who would you pay to watch ? jonathan joseph
he has been a massive find and even if they take nothing else away from the championship they appear to have found an outside centre with world - class potential
i still believe that they need a better footballer at no 12 â and not picking henry slade has been a missed opportunity â but in jonathan joseph they have a player they can build a team around
jonathan joseph has been electric in his year 's tournament and has the potential to become world class video robshaw sets sights on france following scotland win the coach âs strengths ? england operate more as a team of coaches , headed by lancaster â compared with wales and ireland where gatland and schmidt are very much dominant figures
there are few coaches around who have achieved this , as lancaster has with england
wingers anthony watson ( left ) and jack nowell run through some evasion and footwork drills ireland why they can win it between jonathan sexton , conor murray and paul they have the best game management side
they are also playing scotland , even if the hosts do play better in edinburgh
and if the game is dead for scotland with 20 minutes to go , will they mind hugely if it is the irish not the english who win the tournament ? ireland fly half jonathan sexton ( centre ) gives instructions to his team - mates in cardiff last saturday why they might blow it while i do nât think ireland will be concerned heading to murrayfield , they need to score at least three tries
this would leave england having to win by 15 against france
paul o'connell rises high to claim a lineout against the welsh at the millenium stadium in round four the coach âs strengths ? ireland have been unfairly criticised for their tactics
wales why they can win it they are hitting form at the right time and the way wales have bounced back from the defeat by england has been truly impressive
they have the most to do in terms of points difference , but it would be fascinating if they could do what england did last year and put 50 points on italy
wales have the potential to score five or six tries if they get going
gatland brings the best out of shaun edwards , his defence coach , and the effort against ireland was world - class
prediction ireland will win by a few , wales will win by a lot and england will be in a very tight game so it could come down to just one or two points
