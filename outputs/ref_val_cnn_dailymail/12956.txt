norman , oklahoma trinidad james is n't mad at beauton gilbow
the rapper 's hit song can be heard playing in the background as beauton gilbow , the house mother of the university of oklahoma sae house -- known as mom b. -- repeats the n - word seven times on camera
it appears overboard considering that the hook of the song , " all gold everything , " uses the word only three times per succession
beauton gilbow has been bombarded with claims that she 's just as racist as the fraternity members caught singing a racist song on a bus last weekend
it 's an allegation she 's firmly denied , and the atlanta rapper who wrote " all gold everything " is willing to give her a pass , though he would n't condone her use of the word
" the trinidad - born rapper , whose real name is trinidad james , said he does n't like giving interviews about race and the n - word because his views are complex and hip - hop stars can be hypocrites when it comes to the topics
" every ( hip - hop ) artist is using the n - word in their music -- hit records with the n - word in it
if we do n't want the word used and the word holds such a negative connotation , then we should n't use it at all , period
" he has a different take on the fraternity members caught clapping , pumping their fists and chanting , " there will never be a ni * * * * sae
you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me
" sae no stranger to scandal " i do n't respect that at all
" as fellow atlanta rapper waka flocka flame noted when he canceled an upcoming show for the university of oklahoma saes , trinidad james said people of all races attend his concerts and have a great time together
and i 've done a show actually at university of oklahoma last year , " he said
" as far as the chances that he 'd ever perform in front of university of oklahoma 's sae chapter in the future , forget about it , he said
he does n't care if they were resurrected as an all - black fraternity , he said
and while it 's disturbing to see young people voicing racist leanings , trinidad james said he 'd prefer to know where someone stands over being misled
do n't talk to me
if you feel that way about me that you would want to hang me from a tree then do n't talk to me
