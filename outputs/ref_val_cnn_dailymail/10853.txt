en famille : sarah and her children in france breathless , but with an unmistakeable swagger , our three children burst through the door of our mobile home and regale us with their latest news
we are halfway through a week - long break at les castels holiday park in domaine de la paille basse , near souillac , in the lot region , and it is the fourth time our children have completed this morning ritual
les castels fits our bill completely : pool , play - park , shop , takeaway , english - speaking kids ' club , games room , nightly entertainment
accommodation is a mixture of tents , touring pitches and mobile homes
we opt for a three - bedroom mobile home perched on a small hill surrounded by woodland , with an unbroken view of the valley below
lunch is another lazy affair on the terrace with more fresh bread from the shop , cheeses , meat and fruits from the stadium - sized leclerc supermarket at souillac , before an afternoon of hurtling down pool slides and playing tennis
our children would say the eight - mile journey aboard the steam train at martel , which handily includes an ice - cream stop and costs a family - friendly Â£ 7.50 ) for adults and Â£ 4 per child
a mobile home at domaine de la paille basse ( 0033 2 23 16 45 02 , camping - castels.co.uk ) costs from Â£ 4.60 per person per night .
