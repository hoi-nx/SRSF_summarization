might sound extreme , but breast cancer experts say she was spot on
brawley said if he were jolie 's doctor he would have advised her to do what she did because her mother , aunt , and grandmother all had ovarian cancer , and her mother had breast cancer as well
plus , jolie has a gene that gives her about an 87 % chance of getting breast cancer sometime in her life
" she has one of the particularly bad breast cancer genes , " brawley said
the decision is made even easier by advances in breast reconstruction and by hormone treatments that help ease women into menopause , which is induced by removing the ovaries
instead of screening , experts in cancer genetics recommend that women at a very high risk for ovarian cancer , like jolie , remove their ovaries as soon as they 're done having children
brawley added that jolie 's decision likely would n't be right for someone with a different kind of breast cancer gene mutation
for example , some women have a mutation that gives them a 15 % chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime
that 's not much higher than the 12 % chance a woman has of getting breast cancer even if she has no mutation at all
he says he worries that some of these women with just a slightly increased risk will hear about jolie 's decision and want to remove their breasts , too
