a dying father known as ' napkin dad ' for his daily heartfelt notes to his daughter , has celebrated seeing her achieve another milestone : making her high school varsity softball team
garth , 45 , from glen allen , virginia , has been writing short messages on napkins for his daughter dear emma , 15 , since she was in kindergarten - and now she looks forward to them every day
this week the doting father - of - one - who has stage four kidney cancer - uploaded a snapshot to facebook revealing his latest note , reading : ' dear emma , i 'm so proud that you made the varsity softball team
' my goal is to actually write notes for my grandkids and i ca n't think of a better thing to fight for every single day
' the note - writing has long been a tradition in the garth household ; it began when garth worked a busy sales job in dear emma 's elementary school days and would n't see her often
battling on : garth says doctors do not know how long he has to live but he 's determined to remain strong source of support : dear emma says that she also maintains a positive attitude when it comes to her father 's illness long - running : the note - writing has long been a tradition in the garth household thoughtful gesture : it began when garth worked a busy sales job in dear emma 's elementary school days and would n't see her often daily dose : so that she always knew her father was thinking of her , garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts , stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box still going strong : but over the years , the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days , and by the time she was about eight , dear emma had come to expect the memos so that she always knew her father was thinking of her , garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts , stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box
' lunchtime treat : he pops the notes in with her lunch , which he tries to make as nutritious as he can determined : after learning he had cancer , garth sought to write 800 notes so that his daughter would have one every day throughout high school - even if he was no longer alive to put it in her lunch box but in 2011 , garth was diagnosed with cancer and his desire to write the notes became even stronger because , ' at the end of the day , these notes might be the only thing my daughter has left of me '
the cancer patient is now writing notes ahead of time and storing them away so his daughter can still receive them after he is gone
