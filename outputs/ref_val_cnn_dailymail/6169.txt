however , scientists have now proposed that some worlds might be able to host life â not as we know it â that thrives not on water , but on other chemicals
specifically , they looked at titan , which has seas of liquid methane rather than water , and they it could harbour methane - based , oxygen - free forms of life
cornell university scientists in new york have proposed a new type of life
called an azotosome , it would survive on liquid methane rather than water - so it could live on titan
shown is an illustration of a nine - nanometre azotosome , the size of a virus , with a piece of the membrane cut away to show the hollow interior the fascinating research by scientists at cornell university in new york suggests that life in the universe may be abundant in more places than thought
the life they propose , called an azotosome , would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180 Â° c ( -292 â° f )
â ours is the first concrete blueprint of life not as we know it , â said graduate student james stevenson , first author of the research
the life proposed by the scientists would be composed of small organic nitrogen compounds and be capable of functioning in liquid methane temperatures of -180 Â° c ( -292 â° f )
this means it could survive on the surface of titan ( illustration shown ) , meaning more worlds might be habitable than we thought the theoretical azotosome life form is made from nitrogen , carbon and hydrogen molecules - all of which are known to exist in the cryogenic seas of titan
