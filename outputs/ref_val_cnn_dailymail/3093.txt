pellegrini loftily announces that he has no need to win trophies to keep his job at city
rodgers openly admits that unless he had put liverpool back in the running for honours he would have been sacked
louis van gaal urgently instructs his united players to minimise passes back to their goalkeeper in an attempt to pacify fans who are demanding a return to the attacking style of sir alex
pellegrini claims he does not need to win trophies to hold on to the city reins louis van gaal has told his players not to pass back to keeper david de gea to improve united 's tempo martinez airily falls back on the support of his chairman bill kenwright as evertonian drift , as if rudderless , towards the rapids of the drop zone
get real , senors pellegrini and martinez
right on , mister rodgers and van gaal
complacency has never been a recipe for security in the football management game and you begin to fear for pellegrini and martinez as the season heads towards the home straight
pellegrini âs calm intelligence and fine football principles have won our admiration but he is kidding himself if he truly believes it when he says : â i âm not under any pressure to win titles
they are not so desperate to win
martinez comes across as honest â albeit painfully so at times â as well as a smooth media operator but he may be taking a little too much for granted when he says : â i was always aware of the support i would get from the chairman
â martinez has suffered second season syndrome at evertonian with the evertonian perilously perched rodgers was candid about his chances of survival before liverpool 's remarkable turnaround beware the good old vote of confidence , martinez , and let âs hope you do nât come to re-evaluate something else you âve just said about mr bill kenwright : â bill is a mad evertonian
â fanatical fans are not usually very forgiving of only one win in a run of a dozen games including that tepid defeat at stoke
rodgers and van gaal , meanwhile , are sensibly watching their backs
not long ago i had occasion to chide rodgers in this column for doing too much talking about himself but seemingly not enough work on a liverpool team sliding into crisis
since then he has seen the warning signs and cleverly switched to a positive 3 - 4 - 3 formation which has turned them into the form team of the league and he freely declares now : â i âve learned that if the team is not functioning it does nât matter how much support you have in the boardroom
since losing to united on december 14 , liverpool have won nine and drawn three in the league van gaal is proving himself shrewd enough to know that sometimes not even a run of only two defeats in 21 matches is enough at a club as huge as united
that there are times when we could play at a higher tempo
â united are approaching a potentially season - defining sequence of matches against spurs , liverpool , city and chelsea in the league and arsenal in the fa cup quarter - finals and he promises : â we can improve
