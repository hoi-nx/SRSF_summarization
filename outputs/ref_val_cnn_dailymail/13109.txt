beijing in china , you can often tell what the communist party is thinking by watching tv
for years , the typical on - screen china family looked something like this : glowing parents doting over one precious child
since the early 1980s , the party has enforced a draconian one - child policy on most china to curb population growth
it 's perhaps the most hated policy in china
now , under relaxed restrictions announced just over a year ago , couples like yang and chang zi'an , both professionals working in beijing , are eligible for a second child to join their baby girl -- 11 - month - old tao zi , or little peach
chang was an only child but sometimes wished for a sibling while growing up
they are ideal candidates , it would seem , to have a second child
china faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce
" china has already begun to feel an unfolding crisis in terms of its population change , " says wang , a professor at fudan university and a leading demographic expert on china
" history will look back to see the one - child policy as one of the most glaring policy mistakes that china has made in its modern history
" perhaps surprisingly , wang says that the one - child policy was both ineffective and unnecessary , since china 's fertility rates were already slowing by the 1980s
the china government still maintains that it was necessary to keep numbers down
but with around 150 million one - child families and a shrinking population , the china government is moving cautiously , rather than doing away with the policy altogether
in january 2014 , china said it would allow couples to have a second baby if the mother or father was an only child themselves
nationwide , nearly one million couples have applied to have a second child , state media reported in january
and they want to send little tao zi to a private bilingual english and china pre-school to help her in the ultra-competitive china education system
