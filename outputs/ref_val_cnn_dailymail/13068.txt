a video purportedly shows three british schoolgirls preparing to cross the turkish border last month into syria , where the teens are believed to have traveled to join isis , a turkish tv network reported friday
if authentic , the video would represent the first publicly released images showing the girls at the turkish - syria border
the video , released by turkish tv network haber and distributed by reuters , shows three warmly dressed females who resemble the missing teens standing with luggage outside a car and talking to at least one man who is helping them with the bags
the footage purportedly was recorded february 19 in the southeastern turkish city of gaziantep , just north of aleppo , syria , a haber reported
two days before , london classmates shamima begum , 15 , kadiza sultana , 16 , and amira abase , 15 , boarded a turkish airlines plane from london 's gatwick airport to istanbul without their families ' knowledge , according to british police
the video 's release came a day after turkish 's foreign minister said his country arrested a " spy " who allegedly helped the british girls get into syria
this month , a turkish broadcaster released images that it said showed the british girls boarding a bus in istanbul after they arrived from london
they are thought to have crossed the turkish border into syria within days
a trip to gaziantep would have been long : the border town is more than 525 miles to the southeast of istanbul
days before they left for turkish , at least one of the girls allegedly contacted a young woman , aqsa mahmood , who left her home in scotland to travel to syria in 2013 and is accused of trying to recruit others via social media
