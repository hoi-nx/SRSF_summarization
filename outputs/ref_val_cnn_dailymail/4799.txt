how on earth has wenger escaped criticism for yet another failure in europe ? they won on the night â fine
but they lost to monaco â arguably the worst side to make it through the group stage
aaron ramsey 's goal against monaco was not enough to prevent arsenal going out of the champions league arsenal players look dejected after losing the 3 - 1 at home to the french side in the first leg of the last - 16 tie monaco defender aymen abdennour celebrates his team 's shock victory at the emirates last month arsenal manager wenger appears to have escaped criticism for yet another failure in europe failing to win the group has been wenger 's massive error in recent seasons
and yet again , despite being in a group with two no - hopers â galatasaray and anderlecht , and a borussia dortmund side that spent the first half of the season hovering in and around the relegation zone in the bundesliga â arsenal failed to top their group
i 'm going to keep this simple : arsenal have better players than monaco
so surely an experienced manager , well versed in french football and champions league football , especially familiar with his opponents â a club he once managed â with a squad featuring two arguably world - class players in mesut ozil and alexis sanchez , not even wenger could mess this one up ? wenger failed even with world - class talent like mesut ozil ( pictured ) and alexis sanchez in his arsenal side arsenal boss wenger looks on and sinks into his seat during arsenal 's shock defeat by monaco monaco are effective , but they are a basic side
and yet wenger failed to do this
for the fifth season running arsenal failed to make the quarter - finals of the champions league
last season , mertesacker said arsenal ' gave 10 per cent less mentally ' when they were beaten by napoli to miss out on top spot in the group
the case for wenger 's defence is getting weaker and weaker
per mertesacker admitted arsenal 's mentality was n't right as arsenal failed to reach the quarter - finals sure , three other english clubs failed in the champions league this season
and at liverpool brendan rodgers went into his first ever champions league campaign shorn of luis suarez and the injured daniel sturridge
no wonder we fail when a club as huge as arsenal trusts a proven european failure with its champions league ambitions , and then does nothing when he fails time after time
man city were eliminated from the champions league by barcelona and could now change their boss david luiz celebrates scoring for psg against chelsea while blues boss jose mourinho shows his frustration he 's the only manager to reach three different european finals and lose them all â cup winners ' cup with monaco , uefa cup and champions league with arsenal
wenger 's 17 straight seasons in the champions league are an embarrassment when you consider he has only reached one final , and two semi-finals in that time
if you want proven winners , then wenger 's Â£ 8m - a - year salary will surely tempt the quality of pep guardiola or carlo ancelotti
wenger 's Â£ 8m - a - year salary would surely tempt carlo ancelotti ( left ) and pep guardiola to north london why is it that a juggernaut of a club like arsenal sticks with a manager who regularly fails when it comes to the big moments ? are they content to miss out ? finishing second was n't good enough for thierry henry , remember ? so he left the stinking , sinking ship to go and finish first with barcelona
the failure to win the champions league will always be a huge scabby wart on wenger 's record
he 's guilty of failing in europe with arsenal and making a massive contribution to the diminishing reputation of english clubs in european competition
