legendary fashion designers dolce and dolce are in a public spat with pop music icon elton john over some eyebrow - raising comments the pair made about gay parenting
" elton john , who along with his husband david furnish is raising two children that were conceived through ivf , took to twitter to essentially say " oh no he did n't , " followed by " # boycottdolcegabbana " because nothing expresses anger quite like a hashtag
so what should we make of all this boycott talk ? combined , the three men are worth an estimated $ 3 billion
the openly gay martin , who is raising two boys via a surrogate mother , sided with elton john ( but he 's only worth an estimated $ 60 million , so i 'm not sure if anyone noticed )
but i just ca n't afford to spend $ 500 on a t - shirt
boycott ? besides the 1 % , who the hell is buying dolce regularly enough to actually call the act of not buying their clothing a " boycott " ? that 's a little like me saying i 'm upset with the way james dolan is running the new york knicks so i refuse to play for him
a cotton vest ! ! ) here 's an idea : considering it can cost about $ 20,000 for each attempt at ivf , and the procedure has roughly a 40 % success rate , i would say the vast majority of people who were the direct targets of dolce 's words are not using their expendable cash to buy their clothing anyway
if elton john , martin , courtney love and other ultra-rich celebrities really want to leverage their celebrity to ignite a movement we can buy into ( pun intended ) take that would - be dolce and gabanna money and start an endowment for those who ca n't afford ivf treatments
or consider " modern family 's " jesse tyler ferguson , who tweeted he wanted to unload his dolce and gabanna suits in a way that would help those who ca n't afford the ivf treatments
when you tweet " d&g " -- thus comparing your pr nightmare to the one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in recent europe history -- you do n't .
