but mr taylor only discovered his life savings had almost disappeared when he went to orpington town centre with his daughter and a bank statement showed his savings account now contained just Â£ 8.79
roberts , prosecuting , told the court : â mr taylor and his daughter suspected that it was austin , his grandson , who had taken the money and the reason that was thought was because mr austin took money before
mr taylor only realised his bank account had been almost emptied when he went to orpington town centre to get a statement and found that the savings account contained just Â£ 8.79 - there had been more than Â£ 2,500 ms roberts continued : â mr austin attempted to put pressure on his grandfather by asking him to hand over the money as he knew the bank had provided him with a refund
â i also read that you have stopped access to his grandchildren and you have , since june 2014 , been asking him for money and threatening him with not seeing his great - grandchildren if he refuses , â said the judge
