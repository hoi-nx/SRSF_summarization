what are the chances you will live for another ten years ? while your gp might give you some idea , scientists now say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill
the process involves running in three - minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed and at a growing incline
scroll down to read dailymail.com review of the test ... scientists say you can accurately predict your likelihood of death using a calculator and a treadmill
the process involves running in three - minute segments on a treadmill with an increasing speed runners then plug in their vital statistics into a basic formula to find out how likely they are to die over the next decade
dubbed the fit , the test was created by cardiologists at johns hopkins university in maryland after studying 58,000 stress exams
' but we wanted to quantify that risk precisely by age , gender and fitness level , and do so with an elegantly simple equation that requires no additional fancy testing beyond the standard stress test
' the test consists of three - minute segments that increase in speed and incline
follow the below stages in order to see which mets score you reach
make sure you record your heart rate during each exercise
stage 1 - 1.7 mph / 10 per cent grade / 5 mets stage 2 - 2.5 mph / 12 per cent grade / 7 mets stage 3 - 3.4 mph / 14 per cent grade / 10 mets stage 4 - 4.2 mph / 16 per cent grade / 13 mets stage 5 - 5.0 mph / 18 per cent grade / 15 mets stage 6 - 5.5 mph / 20 per cent grade / 18 mets stage 7 - 5.5 mph / 22 per cent grade / 20 mets then put in your details in to the following formula : ( 12 x mets ) + ( % of maximum predicted heart rate ) â ( 4 x age ) + 43 if female
maximum predicted heart rate is calculated as 220 â age
heart rate achieved during exercise should be divided by maximum predicted
as well as age and gender , the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so - called metabolic equivalents , or mets as well as age and gender , the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so - called metabolic equivalents , or mets
more vigorous activities require higher energy output â or higher mets
an activity such as slow walking equals two mets , compared with eight for running
stage 1 - 1.7 mph / 10 per cent grade / 5 mets easy
stage 2 - 2.5 mph / 12 per cent grade / 7 mets still easy but it reminded me why hate treadmills
stage 3 - 3.4 mph / 14 per cent grade / 10 mets incline jump is considerate and i 'm starting to feel it
stage 4 - 4.2 mph / 16 per cent grade / 13 mets it was all that food and booze at christmas
stage 5 5.0 mph / 18 per cent grade / 15 mets no can do
sean o'hare for dailymail.com the results reveal that among people of the same age and gender , fitness level as measured by mets , and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk
' the fit is easy to calculate and costs nothing beyond the cost of the treadmill test itself , ' says senior study author michael blaha
the results reveal that among people of the same age and gender , fitness level as measured by mets , and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk exercise stress tests usually measure how well the heart and lungs respond to physical exertion while a person is walking on a treadmill at progressively higher speed and elevation
the test is stopped once a person reaches the point of exhaustion or develops chest pain , dizziness or heart rhythm abnormalities
' stress test results are currently interpreted as ' either / or ' but we know that heart disease is a spectrum disorder , ' dr ahmed says
