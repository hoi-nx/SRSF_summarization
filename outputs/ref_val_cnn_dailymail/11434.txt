brook is giving khan 48 hours to commit to a battle of britain at wembley stadium on june 13 , or else he will find another big name to be given the special k treatment this summer
khan says sorry but he will be fighting in american next month , although he will oblige brook in due course
brook âs promoter hearn does not believe khan is scared of his man but said : â khan âs family are not certain he would win the fight and realise that if he were to lose it would be game over for their boy
â brook celebrates after beating jo jo dan during their ibf world welterweight title fight in sheffield there was a whiff of mayweather in the saturday night air in sheffield after brook flexed the vivid scar in his left leg and vexed his six months of anxiety since that machete attack on an inadequate challenger for his ibf world welterweight title
by keeping the british on tenterhooks for another 12 months , brook and khan can crank up the ante way beyond what hearn describes as â the biggest pay - day of their lives
â brook has called out khan for the ' battle of britain ' and gave the boxer 48 hours to commit just so long as neither of them is beaten in the interim
brook knocks down jo jo dan for the first time during the one - sided fight at the motorpoint arena they include mexican legend marquez in front of 40,000 of brook âs neighbours at sheffield united âs brammall lane football ground or tex-mex slugger rios in the manchester arena or london âs 02
the welterweight knocked jo jo dan around the ring like a rag doll and wants a big one against khan jo jo dan became yo yo dan as he went down and up four times in the four one - sided rounds which ended in the inevitable stoppage
brook sends jo jo dan flying for a third time and then knocked him down a fourth before it was stopped brook âs first right - hander wobbled him
jo jo dan reeled around like a drunk in the ring and it is arguable that brook might have found a tougher rival in the pub round the corner
brook now rates himself up there with mayweather , pacquiao and khan among welterweight royalty
hearn concurred with that opinion , saying : â when brook first came to me his father told me he would beat mayweather one day
when he took the microphone to ask who they wanted him to beat next , the packed crowd roared : â khan , khan , khan
â brook celebrates after beating jo jo dan during their ibf world welterweight title fight hearn would love that , too , and he believes it is also what the british fight fans desire
and i âm not expecting my phone to ring within 48 hours
