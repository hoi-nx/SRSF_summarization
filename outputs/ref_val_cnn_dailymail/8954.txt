spine uses so - called e-textiles to wirelessly charge military equipment and gets its energy from an inductive charging seat all of this energy use can then be monitored using a smartphone app other equipment in the range includes the q - warrior augmented reality headset and car seats that wirelessly charge the wearable technology
it can power up and transfer data to and from equipment such as radios , cameras , smart helmets and torches , as well as smart weapons - effectively working as a portable hotspot eight devices can be plugged in and charged at any one time , and the vest 's electrically conductive yarns can also be used to charge other gadgets wirelessly
this image is a grab from the spine 's connected app. it shows how much power the vest , and individual gadgets , have a total of eight devices can be plugged in and charged at any one time , and the vest 's electrically conductive yarns can also be used to charge other gadgets wirelessly

bae has additionally created an inductive seat charger that automatically transfers energy from a vehicle to the vest
the power is inductively transferred into the equipment through a modified attachment elsewhere , the q - warrior see - through augmented reality display integrates with the spine power and network to overlay interesting information such as gps locations , temperatures and other data ' current integration of body worn equipment has not been addressed as a platform design and has resulted in an unwieldy cable harness , ' said bae
