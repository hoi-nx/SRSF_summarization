israeli prime minister netanyahu coasted to victory in tuesday 's elections , defying pre-election polls showing his likud party trailing his main rival , the center - left zionist union
in a matter of days , netanyahu exposed his true attitude toward israeli 's conflict with the palestinian , in the process threatening to further erode an already strained relationship with the white house
in the last six years of his premiership , netanyahu has spoken out repeatedly against a withdrawal to the 1967 borders , with mutually agreed land swaps -- the basis for a two - state solution ; insisted that palestinian recognize israeli as the state of the jewish people -- a condition no palestinian leader can accept ; and presided over unprecedented settlement activity in the west bank and jerusalem , which the palestinian regard as their future capital
meanwhile , the israeli prime minister has disparaged palestinian authority president abbas at every opportunity , asserting that he encourages terrorism -- a claim that was contradicted by the head of israeli 's top security service -- and repeating the mantra that abbas is not a legitimate peace partner
in a less guarded moment , netanyahu told israeli writer etgar keret that the israeli - palestinian conflict was " insoluble
adding fuel to the fire , netanyahu has repeatedly injected himself into u.s. politics , most recently with his acceptance of an invitation by white house speaker john boehner to address congress -- a move that was widely seen as a partisan ploy to undercut the white house
in the last month , nearly 200 of these former high - ranking security officials launched a campaign demanding a change in leadership in light of what they view as netanyahu 's failure to take any diplomatic initiative while harming one of israeli 's greatest security assets : its relationship with the u.s.
israeli did not heed the ex-security officials ' warnings when they voted to retain netanyahu as their prime minister
