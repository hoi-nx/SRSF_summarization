on day two of the election campaign , the conservatives were boosted by a string of economic indicators â crowned by ons figures showing uk is enjoying its strongest growth since 2006
the uk is out - performing all other leading economies , including the u.s. , japan , canada , germany and france
in seven signs that the economy is on the up following the worst slump since the 1930s : labour has repeatedly claimed that families are Â£ 1,600 a year worse off than they were when the coalition came to power , but shadow chief secretary to the treasury chris leslie last night conceded that living standards appeared to be â crawling back to the levels that we were at five years ago â
car giant honda announced a Â£ 200million investment in its wiltshire plant - one of the many signs the economy is on the up chancellor george osborne hailed â a hat - trick of good news about the uk economy â , insisting : â with 37 days to go until the election , it âs another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk
voters now face a stark choice : do we stick with a plan which is working , delivering growth and jobs , or do we put all that at risk with ed miliband whose policies of more spending , more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos ? â labour had planned to use ronald reagan âs famous question â â are you better off than you were four years ago â â as a central plank of its election campaign , but the pressure on family finances has eased in recent months as the cost of food and fuel tumbles and wages rise
inflation has fallen to zero â its lowest level for more than half a century â and uk looks set for a period of deflation or falling prices
household spending per head also rose by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year
shadow chief secretary to the treasury chris leslie conceded that living standards appeared to be â crawling back to the levels of five years ago â yesterday âs ons figures showed the economy has grown by more than 8 per cent since the last election , having crashed by 6 per cent in the so - called â great recession â under labour
the uk economy is now 3.7 per cent bigger than at any time in history

and exports rose by 4.6 per cent in the final three months of 2014 despite the ongoing crisis in the eurozone
experts said uk was on course for another strong year in 2015
it is still entirely possible that the uk will head the g7 growth league in 2015 , as we did last year
â reality : in 2014 , gdp grew by 2.8 per cent â revised up from 2.6 per cent yesterday and the fastest annual rate of growth since 2006
uk had the strongest annual growth rate in the g7 in 2014

families are Â£ 1,600 worse off
â reality : real household disposable income per head was up by 1.9 per cent in the final three months of 2014 compared to 12 months earlier
living standards are now officially higher than when the coalition took office
labour âs Â£ 1,600 figure excludes tax changes and dates from april 2014 : since then inflation has fallen sharply while pay rises have improved
â the number of people working full - time has risen by 1.42million - 75 % of the rise in employment since the election has been in full - time jobs reality : the internationally - respected gfk measure â a large - scale survey of the public âs personal finances , savings and optimism about the future â rose to +4 in march , its highest level since june 2002
â reality : ons figures show business investment is the fastest growing part of gdp â up by 7.8 per cent in 2014
while it is of huge political significance that living standards are now higher than in may 2010 , the average household has only a tenner more to spend .
