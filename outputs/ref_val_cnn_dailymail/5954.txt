killed : robinet was killed in a scuffle with los angeles police on skid row on sunday , prompting protests a homeless man shot dead by the los angeles police department stole a french 's identity more than 15 years ago and was wanted for violating terms of a bank robbery conviction , officials said last night
robinet , 39 , was killed on los angeles ' impoverished skid row when he allegedly tried to grab the holstered pistol of an officer while police arrested him on sunday
the shooting was caught by an onlooker on a video that went viral , leading to protests and calls by civil rights activists for a special police commission hearing on the use of force
originally thought to be french , officials now say robinet stole the identity of a french with the same name and birth date to apply for a french passport in the 1990s , when he came to the united states to pursue an acting career
his true identity remains unknown , said cruau , the consul general for french in los angeles
according to the consulate 's account , robinet was identified as a french national in 2000 when robbed a wells fargo branch in thousand oaks , some 40 miles west of downtown los angeles , and pistol - whipped an employee
he served around 13 years in prison for the crime , in which he , an accomplice and getaway driver stole $ 33,500 in a bid to pay for acting classes at the beverly hills playhouse
but when the french consulate tried to support him ahead of his 2013 release , officials discovered the original robinet and realised the prisoner was an imposter
mr cruau said : ' the real charley robinet is in french apparently living a totally normal life and totally unaware his identity had been stolen years and years ago
above is the moment directly after the fatal scuffle , after police had backed away proof ? police say this frame shows robinet , circled center , reaching up for a police officer 's gun during the fatal encounter on sunday in los angeles while in federal prison in rochester , minnesota , the bank robber known as robinet was assigned to the mental health unit
after his release from federal prison robinet spent six months in a halfway house before being fully released in may 2014 , said ed ross , a spokesman for the bureau of prisons
foreign nationals are usually deported after serving their sentences , but french would not take him because he could not prove was french
because of a 2001 supreme court ruling on the rights of ' stateless ' people , robinet was set free
under the terms of the man 's release , he was required to provide reports to his probation officer at the beginning of each month , deputy united states marshal matthew cordova said he failed to do so in november , december and january , leading to the issue of a federal warrant - which triggered the fatal clash with police
the head of the union rescue mission , outside which robinet was shot , told reuters that robinet had been living in a tent outside the mission for weeks and had a history of violent , erratic behavior
' killing : this is the moment police fired shots at robinet , who is obscured from view in the above frame by an officer
the los angeles police department have claimed he was trying to take an officer 's gun before the fatal shooting : he was being confronted over reports of a robbery before five shots were fired the three officers who fired their weapons at robinet were veterans of the skid row beat who had special training to deal with mentally ill and other people in the downtrodden area , said beck
but a rookie officer who cried out that the man had his gun , leading to the shooting , had considerably less experience
police chief beck said some of the veteran officers had ' completed our most extensive mental illness training over a 36 - hour course
los angeles police chief beck said damaged magazine and a partially - discharged bullet prove there was a struggle over it ' the way you have conversations , the way you offer options , the way that you give some space , the body language that you portray , the way that you escalate , all of that is part of the training , ' beck said on monday
' angry protests : people walk through skid row in protest against the killing of a homeless man by police in los angeles on tuesday the specialized training came under the nationwide safer cities initiative , designed to tone down encounters between police and people on the streets
footage showed the homeless man reaching toward the rookie officer 's waistband , beck said
the officer 's gun was later found partly cocked and jammed with a round of ammunition in the chamber and another in the ejection port , indicating a struggle for the weapon , beck said
the man who was shot was black , as is the rookie officer who was just short of completing his probationary year on the force , police said
