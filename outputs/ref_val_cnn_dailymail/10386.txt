' chloe 's first gondola ride with @ mrsvanessatrump # aspen ski bum in the making , ' he commented alongside the image of himself , wife vanessa and chloe
the 37 - year - old businessman added : ' aprÃ¨s ski ai n't what it used to be ! ' over the weekend , ivanka took a break from the slopes in order to help her daughter build her very first snowman yesterday during their family vacation in aspen â and , unsurprisingly , arabella chose to name her snowy creation after a character from frozen
' another person praised ivanka 's parenting style , saying : ' she is just so pretty
ivanka shared two images of herself spinning arabella and her one - year - old son joseph around in an office chair , commenting on the instagram snap that the trio 's playtime session was serving as her morning workout
work those arms ! ivanka spent last thursday morning playing around with her two children , rather than opting for a session at the gym throwback : ivanka shared this childhood image of herself enjoying a skiing session with her mother ivana ' nothing like a morning spin session to get my day started right ! ' she wrote , before adding : ' their adorable squealing was the best part ! ' the adorable photos , which were uploaded as one collage , have already received numerous comments from ivanka 's followers , with many praising the busy mom for her ability to balance her work life with having fun at home
another added : ' you are a great role model for so many young women ! thank you ! ' and it seems that the fun picture may have made ivanka feel a bit nostalgic ; just a few hours after sharing the image with her 500,000 followers , the former model posted one of her own childhood snaps , apparently taken on one of the trump family 's skiing vacations
