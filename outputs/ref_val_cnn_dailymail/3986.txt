a dog with an ' unbelievable ' sense of smell has been able to sniff out thyroid cancer in people not yet diagnosed with the disease
us researchers said that on a test of 34 patients , frankie showed 88 per cent accuracy in finding tumours
frankie was trained to lie down when he could smell thyroid cancer in a sample of urine and turn away if it was clean
a dog with an ' unbelievable ' sense of smell has been able to sniff out thyroid cancer in people not yet been diagnosed with the disease
the us researchers said that on a test of 34 patients , frankie showed 88 per cent accuracy in finding tumours researchers at the university of arkansas said frankie only made two false positives and two incorrect ' all - clear ' diagnoses
' we wanted to see , can the doctor utilise the dog to help diagnose cancer ? ' thyroid tumours , which occur in a gland in the neck , are relatively rare and usually diagnosed by taking a blood sample and testing its hormone levels

thyroid tumours ( artist 's illustration right ) , which occur in a gland in the neck , are relatively rare and usually diagnosed by taking a blood sample and testing its hormone levels ' detecting and diagnosing thyroid cancer can be difficult , because it 's often looking for a very small number of occurrences in a very large background of benign nodules , ' said dr bodenner at the university of arkansas
' dogs , however , can sense it as their ability to smell is 10 times better than that of humans
the researchers now want to see if frankie , and other dogs , could be used as a diagnostic test for different types of cancer
researchers at the university of arkansas said frankie only made two false positives and two incorrect ' all - clear ' diagnoses

' thyroid cancer is our template , ' said dr arny ferrando
