the truebrew technobrewery can make 280 pints of beer in just two hours at the touch of a button
revolutionary ? the truebrew technobrewery ( pictured ) may look unassuming , but it could save ailing pubs and bars by making 280 pints of beer in just two hours , costing just 35 pence ( 53 cents ) each a similar size to an industrial oven , the machine is intended for business use and will cost around Â£ 25,000 ( $ 38,000 )
the machine allows landlords to brew their own beer for a quarter of the price of buying it in from a brewery
cheap and unique : the machine allows people to brew their own beer for a fraction of the price of buying it in and they can create their own unique brews to impress friends and attract customers a serious business : a similar size to an industrial oven , the machine ( pictured ) is not intended to be stored in the kitchen and costs around Â£ 25,000 ( $ 38,000 ) regularly drinking beer could help slow dementia , research suggests
taking inflation into account - but not any increases in duties - this means that a pint costs just over Â£ 1 to make
pubs brewing their own beer was an age - old tradition until the mid- 1800 âs when the introduction of duty killed it off , but now that tradition is being revived with bars launching their own microbreweries
beer industry experts mclauchlan and graham steele have spent the last 10 years developing the truebrew technobrewery
the machine is self - cleaning and the beer is ready to drink seven days later
after fermentation , it can be put into casks or bottles and sold directly from a pub , which the company says guarantees its freshness and wipes out transportation costs
while it costs a considerable amount , the new machine is estimated to cost a quarter of price of setting up a regular Â£ 100,000 ( $ 152,000 ) microbrewery
â pubs can benefit enormously from this by brewing their own beer and that âs where truebrew technobrewery comes in
