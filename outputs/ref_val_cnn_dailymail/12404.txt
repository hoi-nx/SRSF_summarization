sanaa , yemeni a coalition of middle eastern forces continued pounding rebel targets in yemeni from the air on friday , the second day of a campaign aimed at the houthis group
while it was hard to immediately determine the extent of the damage and destruction , the resounding sounds of huge explosions heard around sanaa on friday night suggested that the saudis - led strikes were taking a toll
the strikes ' target is houthis rebels , a shiite muslims minority group that has taken over the capital and , on wednesday , captured key parts of the yemeni port city of aden
aden was where president hadi had moved because of the rebel advance
hadi has since left yemeni , and on friday he 'd arrived in egypt for a summit of arab league representatives
many nations in the arab league are now participating in the armed effort against the houthis and presumably to return hadi to yemeni as its leader
not surprisingly , the houthis are bearing the brunt of the bloodshed -- and not just in sanaa
five houthis died were hurt in an attack by fighters loyal to hadi on a houthis post about 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) outside al anad airbase , two security officials in lahj province said
hadi has also ordered the closure of all houthis - controlled media -- including yemen tv and saba tv
al jazeera 's office in sanaa was also targeted , with houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment , the qatar - based network said
the houthis are allied with majority iran
saudis , the largest contingent in the intervention dubbed al-hazm storm , considers the houthis to be proxies for the shiite muslims government of iran and fear another shiite muslims - dominated state in the region
" i ask you , based on the principle of self - defense in article 51 of the charter of the united nations , and on the basis of the charter of the arab league and the treaty of joint arab defense , to provide instant support by all necessary means , including military intervention to protect yemeni and its people from continuous houthis aggression , " read the letter , which was posted by saudis 's foreign ministry
supreme leader al houthi spoke live thursday night in yemeni on al-masirah tv , saying , " if any army tries to invade our country , we will prove that yemeni will be a grave for those who invade us
at least one major player in yemeni besides the houthis -- the gpc , which is the party of longtime leader ali abdullah saleh -- thinks the saudis and their partners should stay out
