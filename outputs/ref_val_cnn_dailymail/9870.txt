a police department employee will be fired and two suspended after being identified by a justice department report as sending racist emails , the mayor of ferguson told reporters
mayor james knowles made the announcement wednesday after attorney general eric holder said the report showed police created a ' highly toxic environment ' in ferguson
' let me be clear , this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the ferguson police department or in any department in the city of ferguson , ' james knowles said at the conference
the justice department investigation into ferguson police began in august after the shooting of unarmed african - american teen michael brown by a white officer sparked national protests
analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed african - americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in ferguson , an unnamed department official said
the justice department report also found that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were black
a justice department investigation has found patterns of racial bias in the ferguson police department and at the municipal jail and court
the full report will be publicly released march 4 justice department staff interviewed hundreds of average citizens as part of the six - month probe , concluding that a large portion of ferguson 's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were americans eric holder also said that charges for minor violations such as ' manner of walking in roadway ' disproportionately affected black residents and were used ' not as a public service , but as a tool for raising revenue
' nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of americans in ferguson , new york and cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what president obama called ' simmering distrust ' between police and communities
justice department officials found from 2012 to 2014 that black motorists in ferguson , missouri , were more than twice as likely as whites to be searched in traffic stops , even though they were 26 per cent less likely to be found carrying contraband
and from april to september of last year , 95 per cent of people kept at the city jail for more than two days were black , the six - month inquiry found
the justice department plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with ferguson officials and enter a consent decree , or to sue the city to force change
but they are unlikely to restore full trust in the ferguson police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict michael brown 's killer , officer darren wilson
after a separate investigation , the justice department decided not to pursue federal charges against darren wilson , who has said he acted in self - defense
among the emails was one sent sent by a ferguson police or municipal court official in 2008 that said obama would not stay in office long because , ' what black man holds a steady job for four years ? ' another electronic missive , written in 2011 , included an offensive joke : ' an americans - americans woman in new orleans was admitted into the the hospital for a pregnancy termination
biased : the investigation found ferguson officers too often charged blacks with petty offenses ' the fact that police officers and municipal court officials are using their public emails to tell racial jokes , that just reeks of arrogance and ignorance , ' said bynes
' a separate report to be issued soon is expected to clear ferguson police officer darren wilson of federal civil rights charges in the michael brown killing the official said that in ferguson 's court system , african - americans were less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and made up 95 percent of people held longer than two days in the ferguson jail
' ' that is that the tragic killing of an unarmed 18 - year - old black teenager was part of a systemic pattern of inappropriate policing of americans - americans citizens in the ferguson community
