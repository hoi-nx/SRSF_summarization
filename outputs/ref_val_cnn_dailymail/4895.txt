ants may be the perfect workers - they share chores , solve complex problems and work to the death without complaint
german engineers have crafted machines that mimic the cooperative behaviour of a colony , because the robots can make individual decisions as well as work as a team
and they are capable of manoeuvring objects , hinting that such robots could one day replace humans as factory workers
the firm said : â for the first time , the cooperative behaviour of the creatures has also been transferred to the world of technology using complex control algorithms
â the machines work together to complete difficult tasks , such as manipulating a large object , as real ants do in nature
they do this by using a stereo camera fitted in each robot âs head which helps an individual ant locate and identify target objects
an ant can then pick it up using serrated grippers below its head
sensors enable an ant to be aware of its surroundings and the robotic insects communicate over a wireless network to coordinate their actions
the robots have plastic , 3d printed bodies with electric circuits printed on top , ( pictured ) while their legs and grippers are ceramic actuators which can bend precisely and easily using little energy â like their natural role models , the bionicants work together under clear rules , â said dr ing heinrich frontzek , head of future concepts at the firm
the aim of the project is to create intelligent bots that could work in factories , taking over production jobs from humans
â each ant makes its decisions autonomously , but in doing so is always subordinate to the common objective and thereby plays its part towards solving the task at hand ( pictured ) â the company said the bionicants will go on show at hannover messe - the world âs largest industrial technology fair - in april , along with other creations such as the firm âs robotic butterflies ( pictured ) festo 's bionic butterflies are incredibly light and are able to fly as a collective
while they are not as cute as the ants and work alongside humans , they are able to deliver heavy stacks of toys , books and other products to employees to pack
like the ants , the emotion butterflies are designed to work together and can fly autonomously without bumping into each other by using lightweight cameras and an intelligent guiding and monitoring system

' the chameleon is able to catch a variety of different insects by putting its tongue over the respective prey and securely enclosing it , ' the firm says
