they were a species of early human thought to have roamed europe and asia for up to 300,000 years before finally dying out
they have found that an enormous volcanic eruption in italy 40,000 years ago had little impact on the species ' demise
neanderthals , shown above from the tv series walking with neanderthals , were already on the decline by the time of the campanian ignimbrite eruption in italy 40,000 years ago caused widespread climate cooling although the campanian ignimbrite eruption was one of the largest volcanic explosions in europe , scientists say the cooling and increased levels of acid rain that resulted from the explosive eruption would have had little impact in the areas where neanderthals were living
anthropologists at the university kansas say the talons appear to have been made into symbolic jewellery 80,000 years before modern humans arrived in europe
instead they say that it was likely to be competition with modern humans that led to the demise of the neanderthals
dr black , from the department of earth sciences at the university of california berkeley , who led the research , said : ' radiocarbon dating has shown that at the time of the campanian ignimbrite eruption , anatomically modern humans had already arrived in europe , and the range of neanderthals had steadily diminished
' work at five sites in the mediterranean indicates that anatomically modern humans were established in these locations by then as well
some scientists have suggested that the species were killed off by modern humans - homo sapiens - as they moved out of africa or were unable to cope changes to the climate
this image shows the average temperature anomalies in excess of 3 Â° c in the year following the campanian ignimbrite eruption alongside sites where neanderthals and human remains from the time have been found mount vesuvius , which is part of the campi flegrei super volcano , still overshadows the city of naples ( above ) the huge crater left by this super-volcano , known as campi flegrei , can still be seen on the coastline of italy on the opposite side of naples to mount vesuvius
genetic research on neanderthals remains has shown that these now extinct ancient cousins of modern humans may have suffered from psoriasis
neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred , meaning europe now have roughly two per cent neanderthals dna
other researchers have suggested that humans outside africa are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with neanderthals
the campi flegrei caldera close to napes , italy hides a supervolcano that erupted around 40,000 years ago the researchers found that the largest temperature decreases would have occurred in eastern europe and asia , avoiding the areas where the last neanderthals populations were surviving in western europe
however , they say that the cold weather that followed the eruption would still have impacted the day - to day life of neanderthals and early humans in europe
dr black and his colleagues said : ' significant volcanic cooling during the years immediately following the eruption could have impacted the viability of already precarious populations and influenced many aspects of daily life for neanderthals and anatomically modern humans
