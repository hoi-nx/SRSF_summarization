hodgson wants his fringe players to prove a point to him in turin as he prepares to field an ' experimental ' line - up against italy
england 's confidence is running high after they thumped lithuania 4 - 0 on friday to stretch their post-world cup winning streak to seven matches
england boss hodgson will change up his starting xi for the friendly against italy on tuesday night the italy are also without experienced campaigners andrea pirlo and daniele de rossi , but they are still by far the toughest opposition england have faced since their winless and joyless campaign in brazil
the likes of chris smalling , kieran gibbs , andros townsend , theo walcott and ross barkley are likely to get a chance in turin and with competition for places increasing , particularly in midfield and attack , hodgson wants to see encouraging signs from those who step in
' we 've got a tougher test ahead of us against italy and we will be playing that game with players we would n't normally rely upon , ' the england manager told fa tv
england fringe players will get a chance to impress manager hodgson during a friendly in turin ' there are an awful lot of people in the squad i count on that we 've lost , but what it means is for those who are still with us , many who are relatively untried , there will be a chance for them to show that my faith in selecting them for this squad was justified
arsenal forward theo walcott , who was a second - half substitute against lithuania , could start on tuesday england duo wayne rooney ( left ) and danny welbeck ( right ) celebrate their strikes on friday night everton midfielder ross barkley runs with possession during a late cameo on friday in the lithuania match in a bid , perhaps , to dampen expectations running high following harry kane 's impressive debut on friday , hodgson was moved to describe his line - up as ' experimental ' on sunday
harry kane celebrates scoring on debut as england cruise to a 4 - 0 victory over lithunania on friday night ' there are a number of players who quite seriously believe they should be in the team and none of them will be in italy
' italy and ireland ( in june ) will be to some extent experimental and a chance to break in to what we think is our best xi. ' still , a win against the nation that beat them in their world cup opener last summer will do no harm to morale , especially if harry kane puts on another performance like the one that saw him score after just 79 seconds on the pitch on friday
hodgson lost twice in the league at juventus , but a 3 - 0 coppa italia win over the turin giants is still remembered fondly by inter fans
