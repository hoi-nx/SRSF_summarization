italy interior minister angelino alfano is set to push for migrant screening and processing centres in african , at meetings with his eu counterparts in brussels tomorrow
mr angelino alfano claims that the migrant crisis should be tackled with refugee camps on african soil , where asylum seekers could be identified and then distributed evenly throughout europe states
italy , with its southernmost landfall just a 80km ( 49 miles ) from african , is the first port of call for many seeking new lives in europe
minister angelino alfano , of the centre - right ncd party , said the solution has to be found in african : â we must resolve the problem at its origin
there are two paths , stabilise libyans and create refugee camps in african so that the screening is done there , and those who have the right to asylum are identified with a balanced distribution between the europe countries
â italy is the first place many people arrive when seeking a new life in europe
it is thought up to a million people might be willing to make the crossing from libyans

â the facilities would be created by the eu in conjunction with international humanitarian organisations to two ends : avoiding the illegal crossings of the mediterranean with the risks that it brings and distributing the asylum seekers in europe according to balanced reception quotas
