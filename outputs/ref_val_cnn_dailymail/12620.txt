robots serve you drinks , you can skydive on deck and a mechanical arm hoists you 300 feet into the air to view the ship
you could be forgiven for thinking you had been transported into the future on board the new $ 1 billion cruise ship quantum of the seas
the latest brainchild of royal caribbean , which has branded the newest member of its fleet the " smartest cruise ship in history , " it is basically a fun palace on the high seas
everything , it seems , is a first : the first bumper cars , skydive simulator and bionic bar on a ship
" this is the smartest cruise ship , " says kulovaara , executive vice-president of maritime at royal caribbean and head of the design process behind the project
" and this is not just royal caribbean 's prediction
" it 's unique and unusual , and we just had fun -- pure and simple , " is the assessment of carolyn spencer brown , the editor of cruise critic , after spending eight days on quantum
" royal caribbean are always raising the bar when it comes to putting stuff on board you 'd never thought you 'd see on a cruise ship
" there are bigger cruise ships out there : allure and oasis -- both part of the royal caribbean fleet -- although not quite with the same box of tricks
but what exactly does a price tag of nearly $ 1 billion buy you ? the vessel is 16 stories high , has room for 4,500 passengers and a 1,500 - strong crew
built in meyer werft shipyard in papenburg , germany , its first voyage at the end of last year was from southampton to new york , and an eight - day caribbean cruise on board starts from $ 1,333
the project was first discussed in 2009 and the build took three and a half years
kulovaara , who has been with the company since 1995 , is proud of the open - thinking mentality that appears to have gone into the design process
how can we provide a better vacation ? we constantly explore novel options , what 's possible on a ship
" that involves bringing partners on board , including the team behind ripcord by ifly -- provider of skydiving on the deck in an enclosed capsule -- which has long been a company aspiration
" north star looks simple but it 's very complex so adding to the ship design was huge , " explains kulovaara , who says he only got involved in studying naval architecture in order to make him a better yachtsman
" at the bionic bar , passengers can order drinks by ipad and watch as huge bionic arms make any beverage of their choosing
" the company is confident it is winning the cruise wars , and reviews of the vessel have , to date , been very positive
it 's like a ship within a ship with a separate family zone and a cuban - themed area for adults
" so royal caribbean are leading the way but it 's nice to see it 's got competition
" there is a pressure on royal caribbean to raise the bar for its next creation , though kulovaara is not concerned
