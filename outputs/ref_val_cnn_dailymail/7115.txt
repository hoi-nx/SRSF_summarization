lawyers for boston marathon bomber tsarnaev rested their case in his federal death penalty trial tuesday after presenting a brief case aimed at showing his late older brother was the mastermind of the 2013 terror attack
the defense admitted during opening statements that tsarnaev participated in the bombings , but tsarnaev 's lawyer said he was a troubled 19 - year - old who had fallen under the influence of his radicalized brother , tamerlan , 26
during its brief case , the defense called a cell site analyst who showed that tsarnaev was at the university of massachusetts-dartmouth when tamerlan purchased components of the two bombs used in the 2013 attack , including pressure cookers and bbs
they also called mark spencer , a digital forensics expert , who testified about tamerlan âs computer history and his fascination with jihadist literature and learning how to construct bombs
an fbi photographer was also called in hopes of showing that tsarnaev did not target specific individuals with the bombs
