ryanair is poised to become the first airline to use a so - called â ghost airport â on spanish âs eastern coast which has been ignored by other carriers
spanish media said europe âs largest budget airline will operate flights between airport and destinations in britain , germany and sweden
airport has become a symbol of wasteful public spending and spanish 's debt the spokesperson said : ' ryanair does not comment upon or engage in rumour or speculation
' airport has barely been used since it opened four years ago , and has become a symbol of reckless government spending and spanish âs debt
it was built at a cost of Â£ 130million and declared open in march 2011 , even though no airlines were signed on as tenants and it had not received government approval to operate
it received that approval late last year and since december it has been used for charter flights operated by spanish football clubs barcelona and villarreal , but it has not welcomed any commercial flights
citing unnamed sources , abc said ryanair will begin operating from the airport at the start of the easter holiday season , and local officials are hoping the deal will bring more tourists to the region
