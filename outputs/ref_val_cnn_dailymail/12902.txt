newly released al qaeda documents , including letters to and from osama bin laden in the year or so before his may 2011 death , show an organization that understood it had severe problems resulting from the cia drone program that was killing many of the group 's leaders in pakistan 's tribal regions bordering afghanistan
they also entered into ceasefire discussions through intermediaries with elements of pakistan 's intelligence service , isi , although the documents suggest that nothing came of these discussions and there is no evidence in the documents indicating that the pakistan government had any clue about osama bin laden 's location or presence in pakistan
cia efforts to spy on the group and kill its leaders were so effective that in june 2010 an al qaeda official urged osama bin laden , " you should have fewer exchanges of correspondence with us during this period
within a few weeks of this letter being written , the cia would track osama bin laden 's trusted courier to his longtime hideout in abbottabad , pakistan , and on may 1 , 2011 , a seals operation ordered by president barack obama killed al qaeda 's leader
the new al qaeda documents are part of a trove of many thousands that the seals recovered at osama bin laden 's compound
seventeen of these documents had also been released around the first anniversary of osama bin laden 's death
the documents show how al qaeda 's 9/11 operation unleashed so much force against it , including the cia drone program , that it had to hide in the shadows and could n't pull off any successful operation in the west for many years before the death of osama bin laden
the documents demonstrate that almost a decade after 9/11 al qaeda was struggling to get any kind of operation going against western targets
al qaeda had also sent " three brothers " on a terrorist mission to danish , a country that osama bin laden loathed because of the publication by a danish newspaper of cartoons of the prophet mohammed , but had " lost contact with them

" in a letter to osama bin laden , an al qaeda official provided a vivid description of the death by drone of yazid , then the no. 3 leader of the group , on the night of may 22 , 2010
underlining al qaeda 's weakness , during the summer of 2010 the group was contemplating some kind of ceasefire with the pakistan government and had entered into negotiations with it via intermediaries to explain that al qaeda 's battle was " primarily against the u.s.
" highlights of osama bin laden documents released in 2012 the documents show that such a ceasefire was purely tactical rather than the beginning of some kind of rapprochement between al qaeda and the pakistan
