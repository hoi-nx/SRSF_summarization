a man accused of murdering a string of women and dumping their bodies may have killed up to 180 people - escaping detection because the police force turned a blind eye to his crimes because his victims were mainly drug addicts and prostitutes , a documentary claims
lonnie franklin jr - dubbed the lonnie franklin jr because he allegedly had a break between committing multiple murders - is due to go on trial later this year accused of sexually assaulting , murdering and then dumping the bodies of 10 women across la over two decades
but a new documentary by uk filmmaker broomfield suggests franklin was able to go on killing for so long , and possibly target dozens more victims , because of a police ' blindness ' to his victims - which he likes to a ' genocide happening and nobody was talking about it
' mr broomfield claims had the police properly investigated the murders and disappearances of mostly black , female prostitutes and drug addicts lives could have been saved
however a police search of his home found pictures and videos of 180 women who could all be possible victims
' in his documentary tales of the lonnie franklin jr , mr broomfield claimed police did n't warn people there was a killer lurking in the neighbourhood or do anything to alert people living in nearby hollywood because the victims were often seen as more of a ' nuisance
' he said franklin , a father - of - two , was able to go on killing so long because he targeted vulnerable black women , many of whom had become crack and cocaine addicts in the 1980s
the suspected victims of the lonnie franklin jr : enietra washington ( left ) survived an attempted murder and was found in 1988 , alicia alexander ( centre ) was found dead in an alley in september 1988 , henrietta wright ( right ) died in august 1986 in an alleyway valerie mccorvey ( left ) was found dead in 2003 , lachrica jefferson ( centre ) in january 1988 and bernita sparks ( right ) was found dead and dumped in an alleyway in april 1987 mary lowe ( left ) was found in november 1987 - just a few months before barbara ware ( right ) was found princess berthomieux ( left ) was discovered in an alley in march 2002 , and debra jackson ( right ) in 1995 mr broomfield added : ' they were just seen as disposable people
most of the women were prostitutes and drug addicts and i do n't think it helped that the people were black
a search of franklin 's mint green la home found up to 180 pictures of women , many of whom are missing giving one comparison , he said the disappearance of dozens of women was treated very differently from a case in 1988 where a gang had shot students in westwood - causing the whole city to be shut down
franklin was arrested in 2010 after dna evidence was found which appeared to connect the victims stills from the documentary show franklin after he was arrested in july 2010 for the 10 murders mr broomfield , pictured right interviewing a friend of franklin 's , said the documentary took a year and a half pam brooks was interviewed by broomfield , giving an insight into life in la ' people did n't know someone was hunting for them
' mr broomfield said had people been aware there was a danger they would have been more cautious about accepting lifts from people , because some of the victims were not prostitutes or drug addicts but simply those who were waiting for buses late at night
mr broomfield , who spoke to relatives and friends of franklin to produce the documentary , claims when his son christopher told him officers were almost ' grateful ' that the alleged lonnie franklin jr had rid the streets of some of the ' problem ' people they had been dealing with on an almost daily basis
he added that in the one - and - a - half years it took to make the documentary , franklin was described as a ' loving father ' and almost a robin hood figure , who would fix people 's cars and get cheap washing machines if they needed them
broomfield ( left ) claims in the documentary that alleged killer franklin ( right ) continued with his killing spree for so long because police turned a blind eye to his victims , who were largely black drug addicts ' mo ' claimed she had been forced to pose for a naked picture for franklin , her then next door neighbour , after the pair went for a drive in his van in 2006
mo said she was stunned when she saw her photo on a documentary about her former neighbor franklin , dubbed the lonnie franklin jr , is to go on trial for 10 murders and one attempted murder in june police arrested franklin in july 2010 after his dna was connected to more than a dozen crime scenes
but they claimed he was often obsessed with crack addicts - becoming popular with women in the 1980s during the crack epidemic which swept la
