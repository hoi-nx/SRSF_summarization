scotland skipper laidlaw admits the dark blues will be left red - faced if they do not end this year 's six nations with a victory on saturday
vern 's side have impressed in brief spells so far this campaign but have not done enough to beat france , wales , azzurri or england
they now round off their championships by hosting the irish at murrayfield this weekend
scotland captain laidlaw ( centre ) passes the ball during the six nations match against england but with joe schmidt 's team chasing their second six nations title on the spin , they will have to produce a stunning result to spare themselves their third whitewash in 11 years
asked if it would be embarrassing for scotland to finish bottom without a win , scrum - half laidlaw said : ' well yeah
we will go out there and give absolutely everything to try and avoid ( another defeat )
' it 's a huge game for us but i know the boys are absolutely desperate to get out there , put in a good performance and come away with a win

the last - gasp 22 - 19 defeat to the azzurri remains the lowest point of a black six weeks , but the clashes with france and wales also saw big opportunities missed and self - inflicted mistakes prove costly
laidlaw now hopes his men can at least stride away from the tournament with some pride intact and avoid the prospect of stumbling towards this year 's world cup with heads bowed
' if we get a win here it gives us some momentum going forward to the world cup and the four warm - up games

but they failed to build on that platform as stuart lancaster 's men came back at them with a second - half barrage to claim 12 - point win
but laidlaw insists those brutal home truths need to be told if the scots are to improve
' the last time ireland were welcomed into edinburgh they were mugged 12 - 8 by scott johnson 's side and laidlaw believes the current dark blues could learn from that 2013 display
