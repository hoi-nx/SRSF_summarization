cleared : erp was acquitted after being accused of murdering his wife lori in a suicide pact
erp has spent more than two years in jail waiting to come to trial over the death of his wife lori
the court heard how the couple , from portland , oregon , had both signed a suicide note saying they wanted to to die on march 2 , 2013
mr erp told the court that his 52 - year - old wife shot herself twice in the head in their bedroom , before he took the rifle and tried to kill himself
mr erp was arrested and charged with murder , and during the trial prosecutors claimed a post-mortem examination of lori 's body suggested she had been shot by someone else
mr erp told the court he still missed his wife terribly , and some days still wants to die , according to a report by oregonlive
an earlier trial saw the jury reach deadlock - because they could not decide whether mr erp had shot and murdered his wife - and a mistrial was declared
but during the latest court appearance , prosecution lawyer tom cleary urged jurors to follow oregon law , which said that if they believed mr erp fired the fatal shots they must find him guilty of murder
mr erp 's 52 - year - old wife lori ( pictured ) was found dead at her home in bed with two shots to her head
prosecutors alleged mr erp had tried to kill her , but he successfully argued that she had shot herself however defence expert and former medical examiner dr michael propst , said it was unclear whether the woman died by her own hand
