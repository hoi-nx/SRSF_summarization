microsoft hopes to banish the password from mobile phones and computer with the next version of windows
instead of remembering a complex password , users will simply need to look at their phone or use a fingerprint reader
called windows hello , it will be part of windows 10 when it launches later this year
these security features are opt - in , meaning that users will be able to still rely on passwords and pins to unlock devices and features if they so desire
' when we started building windows 10 , the team spent a lot of time and energy thinking about how to make computing more personal , ' said belfiore of microsoft
called windows hello , the new system introduces support for biometric authentication â using your face , iris , or fingerprint to unlock your devices â with technology that is much safer than traditional passwords
' you - uniquely you - plus your device are the keys to your windows experience , apps , data and even websites and services â not a random assortment of letters and numbers that are easily forgotten , hacked , or written down and pinned to a bulletin board , ' belfiore said
' not only is windows hello more convenient than typing a password â it 's more secure ! ' our system enables you to authenticate applications , enterprise content , and even certain online experiences without a password being stored on your device or in a network server at all
' this creates lousy odds in the hacker roulette for all of us â there are only about 2 billion people online today ! ' windows 10 will include a new xbox one app to allow users to easily share with friends , and is extremely similar to the firm 's xbox one console system
the company also revealed that windows 10 devices shipping this autumn will have built - in windows hello features , and devices that already have fingerprint readers will also support the technology
' oem systems incorporating intel 's realsense 3d camera ( f200 ) will support the facial and iris unlock features of windows hello , including automatic sign - in to windows , and support to unlock passport without the need for a pin , ' the company said
