i 'm moss and i am professor of new testament and early christianity at the university of notre dame
i was an adviser on the " true cross " episode and served as one of the many on - camera experts in cnn 's " jesus " series , which currently airs on sundays
herb scribner : can anyone explain to me what the bible 's deal is with 40 days / nights ? moss : it 's more an interest in the number 40
yalanda m. price : was there any division between the followers of jesus and the followers of john the baptist ? moss : one of the interesting things about the relationship between jesus and john the baptist is that john does n't lay down his tools and follow jesus after he baptizes him
jeffery graff : can the dna tests on the bones indicate whether he is a jew or even whether he is of the tribe of levi ? moss : i 'm so glad someone brought up dna
the dna tests on the bulgaria bones yielded only mitochondrial dna ( dna passed down by the mother ) , not the more reliable nuclear dna ( the kind of dna referred to in forensic investigations )
in the original study of the bulgaria relics ( of which i was a part ) the mitochondrial dna revealed that the bulgaria relics were of " probable semitic origin
the episode last night stated things a little too sharply when it said that the bones were from a middle-eastern man
cyndi rosenthal : are there any other historical references of john the baptist outside of the bible ? daniel josã© camacho : any extra-biblical sources that shed light on historical figure of john the baptist ? moss : ( these questions are on a similar topic , so i 've chosen to answer them together
) actually there is external attestation for the life and importance of john the baptist
the jewish historian josephus mentions john the baptist in his book , " the jewish antiquities
according to josephus , herod put john the baptist to death because he was afraid that he might raise a rebellion
moss : i 'm also really glad someone brought this up , because i wondered about it too
" it 's an interesting request that tells us something about john the baptist 's ministry and the demanding characters of jesus ' disciples ! in luke , jesus responds to this request by teaching them the lord 's prayer
