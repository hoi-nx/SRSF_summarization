some australian companies are banning emails as directors believe internal emails cause stress and misunderstandings among staff schokker , the director of facilities management service provider talio , says he implemented this new rule six months ago and has already seen a positive difference in the workplace
' face - to - face interaction or instant messaging has become the preferred means of communication among these employees in order to de-clutter their inbox and create better working relationships for the ceo of website optimisation company quasion , he 's introduced instant messaging among staff and has left email correspondence for clients only
' however emailing often is n't suitable for internal communication and these kind of emails can clutter our inbox
' i found that instant messaging was much suitable for the business and also a very casual form of communication
' with instant messaging , people can respond when it 's suitable for them when they 're back in the office , ' he said
' one company director said he banned internal emails as his staff were increasingly feeling pressued to respond to them , particulary during their time off work so far , mr schokker says the new policy has been successful and is hoping to continue enforcing it at his company
' we 've also empowered employees to be self - governing when they receive internal emails , so they can choose to have a quiet word amongst themselves or not respond at all or respond when they 're back in the office
' now we 've seen about a 90 per cent reduction in emails and i can without a doubt say that it has improved our workplace
