in a bid to potentially bring the woolly mammoth back from the dead scientists have begun extracting dna from the remains of a beast found in siberia
a team of experts took samples of bone marrow from the extinct creature 's front left leg during a special symposium at a university in siberia on monday
the samples will be examined at a laboratory in yakutsk and by scientists in south korea with the hope of being able to clone one of the prehistoric animals
the samples will be examined at a laboratory in yakutsk and by scientists in south korea with the hope of being able to clone one of the prehistoric animals at the very least , the russia hope to decipher the mammoth 's complete dna structure by 2017
the perfectly - preserved remains were discovered two years ago in the sakha republic permafrost region , having been frozen for about 28,000 years
the perfectly - preserved remains ( pictured ) were discovered two years ago in the sakha republic permafrost region , having been frozen for about 28,000 years
it is thought the carcass belonged to a female woolly mammoth aged between 50 and 60 when she died mammoth blood ( shown ) was also found in the permafrost close to the perfectly - preserved trunk
experts will use modern methods to analyse samples taken from the creature and the facility , which will specialise in molecular palaeontology , will also study the remains of other dinosaurs found in the region ' firstly by searching for live cells , culturing them and creating a clone , then secondly by creating artificial living cells based on artificial nucleus dna
' the remains , complete with the creature 's famous hair , were discovered in may 2013 on an arctic island off the diamond - rich sakha republic , the largest region in russia
mammoth blood was also found in the permafrost close to the perfectly - preserved trunk
the work forms part of ' the revival of mammoth ' project , which plans to search for live cells , culture them and create a clone before creating artificial living cells the mammoth ( remains pictured ) was roughly the size as a modern african elephant , standing up to 11ft ( 3.3 metres ) tall and weighing about seven tonnes
the remains found in sakha republic are the best - preserved ever found in the 1993 film , scientists use dinosaur dna taken from a mosquito preserved in amber to clone the animals and create a theme park
however , south korea scientists are hoping that the samples found on the siberia woolly mammoth are n't too old
samples of bone tissue were taken on monday during a gathering at the north-eastern federal university in yakutsk , as part of a special international scientific workshop on the modern methods of working with fossilised remains
a new laboratory opening in yakutsk on tuesday will use modern methods to analyse samples taken from the creature
dr semyon grigoriev said : ' we are taking samples of bone marrow - it is one of the best materials for dna analysis
they are the best studied of all the prehistoric animals because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in siberia and alaska , as well as dung and skeletons
the last wild one was shot in 1870 and the last in captivity died in 1883 the remains found in sakha republic , also known as the sakha republic , were the best - preserved ever found and scientists believe there is a good chance of being able to clone the animal
the remains , complete with the creature 's famous hair , were discovered in may 2013 on an arctic island off the diamond - rich sakha republic , the largest region in russia ( pictured ) as if he was sleeping : the remains of a baby woolly rhinoceros , ( pictured ) who has been named sasha and still has its wool , has been discovered in the ice of siberia
it is the first juvenile of the species to be found the remains of a baby woolly rhinoceros , which still has its fleece , was discovered in the ice of siberia last month
named sasha , the extinct creature - which must be at least 10,000 years old and is the first juvenile woolly rhino to be found - was well preserved by permafrost and experts are hopeful of extracting its dna
