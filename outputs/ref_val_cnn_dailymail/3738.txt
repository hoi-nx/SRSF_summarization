on a scrap of paper at selhurst park last march , mourinho scribbled down the one word lacking from his chelsea team after they had been beaten by crystal palace
at upton park , mourinho âs side showed â balls â of steel , surviving a difficult game against one of those teams â and at one of those grounds â where anything can happen
chelsea have the mentality of champions
cesar azpilicueta , terry and ramires leave the upton park pitch after another victory for chelsea mourinho won the first trophy of his second stint at chelsea and few would bet against him adding the title chelsea celebrate their capital one cup trophy win at wembley and maintained their five - point lead there have been markers at key stages of the season : a 2 - 0 win over arsenal in october , 2 - 1 at liverpool the following month and their stunning performance in the 5 - 0 win at swansea in january
chelsea âs bond is strong , building this resilience in the dressing room as the season has progressed
they looked impenetrable , especially in the closing stages as west ham pushed for an equaliser
their work - rate is phenomenal , a team fighting for each other as they close in on their first premier league title since mourinho returned to the club
look around the chelsea dressing room and it will be difficult to separate some of these players when it comes to voting for the pfa player of the year in a few weeks â time
then there is last season âs young player of the year eden hazard , the tormentor - in - chief down chelsea âs left last night
so what has changed since last season , when they gifted manchester city their second premier league title with a series of faltering performances ? they have the bottle for the big occasion now
at wembley last sunday , mourinho turned to a television camera and squirted water all over the lens after terry had opened the scoring for chelsea
adrian dives in vain as hazard 's header sails past the spanish keeper and into the back of west ham 's net hazard was in irresistible form and leads collins a merry dance here for many different reasons , some tribal and some because of an irrational hatred of former player frank lampard , who has since left stamford bridge , away at west ham is always a tough fixture for chelsea
chelsea are the big noise in football right now , the team to beat as they prepare to face paris saint-germain in the return leg of their last - 16 champions league tie next week
increasingly chelsea look like a team determined to power on and finish the job in the premier league after feeding off the scraps last season
