green electric - powered cars are much more dangerous to pedestrians than traditional vehicles with petrol engines , a charity report said yesterday
it found that walkers are 40 per cent more likely to be run over by a quiet hybrid or electric car than by one with a petrol or diesel engine
the charity â which says that guide dog owners and their animals are particularly at risk from vehicles that they can not hear coming â called for laws to make noise generating systems compulsory on all hybrids
electric cars and hybrids running under electric power move silently and are likely to surprise people on foot who expect to hear the approach of a vehicle
the visually impaired are among the worst affected by the switch to electric as guide dogs also struggle to identify the threat , with campaigners calling for noise generators to be made compulsory car builders and independent companies have been working on a range of artificial sound generators that would lessen the risk of accidents
eu rules say such generators must be fitted to quiet cars by 2021 , but guide dogs said that before then there will be thousands more potentially dangerous green cars on the road
â legislation in britain should also insist that noise - making equipment is not only fitted to a car but always switched on , guide dogs said
