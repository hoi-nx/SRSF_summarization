the astana cycling team have denied reports they have been stripped of their worldtour licence by the licence commission
last month the uci requested that astana 's licence be revoked by the commission following an independent audit into the team of 2014 tour de france winner nibali , which came after a number of anti-doping infringements by astana and their feeder team
the astana cycling team have denied reports they have been stripped of their worldtour licence the licence commission is due to meet with astana on thursday , and the team said they believed that meeting would mark the start of the decision - making process , with no verdict yet in place
at the conclusion of that audit , the uci asked for astana 's licence to be revoked , saying the reality of the team 's policies and structures differed markedly from what astana told the licence commission during a review last december
