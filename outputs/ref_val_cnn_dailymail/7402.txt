sunita day , 45 , who once dated sir terence conran , was disinherited by her gambling - addict mother russell
but a judge ruled yesterday that she was entitled to keep an Â£ 800,000 flat she had been given in 1995
sunita day , 45 , ( left ) was disinherited by her mother russell before her death in 2013 and everything was left to her brother rajan russell ( right ) the court heard that restaurateur mrs russell , who died in 2013 , underwent a personality change after being diagnosed with cancer
mrs russell left her entire estate to mrs day âs older brother , investment banker rajan russell
â but she said her mother âs gambling addiction turned her into â a harridan with a capital h â and at one point she feared mrs russell would have her â bumped off â to get the flat back
her mother had given her a luxury Â£ 800,000 flat in battersea , south london ( pictured ) 20 years ago but mr rajan russell claimed it was part of his mother 's estate during her final years , her mother had visited casinos every night and even resorted to stealing gambling chips , mrs day claimed
but after a four - day hearing , judge marc dight ruled that mrs day was entitled to keep the flat , which had been â freely gifted â
he rejected mr rajan russell âs claim that she merely held the flat as a trustee and ruled he was entitled to only a Â£ 55,000 stake in the property to reflect a mortgage paid off by his mother
the judge said : â by the end of her life , and certainly from the time she was diagnosed with cancer , mrs russell had a deep - rooted and unhealthy gambling habit
â judge marc dight said mrs russell had tried to pressure and manipulate her daughter into giving her back the flat but mrs day had a â feisty â determination to hold on to the property
