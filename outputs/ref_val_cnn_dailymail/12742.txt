vonn may have missed out on gold at last month 's world championships , but the american skier has set her sights on end - of - season glory after claiming a record - extending 65th world cup win on sunday
vonn 's victory in the super-g event at garmisch-partenkirchen in germany gave her the outright lead in the speed discipline ahead of this month 's finals in france
having finished seventh in saturday 's downhill , the 30 - year - old rebounded by coming home 0.2 seconds ahead of overall world cup leader tina maze , whose coach set up the course
it put vonn eight points ahead of super-g world champion anna fenninger , who placed third to give back the 20 points she 'd earned over tina maze the day before -- when their positions were reversed
" i think it was set probably against anna fenninger , " said vonn , who took bronze behind tina maze at last month 's world championships in colorado
" " it 's going to be a close fight in downhill and super-g , so i will really have to ski my best at the finals in meribel
hopefully i can get two titles , " added vonn , who is 35 points ahead of anna fenninger in the downhill standings
but vonn is well off the pace in the fight for the overall crown -- which she last won in 2012 , her fourth success -- in third place almost 200 points behind the austrian
tina maze is another 44 points ahead of anna fenninger , with just two slalom events in sweden next week before the march 16 - 22 finale
" vonn was simply better today and she deserves this win
honestly i thought tina maze was going to be better than me in the downhill and that i would catch up in the super- g. it turned out to be different
the norwegian , who missed out on securing the downhill crystal globe when he finished seventh on saturday , opened up an unassailable 123 - point lead over italian dominik paris
" jansrud has a 20 - point lead over hannes reichelt in the downhill , but is less confident of overhauling his 52 - point deficit on another austrian , three - time defending champion hirscher , in the overall standings
