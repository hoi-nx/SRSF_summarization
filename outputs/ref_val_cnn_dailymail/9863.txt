the beeb said at the weekend that its political editor is to take time off to have a tumour removed from his lung
but he was immediately the subject of vile abuse online from twitter trolls who accused him of both pro-tory bias and anti-snp sentiment
smyth , whose twitter â handle â â his online name â includes an scottish national party logo , sent a message reading â karma â direct to mr robinson , 51 , and the beeb
other twitter users described mr smyth as an scottish national party member and urged the party to expel him
last night , the scottish national party had not confirmed or denied if he was a member
phoenix45blog â the 45 seemingly a reference to the percentage who voted yes â wrote : â a bit of chemotherapy would do the biased beeb man good
a second tweet responding to the same message said : â looks like @ davidcameron âs director of communications is off sick , poor man
â sick : two of the vile messages sent to the beeb political editor after he announced he has cancer the comments were widely condemned â including by the scottish national party
the presenter became a hate figure among some nationalists during the referendum campaign , with protesters outside beeb scottish âs glasgow headquarters calling for him to be sacked for what they saw as biased coverage
during the referendum campaign , the scottish national party was constantly embarrassed by the online army of cybernats
dispute : the scottish national party had a public spat with robinson , 51 , during the campaign , with dozens of members making official complaints and some even calling him a ' liar ' in banners as they paraded through glasgow 's streets last night , scottish politicians warned such abuse threatened to silence democratic debate in the run - up to may âs general election
â nicola sturgeon and the scottish national party must immediately distance themselves from these vile comments and call on their more extreme supporters to stop polluting social media with vicious personal attacks
â a scottish tory spokesman said : â these comments are despicable , but wo nât surprise anyone who saw the depths some people stooped to during the referendum campaign
â an scottish national party spokesman said : â we deplore all internet abuse , as we have made consistently clear , and the first minister has wished robinson well for a speedy recovery
