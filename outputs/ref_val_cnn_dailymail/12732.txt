israeli 's next prime minister -- whether incumbent benjamin netanyahu or labor party leader isaac herzog -- will be faced with a myriad of international and domestic crises amid deepening tensions with the united states , its closest ally
here are five key issues waiting in the new leader 's inbox after tuesday 's election
but ties have grown increasingly strained between president obama and benjamin netanyahu , playing out over the last several years in a series of awkward photo - ops , anonymous quotes in united states and israeli media and tense body language
relations hit a low point recently with benjamin netanyahu 's speech to us congress criticizing president obama 's policy toward iran about its nuclear program
repairing ties with the white house becomes easier if the next government is formed under isaac herzog , who has pledged to " restore intimacy and trust " with the leadership in washington
repairing ties becomes more difficult if benjamin netanyahu remains in office
for all its official praise for the " unshakable bonds " between the united states and israeli , the white house sees benjamin netanyahu as the problem
if benjamin netanyahu is re-elected , they will have to work with him
privately , however , united states officials have warned the level of washington 's political support for israeli with allies and at the united nations could be affected by benjamin netanyahu 's attitude toward the obama administration
confronting iran world powers are pushing toward a framework nuclear deal with iran before the march 31 deadline
in addition , israeli will want input on what constitutes a violation of the deal and what would trigger punitive measures if iran reneges
if he remains in office , benjamin netanyahu 's differing perceptions of the threat posed by iran will undoubtedly come to a head as that deadline approaches
benjamin netanyahu has been clear he believes history has handed him the role of delivering the jewish state from an existential threat posed by tehran 's nuclear ambitions
he worries that the agreement that emerges will leave iran as a nuclear " threshold state " with the materials and expertise to quickly break out and build a nuclear weapon
isaac herzog has similarly said he would never accept a nuclear iran and stresses all options are on the table , including the military options
but he has suggested as prime minister he would work closer with the obama administration and other governments negotiating with iran to strengthen a deal , rather than try and block the deal through the us congress
beyond the nuclear deal , the next israeli will leader will face an increasingly emboldened iran in the region
beyond it 's longstanding support to hezbollah in lebanon and backing of the al-assad government in syria , iran has extended its involvement in iraq 's battle against isis and has provided support to houthis in yemen
coupled with a lack of a viable peace process and a potential economic collapse of the palestinians authority , the lack of security coordination would present a total breakdown of cooperation between the two sides
the differences between benjamin netanyahu and isaac herzog seem to be more style than substance
isaac herzog has pledged to restart the peace process , but has expressed skepticism about whether palestinians president abbas is a reliable partner
dubbed the " cottage cheese " protests -- because of the rising cost of cottage cheese , a staple in many israeli pantry -- they were emblematic of a broader concern that benjamin netanyahu 's relentless focus on security issues was at the expense of domestic issues
polls indicate the growing frustration with the economy has resulted in a shift from benjamin netanyahu to isaac herzog
