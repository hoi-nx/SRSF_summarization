a damning new report has uncovered a string of safety concerns and examples of poor hygiene at homeless shelters across new york city that in many cases have people living in conditions little better than what they would find on the street
the dhs spends $ 360 million a year housing nearly 12,000 homeless families with children in largely privately - run shelters described as decrepit and dangerous in the department of investigation report released on thursday
' at its worst , dhs is turning a blind eye to violations that threaten the lives of shelter residents , ' the report said , calling for repairs , stiffer inspections and new mechanisms to compel fixes
the shocking findings included one family of six living in a homeless - shelter apartment where a dead rat festered on the floor for two days ( stock photo ) the shocking findings included one family of six living in a homeless - shelter apartment where a dead rat festered on the floor for two days
another family had no living - room furniture and had been without electricity for days
at a different homeless family shelter , a puddle of urine soiled the floor of the only working elevator
to make matter worse , all those buildings are part of a system in which the department is often paying well above neighborhood market rates for apartments
conditions in some family homeless shelters were bleakly spotlighted in december 2013 , when the new york times profiled an 11 - year - old girl who lived amid mice , rotting walls and communal bathrooms in a brooklyn shelter that no longer houses children
in february 2014 de blasio announced that he was removing over 400 children from two city - owned homeless shelters - the auburn family residence in fort greene , brooklyn , and from the catherine street shelter in lower manhattan - that inspectors had repeatedly cited for deplorable conditions
but even some better - equipped shelters had fire code violations and other problems , including the rusted - out stairwell , the report said
