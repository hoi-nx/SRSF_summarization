a teenager has been told she will not be allowed to compete to become miss england because she is a single mother
salim decided to enter local auditions for the competition in birmingham only to be told this would not be possible because in the small print it says mothers and married women can not enter
the 19 - year - old had gone to support her latifah , 22 , who was entering the contest but then decided she would also put herself forward
salim , 19 , was told she could not compete for a place in the england competition in the local heats in birmingham because the rules of the contest ban mothers and married women from taking part however the mother - of - one was disappointed when her older sister got to the next round round and she did not
she was told this was because she has a daughter sapphire , three , and there are rules banning mothers taking part
' this rule sends out the message that there 's no beauty in women after birth and that young mums ca n't be good role models , ' said miss salim
' the england beauty pageant claims the rule is in place to protect young families because the busy schedule for contest winners is not compatible with having a settled home life
' salim ( right ) accompanied her older sister latifah to the contest and decided to enter herself salim is currently studying business administration with the intention of running her own entertainment business
' i do n't think it 's fair that because i have a baby i should n't be able to enter the miss birmingham contest

the sisters , who have five other siblings , were among 637 applicants for the miss birmingham crown and 80 were selected for interviews at the burlington hotel in the city centre in january
beasley , director of miss england , said the controversial rule was in place to protect the ' family unit ' because of the winner 's demanding schedule
