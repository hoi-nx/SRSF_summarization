americans like to complain about the endless political gridlock in our capital
those of us who did vote elected more fire breathers than bridge builders to congress
we can turn to public forums to tackle big issues of the day
as research by dan kahan of yale law school shows , these counties took action not because floridians are less divided over political issues , or less partisan , or more scientifically literate than the rest of americans
instead , florida officials engaged their constituents through scores of open forums convened by governments , businesses and community groups
rather than seeing citizens as targets of a political campaign , officials governed with the diverse residents of their community to develop practical solutions that garnered broad support
our research identifies many successful examples of political deliberation in well - designed forums where citizens and officials engage in give - and - take discussion and arrive at solutions
these forums have developed " participatory budgets " in many cities , energy policy in texas and nebraska , community policing in chicago and much more
some of these forums are healing the rotting roots of democracy
for example , gerrymandering of political districts has become one way to protect the party in power and create safe seats for incumbents , sapping their incentive to represent constituents from the opposing party or craft bipartisan legislation
" in response in 2010 californians used their power to approve ballot initiatives to create a nonpartisan citizens redistricting commission , which redrew political districts that better reflected the state 's communities and helped elect a legislature that could work together more productively
this is one reason why the state 's budgeting process , once an endless game of chicken that paralyzed public services and rang up huge deficits , has become less rancorous and more fiscally responsible
many are highly technical proposals pushed by special interests , and multiple initiatives can overwhelm the public 's ability to evaluate them all
unlike politics as usual ( and those infamous town hall meetings meetings ) , these forums put citizens at the center of decision - making
moderators challenge people to treat other respectfully and consider a wide range of arguments and evidence , rather than engaging in hand - to - hand political combat
grandstanding and obstructionism do n't play as well in these forums as they do on the senate floor , partisan media outlets or the local tavern
if we want to move beyond political stalemate , we should strengthen these innovative forums for citizens to deliberate with each other and officials
