education secretary nicky morgan said last night that personal , social and health ( pshe ) lessons needed to be improved â and placed at the heart of the curriculum â to give young people the tools to cope with these growing demands
but let us not deny they bring new pressures that require new responses
â the pressures young people face today were unimaginable to my generation
â explaining the focus on teaching about sexual consent , mrs morgan said : â in this modern world where many young women , and for that matter many young men , are exposed to so many pressures day in and day out , surely we have a duty to make sure they know they can say no and know how to do it
â it does mean telling young people the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship , about when something crosses the line , what they can do about it
â ms morgan said lessons on how to deal with these new online threats , in addition to teching on safe realtionships , needed to be made ' central ' to the curriculum ( file image ) â if the revelations of recent weeks have shown us anything it âs that the stakes are too high to let our young people leave school without this knowledge
