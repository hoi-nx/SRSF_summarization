for burnley , a famous victory
for champions city , plenty of soul - searching required
after failing to stop george boyd , not many will fancy their chances of coping with lionel messi and luis suarez at the nou camp on wednesday

city deserved what they got â absolutely nothing
their manager , manuel pellegrini , looked pale and drawn by the final whistle as well he might
city dominated possession but not energy , commitment or even goal chances
