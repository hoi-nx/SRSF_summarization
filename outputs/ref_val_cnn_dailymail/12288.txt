not only does breastfeeding have clear short - term benefits , such as protection from infectious diseases and a reduction in mortality , it 's also been shown to be associated with an increase in intelligence
prior studies have shown an increase of up to 7.5 iq points in elementary age children who were breastfed , as well as an increase in verbal , performance and comprehensive iq in adults
the latest addition to this perspective is a long - term study of infants born in pelotas , brazil , in 1982
what makes this study unique is that it followed the subjects all the way to age 30
" we observed that breastfeeding was positively associated with performance and intelligence at 30 years old , as well as with education , school achievement and higher monthly incomes
" in fact , lessa horta said the subjects who had been breastfed for 12 months or longer had a higher iq ( about 3.7 points ) , more years of education and earned roughly 20 % more than the average income level
" it 's suggesting that the positive effect of breastfeeding on iq leads to a higher income , " he said
