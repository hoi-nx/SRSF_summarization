since september 1996 , wenger has ruled the roost at arsenal , not just building a squad and controlling a team , but shaping a club
in almost 19 years in charge of the gunners , wenger has won three premier league titles , lifted five fa cups , led his team to their only ever european final and masterminded the move to the emirates
wenger has been at arsenal for almost 19 years , while every other team has changed manager wenger led the gunners to their first champions league final , and has won three premier league titles the arsenal boss has been in north north london since september 1996 , surviving 156 premier league bosses in an era where premier league chairmen are as forgiving to their managers as jose mourinho tends to be towards referees , wenger is approaching two decades in the job â almost 15 years longer than the next longest - serving manager in the division
here sporstmail looks at the men wenger has survived â¦ what counts as a change ? with caretaker managers , interim appointments , and even the odd case of two men doing the job at the same time , it can be difficult to tell when exactly a club have officially changed managers
there were times when it seemed david pleat just had to wait a few minutes to be caretaker at tottenham again ruud gullit had already left two premier league clubs before wenger had been in the job three years gordon strachan ( left ) replacing ron atkinson was the second change after wenger arrived so while â interim â managers are included in our total , caretakers are not included unless they were given the job for a fixed term
ray harford âs resignation at blackburn , less than a month after â the professor â got his feet under the desk at arsenal , was the first , with five more coming in the 1996 - 97 season
peter reid , sacked by leeds in 2003 , marked the 50th premier league manager to go in the wenger era when steve bruce left wigan for sunderland it marked the 100th managerial change since wenger arrived unsurprisingly the rate of change has dramatically increased in recent years
the first half of wenger âs tenure at arsenal produced just 63 sackings in a little over nine years
last season âs total of 14 managerial changes was , in fact , the largest number in premier league history
tony pulis ' resignation from crystal palace last summer was change no 150 since wenger started method of change ? the vast majority of the time , when a premier league manager leaves his job , it âs because he âs been told to clear out his desk
remarkably , in the last 18 - and - a - bit years since wenger joined arsenal , only 18 managers left by choice to go straight into another job ( and three of those went to international management rather than another club ) , while some resigned and a handful retired
glenn hoddle ( left ) and alan shearer have both managed one of the league 's most prolific clubs jose mourinho 's return for his second spell at chelsea was the club 's 12th appointment since wenger started since roman abramovich took over at chelsea the club have had nine managers , jose twice , in 12 years manchester united - 2 everton - 4 liverpool - 6 aston villa - 7 tottenham - 10 chelsea - 11 change has at least brought success for chelsea , but the same can not be said at st james â park , where john carver is the 12th man to try and pick up a trophy since arsenal last appointed a manager
jacques santini ( left ) and martin jol are two of the 10 tottenham managers who have been replaced tim sherwood ( right ) became the 10th tottenham manager to do battle with wenger last season perhaps most impressive in their high number of changes though , are southampton and sunderland , who have managed nine premier league managerial replacements each , despite spending a fair amount of time outside the top flight since 1996
of the top flight âs ever - presents , manchester united have unsurprisingly had the fewest changes , with just sir alex ferguson âs retirement and david moyes â sacking , while liverpool have said goodbye to six bosses during wenger âs tenure
redknapp has left five premier league jobs in the time wenger has been in his only one redknapp won the fa cup in one of his two spells at portsmouth , which ended in october 2008 stoke city boss mark hughes is on his fifth premier league job since wenger arrived in north london stoke city âs mark hughes has matched that , his terms at blackburn , fulham , manchester city and qpr all coming to an end while wenger stayed put
