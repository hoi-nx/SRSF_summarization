england 's population is up 565,000 in the past three years because of a fresh influx of migrants , experts said yesterday
the migrant population in england is estimated to have increased by more than half a million in three years , research from the oxford has revealed
around two thirds of the 565,000 migrants thought to have come to the country between 2011 and 2014 were born in other eu countries , the study by the university 's migration observatory said
here is a regional picture of the total foreign population of england and the percentage it has risen in since 2011 jose manuel barroso said : â when you have 28 countries it will be impossible to say , let âs say , the french can come to uk to work in the city but the poland can not come to uk â this is not possible
the majority moved to london and the south - east but the north - east and yorkshire and humber saw the biggest percentage increases , figures show
every council area of england has seen an increased migrant population , it was said
researchers , who stressed that the numbers are estimates , said the projections give a more up - to - date picture of the migrant populations across england than the 2011 census
it came as the institute for fiscal studies found that rising number of migrants has led to council services spending by being cut in half - and those with highest migration numbers were hit hardest
almost 200,000 more migrants were estimated to live in london last year , compared to 2011
the south east saw the second - highest rise of 79,000 , while the smallest increase was in the north east where an extra 26,000 migrants are thought to have arrived since 2011
figures : the study shows how all regions have seen thousands more migrants from within the eu since 2011 embarrassing : despite pledges from cameron thousands of migrants from outside the eu also came to england ' we have undertaken this analysis to provide a resource for anyone looking to understand local demographics of migration in the run - up to the general election
' the news piles more pressure on cameron , whose promise to curb immigration has been shattered , last week it emerged annual net migration â the measure of how many people have come into uk minus those who have left â has reached nearly 300,000 - a record
official figures : last year 300,000 migrants arrived in uk , with 190,000 of them travelled from outside the eu net migration from the eu hit 162,000 in the year ending september 2014 , up from 130,000 in the previous year a total of 37,000 romanian and bulgarian arrived in the uk , up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months
