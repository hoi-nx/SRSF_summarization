streetwise urban ants from new york city have developed a taste for the kind of diet frequently chosen by their human neighbours
tests on insects collected from pavements and traffic islands in manhattan show that their bodies contain the molecular fingerprint of junk food
the same was not true of more genteel ants that frequent leafy park areas
the scientists tested more than 100 ants representing 21 species from dozens of sites in the big apple
all animals , including humans , take in carbon from food , but the atomic ' strain ' of the element found in the ants was specifically associated with corn and sugar cane
corn and refined sugar are both abundant in human processed foods where they are used as sweeteners and flavour enhancers
evidence of the signature carbon - 13 isotope indicated that the ants had adopted a junk food diet

lasius emarginatus , only identified in new york city in the past five years , was also found in high numbers on manhattan 's pavements and traffic islands
