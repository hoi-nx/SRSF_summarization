a coalition government made up of labour and the snp could break up the uk , sir john warned last night
with the result of may âs general election looking very close , the former conservative prime minister said that a labour - snp coalition would be a â lethal cocktail â and â a tragedy in the making â
polls suggest that , with no party likely to win enough seats to govern alone , a labour - snp coalition is a likely outcome from the election
a coalition government made up of labour and the snp could break up the uk , sir john ( pictured ) warned last night sir john , who was prime minister between 1990 to 1997 , last night urged ed miliband to â summon the courage â to formally rule out any deal
sir john said : â the snp would enter into any agreement with labour with one overriding aim : to break up the uk
â if the outcome of the general election is inconclusive , will they refuse to govern with the support of a party whose principal aim is to break up the uk ? â sir john , who was prime minister between 1990 to 1997 , last night urged ed miliband ( pictured ) to â summon the courage â to formally rule out any deal as prime minister , sir john warned that devolution could lead to scotland âs independence
â ed miliband is facing increasing demands from senior labour figures to rule out a power - sharing deal with the snp
but there is concern that he may only be prepared to rule out a formal coalition â leaving open the possibility of the snp propping up a labour - led government in key votes in exchange for concessions to scotland
