a terror attack in uk is a â price we should be willing to pay â if it means spy agencies do not have access to masses of personal data , a human rights group has claimed
isabella sankey , liberty âs director of policy , said it was better to let â some things happen â than to give security services â privacy - infringing measures â designed to catch extremists plotting atrocities in the uk and overseas
the claim that privacy should be put before national security was condemned as â unacceptable â as a report revealed the extent of snooping by gchq
parliament 's isc found that agents at gchq , the government listening post , monitor ' large numbers of items ' using ' bulk interception ' powers to uncover terror threats
but the committee dismissed the claims that gchq had â blanket coverage â of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages
it said gchq can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a â tiny fraction â of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process
isabella sankey , liberty âs director of policy , said some terror attacks succeeding was a â price we should be willing to pay â rather than have gchq use â bulk collection â techniques but this probably still means that thousands of texts , emails and facebook messages are read every day by government spies
giving evidence on behalf of liberty , miss isabella sankey was asked by the committee in october if she opposed bulk collection even if it was used in a â targeted â way to â prevent plots and contribute to national security â
that is the price you pay to live in a free society
' labour mp hazel blears , a member of the isc branded liberty 's views â unacceptable â
pointing to the comments , ms hazel blears said : â their view was even if terrorist plots happened they were not prepared to allow this capability to collect information whereas that âs not a view we take
â labour mp hazel blears said it was â unacceptable â to suggest capability should not be used to prevent a terror attack the isc report was ordered in the wake of when the claims from whistle - blower edward snowden broke in june 2013 the long - awaited report into uk 's spy agencies blanks out almost every detail which would reveal the true extent of the government 's state snooping programme
all of these cables - carrying people 's emails , facebook messages and other communications - can potentially be hacked by gchq , the committee reveals
' it says : ' fewer than * * * of * * * per cent of the items that transit the internet in one day are ever selected to be read by a gchq analyst
yesterday miss isabella sankey accused the committee of attempting to put words in her mouth
the report says a single law is needed to keep in check the powers of the intelligence agencies to snoop on private communications , because the current legal framework governing the likes of gchq , mi5 and mi6 is ' unnecessarily complicated ' and ' lacks transparency '
' open rights group executive director jim killock added : ' the isc should have apologised to the nation for their failure to inform parliament about how far gchq 's powers have grown
