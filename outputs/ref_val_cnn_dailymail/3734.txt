doctors working for isis have been ordered to charge 15,000 syrian pounds for a caesarean childbirth operation , the equivalent of two months salary for the average syrian worker
jihadi brides like these , posing with a bmw in syrian , wo n't be allowed a caesarean operation if they need one to give birth unless they can afford 15,000 syrian pounds - two months salary for the average worker a surgical team performing a caesarean
some clerics consider the procedure too western and decadent but the high fees will force women who ca n't afford the operations to endure painful childbirth
a written order published in the northern syrian province of deir az-zor states : ' in order to assist the believers from the sons of islamic who are working in the medical corps to support their brothers from the poor and others besides them from the muslims populace , and with the desire to keep the course of medical work removed from arbitrary whim
' there is growing opposition among islamic clerics to western trends in gynaecology developments and in particular to mothers who wish to have a pain - free childbirth sometimes referred to as ' too posh to push '
one scholar has recently claimed that the rise in caesarean operations in the middle east is part of a plot against muslims mothers
the wives of isis fighters like these will struggle to get pregnant again if they have a caesarean , according to one cleric who calls the procedure a ' plot against muslims ' sheikh muhammad ibn saalih al uthaymeen has ruled that muslims mothers should n't need any decadent pain - relieving assistance in the delivery of their babies
' i am afraid that this may be a plot against the muslims , because the more births take place in this manner , the more the skin of the abdomen is weakened and pregnancy becomes more dangerous for the woman , and she becomes unable to get pregnant
