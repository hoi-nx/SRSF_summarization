swansea manager monk believes the only way is up for tim sherwood as the two coaching course mates prepare to cross tactical swords at villa park
monk and new aston villa boss tim sherwood got to know each other on the same wales pro-licence coaching course but the practical takes precedence over the theory on saturday with three premier league points at stake
aston villa manager tim sherwood is preparing for the visit of former coaching coursemate monk tim sherwood has enjoyed a great start to life since taking over the villa park managerial hot - seat ' he 's gone in there and lifted the confidence in the group , ' monk said at his pre-match press conference
monk believes himself and tim sherwood are very much their own men despite their similarities ' they 're fighting for their lives and we know this game is vitally important to them but it is the same for us
' the pair have both been labelled with the tag of bright , young british managers , even if the 46 - year - old tim sherwood is actually 10 years older than monk who celebrated his first anniversary as swansea boss last month
swansea manager monk observes his players during the training session at the fairwood training centre but monk says while certain similarities exist between them they are very much their own men with notable differences
' when tim sherwood came in at tottenham he was already within the club at that time , albeit within a different coaching role , ' monk said
monk believes the former tottenham boss will certainly take aston villa forward in the future ' he 's had a fantastic start and i am sure he will take aston villa forward after being unlucky at tottenham
' swansea are seeking to recover from back - to - back league defeats and will come across a former favourite at villa park in the shape of sinclair
sinclair will come up against his former swansea teammates during the game at villa park but sinclair has thrived under tim sherwood with three goals in five games and monk admits it is satisfying to see his former teammate doing well after such a difficult time in his career
