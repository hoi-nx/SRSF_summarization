italian fashion designer stefano gabbana and elton john are in a war of words on social media , calling for boycotts of each other 's work
the argument stems from comments about in - vitro fertilization in panorama , in which gabbana and longtime collaborator stefano gabbana spoke about " synthetic " children born from " rented " wombs
elton john , who has two children with husband david furnish through ivf , issued a strong repudiation of the statements on sunday and pledged to boycott the stefano gabbana fashion line
in response , gabbana defended his " freedom to speak " and called on fans to boycott elton john
sir elton john appears to be winning the social media war with the hashtag # boycottdolcegabbana , which by monday morning had been used more than 35,000 times on twitter since elton john invoked it on sunday
by comparison , gabbana 's # boycotteltonjohn has been used just 1,600 times on twitter , according to social media search tool topsy
and shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at ivf - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people , both straight and gay , to fulfill their dream of having children , " elton john said sunday on instagram
i shall never wear stefano gabbana ever again
tennis star martina navratilova tweeted her support for elton john 's post , saying " my stefano gabbana shirts are going in the bin â do n't want anyone to wear them
the comments from stefano gabbana struck some as hypocritical coming from a couple that was romantically involved until 2005 ( they continued working together after the breakup )
" gabbana was quick to react to this controversy , calling elton john a " fascist " in an instagram comment that was later deleted , according to cnn affiliate tgcom24
" you have every right to say what you want , especially as you were n't disrespectful nor immature like elton john was
" gabbana issued a statement saying he and stefano gabbana had not intended to judge others
stefano gabbana also defended his views in statement and said he was not applying them to other people
