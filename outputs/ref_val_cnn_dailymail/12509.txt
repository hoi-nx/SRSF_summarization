an indiana jury sentenced a woman who says she had a miscarriage to 20 years in prison
purvi patel was later charged with feticide and felony neglect of a dependent , though these charges are decidedly contradictory
on the other hand , " felony neglect of a dependent " requires delivering a live fetus and then neglecting it
purvi patel is the second pregnant woman to be charged under indiana 's anti-choice " feticide " law
in 2011 , shuai was charged with feticide after she attempted to commit suicide when she was eight months pregnant
still , both cases presented troubled pregnant women who needed help from medical authorities and their government
but indiana 's harsh anti-abortion laws , and the broader culture that seeks to control the decisions pregnant women can make about their own bodies , make women far less likely to reach out for this help
conservatives like to say that women are the " victims of abortion " and that laws such as the indiana " feticide " measure are intended to " protect " them
years ago , the president of the anti-choice susan b. anthony list made assurances that the specter of women being prosecuted and jailed under anti-choice laws was nothing more than fearmongering by pro-choice activists
" and in fact , the indiana " feticide " law was plainly intended to criminalize " knowing or intentional termination of another 's pregnancy
" but there 's no escaping the reality it has been used to turn pregnant women into criminals
those who care about the rights of pregnant women should be deeply concerned
in shuai 's case , it was presumed that the intent of her attempted suicide was to terminate her pregnancy and thus she was charged with feticide
laws like indiana 's and cases like purvi patel 's do n't change that
what they do is make women hide , avoid medical attention and put their lives at even greater risk
ask yourself : in the case of purvi patel , even if she did intend to self - abort and used black market drugs to do so , and if she indeed delivered a live fetus , would n't we want to live in a society where she would bring that baby to the hospital for life - saving medical attention rather than be so afraid of prosecution that she threw it in a dumpster ? purvi patel is reportedly appealing her conviction
