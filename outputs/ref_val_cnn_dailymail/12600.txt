five full weeks into hernandez 's murder trial , prosecutors have called 77 witnesses
but this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against hernandez , who has pleaded not guilty to killing lloyd in 2013
a dna analyst from the massachusetts state police crime lab said she found that hernandez 's dna matched the dna taken from a marijuana joint found near lloyd 's body at the crime scene
the dna analyst , biagiotti , testified to finding a partial dna match from hernandez on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the enterprise rental car office
the office manager at the rental car office , smyth , testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the nissan altima returned by hernandez on june 17 , 2013
inside hernandez 's downward spiral it was revealed by sultan that the state never submitted the gum for dna testing
hernandez is seen on surveillance video buying gum , and he also offered some to smyth
hernandez 's family was in court on friday after a week 's absence
hernandez 's mother , terri hernandez , told cnn ' that she thought friday " went very well " for him
testimony this week also focused on fingerprints from hernandez and lloyd that were found inside the rented nissan altima
state trooper david mackin , a fingerprint expert with the massachusetts state police crime scene services , reported finding the fingerprints of wallace and ortiz in a chrysler 300 that hernandez rented
but no prints were found on the .22 - caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near hernandez 's home
hernandez is charged with illegal possession of that gun
another key find : tire treads of the rear passenger tire of the nissan altima matched a tire impression found at the crime scene , according to court testimony
it showed lloyd smiling and sitting in the driver 's seat of the black suburban that hernandez loaned him
just weeks before hernandez was arrested and charged with murder , he toured rental apartments with patriot employee anderson , real estate agent barbara scardino testified thursday
she said she was initially contacted by anderson to find some apartments to show hernandez
this means the patriot staff knew about hernandez 's second home
in early may of 2013 , she showed anderson and hernandez four apartments
hernandez settled on the two - bedroom condo in franklin , massachusetts , referred to as his " flophouse
" hernandez 's home in north attleboro and his condo in franklin are each about 15 minutes away from the stadium
hernandez 's franklin neighbor , bailey , also took the stand , telling jurors that she met another man that also stayed in the condo
it was hernandez 's friend wallace
bailey paid close attention to hernandez and wallace , seeing them come and go during their short stay there
during her one attempt to talk to hernandez and say hello , she says he sort of grunted back , calling it a " nondescript " noise
darrow went on to testify to multiple calls between sprint cell phone client wallace and lloyd , hernandez and hernandez 's fiancee , jenkins , the night before and morning of lloyd 's death
prosecutors say they believe hernandez was using his fiancee 's phone to call wallace
jenkins granted immunity darrow also explained how cell sites ( or towers ) in the sprint network tracked the phone calls , and thus tracked the direction they were driving
another cell phone representative also testified
t-mobile engineer quinn testified about the data transmissions from lloyd 's cell phone beginning on june 17 , 2013 , at 2:32 a.m. that 's when lloyd was picked up outside his home in the nissan altima
assistant district attorney patrick bomberg methodically walked quinn through data transmissions received on lloyd 's cell phone via multiple cell towers along the route he traveled from dorchester to the industrial park in north attleboro
