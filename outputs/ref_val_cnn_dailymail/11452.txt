if an englishman âs house is his castle , his garden shed is his fortress : a refuge that has nurtured many a seedling and saved many a marriage
but today a mere shed is not enough
so meet the Â£ 22,000 solardome â an eden project for the burbs
it âs the ultimate uber - shed , a grand , permanent 20ft - across structure made from glass
hundreds of these and similar egg - shaped conservatories are springing up around the country â and now john lewis is about to start selling the smaller - scale Â£ 599 garden igloo
if it âs good enough for john lewis , it âs good enough for me
while i can happily whip up braised saffron sweetbreads or layer a ceviche , diy remains a strange and alien country
ikea is , truly , a four - letter word
so it was with some trepidation that , yesterday morning , i took delivery of an enormous , corpse - heavy cardboard box , dispatched â with typical teutonic efficiency â from a berlin factory in just 24 hours
grand : egg - shaped conservatories are springing up around the country like the solardome ( pictured ) which is a permanent 20ft - across structure made from glass it might be called an igloo but , much to my daughter âs disappointment , you do nât have to hand - carve blocks of pack ice , which would have been undeniably tricky in dorset at the end of march
but even with a set of faultlessly efficient instructions â the poles are all numbered , the instructions straightforward , albeit tedious â i was a worried man
a breezy promotional video shows some beanie - hatted hipster nonchalantly putting his igloo up in just 30 minutes , but it took me two - and - a - quarter hours , slowed by the shaming fact i clearly ca nât tell the difference between a hexagon and a pentagon and , as a result , got two of my joints muddled up , wreaking havoc
â cue some furious , ill - tempered dismantling followed by a quick first - aid break as i clumsily managed to all but deglove my finger unscrewing one of these stubborn joints and spattered the white doorway with blood : not a great look
inspiration ? the conservatories are stylistically similar to the maze featured on classic game show the crystal maze there was one last glitch as my wife and i grumpily managed to slide on the skin - tight pvc cover , inside - out
this is arguably the trickiest section : imagine trying to coax a single cover over a double duvet while swearing â and sweating â under plastic
it was then time â with help from sherborne âs castle gardens â to dress my new man cave : an orange tree , a fig and a fern , table and chairs , a ghetto - blaster and , more crucially , a wine - cooler
sales in germany have been relatively modest â about 1,500 last year â but chris dimpker , head of marketing , says : â our product is 100 per cent weather - proof and really suits the uk
you have warmer winters and cooler summers â this multi-purpose dome is tailor - made for those conditions
with the igloo finally up , it 's time to dress the dome : cue pot plants , a hi - fi and of course , a wine cooler
its prices start from Â£ 8,000
gloucestershire âs dome garden â recently voted the uk âs best glamping site â is made up of 11 vast geodesic domes
