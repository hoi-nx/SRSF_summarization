just a week before the grand jury decided not to indict wilson for the shooting death of brown , its request to make a public statement about the case was rejected by a judge
the twelve ferguson grand jurors were denied the opportunity to speak by st. louis county circuit court judge carolyn whittington , according to court documents filed on friday
the documents surfaced during the ongoing lawsuit involving a member of the grand jury , who filed a memorandum earlier this month fighting to speak publicly about the controversial case
the unnamed juror , referenced as grand juror doe , has claimed attorney robert mcculloch , who prosecuted the case , lied to the public
in a letter from judge carolyn whittington to robert mcculloch on november 17 , she explains initially she said yes to the request , but then did legal research and decided the final response was no , according to yahoo news
it is unknown what the jurors were going to say in their statement , and documents from friday do not detail when they initially made the request
' the grand jury sat for three months hearing evidence and a verdict was released on november 24 , 2014 not indicting wilson ( above ) for the shooting death of brown in a memorandum filed last month by the juror , he claims robert mcculloch presented evidence over the course of the trial that suggested brown ( above ) was the aggressor and wilson did nothing wrong judge carolyn whittington continued : ' the supreme court has spoken on the issue of the power of the grand jury
' in the documents filed on friday , robert mcculloch states his argument in support of reasons for the dismissal of the case involving the grand juror
the individual filed suit in january accusing robert mcculloch of lying during the november 24 press conference when he said ' all grand jurors believed that there was no support for any charges '
