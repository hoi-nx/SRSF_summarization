speaking two languages really could give you a split personality , researchers have found
previously research has even found those who are bilingual even see colours differently
researchers say that speaking in another language can change our personality
' the extent to which language affects this process has been the focus of a long - standing debate : do different languages cause their speakers to behave differently ? , ' the team wrote
' here , we show that fluent german - english bilinguals categorize motion events according to the grammatical constraints of the language in which they operate
athanasopoulos and colleagues were interested in a particular difference in how english and german speakers treat events
as a result , german speakers tend to specify the beginnings , middles , and ends of events , but english speakers often leave out the endpoints and focus in on the action
looking at the same scene , for example , german speakers might say , ' a man leaves the house and walks to the store , ' whereas an english speaker would just say , ' a man is walking
' first , as predicted from cross-linguistic differences in motion encoding , participants functioning in a german testing context prefer to match events on the basis of motion completion to a greater extent than participants in an english context
a total of 262 participants could communicate in at least one language other than english
' second , when participants suffer verbal interference in english , their categorization behavior is congruent with that predicted for german and when we switch the language of interference to german , their categorization becomes congruent with that predicted for english
