prince prince william arrived in beijing on sunday -- the first visit to china by a senior member of the british royal family in three decades -- and he might have been expecting a dose of culture shock
from television shows and etiquette lessons to private schools and mock tudor housing developments , china has been embracing british culture with a passion
china viewers are captivated in their millions by shows like " sherlock holmes " and " downton abbey , " with the former 's star , benedict cumberbatch , so popular he has his own china nickname -- curly blessing
and the obsession with british culture has taken a bizarre turn in thames town , a housing development on the outskirts of shanghai that resembles a quaint english town , complete with replica red telephone booths
it 's crucial that prince prince william capitalizes on these cultural ties during his high - profile visit , which is being viewed as the first real test of his diplomatic skills
" it will tell us something about how he will handle one of the most important diplomatic relationships when he comes to throne , " said brown , a professor of china politics at the university of sydney and a former british diplomat
china spent 17 million pounds on british tv programs and formats in 2013 , a 40 % increase on the year before , but they form a small part of the overall trade balance
when the queen and prince philip spent time in china in 1986 , the queen 's husband caused offense when he told a group of british students : " if you stay here much longer , you 'll all be slitty - eyed
" prince charles , prince william 's father , has never visited china but described the country 's leaders as " appalling old waxworks " during his visit to hong kong in 1997
prince prince william will visit beijing 's forbidden city , attend the china premiere of the british - produced children 's animated movie " paddington " in shanghai and launch a campaign to celebrate british innovation during the three - day trip
but the relationship between the british and china comes laden with " stacks of historic baggage , " brown adds , and the prince will have to tread carefully , particularly over the former colony of hong kong , where the push for a free vote has strained ties between british and china , the current landlords
what 's more , it 's not clear how much " star power " prince prince william has in china , especially without his glamorous wife duchess of cambridge , who at eight months pregnant wo n't make the trip , and his young son george
