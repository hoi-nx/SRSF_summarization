sen. cruz , r-texas , made news this week when he told cnn 's dana bash that he would get his health care through obamacare
previously , cruz 's family was covered under his wife 's policy through her employer , the investment bank goldman
but with her husband 's presidential candidacy underway , heidi cruz has taken a leave without pay
so she has lost her goldman health benefits
the story went viral , in part because cruz once engineered a partial government shutdown to try to kill obamacare
as part of his crusade , cruz conducted a 21 - hour talkathon on the senate floor , during which he read dr. seuss ' classic " green eggs and ham
" spoiler alert : " green eggs and ham " ends with the protagonist actually trying the food he thought he hated -- and liking it
now that cruz is likely to try obamacare , my guess is he will have a similar experience
so , with apologies to dr. seuss -- who would no doubt have found a way to rhyme " president bar " with " obamacare " -- here is my updated version of " green eggs and ham
" president barpresident bari do not likethat president bar do you likeobamacare ? i do not like it , president bar.i do not likeobamacare
