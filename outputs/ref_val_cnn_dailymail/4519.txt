afghanistan president ghani told the congress on wednesday that the isis terror army has begun to infiltrate his country ' like a dangerous virus , ' and warned his fellow muslims not to be romanced by its ' anger and hatred
' ghani said afghanistan is the new ' frontline ' for the self - proclaimed isis , which has been ' sending advance guards to southern and western afghanistan to test for vulnerabilities
' so far , he told a joint meeting of congress , ' afghanistan 's people have rejected the allure of violent islam
' leaders , intellectuals , and those many millions of muslims who believe that islam is a religion of tolerance and virtue must find their voice
' ghani insisted that ' islam is a religion of peace , ' and praised the muslim world for its ' gloriously tolerant and inquisitive past
' his speech came against the backdrop of a spreading islamist radicalism that has helped isis â which he referred to by its native name ' daesh ' â conquer large swaths of iraqi and syrian teritory by leveraging a fundamentalist brand of islam as a pretext for military might
' at the same time he thanked us taxpayers for supporting his country 's post- 9/11 resurgence and urged congress to keep the money flowing â to a point
' and in a throwaway line that was n't in the prepared text that circulated among lawmakers wednesday morning , he chuckled : ' we 're not going to be the lazy uncle joe
tennessee corker sen. corker , who chairs the senate foreign relations committee , said wednesday that the us has ' a vested interest in the ability of afghanistan to secure and stabilize their country after the investments of the us people and the extraordinary sacrifices of our service members
' troop drawdown ? president obama said tuesday that he would n't order the quick military withdrawal he was expected to institute in the wake of the official end of us combat in afghanistan at the end of 2014 thank you : ghani thanked us over and over for supporting and stabilizing his country in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , perpetrated by al-qaeda terrorists who had taken refuge there ' with the bitter exception of the aberrant taliban regime , islam has traditionally been inclusive and reflective , not violent and angry , ' he said
' that must not be permitted ! it can not be permitted ! it will not be permitted ! ' ghani faces the challenge of establishing afghanistan 's military and civil self - sufficiency as president obama supervises a slowed - down but inevitable drawdown of the us military forces that have kept the country from falling apart since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001
' we owe a profound debt to the soldiers who have lost limbs to buried bombs , to the brave veterans , and to the families who tragically lost their loved ones to the enemy âs cowardly acts of terror , ' ghani said wednesday
' ' never again will our country be a host to terrorists
