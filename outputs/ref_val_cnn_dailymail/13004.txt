boston the defense in the trial of boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev rested tuesday afternoon after presenting only four witnesses
the defense case lasted less than two days , while the prosecution presented more than 90 witnesses over the course of a month
federal prosecutors rested their case monday with grisly testimony about how the bomb dzhokhar tsarnaev placed near the marathon 's finish line tore through the bodies of 8 - year - old martin richard and lingzi lu , a 23 - year - old grad student
a second bomb placed by dzhokhar tsarnaev 's brother , tamerlan , killed krystle campbell , a 29 - year - old restaurant manager
the short presentation in the sensational trial was n't surprising , given that dzhokhar tsarnaev 's attorney , judy clarke , acknowledged during opening statements that " it was him , " referring to her client 's culpability
testimony ended with an fbi fingerprint investigator who talked about numerous pieces of evidence with tamerlan 's fingerprints and not dzhokhar tsarnaev 's
similar searches were not found on dzhokhar tsarnaev 's computer
jurors first will be asked to determine whether dzhokhar tsarnaev is guilty of 30 counts
in the penalty phase , jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors , such as the heinousness of the crime , versus mitigating factors , such as dzhokhar tsarnaev 's family history and his youth
the defense , which began calling witnesses monday afternoon , has argued that dzhokhar tsarnaev , known to friends as jahar , fell under the sway of his more extremist older brother after their parents moved back to russia
prosecutors william weinreb , aloke chakravarty , nadine pellegrini and steve mellin presented witnesses who told the story of dzhokhar tsarnaev 's alleged scheme with tamerlan to build and detonate pressure cooker bombs as an act of jihad
prosecutors delved into dzhokhar tsarnaev 's text messages and twitter posts and showed jurors militant material found in his laptop , phone and ipod
jurors saw photos of pressure cooker parts , fuses , christmas lights and other bombmaking materials found in the dzhokhar tsarnaev family 's cambridge apartment , where tamerlan lived with his wife and child
and they showed security surveillance videos of the brothers in the crowd near the finish line : in one , dzhokhar tsarnaev can be seen blending in with the crowd behind the richard family for four minutes
he can be seen jumping out of his leased mercedes suv at a gas pump and running across the screen as dzhokhar tsarnaev casually strolls through the store , picking up an armload of snacks
jurors also viewed a boat in which dzhokhar tsarnaev sought refuge during the ensuing manhunt , which put boston under a " shelter in place " lockdown
