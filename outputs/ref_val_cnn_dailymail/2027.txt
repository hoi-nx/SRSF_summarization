picking up their copy of the parish news , residents of the town of westhoughton were probably expecting the usual mix of announcements , reminders and perhaps a page or two of genteel religious discourse
instead they were treated to five pages of a minister ranting about his wife âs adulterous affair
james wilson , 54 , shamed his wife , alyson , 56 , in a 2,000 - word article that left many elderly worshippers in shock
james wilson , 54 , churchwarden of st bartholomew 's c of e church in westhoughton near bolton , has accused his wife alyson ( pictured together ) of having an affair in an extraordinary rant in a parish magazine mr james wilson claimed his wife alyson had committed the ' most heinous ' crime of any marriage by leaving him for her ex-police officer boyfriend in the 2,273 - word tirade , which he published in the parish magazine he edits in the piece , entitled heartfelt story , mr james wilson , a lay minister , accused her of conducting an affair behind his back and then abandoning him to set up home with her ex-policeman lover
he begins by telling parishioners : â sadly , i have to report to you , my wife of 20 years recently ended our marriage and not in an amicable or hearty way
â she was constantly out till all hours most nights , coming home with flowers , even a teddy bear that went to bed with her and sat on my bed 24/7
it was blatantly obvious she was having an affair â¦ and she came home from him and got in my bed
' how cold is that dear reader ? it 's heartless , cruel and just not on
' mr james wilson , who is a lay minister at st bartholomew âs , a c of e church near bolton , wrote in the westhoughton parish magazine : â i am bereft , numb , angry and disgusted with my estranged wife , a woman i have loved , worshipped and adored for 20 years
mr james wilson published the rant in the westhoughton parish magazine , which has now been retracted by the church for being ' totally inappropriate ' â i understand relationships end â¦ but to make the decision on your own , then go and jump into the first bed that comes along is wrong
the parish magazine has never been so controversial
â mr james wilson , who joined the church in 1995 , became a church warden in 2008 and runs the church youth club
in 2010 he was made a lay minister and has been editor of the parish magazine for several years
he has been married to alyson for 20 years and the couple have a son tom , 18 , while mr james wilson has a daughter , emily , 28 , from a previous relationship
mr james wilson said his wife alyson , 56 , would sneak out to meet her lover before returning to the marital bed
he said he wrote the five - page rant to parish worshippers because he wanted to ' highlight the impact adultery ' â but she lost the right to tell me what to do as soon as she jumped into bed with another
â mr james wilson - who has another child , emily , 26 , from a previous relationship - said he now ' regrets the turmoil caused ' but published the article because he wanted to highlight his wife 's alleged cheating
mr james wilson , who has two children , claimed the marriage breakdown had taken its toll on both him and the couple 's 18 - year - old son tom ( pictured together )
' mr james wilson , who joined st. bartholomew 's church in 1995 and became a churchwarden in 2008 , said he is now planning to issue divorce proceedings
he said : ' the church are saying i 've brought them into disrepute but i 've worked for the parish magazine for 15 years and the majority of my stories have been happy
mr james wilson , a lay minister at st bartholomew 's c of e church in westhoughton near bolton ( pictured ) , described his wife as ' heartless and cruel ' and said he was now looking to issue divorce proceedings ' my whole intention was to help other people in an adulteress relationship
' i had to go to bed at night knowing my wife was in bed with someone else
a spokesman for the diocese of manchester said the church was â supporting james wilson through his personal difficulties
it was totally inappropriate for him to vent his hurt and anger â¦ in the parish magazine
