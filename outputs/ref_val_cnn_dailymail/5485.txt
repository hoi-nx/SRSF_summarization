it did nât take long for us to get used to googling things , instead of looking them up in books
free blippar , the world âs largest image recognition and augmented reality platform , has re-launched its app to change the way we search for things and interact with the world around us
users can ' blipp objects , such as cds and adverts to access information about them online and could soon blipp any object , such as apples ( shown ) users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to â look â at any object and use the image to search for it online in the long - term
when a user â blipps â one of these items or images , they will be presented with a range of information about it
for example , if they blipp an album cover , they may be presented with access to videos of the band , a source to buy tickets to an upcoming concert , details on what people are saying about them on twitter or photos of the band itself
when an object is detected , users will see augmented reality content , which could take the form of a video , reviews or related information
the first blippable objects on the new app will be cds , dvds and film posters , but more will be added
from inputting keywords to digging through pages of links to access information , this search behaviour is limited by vocabulary and literacy
free blippar âs image recognition service aims to go beyond language to allow consumers to pull timely , relevant information directly from the environment around them
users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to â look â at any object and use the image to search for it , and related information online
â the company claims that free blippar âs platform allows users to access information faster than using traditional online search methods
last year , free blippar unveiled the first image recognition and tracking app for google glass wearers that shows videos , webpages , and more , simply by looking at a picture
