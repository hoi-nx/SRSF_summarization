proud pose : tory poster boy afzal , in ceremonial army uniform , whose political career is in ruins afzal was to be the tories â poster boy at the general election
it is a spectacular fall from grace for a politician from a humble background who seemed set for high office with the tory but is now a victim of his over-reaching political ambition
afzal was the first ethnic minority candidate to be chosen for this year âs poll , and has been pictured alongside prime minister david cameron , chancellor osborne and the archbishop of canterbury justin welby
despite his ambitions , afzal â who is married with two teenage children â has not been afraid to criticise tory bosses
afzal was brought up in the deprived black country town of smethwick , where the tories had once infamously used openly racist slogans on election leaflets
his fortunes changed in 2001 when he was selected to attend training at the royal military academy at sandhurst
he rose to the rank of captain and saw active service in iraqi and did three tours in afghanistan
