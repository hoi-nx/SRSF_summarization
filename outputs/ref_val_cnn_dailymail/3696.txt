hefty bonus : jenkins , who receives Â£ 5.5m a year , was immediately accused of being â out of touch â over the ' pie in the sky ' comments the boss of barclays has called for an end to free banking , claiming the controversial move would be a â step forward â for customers
jenkins , who said he would not make the first move in case it scared off customers , was immediately accused of being â out of touch â
his comments came as the high street giant unveiled another big pay - day for staff
mr jenkins â total package more than tripled from Â£ 1.6million in 2013 to Â£ 5.5million last year
this shows how out of touch mr jenkins is , as so many customers value free bank accounts
â mr jenkins came under fire last year when he argued that closing bank branches would lead to a â better customer experience â as current account holders are increasingly banking online
james daley of consumer group fairer finance said his latest comments were â pie in the sky â , adding : â to try and scrap the free in - credit banking system we have now would be incredibly unpopular
but mr jenkins has the support of senior regulators including bank of england deputy governor andrew bailey , who has called free banking a â dangerous myth â â partly due to the confusing array of hefty charges for the millions who go overdrawn
the comments came as the high street giant unveiled another big pay - day for staff ( file picture ) the row came as mr jenkins was forced to defend his decision to accept a Â£ 1.1million bonus for last year , despite cutting 14,000 jobs
