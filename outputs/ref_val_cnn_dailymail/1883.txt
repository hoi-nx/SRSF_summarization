a serving ferguson police officer revealed that he broke down in tears after he read the department of justice report which condemned his force and said : â i just close my eyes and wish it was nât like that â
in an exclusive interview with daily mail online he said they were all standing behind embattled ferguson police chief jackson but were fearful they would lose their jobs if the department was shut down
he said : â people who do nât know me see me and then they hate me
i âm not going to hate people because they are venting
but a serving officer from the force said : ' we are not bad cops
' concern : outgoing attorney general holder focused the report on relations between police and citizens central figures : the shooting of michael brown ( left ) by officer darren wilson ( right ) in august created a firestorm over policing in ferguson and beyond
totemic : the image of officer darren wilson standing beside the body of michael brown became central to the controversy which surrounded the case the officer spoke out as the family of michael brown said they would file a wrongful death lawsuit over their son âs death
the 18 - year - old was shot dead by former ferguson officer darren wilson last august in a killing which sparked widespread looting across the city
the landmark department of justice report that was commissioned as a result painted a devastating portrait of a police force which unfairly targeted blacks for traffic stops and arrests
one ferguson city employee has been fired and two are under investigation but darren wilson did not face charges
as he released the report attorney general holder said that the conclusions were ' searing '
and a community where all of these conditions , unlawful practices , and constitutional violations have not only severely undermined the public trust , eroded police legitimacy , and made local residents less safe â but created an intensely charged atmosphere where people feel under assault and under siege by those charged to serve and protect them ' if michael brown 's family win their civil lawsuit they could get a payout or the city of ferguson could reach a settlement before it goes to trial
but the official report said that michael brown did not use the words or the gesture
violence : the decision of the grand jury not to indict darren wilson was followed by rioting , arson and looting however another finding of the department of justice report was the michael brown did not have his hands up when darren wilson shot him , a finding which holder confirmed
' hands up , do n't shoot ' became the mantra of the protest movement after some witnesses said that they saw michael brown with his arms raised
speaking to daily mail online , the ferguson police officer said the report misrepresented not just the force , but the city
â the statistics in the report are scathing : whilst ferguson is 67 per cent black , just three of the 53 officers on their police force are non-white , or six per cent
suing : michael brown 's parents - lesley mcspadden , his mother and michael brown snr , his father , are set to take their son 's death to court in a wrongful death suit defended : the officer defending his colleagues - one of whom is pictured above during the protests in the aftermath of the decision not to charge michael brown - said : ' we are good cops
another issue raised in the report was how black residents were disproportionately targeted for traffic tickets which contributes to the expected court revenue of $ 2.4 million this year
according to the report residents are seen â less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue , â the officer said : â there are guys who write a lot of tickets , yeah , but i do nât think it was any different from other departments
