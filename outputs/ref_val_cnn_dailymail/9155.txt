the night we lost to bangladesh i found myself staring at the floor in disbelief and i was trying to work out in my own mind what happened
did we lack a bit of experience ? you look at the big teams here at this world cup and most of the players have played a lot more one - day internationals than us
there âs always a temptation to call for change at times like this but my gut feeling would be to keep this group of players together to get them that experience over the next four years before the next world cup
we do nât play as much one - day and twenty20 cricket as others because of our schedules but we have to find a way to be honest so we can get that experience
you learn how to win games in tricky positions and the pressure of winning a game for england is completely different to doing it for your county
stuart broad ( bottom ) lays on the floor during england 's world cup pool a defeat to bangladesh on monday do nât blame the coach it âs unfair to pin the blame on peter moores
there was no reason why we could nât have beaten bangladesh on that flat wicket at the adelaide oval
england coach peter moores ( left ) has come under strong criticism for their early world cup exit below my best it âs stating the obvious to say i have nât taken the amount of wickets i would have liked in this tournament but it âs never the definitive way to judge how you have bowled
so against bangladesh i changed that and tried to bowl a bit more as if it was a test and looked for movement
stuart broad admits he has n't been happy with his productivity levels in terms of taking wickets at the world cup the obsession with statistics i really do nât know where that has come from
in my eight or nine years of england touring this trip has seen fewer meetings than ever before
the fast bowler adds that despite talk of stats there have been fewer team meetings than ever before moving on it âs still very raw going out of this world cup at this stage and that frustration and anger is still there
another book i read recently was roy keane âs and he âd say that if manchester united lost on a saturday when he played he âd be embarrassed to leave his home on a sunday
stuart broad says england ca n't afford to sulk on their world cup disappointment with a busy fixture list ahead a one - day future i âm only 28 and i want to continue playing one - day cricket for england
i âve not shown enough quality in this tournament but the next world cup is in england and my record is good at home
you ca nât say what âs going to happen in the next four years but i âd certainly like to play a key role leading up to the next one
they say a bowler âs peak is from 28 to 33 so why would nât i want to play ? i know we are the only team who plays all - year round and that means a lot of cricket but i try to give myself the best opportunity i can to play for england as often as i can
that âs because i want to play for england and i want to keep on doing that in all forms
at 28 , stuart broad ( right ) aims to play in the next world cup for england which will be on home soil a modern approach we âve got the players to produce the modern brand of cricket we are seeing in one - day cricket , of course we have
those guys will have a significant number of one - day caps when they play in the next world cup and that will give them more expertise and more confidence
i think the right 15 players were in this world cup squad and we can only look at ourselves as to why we have nât justified the faith placed in us
stuart broad says moeen ali ( right ) is an example of the modern brand of one - day cricket england has to stick with
