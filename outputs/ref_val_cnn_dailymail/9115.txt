in hindsight the turning point in the tournament for ireland came against south africa , against whom they suffered a mammoth 201 - run loss
a shock 29 - run ( d / l ) victory over south africa ensured the match against ireland would be a straight knockout , after the west indies guaranteed their safe passage to the quarter - finals with an easy victory against the uae earlier in the day

the equation for pakistan was simple , win or tie against ireland and they would be through and sarfraz ahmed and shehzad âs 120 - run first wicket partnership took them a large way towards their target

it âs unlikely to be of much comfort to the associate side with their future in the competition unknown but ireland along with the other associate sides â scotland , afghanistan and the uae â showed in the past four weeks that the icc will truly miss them if the icc has its way
