lubitz , the co-pilot who killed 150 people when he is believed to have deliberately crashed a plane into the alps , could have killed more if he had realised his dream to fly larger planes for long haul flights
lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the germanwings into a rocky ravine of the alps , locking the pilot out of the cockpit as he put the plane into a descent - killing all 149 people on board and himself
the 27 - year - old was said to be a keen glider and an ambitious pilot , with hopes to continue his career by handling larger planes that carried hundreds of passengers
' mr woiton , who comes from lubitz 's home town of montabaur , said the young pilot had told him he dreamed of flying boeing 747s and an a380
a380 are also considerably larger than the 180 - capacity doomed airbus a320 jet that lubitz flew
standard a380 planes carry 544 passengers but larger versions can carry up to 800
recordings from the one recovered black box have revealed the final moments of the plane , as the pilot desperately tried to get back into the cockpit after being locked out by lubitz

â lubitz is believed to have been suffering from vision problems and was concerned it would affect his flying as a child , lubitz is said to have always wanted to be a pilot and covered his bedroom walls with pictures of planes and collected model aircraft
