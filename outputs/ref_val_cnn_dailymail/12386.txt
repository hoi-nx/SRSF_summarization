creflo dollar 's new scheme to raise $ 60 million to purchase a luxury gulfstream g650 airplane is the latest chapter in a long and sordid history of televangelists exploiting their churches ' tax - exempt status -- and their congregants -- to line their own pockets
creflo dollar , dollar 's 30,000 - member church , is a tax - exempt organization under the internal revenue code
dollar is known for his custom suits , luxury homes and private jets that ferry him , among other places , from his home base in college park , georgia , to his satellite church in manhattan , where he and his wife reportedly have a $ 2.5 million apartment
creflo dollar tells his congregants to " sow a seed " with him , promising that a plentiful harvest will be their own blessing and , essentially , a return on their investment
the committee requested documents from dollar and his wife , taffi , explaining that taxpayers " should be assured that their donations are being used for the tax exempt purposes of the organizations
" the documents sought by the committee included audited financial statements for world changers , information about related for - profit and nonprofit entities , and data on executive compensation and the church 's real and personal assets
instead , the committee called on the ministries to engage in " self - reform , " even though the committee staff 's findings plainly demonstrated that four of the ministries , including dollar 's , were unwilling to engage in any sort of meaningful transparency or accountability
it concluded that in 2006 , world changers had received $ 69 million in contributions at its atlanta church alone , that the dollars owned two multimillion - dollar homes in georgia , and that the church and related business entities had at various points owned four aircraft flown for personal use -- although none was nearly as pricey as the luxury dollar now seeks to acquire
the committee staff was clearly troubled by the array of business entities , " including private airports and aircraft leasing companies , " that raised red flags " about the use of the church 's tax - exempt status to avoid taxation
" four years after the abandonment of the senate 's televangelist investigation , it looks like the absence of government oversight has only emboldened creflo dollar .
