defender olsson insists blackburn have still not given up hope of a late charge into the championship play - offs and the prospect of an fa cup semi-final place will not distract them from that aim
sunday 's goalless draw at anfield to earn a replay back at ewood park - where they have already dispatched premier league sides swansea and stoke - may have improved their chances of booking a trip to wembley
however , they are likely to have at least five league matches to play before the expected return leg against the reds in early april and , even though blackburn are 14 points adrift of the play - offs , olsson stressed they have to give it one last push
olsson ( right ) says him and his blackburn team mates are only thinking about gaining a play off place ' we do n't really think about the fa cup , ' he told press association sport
' we try to give 100 per cent every game as there is still a chance of getting into the play - offs but we have to concentrate in the last 11 games of the league
' the full back had a busy game trying to deal with the skill of liverpool 's adam lallana in the fa cup clash rovers matched what fellow championship sides middlesbrough ( in the capital one cup ) and bolton ( fa cup ) have done this season in not getting beat in 90 minutes at anfield
