. but now the system of paying to park using your mobile phone , follow the trend of using passes instead of cash on buses , could be the latest sign that britain is moving towards a cashless system
brighton and hove council has announced it will scrap half of its coin operated parking meters in favour of people using their phones to pay for and top up their car parking
this is already used on buses across the country where cash is no longer accepted , and particularly in london , as well as in a number of work canteens that operate card - only systems of payment
the popularity of non-cash payments has also been seen on the streets with an unemployed man travelling to mayfair armed with a card machine so people can give him money using their cards
britain is on track to make more non-cash payments - defined as paying by card , cheque , direct debit , standing order and mobile phone - than cash for the first time in 2015 , according to predictions by the payments council
this is forecast to happen at some point in 2015because while cash payments are remaining fairly constant , the number of non-cash payments has been steadily increasing
some have predicted the end of coin - operated marking meters ( right ) could spell the end of cash about three - quarters of britain now shop online , compared with just over half in 2008 , according to ons ( ons ) figures released last year
in brighton councillors have decided to remove half of its coin - operated parking meters because of the popularity of doing this through mobile phones and the ease of its use
the move by brighton follows similar methods such as only accepting payments by card and oyster card on buses in london ( left ) as well as the launch of the barclays pingit app ( right ) ian davey , a transport councillor in brighton , said : ' it 's actually a lot easier than messing about getting the right change
you can also top up your parking time remotely if you need to stay longer , which is a lot easier than walking back to the car
the 37 - year - old travels by bus , train or rental car from preston in lancashire to mayfair and spends thursdays to sundays taking cash from passers - by and card payments from ' regulars '
and in another move towards getting rid of cash , barclaycard has launched a ' ping - it ' app where people can make payments in a similar way to sending a text message
however the payments council said the popularity of cashless payments do not spell the end of britain 's monetary system in its entirety
while card and other non cash payments will continue to become popular , the council predicts that by 2023 we will still be making 12.9 transactions using coins and notes
mark bowerman , a spokesman for the payments council , said cash is still a vital payment method for many consumers , with students , people who need to tightly control their budgets , older people and people with a disability being particularly high users of cash
