hollywood actor freeman is today unveiled by labour as the first big celebrity endorsement of the election campaign
the star of the hobbit , sherlock and the office is to appear in a party political broadcast in which he contrasts the ' choice ' between labour and the tories
but in a surprise move , the video lasting almost three minutes has no mention of labour 's leader ed miliband
he adds : ' i do n't know about you , but my values are about community , compassion , decency ; that 's how i was brought up
' he claims the tories will take the country on a ' rollercoaster of cuts ' while labour will ' make sure the economy works for all of us , not just the privileged few , like me , but it 's not just about that '
the 44 - year - old says the election will focus on a ' choice about what kind of country we want to live in ' labour leader ed miliband is not mentioned in the broadcast , as polls suggest the labour is more popular than its leader not every celebrity has been supportive of ed miliband 's labour , not least his plans to impose a levy on homes worth Â£ 2million

' presenters ant and dec on labour and ed miliband : ant mcpartlin : i feel we 're both staunchly labour and would vote labour if we could , but i do n't know what their philosophy is any more
' freeman claims labour ' start from the right place - community , compassion , fairness - i think all the best things about this country '
' i love this country so much and i love the people in it , and i think you do too , but really , for me , there 's only one choice ; and i choose labour
' but mr ed miliband does not get a mention , perhaps an acknowledgement of polling which shows labour is more popular than its leader
conservative mp nigel adams said : ' labour is trying to whitewash ed miliband from their campaign - his mps do n't want his photo on leaflets and now their party election broadcast does n't even mention him
