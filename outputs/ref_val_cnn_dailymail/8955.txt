here 's the scene : my husband tony is desperately ill and i 'm sitting by his hospital bed
he 's been sick for weeks and at one stage i was told he was expected to die
he 's now out of a coma and no longer , thank god , one of the ten sickest people in the vast teaching hospital
but still no one knows what 's wrong with him
he 's been moved from the intensive care unit into a small room when suddenly a consultant descends
sarah foot says that while with her sick husband tony in hospital a consultant with hostile body language came crashing in and started talking down to them as she gave the diagnosis she crashes through the door , followed by half a dozen of her juniors , who crowd round the bed and wait for her to speak
no one 's in any doubt who 's in charge
she talks not at us , but down to us , like some reincarnation of the monstrous sir doctor in the house ( played by james robertson justice ) from the doctor in the house films
except this is n't funny
tony has been in hospital for more than a month , but how or why he got ill so suddenly no one really knows
one minute i was wondering whether he just had man flu ; the next he was delirious with fever and dreadful abdominal pains , and being rushed to hospital in an ambulance
just 48 hours later , he was in a drug - induced coma with sepsis , a life - threatening condition triggered by an infection , his organs shutting down one by one
when he was admitted , his symptoms suggested pancreatitis - where the pancreas becomes inflamed
i want to know if the doctors are any the wiser about what caused his body to go into free fall
sarah foot accompanied tony as he was rushed to hospital in an ambulance , and shortly after was in a drug - induced coma with sepsis so , looking up at the sea of faces , i ask : ' was it pancreatitis that started this ? ' i remain sitting , because if i stand , tony - who is unable to speak for himself as he has a tube in his windpipe - will feel even more helpless
' yes , ' the consultant declares haughtily , ' he presented with similar symptoms
' ' but was it actually pancreatitis ? ' she repeats herself impatiently : ' yes , he presented with similar symptoms
' her hostile body language is telling me to shut up and know my place
i try again , but still she answers like a politician , repeating the same refrain
then she shuffles her notes and says that another consultant is coming to discuss a kidney tumour that showed up on a scan
i 'm torn between bursting into tears and storming into the corridor to tell those junior doctors that if they learn one thing today , it 's how not to talk to the sick and their loved ones
same patient , different consultant , working under exactly the same pressure and constraints as the others
and his approach was so full of kindness and compassion that i wonder whether the disparity between those who have a good bedside manner and those who do n't is about individuals rather than the pressure of the job
this man became our rock when tony 's illness - whatever caused the sepsis in the first place was never identified - sparked off a chain reaction that had doctors chasing problems around his body for a year after he was admitted in march 2006
she had barely slept for weeks and was extremely anxious , so needed kindness and support plus we had a three - year - old son and he 'd be thrown into turmoil
would it be possible , i suggested , for me to give my husband more antibiotics at home and bring him into hospital in the morning ? the doctor agreed , but then warned me : ' tony may deteriorate very quickly
but on this occasion i was overwhelmed by kindness far beyond the call of duty
after a further set of operations , including a ten - hour marathon to reconstruct parts of his insides that had been destroyed by infection , this doctor would phone us at home and see how my husband was
when i look back at my bedside encounter with that spratt of a consultant , if i 'm being rational , i can see that whether i knew the precise name of my husband 's illness or had been forewarned about his tumour was irrelevant
and , like all relatives , i needed kindness and support because i was going to play a crucial role in my husband 's care
sarah foot wonders some doctors so understanding and others less so relatives are also essential if there is bad news
' my husband was too sick to help or even respond
my husband came through his ordeal , though he still bears the scars of six operations within a year , has bits of plastic inside him keeping him alive - stents to bypass the aneurysm , another for a blood clot - and is on a strict , life - long regimen of medication
i still regret that , on that miserable day , i did n't rush out after the junior doctors and demand to know : what sort of doctor do you want to be remembered as ? a saint ? or a spratt ? sarah foot 's new novel fragments ( quercus , Â£ 19.99 ) .
