a photo of a giant cat coming down the stairs of a house , teeth bared and biting for the chandelier has caused a sensation on social media
disappointingly , or doubtless to some people 's relief , the photo actually shows a normal - sized kitten playfully exploring the inside of a meticulously detailed dollhouse
hear me roar ! the photo of a giant cat destroying a house is actually a kitten playing in a dollhouse the photo was taken by cade ritter , 18 , of austin , texas , in an effort to get fostered kittens adopted into permanent homes
the photo came about when ritter and his mom , austin - based artist barbara atwell , decided to use a dollhouse ritter 's great - grandfather had built by hand many years before
the photos were taken by cade ritter of austin , texas , a few years ago to help find foster homes for a litter of five kittens users were as impressed by the dollhouse as they were amused by the photo noting the meticulous detail
it was built by ritter 's great - grandfather and even includes working lights
