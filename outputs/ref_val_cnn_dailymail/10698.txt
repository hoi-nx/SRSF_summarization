photos and video have appeared on social media of two young women smiling , posing and snapping photos with large crocodiles at darwin 's fogg dam
salt water crocodiles can grow to five metres in length , weigh 450 kilograms and last year killed more people than any other year with the ' freshies ' remaining more timid and fearful
just last january , a 12 - year - old boy was taken by a crocodile while swimming with friends in a river in kakadu
as more and more people arrive to take photos , the distressed crocodile wanders back down the bank and in june a 62 - year - old man was taken , also in kakadu , whilst he was fishing in his boat when a five - metre salt water crocodile launched itself into the boat , grabbing him and dragging him under the water while his distressed family watched from the river bank
