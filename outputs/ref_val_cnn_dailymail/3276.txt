as the jury in the jodi arias trial reached an impasse last week , prosecutors and fellow jurors attempted to remove a holdout on the panel who was the only obstacle in the way of securing a death sentence against the convicted murderer
a court document released tuesday by the judge in the case reveals the behind - the - scenes wrangling in the jury room as arias ' fate hung in the balance
jurors had questioned the holdout 's objectivity because she had previously watched a lifetime movie about the arias case , and prosecutors were upset at the juror 's social media activity as she went on facebook and liked several local tv stations and nancy grace of the hln network
the juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend jodi arias nearly seven years ago
the holdout 's identity was leaked through a twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about alexander , while a pro-arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence arias to death for the 2008 killing
