jet2 and wizz air were said to have breached airline policies when it came to consistently offering their customers compensation for disrupted flights and had imposed false deadlines for claims
the caa ( caa ) added that aer lingus and jet2 had also failed to tell passengers about their right for compensation

the caa alleged that jet2 and wizz air have failed to satisfy the regulator that they are consistently paying compensation for disruption caused by technical faults , despite a court of appeal ruling clarifying that airlines must do so ' no enforcement action has been taken
the caa is obligated to consult with jet2 before considering enforcement action
given the misapprehensions of the caa , jet2 expects that following the mandatory consultation process the caa will not wish to take the matter any further
- jet2 and wizz air are imposing two - year time limits for passengers to take compensation claims to court , despite a court of appeal ruling that passengers should have up to six years to take a claim to court
- jet2 and aer lingus have failed to give satisfactory evidence that they proactively provide passengers with information about their rights during disruption in line with the requirements set out in european regulation
' aer lingus denied claims and said their provision of information to customers affected by operational disruption , were ' fully compliant with all the relevant regulations ' andrew haines , chief executive of the caa , said : ' airlines are well aware of the support they must provide when there is disruption and passengers have every right to be disappointed that a small number of airlines are not complying with the court of appeal rulings and continue to let people down in this way
