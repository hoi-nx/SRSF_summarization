britain is facing gridlock this easter weekend as engineering works on the railways will lead to long queues during the bank holiday getaway
drivers could face travel misery this easter as disruption to railways will see more people opt to use their cars more people are planning to drive because of works on the rail network and a surge in people travelling abroad to seek sunshine ' the first spring bank holiday of the year traditionally heralds the start of busier weekends on the nation 's roads , ' said rac head of external affairs pete williams
work is planned on three key routes - the west coast main line , first great western and greater anglia - forcing passengers to make diversions on slower trains or spend hours on the dreaded replacement coaches
network rail said engineering works were planned over the easter holidays because passenger numbers fell by 20 per cent
' this map shows the traffic hotspots , rail closures and delays that are due to take place this easter weekend last christmas , thousands of passengers were crammed together outside finsbury park station , a small commuter stop in north london , in freezing conditions because kings cross had failed to reopen in a move that has been described by an expert as ' adding insult to injury ' , virgin trains and london midland have cancelled advanced cheap fares forcing passengers to purchase more expensive off - peak tickets
both virgin trains and london midland say they can not offer advance fares as the tickets would not be valid with other operators and replacement services
' passengers should be entitled to reduced , not increased , fares when engineering works affect journeys
' a virgin trains spokesman said : ' all easter weekend trains in and out of london euston to all destinations have not had usual discounted advance fares made available
' advance fares are only available on our services and due to the engineering works , there will not be any virgin trains services to travel on
' terry oliver , london midland 's head of west coast services , has even encouraged passengers to avoid travelling this easter
he said : ' london midland will be running rail - replacement bus services over the bank holiday weekend , but journeys will involve changes and will take much longer than normal
' a string of engineering projects is expected to cause delays and overcrowding on some of the busiest lines last christmas , carne , the chief executive of network rail , was forced to forego his annual bonus worth up to Â£ 135,000 after chaos on the railways caused by over-running engineering projects
figures from gatwick airport show that more than two million passengers are expected to fly off for foreign holidays over the easter break - a four per cent rise on the same period last year
almost 50,000 more people than last year have bought air tickets for travel over the easter weekend compared with last year
