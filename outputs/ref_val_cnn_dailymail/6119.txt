one poll this week put the lib on just 5 per cent , the lowest for 25 years , while ukip were on 14 per cent ukip candidate fraser called into the programme to attack mr clegg âs stance on civil liberties and boast that the lib face wipeout
but mr clegg hit back : â rather than making slightly silly political points on the radio â¦ â how about this , i will bet you , i do nât know , what shall i bet you , i will bet you several pints that the lib will have many , many , many , many , many more mps than your party after the election

â let me be absolutely clear fraser , you believe on behalf of farage , that you ukip will have more mps than the lib after may 7 , is that right ? â fraser replied : â i think there âs a very good chance of overtaking your party
am i taking the bet ? two pints will go to each : if i lose , i âm buying nick ferrari two pints , i âm buying clegg two pints , how about that ? â but mr clegg insisted : â bad luck fraser , you might as well set the money aside already
