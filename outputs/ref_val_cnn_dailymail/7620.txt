after months of defending gaye 's work , the late motown singer 's family breathed a sigh of relief in court on tuesday as a jury decided that the thicke song ' blurred lines ' ripped off gaye 's 1977 hit ' got to give it up '
following the decision , gaye 's ex-wife and children sat down for interviews to describe the emotional legal battle to stand up for his music and how they hold no ill - feelings towards the song 's producer , pharrell
from left to right : gaye 's son marvin gaye iii , daughter nona , and ex-wife gaye overcome with emotion : tears welled in nona 's eyes as she reflected on the multi-million dollar lawsuit the success of the family 's lawsuit in court is also sparking discussion online as to whether some of pharrell 's other work infringed on gaye , with many drawing comparisons between his 2013 hit ' happy ' and gaye 's ' ai n't that peculiar '
i do think they sound alike , ' gaye 's 40 - year - old daughter nona told entertainment tonight
in court on tuesday , nona cried in court as a jury decided to award her family $ 4million in damages and $ 3.4 million in profits from the song
thicke will be forced to pay $ 1.7million from his own pocket and pharrell $ 1.6million
they were not present when the decision was read on thursday ' i feel free , free from ... pharrell â & thicke âs chains , ' said nona in an emotional statement outside the courtroom following the verdict on tuesday the verdict could tarnish the legacy of pharrell , a reliable hit - maker who has won grammys and appears on nbc 's music competition show the voice
it was previously revealed that the song had made a staggering $ 16million for pharrell , thicke , rapper t.i. and the record company , though t.i. and various record and music companies had previously been cleared of copyright infringement charges
an attorney for thicke and pharrell has said a decision in favor of gaye 's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist 's sound
' blurred lines â was created from the heart and minds of pharrell , thicke and t.i. and not taken from anyone or anywhere else
' free from ... pharrell and thicke 's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told
' tragic death : gaye , best known for such classics as sexual healing , i heard it through the grapevine and how sweet it is ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father when he was just 44 - years - old this was no doubt in response to the fact that pharrell and thicke had filed a lawsuit against gaye 's estate back in august 2013 in an attempt to stop his family from suing them for copyright infringement
' victory speech : nona ( second from left ) , daughter of late singer gaye , and her lawyer busch ( front right ) speak to the media following the verdict on tuesday the gayes ' lawyer branded pharrell and thicke liars who went beyond trying to emulate the sound of gaye 's late - 1970s music and copied the r&b legend 's hit got to give it up outright
he also brought up the fact after the verdict that the defense 's legal team did everything they could to stop the jury from hearing gaye 's song during the proceedings , allowing them to just listen to certain snippets of the music
for this reason the infringement charge only applied to the sheet music for the two songs , making the case against thicke and pharrell that much more difficult for the gaye family
busch however pointed out during his argument that thicke said in interviews while promoting the single that he and pharrell were trying to write something like gaye 's got to give it up
thicke told jurors he did n't write blurred lines , which pharrell testified he crafted in about an hour in mid- 2012 , as he was too high on painkillers and alcohol
he also took time on the stand to play a variety of songs that sound similar in music and tone in an attempt to strengthen his case pharrell told jurors that gaye 's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth , but the seven - time grammys winner said he did n't use any of it to create blurred lines and that the songs were alike in genre only
' heads held high : busch , far left , walks with the late singer , gaye 's family members , from left , daughter , nona , ex-wife , jan , and son , frankie , on tuesday according to the los angeles times , he song brought in $ 5.6 million for thicke , $ 5.2 million for pharrell and another $ 5 million to $ 6 million for the record company , as well as an additional $ 8 million in publishing revenue gaye 's children - nona , frankie and marvin gaye iii - sued the singers in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read
gaye 's ex-wife janis testified that as soon as she heard the song she recognized the similarities and was thrilled thinking that this would introduce the music of her late husband to a new generation of music lovers
that quickly turned to anger however when she learned the rights to gaye 's song had not been licensed
