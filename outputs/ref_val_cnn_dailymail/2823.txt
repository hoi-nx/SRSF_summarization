the 26 - year - old wife of former real housewives of new york star aviva drescher 's 79 - year - old father george has revealed intimate details about the couple 's ' steamy ' marriage , insisting that , despite their 53 - year age gap , the couple 's love life is more passionate than ever
dana , who married reality star george in an intimate ceremony in malibu last year - which his daughter aviva chose not to attend - explained to daily mail online that , before meeting george , she was close to giving up on the idea of finding a soul mate who would live up to her standards
' before george , i only ever dated men my age or younger and i âd never had an orgasm , â dana , who is from miami , says
but then i met a man 53 years older than me and finally i see what all the fuss is about
â my husband has the stamina of a 20 - year - old
george thinks nothing of making love to me for at least five hours every night and he wears me out ! â the couple 's unconventional romance began in march 2011 , when george , who appeared on a number of episodes of real housewives before his daughter aviva was fired from the reality series last year , walked into dana 's miami salon for a pedicure
and when george asked her for an email address following his appointment , dana insists that she had no idea he was looking to pursue anything other than a business relationship
happy couple : the pair married in an intimate ceremony on the beach in malibu , which george 's daughter , former real housewives of new york star aviva drescher , chose not to attend moving on : george 's first wife , aviva 's mother , passed away a number of years ago â i loved how intelligent , successful and charismatic he was and suddenly the age difference did nât seem to matter so much
â and while george 's over-the - top sexual antics were the source of much horror among aviva 's real housewives co-stars , it seems to have worked wonders with dana
' ironically , while george 's talents in the bedroom proved particularly effective when it came to wooing his wife , his playboy lifestyle seemed to have the opposite effect on the real housewives - and their viewers
' i love a good drama - whether a screaming match or a hair pulling - but i 'm with the audience on this one : get george off the tv
playboy : during his appearances on his daughter 's reality show , george formed a reputation with her castmates for his overtly sexual behavior sun - filled fun : george and dana insist that their age gap does not bother them ' it 's sickening to hear an old man sexually degrade women in all kinds of vile ways
' but despite his less - than - chivalrous behavior during his appearance on real housewives , it did n't take much for george to win dana over - and the couple 's relationship quickly began to go from strength to strength , despite the then - 23 - year - old not even knowing his real age
despite knowing george was a widower with three daughters and two sons , all older than her , dana admits that she did n't actually ask his real age until six months after the pair began dating
â in august 2013 , george proposed during a family dinner at his daughter âs house and the happy couple tied the knot in a romantic ceremony on the beach in malibu a year later
and while george 's daughter aviva , who was often forced to defend her father 's shocking behaviour to her castmates , did not choose to attend the couple 's wedding , dana insists that the 44 - year - old gave them ' full blessing ' before they walked down the aisle
â george âs kids gave us their full blessing , ' she explains
family ties : although aviva ( r ) chose not to attend her father 's wedding to dana , the couple insist that the 44 - year - old gave them her blessing motherhood : aviva and her husband reid drescher ( l ) have two children together ( pictured ) ' after losing their mum , they are glad to see him so happy again
dana admits that some friends have accused her of acting like a â prostitute â in marrying george , who is reported to be worth about $ 50 million
â dana says that the pair are desperate to start a family as soon as possible - so desperate in fact , that george revealed during an appearance on real housewives that he has had his sperm frozen so that dana can opt to have his children even after he has died
but dana insists that she has put any fears about george dying before he gets to see their unborn child grow up to the back of her mind
