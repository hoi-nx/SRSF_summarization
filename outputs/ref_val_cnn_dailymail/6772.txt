the execution of the only woman on georgia 's death row , gissendaner , was delayed because the lethal injection was ' cloudy ' the execution of the only woman on georgia 's death row has been postponed at the last minute for the second time in less than a week - because the drug used in the lethal injection she was scheduled to receive was ' cloudy '
kelly renee gissendaner , 46 , was due to be given an injection of pentobarbital at a jackson prison at 7pm on monday in retribution for plotting the murder of her husband in 1997
but after officials observed the drug had a ' cloudy ' appearance , they postponed her death until a future , unspecified date ' out of caution ' , according to reports
earlier on monday , gissendaner had feasted on a massive last meal of two burger king whoppers , two large portions of fries , cornbread , a fatty salad , popcorn and cherry - vanilla ice cream
it is the second time gissendaner has been spared death from lethal injection
it was unclear whether she received her whopping , 3.400 - calorie last meal at that time
monday 's decision came as the u.s. supreme court considered whether or not to grant gissendaner a stay of execution after a last - ditch appeal for clemency was denied by state officials
' more than 100 protesters were gathered outside the prison where gissendaner was to be executed , pleading with officials to spare the mother - of - three 's life
riot police were also reportedly stationed outside the facility

they were backed by a petition , which had gained over 70,000 signatures by monday evening , saying gissendaner has turned her life around , even earning a theology degree behind bars
however , on monday afternoon , the board announced it was standing by its february 25 decision to deny clemency to gissendaner , whose last meal included a salad drenched in buttermilk dressing
' she has also drawn attention to the fact that , while she did not kill her husband , the man who struck the fatal blows is not facing the death penalty - and will , in fact , be eligible for parole in eight years
indeed , although her boyfriend , owen , stabbed her husband , douglas , at her urging , he could be freed in just eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against her
gissendaner 's death via lethal injection was previously scheduled to take place last week

gissendaner 's lawyers also urged the board to consider that before trial , she had been offered the same plea deal as owen - life in prison with an agreement not to seek parole for 25 years
douglas gissendaner 's parents and sisters wanted her to be executed , but two of gissendaner and douglas ' three children asked the parole board to spare her life , the lawyers wrote
