the conclusion of pc toby rowland 's defamation case against the mp was announced at the high court in london today
pc rowland 's lawyer , clarke-williams , told mr justice warby that since that judgment mr mitchell ' has abandoned the other defences he had raised to my client 's claim and consequently terms of settlement have been agreed '
the solicitor added : ' the payment of Â£ 80,000 damages by mr mitchell sets the seal on pc rowland 's vindication , as well as providing compensation for the injury to his reputation and the distress caused to him and his family over many months
' neither mr mitchell nor pc rowland was in court
' what exactly mr mitchell said to pc rowland as he left downing street became the crux of the so - called ' plebgate ' controversy , ' the lawyer said
two days after the incident ' mr mitchell phoned pc rowland and apologised to him for his behaviour at the gates '
' on saturday december 22 2012 pc rowland was ' identified by name and photograph in the mailonline website , and then in the mail on sunday newspaper the next day , as the police officer who had dealt with mr mitchell at the gates of downing street ' on september 19
' consequently , all the accusations made after that date by mr mitchell about the police officer who dealt with him were understood to refer to pc rowland
' mr clarke-williams added : ' however , on the very same day as the dpp 's announcement , mr mitchell held a televised press conference accusing pc rowland of having lied in his account of what mr mitchell had said at the gates of downing street and implying he should have been prosecuted
' the trial in november took place before mr justice mitting to ' establish precisely what had been said at the downing street gates in the exchange between pc rowland and mr mitchell '
' it is understood that the issue of legal costs has yet to be determined
mr mitchell has already paid the Â£ 80,000 damages to mr toby rowland
he has also been ordered to pay Â£ 325,000 in legal costs prior to a full hearing on the issue
