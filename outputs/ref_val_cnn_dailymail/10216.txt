now there is a new potential threat that turns the lowly thumb drive into a â laptop killer â by using a high voltage to destroy the computer âs components
dubbed â usb killer â , the crude device was created by a russian electronics expert known as dark purple
the malicious drive has been dubbed â usb killer â and it uses a high voltage and current to â fry â the laptop âs components
the prototype ( pictured ) was created by a russian electronics expert known as dark purple the user posted photos and specifications about the project on russian blog habrahabr , and this was later syndicated and posted in english on kukuruku
the english post said : â i work in [ a ] company engaged in the development and manufacture of electronics
â in modern computers , the usb â physics â is built in the processor [ and ] the task of the designed usb flash drive is to burn all of this stuff , or at least kill the usb port

a colleague of dark purple is reported as saying the device is â like an atomic bomb : cool to have , but can not be applied â dark purple ordered the parts , including a custom circuit board , from china before making a â full - fledged prototype â
in november a team of berlin - based researchers reverse - engineered the files that control how a usb drive 's software works
â the basic idea of the usb drive is quite simple , â explained dark purple
â put more simply , it uses high voltage and high current to â fry â the electronics inside the port
