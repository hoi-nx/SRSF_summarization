reverend gavin ashenden said around 100 passages in the islamic holy book incite followers to violence , including ' striking off heads ' there are passages in the koran which â invite people to violence â , one of the queen âs chaplains said last night
reverend canon gavin ashenden , the former chaplain of sussex university and one of 35 who serve her majesty , expressed concern about more than 100 passages in the islamic holy book
but the church of england priest declined to say whether parts of the koran are â evil â , instead advising people to make up their own minds
he was responding to comments by the archbishop of canterbury , who warned this week about being too quick to brand people with strong religious views â extremists â
the signatories , which included journalist yvonne ridley and former guantanamo detainee moazzam begg , criticised the â demonisation of muslims in britons ... despite their disavowal of violence and never having supported terrorist acts â
but rev ashenden told lbc radio he was â attracted to christianity because it invites people to the extremity of forgiveness and love â
he added : â islamic has , i think , over 100 verses inviting people to violence in the koran which christianity does nât have
â asked to compare the bible and the koran , he said the christianity holy text invites its followers to forgive and try to lead people away from sin , while the islamic text invites people to violence presenter iain dale said muslims would say islamic was â entirely peaceful â , but rev ashenden said parts of the koran â tell you to kill your enemies â
when warned his comments could offend muslims , he said : â if they are offended by my quoting the koran they are not offended by me , they are offended by the koran
â he added : â if you âre going to talk about excitement in christianity it âs about delivering people from evil and transforming people âs lives
â asked whether he would describe certain parts of the koran as evil , he said : â i notice that they invite people to violence
i âll let other people decide whether that âs good or evil
