but kouyate was in the crowd as his previous side anderlecht recovered from a 3 - 0 half - time deficit to take a champions league point home from north london and he wants to follow in the footsteps of the belgian outfit
' i went to the emirates to support anderlecht in the champions league earlier this season and they did very well and drew three - all

' it went to 3 - 1 , then 3 - 2 and then 3 - 3 - it was unbelievable ! ' i am very happy for anderlecht , but now hammers go to arsenal and it would be fantastic if we could do the same
