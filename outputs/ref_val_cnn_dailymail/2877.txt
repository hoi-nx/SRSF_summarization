resigned : amin was exposed after plotting with far - right extremists to stir up racial hatred the tory election candidate exposed for plotting with far - right extremists to stir up racial hatred is a former member of a fanatical islamic sect that believes the nazis were misunderstood and that jews control the world
amin , who resigned after the mail on sunday published undercover recordings of him meeting the edl , joined the birmingham wing of the murabitun , a fundamentalist cult which questioned the holocaust and praised hitler
in 1992 when amin was 18 , he left the group , founded by scottish hippy ian dallas , after becoming disillusioned
two years later , a book crediting him as author raja afzal raza amin al-quraishy , was published in which he criticised the murabitun and called for jihadi warriors to establish a muslims state in europe
amin says his words were doctored to include the extremist views , which he yesterday described as â disgusting â
in the pamphlet amin â described last week by a colleague as a â walter mitty character â â demeans women and calls for restaurants that serve alcohol to be burned
â those of us in the cities of europe need to free ourselves economically from kafir [ unbeliever ] institutions , state and private , by creating our own arenas of trade , with islamic coinage â¦ and the building of independent villages for muslims , from where the mujahidun [ jihad warriors ] can burst out and conquer lands establishing islam [ a muslims region ]
â recounting the tale of another muslims , a passage in the book says that he â as any man would , refused to be taught the â methodology of jihad â by a female
â discussing indian restaurants which sell alcohol , he says : â my complaint is primarily with the hypocrisy of a group of people who claim to be the â cutting edge â of islam , yet instead of burning the alcohol - selling restaurants are accepting â¦ â last week , former student abu abdullah , who said he met amin while studying at the school of african and oriental studies in london , claims amin proudly gave him a copy of the pamphlet in 1998
â amin said yesterday : â this work is not a book , it is merely stapled photocopied pages
â amin , 40 , was exposed for hatching a plot with the edl to announce a demonstration in his dudley north constituency which would then be cancelled , allowing him to claim credit for brokering peace
a muslims campaigner claims amin asked him to publicly attack his military career to make him more appealing to working - class white voters
â amin responded : â if i have met him i do not recall doing so
â amin said : â no such discussion took place
â amin said : â performance issues should be referred to the party
influence : amin afzal with former tory election chairman baroness warsi millward said : â on paper , amin was a very good candidate when he was selected in 2013 , but i think the whole process needs to be thoroughly looked at after this election
