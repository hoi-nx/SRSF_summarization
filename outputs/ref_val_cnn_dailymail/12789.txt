los angeles thousands of veterans who are patients at the va healthcare system have been waiting months just for an appointment , cnn has learned
what 's more , administrators in charge of the massive va facility in greater los angeles may have been hiding wait times , and may have misled congress on the delays and exactly how long veterans are being forced to wait for care , according to new information obtained by cnn
the detailed new evidence comes from the los angeles va 's own internal documents obtained by cnn , and numerous medical and administrative sources confirmed the information
it is particularly significant as the va veterans medical center is the nation 's largest va health care system , caring for hundreds of thousands of u.s. veterans
and yet last month , the va 's acting director for the western region overseeing the los angeles va told congress that veterans who are new patients there only have to wait a few days for appointments
" the average wait time for a new patient right now is about four days , " dr. mcdougall , the acting director of the desert pacific healthcare network , veterans health administration , testified before the house committee on veterans ' affairs
according to the los angeles va 's documents dated january 15 , the actual average wait time for new patients at the va was 48 days
a half - dozen medical and administrative sources inside the va system corroborate these waits
the wait times since then have not changed significantly -- coming down slightly to a wait time of 44 days for new patients as of march 1 , according to another va document -- and are still roughly 10 times what mcdougall testified they were
the uncounted : war 's true toll asked how long the wait time is for mental health at the va , mcdougall testified that the same number -- a four days ' wait for new patients -- applies for mental health
" the va sent cnn new " retrospective data " showing primary care average wait times of four days , specialty care wait times of 7.5 days , and mental health wait times of 2.5 days , as of january
this news of continuing delays in los angeles comes a year after reports of cover - ups and turmoil at the va , which became a national scandal , where wait times , veterans ' deaths and even secret waiting lists were revealed at va hospitals across the country
vets not impressed with va reforms sources in the va va say despite the scandal last year , the new secretary , the new laws and all the attention , not much has changed
