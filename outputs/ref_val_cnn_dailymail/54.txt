statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent , researchers claim
the medication has already been linked to a reduction in heart attacks
prevention ? cholesterol - lowering statins can cut the number of hospital admissions for heart failure by 10 per cent , scottish researchers found but the latest research is the first to show the benefits for those at risk of heart failure â which occurs when the organ struggles to maintain adequate blood flow to the body
scientists from the glasgow said their findings herald a â significant benefit â for the near - one million uk affected by the condition
exerts from the university âs institute of cardiovascular and medical sciences reviewed 17 statin trials involving more than 100,000 patients as part of their analysis
â while it has been assumed that statins reduce the development of heart failure simply because they reduce heart attacks , to our surprise this had not been definitively shown before
â the results of this analysis clearly show a modest , but significant benefit , reducing hospital admission for heart failure by 10 per cent , which is clinically important
â heart failure happens when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body
damage : heart failure ( pictured ) affects nearly a million birtons and develops when the heart is unable to maintain adequate blood flow to meet the needs of the body figures show 15 per cent of patients with the condition die in hospital â twice the european average â partly because of late diagnosis and treatment that fails to adequately control symptoms
â the study found a 10 per cent reduction in first hospital admissions for heart failure , although researchers believe the impact of statins has been underestimated
