the senator : sen. menendez , a new jersey democrat , may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption politics : ( l - r ) menendez , donor melgen , white house minority leader nancy pelosi , and her husband paul , posed in february 2012 at a national association of latino elected and appointed officials gala menendez , 61 , has seen pressure from the obama administration over his positions on cuban and iranians , leading some republicans who share his foreign policy views to suspect that the white house is exacting retribution on him
but more troubling are the ethics questions lingering about menendez 's relationship with florida eye doctor melgen , a wealthy and prolific donor
the senator 's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the medicare on his friend 's behalf , pushing back against accusations of overbilling the medicare system by $ 8.9 million
menendez has also repaid melgen $ 58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor 's private jet , mostly to the posh dominican republic resot casa de campo

cnn reported that melgen was one of the medicare system 's most - reimbursed doctors nationwide , during the years when he was also a major donor to menendez and to the majority pac
that political action committee , run by former reid staffers , collected more than $ 700,000 from melgen and made sure $ 600,000 of it benefited menendez âs re-election campaign
last week two of his senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case , arguing that the senator 's actions , and theirs , are protected by the u.s. constitution 's ' speech or debate ' clause
the doctor : melgen , a wealthy florida ophthalmologist and a major menendez donor , was ordered to pay back medicare for $ 8.9 million in overbillings , and menendez intervened with hhs for him search warrant : a january 30 raid of melgen 's medical practice yielded van - loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files according to the new jersey law journal , aide michael barnard refused to answer 50 questions about menendez 's conversations with sebelius and tavenner , and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator 's office and melgen 's lawyer - lobbyist about those conversations
the grand jury wanted to know if talbot had emailed a staffer at u.s. customs and border protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port - screening equipment â principally cargo - container x-ray machines â to the dominican republic
melgen , the senator 's donor , controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through
narco - politics : dr. melgen controlled a company that wanted a dominican republic ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs
menendez allegedly helped ensure the u.s. would n't provide the machines for free in 2013 fbi agents and investigators from hhs raided melgen 's west palm beach , florida medical office , vitreo-retinal consultants
the washington post reported at the time that hhs auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments melgen 's practice billed to medicare
the government typically paid $ 2,000 for each container , raising the possibility that melgen could have overbilled medicare between $ 4,000 and $ 6,000 per vial .
