for once , the focus of north london did not fall on arsenal on sunday
after the week they 've had , arsene wenger was happy to shun the limelight this time
ask gunners fans prior to kick - off if they 'd rather three points or a spurs defeat in the capital one cup final and you 'd have been greeted with differing opinions
their arch - rivals lost to chelsea at wembley and arsenal got their win â by the same scoreline , â courtesy of goals from giroud and tomas rosicky , to move four points behind second - placed manchester city
giroud points to the sky after scoring the opener against toffees at the emirates on sunday giroud had a less than enjoyable time in his side 's champions league defeat against monaco on wednesday the frenchman striker congratulates team - mate tomas rosicky after he doubled the gunners ' lead on sunday but much like their demoralising champions league loss to monaco on wednesday night , this did n't make for comfortable viewing
the 2 - 0 score does n't tell the full story
this was unconvincing from arsenal ; the emirates a bag of nerves until tomas rosicky 's last - minute goal
despite their lack of fluency , arsene wenger would have been pleased with the response shown by his wounded players following the midweek loss
this was n't the arsenal we 're accustomed to , but after the monaco monstrosity that did n't concern arsene wenger

arsenal 's gabriel ( right ) did not have the most convincing performance but managed to keep a clean sheet coquelin was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team - mate before being hit in the face this certainly had the desired effect , as the frenchman international nipped in front of john stones to flick home ozil 's corner in the 39th minute
much like the first half , roberto martinez 's side made a positive start after the break â luke garbutt 's dead - ball delivery causing arsenal 's defence problems
ozil should have eased the tension in the 80th minute after being sent clean through on goal by oxlade-chamberlain but the german 's shot was blocked by jagielka , before substitute tomas rosicky struck in the final minute to ensure arsene wenger could finally relax .
