for some reason , southgate could nât get over the first 25 minutes at the riverside stadium , even though england had beaten germany 3 - 2
england , he felt , were overawed by germany who looked a team of stars , passing smoothly in tight areas , winning cute free - kicks and making their experience tell
the numbers ? norwich 's nathan redmond , who scored england 's second goal , deserves a premier league return jesse lingard levelled for england to make it 1 - 1 in middlesbrough during an impressive victory ward-prowse hit the winner to give southgate 's men a tremendous win ahead of euro 2015 nathan redmond : west ham and stoke considered moves for the winger last summer
if he ca nât , others will be on alert
jack butland : just three fa games is not enough for england âs no 3 keeper since returning to stoke from his derby loan
the team horst hrubesch selected had 639 top - flight appearances between them ; the squad âs combined number was a staggering 977
how does the top - flight experience of the england starting xi measure up ? the figure is 230 , the squad âs total is 389
it gives credence to the point fa chairman greg dyke has made about young english players not getting sufficient opportunities but when you see the impressive way they tore into germany , it makes you wonder why some ca nât break through the glass ceiling
southgate was not happy with the first 25 minutes of england 's match against their german counterparts â we want to get the ball down and score lots of goals , â said ward-prowse , whose late goal defeated germany
â it âs also down to players putting in the effort
with 67 premier league appearances , he was the most experienced starter against germany and has benefited from being at southampton , where youth is given its head
so what about the rest ? experts talk about a team âs spine but england had four players â goalkeeper jonathan bond , ben gibson , jake forster-caskey and will hughes â in key positions who had never kicked a ball at the highest level
â the german federation said in 2002 they needed young german players to be playing regularly for their clubs to help the national team
but if not united , why not somewhere else in the premier league ? will anyone gamble on nathan redmond ? the norwich winger , who excelled against germany , believes the european under 21 championship has toughened him up since his side were relegated last may and a good showing in the finals this summer will help him
germany are the best team england have faced at this level since spain at euro 2011 , when they were chasing shadows before scrambling a 1 - 1 draw with a late danny welbeck goal
the performance against germany showed how much england have evolved and why they are genuine contenders to win the european under 21 championship , even if their numbers suggest they do nât have enough experience
