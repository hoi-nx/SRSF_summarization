the raf has spent Â£ 37million on bombing raids in its mission to smash isis and bring jihadi john 's network to its knees
an investigation by mailonline has unveiled the grand scale of the military effort against the terrorist group , including more than 100 airstrikes and 195 missiles fired
the bombings , carried out by britain âs fleet of warplanes and unmanned drones , have targeted more than 180 isis positions and have killed dozens of islamists so far in the six - month campaign
britain has used tornado gr4s at least 126 times in attacks on the militants , with each one flown from raf akrotiri in cyprus at an estimated cost of Â£ 35,000 an hour
brimstones - â smart bombs â which can pinpoint small targets in crowded areas - have been fired at least 54 times on trucks , buildings and groups of isis terrorists
britain has used tornado gr4s at least 126 times in attacks on the militants , with each raid flown from raf akrotiri in cyprus in pairs ( file picture ) weapons : at least 66 500lb paveways have been dropped on isis in iraq by the eight raf tornados in iraq strike : the targeted bombings have killed dozens of islamists so far in the six - month campaign meanwhile at least 66 500lb paveways have been dropped on isis in iraq by the eight tornados the raf has sent to the region
but this does not stop britain âs fleet of 10 unmanned reaper drones , which can locate and fire on small targets from as high as 45,000ft , from picking off isis convoys trying to take advantage of poor visibility
during 101 airstrikes on isis in iraq , the raf has fired : 75 hellfire missiles 66 paveway iv laser - guided bombs 54 brimstone missiles the drones use aptly - named hellfire missiles , which can incinerate targets in a burst of flames before they are even aware they are being fired upon and cost Â£ 46,000 a unit
the full Â£ 37million fight against isis does not include the costs of flying the drones , which are each worth around Â£ 8.5million , as their operation is shrouded in secrecy
critics have called for the raf mission to be stepped up , despite david cameron insisting that britain âs role in iraq is second only to that of the u.s.
aerial attack : reapers , which can fly for up to 30 hours before needing to refuel , have fired on the extremists 75 times during the raf mission the commons defence committee said the raf âs role in iraq was â surprisingly modest â and that the air force was only carrying out one strike a day
â britain has also provided 40 heavy machine guns to the kurdish , who are fighting against isis in iraq , but this pales in significance when compared to germany , which has sent more than 35,000 weapons to the fighters
while the mod does not comment on ongoing operations , its latest update on the strikes on isis says : â military support is just one part of the britain government âs contribution to the global coalition strategy to defeat isis â we are also taking action to counter the terrorist network âs finances , are restricting the flow of foreign fighters and have provided vital humanitarian relief to help those affected by isis âs brutality
â having previously provided military equipment to the iraq forces , britain plans to gift improvised explosive device ( ied ) detectors to help the iraq and kurdish soldiers protect themselves against the numerous improvised explosive devices on which isis are increasingly relying as they are forced back by successful offensives
