so far so good : the skydiver captures his fellow jumpers on their descent over perris , california but suddenly , the bridle , which connects the pilot chute â a small auxiliary parachute used to deploy the main parachute â to the deployment bag containing the parachute , wraps around the pilot chute
this sends the skydiver spiralling out of control , and he begins a dizzying descent back down to earth from a height of more than 1000ft
the skydiver 's reserve parachute , which is automatically deployed via an rsl system after cutting away from the main parachute , becomes tangled the skydiver is sent spiralling out of control and back down to earth at a height of more than 1000ft as he finally reaches the ground it appears that he is descending relatively slowly considering he is without a fully working parachute
the skydiver slams into the earth at a speed of around 25mph and groans in pain and shock the man was taken to the hospital where he was only treated for mild concussion and bruising
