apple and samsung made bets on fingerprint scanning for their flagship phones but fujitsu is taking a different route
the japanese firm has developed an iris authentication system that unlocks a smartphone screen by scanning your eyes
and its prototype can be used to log into facebook , email or other web services
the prototype ( pictured ) can be used to log into facebook , email or other web services the demo of the prototype is on display at mobile world congress in barcelona
â fujitsu âs new authentication method uses iris recognition , which is hard to forge and convenient to use , â the firm told mailonline
â the end of the password ? for its prototype ( demo pictured ) , fujitsu has built a miniature scanner so it fits on the front of a smartphone.it recognises the pattern by shining an infrared led light on the sensor onto the eyes and taking a picture of the patten with the infrared camera fujitsu has developed a â custom compact and high - output infrared led â , and a custom infrared camera
movements of the smooth muscle of the iris make the eye âs openings larger or smaller , which in turn adjusts the amount of light that enters the retina these were combined with fujitsu âs camera controller technology and biometric - authentication technology
it recognises the pattern by shining an infrared led light on the sensor into the eyes and taking a picture of the pattern with the infrared camera
each time they look at their phone , the sensor scans their eye , matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device
â the system can reliably authenticate the detailed patterns of the iris and that can be used in most everyday situations , â a spokesman for fujitsu told maionline â this can be used at a normal smartphone viewing distance , rather than within the 10cm range most existing iris recognition systems require
fujitsu âs technology recognises the pattern by shining an infrared led light on the sensor onto the eyes and taking a picture of the patten with the infrared camera
this pattern is registered and linked to the user and each time they look at their phone , the sensor scans their eye , matches it with the stored image and unlocks the device
