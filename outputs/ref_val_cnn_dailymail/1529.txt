rowan joyce , 52 , runs the south street coffee and ice cream shop in isleworth , middlesex , with her son tom
tom , 24 , started working at the business while on a summer holiday from exeter and enjoyed the role so much that he packed in his course and became joint manager of the store , taking control of the ice cream - making side of the business
rowan joyce ( left ) displays some of her home baked cakes , while tom shows off his ice cream ( right ) rowan joyce tells femail in her own words why she thinks her son made the right decision and explains how they have n't looked back since ... she says : every middle class mum wants her child to go to university and when tom got a place to read germany and philosophy at exeter i was thrilled
tom and rowan joyce ' i figured with tom if the worst came to the worst the language would always come in useful and he could get a job as an air steward ! ( yes , i had a brief spell as an air hostess myself ) ' we opened south street on an absolute shoe string and as tom was home for easter from exeter i employed him to help scrub floors , scrape walls , paint , paper and clean
' it was hard , boring , work and tom was not the best employee , he tended to get bored easily or give up if things got difficult
' i was paying him a wage so technically he should have done as he was told but if it 's your kid it 's not always as easy as all that : you have to maintain the relationship no matter what and you ca n't sack them ! ' a year on and the business was going well , having worked in retail management i was used to handling staff but i was surprised to find that staffing was turning into my biggest headache
' he was claiming to be ill , i was paying him sickness benefit and working seven days a week to provide cover and i discovered he was n't actually ill at all , he just did n't fancy coming into work
' the afternoon i finally got up the courage to sack him i was upset and worried , another staffing disaster , who could i turn to now ? who could i trust to love and understand my business as i did ? tom is very creative with his ice cream flavours ' south street demands a very personal touch , it 's all about word of mouth , friendships , trust and kindness
' there is very little footfall here and we rely on repeat business and word of mouth
' tom and i were doing american night that night : every so often we pick a food theme and sell 20 tickets to an evening meal
rowan joyce behind the counter at the shop ' we were in the backyard lighting the bbq when he told me that i did n't need to worry too much about finding another full timer : he was planning on giving up uni and working for me full time
surely i should be putting his education before my business ? ' i knew his father ( we 're divorced ) would be furious
he also wanted to be part of building the business
' i 'm very keen to get my other two children into the business but they are resisting for some reason ! ' it 's funny to think now but tom has always been a home bird
tom selling his ice cream on a summer afternoon ' he absolutely hated leaving me to go to nursery and although he got on well at school and had a lovely girlfriend for years he was never one for going out and socialising much , he just always liked being at home
' i guess south street is an extension of that , it is very cosy and homely ! ' tom took over the ice cream making which was a massive relief for me as it is very sticky , hard work and labour intensive
tom is brilliant at translating those ideas into ice cream
' i know i can trust him 100 per cent - he has bought shares in the business and although i am technically the boss ( i am his mum ! ) we have equal shares
south street coffee and ice cream shop in isleworth , middlesex ' he is as passionate about making south street work as i am , he loves our customers and our product as much as i do , we are family ! ' i know our customers really identify with us as a family business , they love the way we interact - although i was once accused of having an incestuous relationship with him ! ' it does have its down side ! if i get angry with him i get furious , and he is the same , we are both pretty volatile and he always knows how to drive me nuts
why would i give up a university degree to work with my mum ? let 's be honest , what 's the job market like for graduates nowadays ? not great
i believed in the product 100 per cent and still do : no one else is doing innovative , artisan gelato the way we do it , and our business growth speaks for itself : we now have a dedicated factory , as well as an art gallery / gift shop
