ford may be known for its cars , but at this year âs mobile world congress the auto giant also unveiled a pair of electric bikes
both prototypes are powered by 200 - watt motors , fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car , and with pedal assist , help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph ( 25km/h )
the bikes are part of an experiment by ford called handle on mobility , which aims to make journeys safer and more efficient
ford unveiled two prototype electric bikes at mobile world congress in barcelona
both the mode : me ( pictured ) and mode : pro are powered by 200 - watt motors , fold to fit on a train or in the boot of a car , and with pedal assist they help riders reach speeds of up to 15mph ( 25km/h ) they are also part of the company 's wider smart mobility plan , which is designed to make cars and other vehicles more connected
the bikes , called mode : me and mode : pro , are based on designs by ford employees and take inspiration from technology seen in cars
for example , both bikes are fitted with rear - facing ultrasonic sensors
these sensors link with the handlebars to discreetly alert the rider when a car is about to overtake using subtle vibrations
it folds and stows easily , allowing commuters to park outside the city , for example , take the e-bike onto public transport or a car and travel to the centre , then ride the e-bike to their destination both bikes have a slot for an iphone so an app can be used as a sat - van ( pictured left ) and show when a car is about to overtake ( pictured right ) , thanks to rear - facing ultrasonic sensors in the bike 's frame earlier this week ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining on an electric car , but bases its predictions on your unique driving style
both prototypes work with an called mode : link , which is currently only compatible with the iphone
this app acts as a sat - nav and sends vibrations to the handlebars so the rider knows when to change direction
both prototypes work with an called mode : link , which is currently only compatible with the iphone 6 its multimodal navigation and smart routing lets riders filter journeys based on cost , time , and the amount of cycling required , compared to driving
