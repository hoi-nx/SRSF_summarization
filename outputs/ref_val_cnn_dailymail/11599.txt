nelly managed to make a little history and support the troops battling isis on friday
it was all part of a charity concert put on by the rwanga foundation , a non-profit created to help those in the area , and in a press release the group claims that nelly is now ' the first american artist to perform in the city âs 8,000 year old history
some have taken to social media to say it would have been better if the money used to pay nelly to perform was just given to the troops also performing was arab idol âs ammar koofy some however are less than thrilled and have attacked the non-profit for paying nelly a reported six - figure appearance fee and not giving the money directly to displaced families and troops
