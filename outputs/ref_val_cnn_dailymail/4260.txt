a golden opportunity to register a rare victory on the pga tour slipped through the fingers of paul casey and poulter on monday
but their failure opened the door for an even more heart - warming outcome : victory for two - time open winner harrington at the second play - off hole of the honda classic at palm beach gardens in florida
the crushing decline of harrington has been documented well enough in the past six years
harrington celebrates his honda classic golf win on monday at palm beach gardens harrington tips his hat to the crowd as he walks to the green on the second playoff hole poulter plays his shot out of a bunker on the 14th hole during the honda classic with harrington in danger of falling outside the world âs top 300 , it seemed a mystery why he did nât put his name forward last month as a candidate to be europe âs captain at the ryder cup in minnesota next year
but the model irishman , now 43 , had the last word on monday with his first win in seven years on one of the two main tours
jack nicklaus opined that he could see tension in the harrington swing during the third round , which was hardly surprising given all the problems he âs had on the course these last few years
after yesterday âs win , harrington moves up to no 82 and qualifies for this year âs masters
and some of the putting woes that have contributed to his fall re-appeared during the final round , only for harrington to hold his nerve with a level - par 70 that set up the win
for poulter , who went into the water five times in a final round of 75 that left him tied third with paul casey , it means the long wait to register a stroke - play success on america soil , stretching back over 150 events and more than 10 years , goes on
harrington putts on the second playoff hole during the honda classic at pga national resort & spa the 39 - year - old has won stroke - play events in africa , asia , australia and europe , but his sole victory in the america came in the wgc-accenture match play championship in arizona in 2010
for poulter it brings to an end a miserable 15 months during which he has nât finished in the top 10 in tournaments , never mind win
