arsene wenger refused to be drawn into a discussion of arsenal 's premier league title chances after seeing them hold out to claim a hard - fought victory at newcastle
the gunners ' sixth successive league win left them just four points behind leaders chelsea , who have two games in hand , but arsene wenger is adopting a one - game - at - a - time approach to the closing stages of the campaign
he said : ' look , chelsea have a good security and at the moment , i feel they have enough cushion to be quite serene
arsene wenger has played down his side 's chances of winning the premier league title this season the arsenal boss believes chelsea have too much security at the top and are quite serene ' we have manchester city in front of us and behind us , it is tight as well - the only thing we can do is to win our games
' i think chelsea have too much security
' chelsea are four points clear of the gunners but have two games in hand on the rest of the chasing pack arsenal looked to be heading for a comfortable victory at st james ' park when oliver giroud struck twice inside four first - half minutes to give them a commanding 2 - 0 lead at the break
oliver giroud ( centre right ) pokes home the opener in an entertaining affair at st james ' park arsene wenger said : ' we have played four games in two weeks and three away games at manchester , in monaco and here today and we have won all the three
' the last 40 minutes were difficult because our legs had gone a little bit and newcastle played very well in the second half
' the in - form striker bagged a second from a corner to put arsenal into a commanding half - time lead but newcastle head coach carver , who had only one fit central defender for the game , was also able to take positives from a spirited fightback which he felt demonstrated the fact that his players have not started their summer holiday just yet
moussa sissoko ( right ) halved the deficit but despite late pressure newcastle 's poor start punished them when informed , carver said : ' that 's nice , i did n't realise that had happened
