battery life is consistently listed as a major flaw of smartphones , smartwatches and other wearables
but this problem could soon be solved thanks to technology that promises to extend battery life for ' decades
' atmel has released its latest microcontrollers ( mcu ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body
atmel has released its latest microcontrollers ( mcu ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body
atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' the ultra-low power sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32 - bit arm - based mcu range
during a demonstration of the microcontrollers to armdevices.net at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel
atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas
plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature
the firm said that the microcontroller itself can run for years on a single charge , but the battery life of the devices it is added to will depend on how much they are used
atmel 's current model is designed for smart household devices and other gadgets that use relatively low power , but the technology has the potential to one day run on more power - hungry gadgets such as phones and tablets .
