using similar methodology , olsen then took on the challenge of planning the best u.s. road trip - ensuring the car would never leave home soil on its route
there is a scheduled stop - off at the world famous prehistoric monument of stonehenge in wiltshire , uk each stop would be at a national natural landmark , national historic site , national park or national monument
to create the map , mr randy olsen first found the shortest distance by road between each of the 50 landmarks provided
