â reece asked me for some money to go on a fairground ride
he met up with a couple of school friends too
â but a short time later , one of reece 's friends raced back to say he had fallen from a ride
though i was worried , i was glad that at least it was n't as serious as i 'd feared
â reece lay on the ground , as we waited for an ambulance and i saw the fairground workers , picking up broken parts from the ride
â reece spent five days in a coma and a further ten days in hospital and missed his 15th birthday in hospital , doctors found reece was bleeding internally from his main artery
â they explained if they did n't operate he would bleed to death
his condition was still critical and he was taken into intensive care
she said : â i did n't leave the hospital for a week
even at home , he needed a wheelchair and was unable to look after himself
he had major surgery on his upper body and his ankle was in pieces too , so he just could n't move
â reece was in a wheelchair and it was five months before he returned to school
â to this day , he rarely goes out alone and wo n't go in a car without me
after his accident reece was in a wheelchair and it was five months before he returned to school â he has become anxious and old before his time
he ca n't walk past a fairground , let alone go on a ride again
