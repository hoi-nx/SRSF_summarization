twitter 's latest attempt to tackle the site 's problem with trolls is a ' quality filter '
the tool works in a similar way to its ' tailored notifications ' and involves scanning tweets for abusive or offensive words , threats or signs of harassment
it will automatically remove these tweets from a user 's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site
twitter 's ' quality filter ' will scan tweets for abusive or offensive words and threats
it will automatically remove these tweets from a user 's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site
it was spotted by twitter user dash ( pictured ) and is only currently available to verified users the tool was first spotted by twitter user dash who wrote : ' well , that 's an interesting and welcome addition , twitter ! ( was prompted about this on opening the app. ) ' mr dash is a verified twitter user , meaning he has a blue tick on his account
a twitter spokesman said the feature is only currently available for these verified users and did not reveal if it will be rolled out further
it is likely due to the fact such celebrities fall victim to more abuse and harassment than regular users , but twitter did not confirm this
the site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users reports recently claimed twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers
in the future , twitter may ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number twitter already lets people block , report or mute people who are sending them abusive messages
stories of abuse , threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on twitter in recent years
last month an internal memo sent by twitter 's chief executive costolo revealed the 51 - year - old thinks his site ' sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls '
in december , a blog post titled ' building a safer twitter ' revealed twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse
