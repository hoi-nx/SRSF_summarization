consumers may be eager to get their hands on samsung âs galaxy s6 edge with its curved screen
but a report hints that the south korean firm is already working on its next - level displays for a fully foldable smartphone
unlike the curved models available now , such as the s6 edge and lg âs flex 2 , samsung 's galaxy s7 could be flexible and bendy
a report hints that a fully foldable smartphone by samsung could be ready as soon as next year
this image shows prototype curved screens unveiled last year a spokesman for samsung display told business korea : â the industry believes that the commercialisation of foldable smartphones will be possible in 2016
â a number of the curved screens , including those created by lg and samsung , use high molecular substance - based polyimide film
however , until other components such as batteries and processors are made to be flexible too , the dream of a roll - up smartphone will remain on the horizon
it is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment , as bendy displays could have many uses , such as in smartbands and laptops , for example
a spokesman from the industry said : â when flexible display technology is being used in e-books and laptops , which are substituted for publications , the concept of tiny portable pcs and e-books will be realised in reality
last year , lg demonstrated a 5.9 - inch display that can be bent more than 100,000 times without being damaged , at an exhibition in tokyo
it is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment , as bendy displays could have many uses , such as in smartbands ( illustrated ) and laptops , for example the foldable display is made of layers of lights using organic light emitting diodes ( oled )
