mccall 's nearest and dearest knew what his reaction would be in the event of rangers calling
now 10 days into the job and confronted by his third and most difficult match , a barrage of advice from those friends and family has landed
two dismal draws against relegation candidates livingston and alloa , stretching the winless run to five matches , has damned the playing provision at ibrox now operating under their third manager of a sorry season that mccall was hired to rescue
he has not been short of suggestions aimed at helping him carry out that brief picked up from kenny
â i âve got family and a lot of friends who are rangers supporters and , if it was up to them , they would nât have a team out there because everyone would be dropped , â said mccall
â if you speak to supporters , they are so frustrated and disappointed
mccall has encountered a tricky start to his spell as rangers manager â you speak to one fan who would nât have him in , and another who would nât have him in , and so on
kenny tried all different permutations up front with our five strikers
it âs the same with the backline and the midfield
â the emergency work on a squad ravaged by a confidence slump is required for many reasons and some can be traced back to the recruitment â on bumper contracts â of several top - flight players who have failed to live up to being rangers players even at a lower level
but mccall believes that a more recent explanation for the disarray in his inheritance , which includes four unfit newcastle loan men , is that their direct competitors for promotion â and today âs opponents hibernian â were able to be clever in january
rangers , meanwhile , were chaotic
hibernian have won their past seven games in all competitions since deadline day , reached the scottish cup semi-final and are now unbeaten in 15 matches â a streak of results that stuttering rangers have at no stage looked capable of stringing together
mccall joked that if his family and friends had their way that everybody would be dropped mccall noted : â the key thing for them was the january transfer window when they managed to keep their best young player , scott allan , while we had to sell lewis macleod , who was ours
â while they were doing that , rangers brought in five players from newcastle and only one of them has been able to play a part
â mccall dug into the reserve reaches of the squad to promote the impressive 18 - year - old tom walsh
as mccall seeks that winning formula , he has a frustrated and often frustrating figure offering to be an intriguing ingredient today on a return to easter road
â i spoke to dean before we picked him for the alloa game , â said mccall
new boss mccall takes charge of a rangers training session â i know there are players here who want to be in my team
â next season , rangers need young , hungry players
he can bid to be as energetic and vibrant as mccall wishes but it is defensive fortitude that the boyhood hibernian supporter will be determined to bring today to a rangers team that have lost their past three to the capital club
rangers have limped to unconvincing draws against livingston and alloa under mccall â we âve conceded too many goals
â to be fair to the previous manager and this manager , their hands have been forced a bit of the time because of injuries
â i want my first season at rangers to be capped with promotion
