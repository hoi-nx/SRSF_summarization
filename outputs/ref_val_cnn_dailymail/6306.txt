labour and cameron 's tories remain neck and neck , despite the conservatives being ahead in the polls tomorrow the queen dissolves parliament and the election campaign begins
it will be the strangest election of modern times and leaves the experts baffled
most expected that , with economic recovery , and cameron ahead of miliband in the polls as favoured prime minister , the tories would pull ahead
labour and the tories remain neck and neck
the weakening of the two party system makes a hung parliament very likely
but , curiously , a small overall majority for the tories or labour could prove even more unstable than a hung parliament
the tories would be at the mercy of their eurosceptic right wing , as john major was in 1992
a labour government with a small majority would be at the mercy of its left wing which opposes austerity
labour , contrary to conservative propaganda , is committed not to a splurge in public spending , but to public expenditure cuts , though less severe than cameron and osborne are proposing
but labour austerity would disappoint the expectations of its supporters , many of whom look for rapid improvements in the nhs and social care
speaking two weeks ago at the london school of economics , nicola sturgeon , the snp leader , advised england voters to support the greens or what she called â progressive â labour candidates , that is candidates opposed to austerity
she hopes to create an anti-austerity bloc in the next parliament , composed of the snp , greens and left - wing labour
but it has , and with a comfortable majority of 78 in the commons it has never really looked in danger of being brought down in parliament
the snp , which may well win many seats , will not deal with the tories and will not join labour in a coalition
this would mean that no two parties â other than the tories and labour â could command a majority
the last minority government following a general election occurred in february 1974 after ted heath had gone to the country in the middle of a miners â strike asking the voters to decide â who governs ? â the voters , however , refused to give a clear answer and , in the fragmented hung parliament that followed , labour governed as a minority for seven months
there was then a second general election in october at which labour won a small majority
the longest - lasting was between 1929 and 1931 , but that was buttressed for part of the time by a pact between labour and the liberals
under our electoral system , farage 's ukip and the greens are unlikely to win many seats in the past , the prime minister could try , as labour did in 1974 , to escape from the minority situation by dissolving parliament
besides , there is no reason to believe a second general election would , as in 1974 , deliver a majority government
alex salmond ( pictured ) and nicola sturgeon are doing to labour in scotland what farage is doing to the tories in england the typical ukip supporter is not , as we used to think , disgusted of tunbridge wells , a retired army officer spluttering over his gin and tonic at the 19th hole , but a working - class voter or small businessman or shopkeeper who feels betrayed and belittled by the system
blair âs labour sought to win over graduates and middle - class professionals â those who aspired to leave the working class
labour areas in the west central belt around glasgow voted â yes â to independence , while middle - class snp areas in perthshire and aberdeenshire voted â no â
alex salmond and nicola sturgeon are doing to labour in scotland what farage is doing to the tories in england
the snp could well be the third - largest party in the next parliament , even though it will probably secure fewer votes than the lib dems , ukip and the greens
