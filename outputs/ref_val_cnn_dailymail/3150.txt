rory needs tiger to play in the masters to help ease the burden of expectation from his shoulders as he chases a career grand slam , says mcginley
ten years after that chip - in and his fourth - and last - masters triumph , the world could be denied the latest episode of the tiger soap opera at augusta
rory ( pictured ) needs tiger to help ease the burden of expectation , says mcginley mcginley feels rory could benefit from woods playing in the masters to help ease the expectation some might think rory could gain from tiger 's absence but others , such as mcginley , disagree the man now being widely hailed as europe 's most astute ryder cup captain , when asked whether it will be easier for rory if tiger plays the masters , said : ' of course
look what happened at the us pga last year , all the talk was " is tiger going to play , is he not going to play ? " rory was favourite , but all the expectation , all the talk , was focused on tiger
' woods , nine months shy of his 40th birthday , will fall outside the world 's top 100 when ( or if ) he gets to augusta - his worst ranking since before he won his first tournament as a 20 - year - old in 1996
there 's no doubt tiger has peaked , in age times , and in terms of when guys normally play their best golf
mcginley , the victorious ryder cup captain , speaks with the media at gleneagles in september 2014 mcginley feels rory needs tiger to play in the masters to take the pressure off of him ' it 's not just the wear and tear on your mind and body , having performed at a very high intense level with scrutiny like tiger 's had for 20 years
victory at augusta would secure rory 's first green jacket - four years after his infamous final - round meltdown - and a seat among the golfing gods
at the age of just 25 , rory could join sarazen , hogan , snead , nicklaus , player and tiger himself as only the sixth man to win all four majors
mcginley , however , is keen to point out that rory is blessed with an exceptional maturity
woods , nine months shy of turning 40 , will fall outside the world 's top 100 when - or if - he gets to augusta tiger faces his worst ranking since before he won his first tournament as a 20 - year - old in 1996 ' it 's incredible how much he gets it , how mature he is for such a young guy
' although rory now wears tiger 's crown , he is not yet a superstar like the us
the world is waiting to see whether rory can claim his place in history , but it is desperate to answer the burning question : is tiger really finished ? ' i do hope tiger comes back , we all hope tiger comes back , ' says mcginley , who will be at the masters commentating for sky sports , the only place to watch all four days live
