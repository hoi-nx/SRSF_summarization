the snp will force ed miliband to abandon planned spending cuts from labour 's very first budget if the party holds the balance of power after the election , alex salmond said today
the former scottish first minister said the snp would hold all ' the power ' if a labour government needed its votes to survive â and even claimed the party 's surge in support showed it had been the real winner of last year 's independence referendum
he said the party would demand an end to austerity â with billions of pounds more borrowing and debt â as the price of propping mr ed miliband up in power
appearing alongside the former scottish first minister on the bbc 's andrew marr show , ms anna soubry said : ' the thought that we are in a position where you can be actually controlling in the way that you have described this uk fills me with absolute horror
we are a uk , that is what the people of scottish wanted
he said it would be ' very good for scottish ' if there was a decisive number of snp mps after may 7 , adding : ' if you hold the balance , then you hold the power , ' he said
asked if that meant ed balls or another labour chancellor would have to negotiate their budget with the snp , he replied : ' yes , any minority government has to negotiate in order to win a majority for its proposal
' if the snp are in these circumstances it will be very good for scottish , certainly
' tory defence minister anna soubry said mr alex salmond 's remarks were ' terrifying '
ed miliband has vowed not to form a formal coalition with the snp after the elction ' i think there is lots of people - certainly lots of people in scottish
mr alex salmond said he believed scottish independence was now ' near inevitable ' , and hinted that a commitment to a new referendum could be included in the snp manifesto for the 2016 elections north of the border
' what you have to have is a party or parties have to put it in their manifesto for the scottish election , they have to win a majority in that proportional parliament to hold a referendum and then the decision of course lies with the scottish people
' labour leader murphy said the snp would have ' no bargaining chips ' to control a minority government headed by ed miliband as they had already ruled out working with the tory pushed on whether renewing trident was a ' red line ' for the snp that would prevent a deal with labour , mr alex salmond said : ' you could n't have a coalition or a confidence and supply , but a vote by vote is what comes up in the house of commons
' labour leader murphy said the snp would have ' no bargaining chips ' to control a minority government headed by ed miliband as they had already ruled out working with the tory
and he warned scottish that they could not vote snp to get a labour government ' by proxy '
' it is either labour or the tory
' asked about polls suggesting labour faces losing dozens of seats to the snp in scottish , mr murphy admitted his party had not been ' good enough ' over recent years
' john lamont msp , scottish conservative chief whip said : ' four weeks before postal ballots go out , alex salmond is taking the votes of people in scottish for granted and planning back - room deals with labour from a tv sofa in london
' that would mean the snp holding a weak labour party to ransom on every vote , every day , all with the aim of trying to weaken the uk
