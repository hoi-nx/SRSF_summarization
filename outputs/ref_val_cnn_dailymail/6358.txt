fierce fighting between islamic state militants and soldiers from the army has forced 28,000 residents of the iraqi city of tikrit to flee their homes in recent days
more than 30,000 army soldiers are currently fighting isis militants in the suburbs of tikrit , or are otherwise making their way towards the city alongside tens of thousands of iran - backed shia volunteer militias , many of whom are accused of carrying out isis - style atrocities themselves
although the troops are aiming to liberate the city from isis control , many of the predominantly sunni population have spent the past few days cutting up white clothes and fabric to make flags of surrender , fearing the shia armies even more than their terrorist occupiers
