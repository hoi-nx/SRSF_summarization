they are extraordinary treasure troves , stuffed full of some of the greatest works of art that britain has ever produced
but the national trust now wants its stately homes to have fewer exhibits â because they are too demanding on visitors
the charity , which owns 500 historic homes and gardens , is worried that rooms often have â so much stuff â it puts off all but the middle classes
national trust , which owns 500 historic homes and gardens such as cliveden house in buckinghamshire , is worried that exhibitions often have â so much stuff â it puts off all but the middle classes in an attempt to try to broaden the appeal of britain âs grand properties , bosses yesterday launched a ten - year strategy that includes plans to â simplify â some exhibits
â we are making visitors work too hard in some places , â she said â it âs not surprising given that where we have come from , that the type of places that we own are the places where the middle classes feel more comfortable , that it forms more of their cultural background
â our analysis is that it is nât the entrance fee that is putting people off , it is that they think this is nât â the place for them â so how do we get them in ? â the national trust 's director general dame dame helen , said places like the carrick-a-rede bridge attracts visitors from all social classes dame dame helen , who was permanent secretary of the home office until she was appointed to the national trust in 2012 , said that some properties have a broader appeal
but many of the large stately homes have a far narrower visitor base
â let âs not expect our visitors to look at every single picture in a room - let â s pick one lovely thing , put it in the middle of the room and light it really well
â but she denied that the national trust is â dumbing down â its approach in order to boost visitor numbers
â parker , chairman of the national trust , added : â every museum and gallery has the middle class problem
â the fantastic opportunity for the national trust is that we are not confined to buildings - we have lots of parks - people do nât have to go inside , â he said
