natural england 's first wild beavers for 800 years were last night released back onto a river in devon , after passing vital health tests
the animals were captured for a series of tests last month , after natural england gave unprecedented permission for them to be allowed to live free near ottery st mary , east devon
four adults and a juvenile were certified as free of disease , and will rejoin four young kits which had remained on the river otter
ministers had initially wanted the remarkable animals to be rounded up and put in a zoo or even culled after they were first spotted in late 2013
but government agency natural england has decided they will instead be allowed to stay in the wild in the first project of its kind
devon wildlife trust âs peter burgess said last night : â today âs re-release means that these beavers are back where they belong , in the wild on the river otter
close to freedom : the devon wildlife trust said : â we âre delighted that [ the otters ] have coped very well with a short period in captivity and been given a clean bill of health ( moment prior to release , pictured ) government agency natural england ruled that as long as the beavers were disease - free , they could remain on the rover otter ( newly freed otter shown in its natural habitat ) beavers build dams to flood areas and provide ponds
â they âve tested free of serious infectious diseases and we âre now looking forward to starting the next phase of our work : studying the long term effects of these wild beavers on the local landscape , on local communities and local wildlife
â beavers , which are native to natural england , were plentiful in our countryside until they were wiped out by hunters in the middle ages
they vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until , mysteriously , one was spotted near ottery st mary some 18 months ago
it later became clear that there were in fact nine beavers , of three different generations , living on the river otter
idyllic : beavers , which are native to natural england , were plentiful in our countryside ( river otter pictured ) until they were wiped out by hunters in the middle ages dna tests also confirmed the family were eurasian beavers - the species originally native to the uk - rather than north american beavers ( here one of the english family is pictured while in captivity during tests ) tests , carried out by beaver experts from the royal zoological society of scotland over the last few days , revealed the animals were free of bovine tb and a parasitic tapeworm that can cause serious harm in humans at home : officials had originally said that the wild family ( one member , pictured ) posed a risk to other wildlife , and might spread parasites and disease , and should be caged or killed the beavers ' impact on the surrounding landscape ( dam in river otter , pictured ) , fish stocks and landowners including farmers , will also be monitored over the coming years peter burgess of the devon wildlife trust said the beavers could have a hugely beneficial impact on rivers , reducing numbers of trees on the banks , improving light levels , and reducing flood risk by controlling water flow with their dams
natural england , the government agency in charge of wildlife , ruled that as long as the beavers were disease - free , they could remain on the rover otter
they vanished from our rivers and wetlands for centuries until , mysteriously , one was spotted near ottery st mary in eastern devon last winter
tests , carried out by beaver experts from the royal zoological society of scotland over the last few days , revealed the animals were free of bovine tb and a parasitic tapeworm that can cause serious harm in humans
at its conclusion in 2020 , the project will present natural england with its evidence and decide the future of the beavers
the four adults and a juvenile were certified as free of disease , and will rejoin four young kits which had remained on the river otter ( map shown ) the reason for the beavers â ( pictured ) presence in devon remains a mystery
