mccall has confirmed rangers are paying money for all five newcastle loanees - despite two of them being highly unlikely to ever appear for the ibrox club
sturat mccall has revealed that rangers are paying some of the wages for the five players signed on loan from newcastle in the january window even though only one of them is available at the moment of the five players loaned from newcastle , only haris vuckic will again be available for sunday 's crunch championship encounter with hibernian after recovering from a calf knock
the only further first - team involvement has come from centre - back remie streete , who managed 44 minutes against raith last month before succumbing to a hamstring injury
youngster kevin , who has never played a senior game , is involved with rangers â under - 20 squad , but mccall revealed midfielder gael bigirimana has been ruled out for the season by an unspecified â medical condition â
the new ibrox boss is also highly sceptical about ever having northern ireland international shane ferguson available , as he recovers from a knee injury on tyneside
asked if the quintet were on rangers wage bill , mccall replied : â yes
mccall prepares the rangers players for sunday 's clash with hibernian even so , the fact so little value has been earned will outrage rangers fans
â biggi ( bigirimana ) has a medical condition that our consultant is dealing with , â said mccall
â shane ferguson has had a long - standing serious knee injury , i think he âs been out for four or five months
mccall faces the media on friday ahead of the crucial clash with second place hibernian â remie streete came and played the first game and pulled his hamstring , was out for a couple of weeks then came back and pulled his thigh
â the current state of play begs the question as to whether rangers can simply send those not available back to newcastle
â certainly two of them - biggi and shane ferguson - would be very doubtful , unless shane ferguson recovers very quickly from his long - term knee operation
