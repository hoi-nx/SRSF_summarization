in his first interview since islamic state militants burned alive a jordanians pilot , the the king of jordanians spoke to cnn 's zakaria about why and how the country is going after the terror group
last december , isis captured royal jordanian air force pilot al-kasasbeh after his plane went down during airstrikes that were part of the u.s. - led coalition to defeat the group
for more than a month , al-kasasbeh 's family , hailing from a high - ranking tribe considered especially loyal to jordanians 's royal family , implored isis to let him go
abdullah , an instrumental supporter of the global coalition , then said jordanians would be relentless in retaliating against isis
to zakaria , abdullah reiterated his commitment to stop isis
the the king told zakaria that he did n't watch the video of the pilot 's slaying
" i -- many of us refused to see what i think is propaganda , " abdullah said
he felt " disgust , sadness for the family " and his " heart went out to the father , the mother , the brothers , the sisters , " the the king continued
( i felt ) anger as the son of the arab army , jordanians armed forces
" all soldiers past and present were disgusted by the brutality of what moath was put through , " abdullah said
during his interview with zakaria , the the king repeatedly referred to isis , the isis and syria , as daesh
many in the middle east prefer to use daesh because , to them , the acronym isis suggests the terror group is a legitimate state
" i think if isis , or daesh as we call them , try to intimidate jordanians ... just ( has ) the reverse effect , " abdullah said
" the pilot 's killing " just motivated jordanians to rally around the flag , " he said
" isis is " always trying to intimidate , scare , put fear in people 's hearts , " the the king told zakaria
" " the barbarity with the way they executed our brave hero ( the pilot ) , i think , shocked the muslim world , especially jordanians and people from this region , " abdullah said
in the wake of the pilot 's death , a jordanians government spokesman vowed an " earthshaking retaliation
" zakaria asked abdullah if jordanians 's action has lived up to that fiery rhetoric
the war against isis is as much jordanians 's war as that of any other country in the coalition , he said
" isis can not argue that jordanians and other muslim nations should not attack them because they 're fellow muslims , he said
" what about the hundreds if not thousands of muslims they have killed in syria and iraq over the past year and a half ? " jordanians has a " responsibility to reach out to eastern syria " and to western iraq where people have been " executed in large numbers " by isis , abdullah insisted
" zakaria asked abdullah what he thinks about the perception some have that syria president al-assad is interested in combating isis , meaning al-assad and abdullah have common enemies
the the king told zakaria that the " history of dealing with " the al-assad regime and the " history of dealing with " isis are two separate things
