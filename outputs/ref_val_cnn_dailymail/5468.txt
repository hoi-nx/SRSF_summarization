new ruling : all eu countries will have to cut the use of throwaway â plastic poison â carrier bags by 80 per cent following a vote yesterday all eu countries will have to cut the use of throwaway â plastic poison â carrier bags by 80 per cent following a vote yesterday
the decision represents a victory for daily mail readers and the â banish the bags â campaign , which launched in february 2008 with the backing of groups from the national trust to the campaign to protect rural england
member states have set the 28 countries of the eu a deadline of 2025 to meet the target which can be achieved through the introduction of bans or charges
the uk is already on course to meet this target following decisions by the devolved governments in scotland , wales and northern ireland , which have already have a system of charges
england is set to follow suit with a 5p levy on the plastic bags in october after supermarkets failed to meet pledges to reduce bag numbers through voluntary schemes
pollution and litter expert at the mcs , dr sue kinsey , welcomed the eu vote , as a â useful first step â in the reduction in single use plastic bags
bizarrely , the uk government was among those that opposed the idea of a mandatory charge across all eu states
the mcs is also concerned that the bag charge scheme for england will not be as effective as those in wales , scotland and northern ireland
the decision represents a victory for daily mail readers and the â banish the bags â campaign , which launched in february 2008 ith the backing of groups from the national trust to the campaign to protect rural england there , families have found no significant problems in switching to re-usable bags and baskets for their shopping
