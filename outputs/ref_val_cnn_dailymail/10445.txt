when england crashed out of the last global limited - overs tournament there was just the small matter of a dead rubber against the netherlands to complete what had been a hugely disappointing world twenty20
fast forward 10 months and here we are again amid more recriminations over another lost campaign and a final match , this time against afghanistan , where england have far more to lose than just a meaningless group match
england coach peter moores and batting coach mark ramprakash watch over training on wednesday the world cup flops form a huddle on the sydney as they prepare to face afghanistan indications are peter moores will keep his job , at least for the test series in the caribbean , whatever happens at the sydney on friday morning but the last thing he needs is another humiliating loss against another of the â minnows
â the fact england turned up early on wednesday for what used to be known as naughty boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their desperate need to take something , anything , from their worst ever world cup
peter moores ( centre back ) looks set to keep his job at least until after the test series in the west indies victory against an afghanistan side who have made a remarkable journey from the refugee camps of pakistan to be here would barely regain any pride for an england team who are still coming to terms with what they have done
but for peter moores it would perhaps keep the wolves away from his door for just a short while before he helps put the finishing touches to a squad for the three - test series in the west indies next month that will be named on tuesday
england will be without moeen ali and chris woakes , two players who can still expect a one - day future , when they face afghanistan and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to st kitts on april 2
senior england paceman stuart broad warms up with a rugby ball on the sydney during their session in the sun in their absence it is to be hoped england give games to the two players yet to appear in this world cup in tredwell and bopara , not least before both could then be making their final one - day international appearances
a dead rubber against afghanistan is hardly the way all of them would have wanted to bow out but at least they will be meeting a team with an identical world cup record as themselves â just a single victory against scotland
history repeating ? england will be eager to avoid a repeat to their loss to netherlands ( pictured ) in their world t20 group dead rubber when the same scenario is presented to them on friday against afghanistan moles has been in charge of a team who have defeated england before â when he coached new zealand in the champions trophy â and would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland
