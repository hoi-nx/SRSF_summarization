it is the game which , ultimately , could define the success or otherwise of o'neill and keane âs expensive ireland tenure
installed amid much fanfare 18 months ago , Â£ 1million - per - year o'neill and his assistant keane â with a Â£ 600,000 salary - were given a remit of qualification for euro 2016 , a task made easier by the expansion to a 24 - team format
defeat against poland at the aviva stadium on sunday , however , would all but render redundant any hope of automatic progression to next summer âs finals in france
aiden mcgeady jokes with ireland assistant keane during a training session earlier this week sunderland defender john o'shea catches a bib as the side prepare for the crucial qualifier against poland the mood here in dublin is not one of optimism
an inquest , you feel , awaits o'neill and his regime should they fail to beat the group leaders
o'neill , meanwhile , has kept all talk to football
o'neill addresses his squad at the training session as they bid to go level with poland in group d the ireland players are out through their paces in preparation for the euro 2016 clash â i âve said all along that the home games will shape our destiny
â o'neill , whose fourth - placed side trail poland by three points , added : â we can change all of that ( negative talk ) with one result and one fantastic performance
â we have given ourselves a chance ( of qualification ) but we will have to be right on top of our game to win this match
â one criticism of o'neill is that he does not know his preferred xi or , indeed , formation
o'neill is hoping to banish all the negativity around the squad with a result against poland one player not guaranteed to start is captain robbie keane
the la galaxy striker , 34 , was sat next to o'neill at saturday 's pre-match press conference and was diplomatic when pressed on his possible exclusion
â that âs up to the manager ( if i play ) , â he said
â lose and it could prove an awfully long three months for o'neill before they face scotland back in dublin
