england are the embarrassment of the world cup after a third humiliating defeat in three matches against australia , new zealand and sri lanka
sportsmail 's panel of experts â hussain , lloyd , cricket correspondent newman and cricket writer and wisden editor booth â discuss the big questions arising from another world cup failure
england captain eoin morgan plays a shot during the world cup match against sri lanka in wellington england gary ballance ( front ) loses his wicket to sri lanka 's tillakaratne dilshan during the world cup match is there any hope left for england at this world cup ? hussain : if there is , it 's because of the ridiculous format of this tournament
that should not be possible after the way england have stunk the tournament out
lloyd : realistically , no. it 's sad to see so much effort going into plans and strategy that just do not fit in modern international cricket
root bats for england during their match against sri lanka at wellington regional stadium england have slumped to three straight world cup defeats against australia , new zealand and sri lanka can anything be done in the short - term ? hussain : they need variety in their bowling , and a more attacking no 3
ravi bopara offers something different , and james tredwell is england 's best off - spinner
england just do not seem to rate hales and if that is the case what is he doing here ? if he does not play in adelaide on monday they might as well send him home
so many people in the game say he should have been in the 50 - over team for the past 18 months ! england batsman jos buttler ducks a delivery against sri lanka at the wellington regional stadium sri lanka batsman lahiru thirimanne ( left ) dives to make his crease just in time against england and what about the long - term ? hussain : there 's no easy fix
give hales 20 one - dayers to see what he 's made of
england need to work towards as separate a one - day team as possible , leaving jimmy anderson and stuart broad , to name two , to focus on tests
i know split coaches did n't work last time but england prioritised test cricket then
they have to give equal billing to 50 and 20 - over cricket from now
booth : england have to accept , finally , that the game has changed , and back more youngsters â the likes of jason roy and james vince
but the problem runs deeper : england is inherently a test nation
lloyd : england need to show imagination in selection
i 'd implore england to look at how other teams are doing it â people like australian glenn maxwell , corey anderson of new zealand and the dynamic australian duo of david warner and aaron finch
sam billings ( pictured in january 2015 ) has been backed by newman to help reinvent the england set - up 24 - year - old jason roy ( pictured playing for surrey in june 2014 ) , is another name being mooted for england what do you think of eoin morgan as captain ? hussain : i 've been disappointed with the way he 's become infected with management - speak
but you do need a plan , and a captain 's only as good as his bowling attack
he should be criticised for playing in the ipl rather than leading england against ireland in may
eoin morgan was given just the tri-series in australia to prepare
what did the ecb expect ? lloyd : i like eoin morgan immensely but i shudder at the interviews he 's giving
eoin morgan 's form for england has come under particular scrutiny during england 's woeful world cup campaign does peter moores still have much to prove as coach ? hussain : yes , lots
he 's partly a victim of england 's one - day struggles , but it 's a worry to see some players going backwards
england 's disappointing world cup has raised questions over the future of coach peter moores can kevin pietersen really play for england again ? hussain : i 've always believed in picking the best side , then man - managing it
but i feel there 's too much baggage with kevin pietersen now
but the focus should be on england 's one - day team , not kevin pietersen
the suggestion is that nothing has changed regarding kevin pietersen but graves ' clumsy words undermined the management while the ecb 's attempt to distance themselves from his comments by talking about ' positive influences ' just made it worse
booth : would he really have saved england at the world cup ? he played nine odis in 2013 and averaged 28
lloyd : if it is going to happen kevin pietersen must be playing county cricket â red - ball and white - ball
if he commits to the english game and scores heavily then he should be back in the mix. whether or not kevin pietersen should return to the england set - up remains a hotly contested debate sportsmail experts are skeptical that 34 - year - old kevin pietersen 's return would necessarily improve england
