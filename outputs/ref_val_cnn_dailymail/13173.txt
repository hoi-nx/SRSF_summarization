the devastating event took place on our planet many millions of years ago , but researchers are only now beginning to discover what happened
in a remote part of australia , the two pieces of asteroid left what geophysicists say is the largest impact zone ever found on earth , spreading over an area 400 kilometers ( 250 miles ) wide
traces are buried more than 2 kilometers inside the earth 's crust , under an area near the borders of south australia , queensland and the northern territory
" there are two huge deep domes in the crust , formed by the earth 's crust rebounding after the huge impacts , and bringing up rock from the mantle below , " glikson said
the researchers are still trying to figure out just how long ago the shattering event happened
a big meteorite strike that is believed to have led to the extinction of many dinosaur species 66 million years ago launched a plume of ash into the air that now shows up as a layer of sediment in rocks
but the researchers say they have n't come across a similar layer in sediments from about 300 million years ago
