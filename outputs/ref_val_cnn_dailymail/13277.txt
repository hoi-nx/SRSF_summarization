a decision last week to ax the popular ole miss chancellor dan jones rippled into wednesday with demonstrations at the oxford campus , powerful alumni denouncing the decision and wealthy donors threatening to withhold funding to the school
" english , a chef and restaurateur who has met the chancellor , called dan jones " a man of integrity " who " cares deeply about the university
" while the state board that voted not to renew his contract , which expires in september , cited " concerns centered on financial issues at the ummc , " the chancellor 's advocates feel something sinister is at play
dan jones was magnanimous in his response , saying that while he was disappointed not to be granted another four - year term , he was proud of his accomplishments and every disagreement he had with the board was the product of both parties trying to do what 's best for the school
" over the last couple of years , i have expressed concern and disagreement with the board in some areas , including the funding allocation plan that distributes state funds to various public universities , business issues at the medical center , and responsibility for managing the selection process for the position of vice chancellor to lead the medical center
" dan jones has been at the university 's helm since 2009 , when he took over for another popular leader , khayat , who retired
to hear dan jones ' supporters tell it , he 's ushered in an era of unprecedented gpas , test scores , enrollment and fund - raising , including three straight years of nine - figure gifts to the school
" unfortunately for his alma mater , english said , that good ol ' boy network " caught ( dan jones ) in jackson
" when the board -- fresh on the heels of dan jones completing a reportedly successful round of chemotherapy for his lymphoma -- decided in a 9 - 2 decision not to renew his contract , the outcry was loud ( though the board and dan jones concur the decision was unrelated to his health )
a protest wednesday brought more than 2,500 dan jones supporters to the lyceum , event co-organizer borst said
" " chancellor dan jones has always made himself available to students and always done what 's in our best interest , " borst said
khayat and famous alumni -- such as former new orleans saints quarterback ( and peyton and eli 's dad ) archie manning and author john grisham -- decried the move , as did numerous university groups , including the faculty senate , staff council , alumni association and black student union
and that decision could cost the university at least $ 20 million from one donor alone , as the newspaper reports that anthony papa , president of the gertrude c. ford foundation , said he would not move forward with the grant for a new science building if dan jones was n't reinstated
borst said this explanation has n't given ole miss students enough information to understand why dan jones wo n't be reinstated
