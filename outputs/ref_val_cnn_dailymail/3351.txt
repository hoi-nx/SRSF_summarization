a couple 's adventure touring the beautiful wildlife of africa is set to be documented in a stunning new photobook
kym , 53 , and tonya illman , 47 , from perth , australia , utilised remote controlled camera buggies , hidden cameras and quad - copters among other things , to portray african wildlife in different ways
' the photographs , including this cheetah at a lion park in zimbabwe , will be documented in a 204 - page book set to be launched on safari ' kickstarter imminently the battery operated 4wd camera buggy was custom made to carry a canon 5d mark 3 camera with a 16 - 35mm lens the wildlife - loving australia the buggy primarily on private game reserves or conservancies with the approval of the guide or game reserve manager ; here eland run towards the camera the couple have spent more than 22 weeks in africa over the past two years alone , photographing for the book and have got frighteningly close to an array of wildlife
they did n't so tonya illman quickly mounted a camera on a monopod and connected a remote shutter
i lowered the monopod through the open window and when the lion came closer and started pawing it gently , tonya illman clicked the remote shutter - my lower hand just 50cm from its paw
' kym , 53 , and tonya illman , 47 , from perth , australia , manage to show their love for africa with their stunning photography skills mobile cameras and video cameras capture the wildlife in their natural habitat ; pictured here are buffalo in zimbabwe a gorilla in rwanda makes the final cut in the australia couple 's beautiful set of wildlife photographs the pair , who immersed themselves in photography four years ago , have also used a quad - copter
' a number of aerial shots feature in the book , shots that many years ago would have been impossible to capture , ' said mr illman
' unfortunately , a couple of countries have limited the use of drones over the past 12 months so these shots will be harder to acquire in the future
' mr illman 's wife had been to africa in the 90 's but it took her two decades to convince him to join her on a second safari
he said : ' tonya illman thought i would love it but for decades i resisted
then one day , she called me at work and said , ' i 've decided we 're taking the boys ( then aged 10 and 12 ) on safari in africa
since then the illmans have shot more than a quarter of a million images and have settled on 143 of their best to feature in this large format book , africa on safari , to be published by london - based papadakis publisher and released later this year
kym can be a little disorganised and when you have 3,000 images to wade through at day 's end , my organisational skills come to the fore
