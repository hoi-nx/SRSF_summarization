a republicans - led congressional committee created to look into the 2012 benghazi , libya terror attacks has formally asked democratic former secretary of state clinton to deliver her now - famous secret email server to a neutral third party for examination
the same committee has already subpoenaed the emails of ' close to a dozen ' people who worked in the state department for clinton when she was secretary of state , the chairman of the u.s. house committee investigating the 2012 benghazi attacks said on thursday
south carolina rep. trey gowdy , the committee 's chairman , wrote to clinton 's lawyer to say he expects her to give the email server to the state department 's inspector general or another unbiased examiner for an independent determination of which emails and other records should be in the public domain â or at least archived by the government
he gave clinton an april 3 deadline to make a decision , saying he would urge house speaker john boehner to take action if she ignores his request
' hand it over : south carolina republicans rep. trey gowdy asked clinton 's lawyer on friday to hand over her email server to a neutral third party for analysis not a care in the world : mrs. clinton dodged talk of her presidential ambitions on thursday but a speech organizer gave her a ' camp david ' sweatshirt anyway ' an independent analysis of the private server clinton used for the official conduct of u.s. government business is the best way to remove politics and personal consideration from the equation
having a neutral , third - party arbiter such as the state department ig do a forensic analysis and document review is an eminently fair and reasonable means to determine what should be made public
' we sent a subpoena to the state department for emails from a number of individuals within the state department , other than clinton , ' trey gowdy , a republicans , said in a phone interview with the news service
separately , pressure mounted friday on the bill , clinton and clinton foundation with a new wrinkle in the flap over the nationality of many of its six - and seven - figure donors â many of whom , it has been revealed , have ties to foreign governments
former president bill clinton had promised the obama administration that his family philanthropy would turn down money from foreign governments themselves while his wife was secretary of state
it 's unclear whether the foundation flap or ' email-gate ' will prove the greater irritant to mrs. clinton 's growing presidential campaign momentum
trey gowdy , a former criminal prosecutor , insists he 's not interested in clinton 's private communications , but wants to elarn if she discussed the 2012 benghazi terror attack outside the reach of government document - retention mandates email-gate : clinton has been dogged by accusations that she hid work - related emails from the state department by relying exclusively on a private email server hosted in her home but without their emails , he has argued , no congressional committee investigating the benghazi attack could claim to have issued a definitive report
democratic say that benghazi has been thoroughly investigated by several congressional panels and that trey gowdy 's committee 's efforts are politically motivated and aimed at undermining clinton 's expected presidential candidacy
' trey gowdy spoke to reuters on the same day senator grassley sent letters to secretary of state john kerry and the state department 's inspector general asking for information on the emails of abedin , who was a top aide to clinton
the revelations about clinton 's emails have raised questions about the state department 's email practices
any day now : clinton is expected to annoucne her presidential campaign launch in a matter of weeks nancy pelosi , the democratic house minority leader , predicted republicans would keep pressure on , ' whether it 's her emails or it 's her hair or whatever it happens to be ' earlier on thursday , u.s. officials said the state department does not automatically archive the emails of its assistant secretaries of state , contradicting the department 's prior public statement
trey gowdy said no decisions had been made in the house about when clinton would be called to testify , either about her email use or about the benghazi events
the benghazi select committee also subpoenaed all communications of clinton 's related to libya this month , but neither clinton nor the state department have produced documents in response to the subpoenas , trey gowdy said
earlier the state department gave the committee 300 of clinton 's emails related to benghazi
