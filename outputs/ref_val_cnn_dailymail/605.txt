an endless , steep road spirals up ahead of me and in the heat of the ibiza sun it seems insurmountable ... until a somewhat over-enthusiastic spencer sprints straight past me
yes , it seems the secret to his rock - hard abs and enviable tan is impossible runs up the mountains of the white isle , where he is doing anything but partying into the wee small hours
i have signed up to no1 bootcamp , the retreat tucked into a beautiful sprawling farmhouse near the coastal town of santa eulalia
the before and after shots showed the difference the ibiza camp made to spencer 's figure it is famed as the bootcamp to the stars ( alumni include x-factor contestants , model calum best and former atomic kitten natasha hamilton )
and as if to prove a point , the indomitable made in chelsea stalwart turns up unannounced on my first day
we 're a nervous bunch at 7am as we stand in our lycra waiting to meet andy - a former personal training instructor in the raf
we had all arrived at different times the day before , dropped off at this picture - perfect villa casona morna , where its fragrant gardens give way to a beautiful pool and an outdoor seating area makes the perfect spot for al fresco lunch and dinner
casona morna is located near the pretty ibiza town of santa eulalia , not far from the beach relaxation time is spent on loungers around the pool in the villa 's pretty gardens just down the road is the beach - where andy hosts classes when he feels we need a change of scene - and all around are rolling hills criss - crossed by hiking routes which we explore in the afternoons
a bundle of energy with the essential booming voice that every instructor needs , andy has us all weighed , measured and taking part in a basic series of exercises as an introductory fitness test before we have even had breakfast
when we do eventually sit down my serving of porridge looks decidedly small as he talks us through the week - 7am intensive workouts for 20 minutes , three - hour hikes , swimming pool - based activities , boxing classes , team games and endurance work - outs on the beach are just some of the highlights
spencer works out during a boxing circuit with former raf personal training instructor andy fellow made in chelsea star spencer lost a stone by taking part in no1 boot camp in ibiza and we 'll be doing all this while on a severely calorie - controlled diet
our amazing chef and nutritionist kate will be serving up three meals a day and snacks , but it will all be sugar , gluten and dairy - free
my stomach rumbles in sympathy
as it turns out , the food is delicious
some of us excel during the running and endurance training , others are great when it comes to weights
we interchange hiit ( hiit - where you blast through exercises with 100 per cent , but it 's all over quite quickly ) with isometric training ( strength training focusing on one muscle or group of muscles )
between classes we 're given time to recover , some people swim , others sunbathe and i drag my bruised and battered body into the shade for a nap
after a particularly strenuous walk , spencer cools down with an impromptu shower from a local spring throughout my personal ups and downs , spencer remains irritatingly energetic
06:00 wake - up time ( this was a little later during my stay in ibiza ) 07.00 short , intense 20 - minute workout 07:30 a healthy breakfast to kick start the day 08:30 first full class of the day 10:00 snack and a short break 10:30 circuit training or similar 12:00 lunch & much needed break 13:30 a long countryside hike 16:30 team games & exercises 17:30 stretching & similar exercises 19:30 a well - deserved gourmet dinner which is how i find myself being overtaken by the chelsea resident while tackling a particularly steep hill
our final hike ends with a devastatingly steep road which andy has the bright idea of making us run up
chest heaving , muscles straining and mentally making a note to kill our instructor , i haul myself up , only for spencer to come bounding past , giving a thumbs up to the camera ( andy also loves nothing more than filming his victims - i mean participants - for a surprisingly touching montage to be shown at the end of the week )
spencer and instructor andy demonstrate how an old mill discovered during a hike can be used for a workout small groups mean that everyone gets the attention they need and the chance to bond while taking part in the activities , such as the three - hour afternoon hikes despite the concentration of bootcamp on exercise and healthy lifestyles , we have n't been weighed in since our first day and there is little talk of ' diets ' and body comparisons
