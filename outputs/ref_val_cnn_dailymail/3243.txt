in a season when manchester united âs aspirations have been peeled away like layers of an onion , the only goal left is qualification for the champions league
thrashed in the capital one cup by league one mk dons and dumped out of the fa cup by one of their own , manchester united were never even in the premier league title race
manchester united have not beaten a team in the top half of the premier league since liverpool in december failure to finish in the top four would be pretty disastrous though
without the extra commitment of a european campaign and having held a healthy lead in this run at one stage , falling late would ask serious questions of louis van gaal
it would probably mean entry into the europa league instead â a nightmare scenario adding games in a competition manchester united would rather avoid entirely
manchester united face a difficult run - in , with 10 games to define their season
four of their next five matches are against the top six but van gaal âs side have not beaten a team currently in the top half of the table since december
manchester united vs spurs ( march 15 ) reverse fixture : 0 - 0 a struggle for life , is how van gaal termed the second half of the sides â dour draw at white hart lane on december 28
the 21 - year - old striker already has 26 goals to his name this season - more than the supposedly stellar line - up of wayne rooney , robin van persie and radamel falcao have managed for manchester united combined
prediction : 2 - 1 manchester united manchester united train ahead of their crunch premier league clash against spurs on sunday wayne rooney , juan mata and radamel falcao are all smiles despite their side 's recent struggles football data analysts bsports believe a manchester united home win is easily the most likely outcome march 15 : spurs ( home ) march 22 : liverpool ( away ) april 4 : villa ( home ) april 12 : city ( home ) april 18 : chelsea ( away ) april 26 : everton ( away ) may 2 : west brom ( home ) may 9 : crystal palace ( away ) may 16 : arsenal ( home ) may 24 : hull ( away ) liverpool vs manchester united ( march 22 ) reverse fixture : 3 - 0 manchester united the match at old trafford sparked liverpool âs remarkable resurgence into the champions league hunt
but , with philippe coutinho rampant , raheem sterling offering pace and dynamism simply not seen in manchester united 's team and daniel sturridge now back in action after injury , the dutchman will need a tactical masterstroke to pull off victory
anfield will be rocking with the added incentive that van gaal 's head could be on the block if he fails to finish in the top four
prediction : 1 - 1 manchester united vs villa ( april 4 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 1 tim sherwood led spurs to victory in his previous visit to old trafford as a manager , and villa are showing signs of vibrancy under his charge
could arguably be the easiest fixture in manchester united 's run - in
prediction : 2 - 0 manchester united manchester united vs city ( april 12 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 0 city sergio aguero got the decisive goal at the etihad on an afternoon chris smalling lost his head and city were denied three clear penalties
6 - 1 , anyone ? manchester united have rarely got near their noisy neighbours in recent years
and city 's focus could be entirely focused on overhauling chelsea 's premier league lead after their likely champions league elimination in barcelona
but old trafford will not stand for their men surrendering as meekly as during last season 's grim 3 - 0 defeat
prediction : 1 - 1 sergio aguero is likely to cause the manchester united defence problems in next month 's manchester derby chelsea vs manchester united ( april 18 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 1 robin van persie âs late equalising goal got old trafford to its feet and hoping a turning point had been found
whether angel di maria , ashley young et al are strong enough to pierce those gaps is another matter , prediction 2 - 1 chelsea eden hazard has been chelsea 's stand out player this season as they bid to recapture the title everton vs manchester united ( april 26 ) reverse fixture : 2 - 1 manchester united radamel falcao appeared like a tiger to pounce for the winning goal at old trafford but the once - feared predator has experienced the wilderness since
defeat at goodison park did for david moyes last season although the ground does hold happier memories for manchester united
prediction : 1 - 1 romelu lukaku could cause manchester united problems if he can carry his european form into the premier league manchester united vs west brom ( may 2 ) reverse fixture : 2 - 2 twice united came from behind to salvage a point at the hawthorns , with daley blind âs measured effort the point - clincher
prediction : 2 - 1 manchester united tony pulis has transformed west brom 's fortunes and his side will be a stern test for manchester united in may crystal palace vs manchester united ( may 9 ) reverse fixture : 1 - 0 manchester united juan mata , remember him ? the spaniard popped up for the winner in the season âs earlier game , an example of manchester united at their most stubborn - performing poorly but still grinding out a win
prediction : 1 - 0 manchester united juan mata scored the only goal of the game when manchester united hosted crystal palace earlier in the season manchester united vs arsenal ( may 16 ) reverse fixture : 2 - 1 manchester united a smash and grab to make john dillinger blush , manchester united stole three points from the emirates in a game they ought to have lost
arsenal have since shown that they know how to win at old trafford , thanks to the danny welbeck - inspired win in the fa cup on monday in which manchester united struggled to get break down their opponents and were outfought as well as out - thought
prediction : 2 - 1 manchester united danny welbeck scored the winner as arsenal dumped manchester united out of the fa cup earlier this week hull vs man united ( may 24 ) reverse fixture : 3 - 0 manchester united the last time manchester united visited the kc stadium on the final day sir alex ferguson fielded an inexperienced side having wrapped up the title and with a champions league final against barcelona on the horizon
you would back the manchester united of old to win this encounter every time , but can you say the same about van gaal 's version ? prediction : 1 - 0 manchester united total predicted points : 74
