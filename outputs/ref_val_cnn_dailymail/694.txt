flam , a cat in nashville , tennessee , may well be the first of its kind to have had a conversation with a human being
penny announces to the camera that she is about to use a cat - to - human translator app on her phone jumping up , the feline negotiates a number of dumbbells on the floor before making its way towards penny
with its tail poised , the cat maintains its eye - contact while lifting its paw and climbing up onto her leg
intrigued , the cat approaches penny with its tail poised and begins slowly climbing up her leg reacting by blocking the cat with her arm , penny laughs in surprise as the insulted feline continues to bare its teeth before scuttling off
after struggling to get waffles â attention with toys and treats , penny used her human - to - cat translator app as a way of getting the cat to look at the camera
the cat , clearly insulted by what the human - to - cat translator app is saying , attacks penny with its paw penny said : â it worked , but it also got an unusual reaction from flam , who proceeded to walk up slowly and pop me in the head
