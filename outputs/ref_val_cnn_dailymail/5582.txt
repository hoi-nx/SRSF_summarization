last night the rowntree trust reluctantly agreed to stop bankrolling cage after officials at the charity commission â furious over cage âs support for the is killer â threatened a statutory inquiry into its leadership if it refused to give â unequivocal assurances â it would withdraw funding
the campaign group gave an extraordinary press briefing about emwazi â carried live at length on the bbc and sky â after he was identified as the man behind the mask of jihadi john
â cage has been propped up largely by grants from the joseph rowntree charitable trust since 2007 , making a combined total of Â£ 305,000
