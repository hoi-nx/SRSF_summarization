sweden prosecutors have asked julian assange 's legal representatives whether the wikileaks founder would consent to be interviewed in london and have his dna taken via a swab
julian assange has been holed up in the ecuadorian embassy in london since june 2012 to avoid extradition to sweden , where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another
sweden prosecutors have previously balked at coming to british to question julian assange
julian assange 's defense lawyer , samuelsson , said he called julian assange on friday morning with the news from the prosecution authority -- and that in principle they viewed the request positively
" my view has always been that to perform an interview with him at the ecuadorian embassy in london would lower the quality of the interview , and that he would need to be present in sweden in any case should there be a trial in the future , " ny said
now that time is of the essence , i have viewed it therefore necessary to accept such deficiencies to the investigation and likewise take the risk that the interview does not move the case forward , particularly as there are no other measures on offer without julian assange being present in sweden
samuelsson said julian assange 's legal team would travel over to london as soon as possible to discuss ny 's request and that it expects to respond next week
" we think that the prosecutor general , who has taken over the case , probably told prosecutor ny to interview julian assange in london , " he said
london 's metropolitan police said last month that the cost of the operation to guard the embassy to prevent julian assange fleeing had spiraled to more than 10 million pounds ( $ 15.3 million
