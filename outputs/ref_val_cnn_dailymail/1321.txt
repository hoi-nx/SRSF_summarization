as five years as prime minister david cameron should have a decent stock of anecdotes to keep a room of voters entertained
but in an advert break for last night 's tv election contest the tory leader took the chance to perform his own party trick
in front of more than 100 voters and studio crew , he recited a verse from his favourite childhood song : ernie ( the fastest milkman in the west )
during a break he told sky news presenter kay burley how the chart - topping song by benny hill was the only one he could sing in full
she tweeted : ' just heard from pm that he can sing ernie and nothing else ... ' the premier could not be persuaded to showcase this talent , but did prove his love of the song by reciting the first verse
burley added : ' he did n't sing but he did recite ' you could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground ... ' mr david cameron 's love of the song first emerged in 2006 when he appeared on desert island discs and revealed it would be one of the songs he would take to the fictional island
' this really just reminds me of my childhood , ' he said at the time
' when you are asked to sing a song , this is , i 'm afraid , the only song whose words i can remember
' the private rendition for the audience in last night 's tv studio might explain why he got a relatively easy time from them when the cameras went live
while mr david cameron was asked about treating the elderly with dignity and the depth of spending cuts , mr miliband faced a series of aggressive questions
mr david cameron waves to the audience after taking questions in the first tv contest of the general election campaign the tory leader 's first question from the audience was : ' what do you think are miliband 's best qualities ? ' one of the few off - the - cuff questions from burley to the pm was : ' have you ever had three shredded wheat ? ' when mr miliband face the audience , he was first asked : ' you sound gloomy most of the time , are things really so bad ? ' another asked : ' do you not think that your brother would have done a better job ? he was better qualified and better positioned
' mr david cameron and mr miliband faced the wrath of voters - and jeremy paxman - last night as they were forced to defend their broken promises , judgement and ability to lead the country in the first prime - time tv contest of the general election
this afternoon ofcom had received 254 complaints - all of which were about perceived bias against the labour leader
jeremy paxman appears to scratch his head mid-way through interviewing prime minister david cameron an ofcom spokesman said : ' we are assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate
' a channel 4 spokeswoman said it had received around 300 complaints , but was unable to say specifically what they were about
' both politicians , one of whom is likely to be the next prime minister , agreed to the format and were prepared for and actively participated in robust questioning about their policies and abilities
at one point burley told mr miliband : ' that 's a politicians answer there is n't it ? ' she also pressed him on the impact of his leadership victory over his brother david
hundreds of people have lodged complaints with tv watchdogs that kay burley and jeremy paxman were biased against miliband you could hear the hoof beats pound as they raced across the ground , and the clatter of the wheels as they spun ' round and ' round
comedian benny hill pictured as ernie receiving a ticket from a policeman he tempted her with his treacle tarts and his tasty wholemeal bread , and when she seen the size of his hot meat pies it very near turned her head
where the customers are angels and ferocious dogs are banned , and the milkman 's life is full of fun in that fairy , dairy land
