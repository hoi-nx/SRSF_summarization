the classic advice was given to me first by no less a figure than dame barbara cartland â then aged 90 â at one of her bizarre lunches to launch yet another romantic novel
she was busy rattling off a roster of men who had proposed to her over the decades , when she broke off and fixed a skinny guest with her gimlet eye
â after 40 , â she told me , â a woman has to choose between her face and her figure
my advice is , keep a lovely , plump pretty face , and stay sitting down
as she got up again and started working the room , distributing souvenir gold - leaf acorns from her garden and finishing the list of long - deceased suitors â the object of her remarks , a skinny fellow journalist , scowled and fiddled with her lettuce
i â past 40 by then â smiled my chubbiest , most complacent smile
it âs not often my tribe get our bums and faces validated over those of grumpy glamazons
in bergen 's ( pictured in the 1960 's ) memoir she merrily admits to putting on more than 2st over the past 15 years now , that face - and - figure tip has been reiterated by candice bergen , former model , actress and oscar nominee , whose memoir a fine romance will be published soon
in it , 68 - year - old candice bergen merrily admits that over the past 15 years she has put on more than 2st
candice bergen sounds a riot , just the girl for a grand night out
none of that weird , skeletal , sarah or victoria beckham vibe for her , nor that gristly , hard - body madonna look , all abs and biceps
oscar nominee candice bergen ( pictured ) is confident , sexy and fun , despite putting on more than 2st over the last 15 years her brand of femininity , which is shared by domestic goddess nigella lawson , is a bounce and a grin , a wink and a cuddle
candice bergen and nigella lawson 's healthy , curvy figures differ from the tiny frames of celebs such as victoria beckham ( pictured ) and sarah indeed , scientists lately delighted us with news that the particular sort of fat on the female backside is rather special
domestic goddess nigella lawson ( pictured ) has a curvy figure and a healthy face , she shares her fun , comfortable brand of femininity with former model candice bergen this is not about those sad whale - forms who wheeze and waddle and risk diabetes ; who ca nât fit in train or plane seats
but that is quite different from the 2st - above - model - weight which candice bergen is talking about
others enjoy engaging in such ferocious sports that they rarely put on an ounce
actress sarah ( pictured ) sports a skinny , skeletal figure , similar to that of victoria beckham
but libby purves says there 's nothing wrong with some extra weight and curves but what about the rest of us ? as long as we walk our 10,000 steps a day , eat lots of veg , swim or bike or zumba and can nip upstairs and sprint for a bus , there âs no problem with a bit of extra round the bum
the upside , as cartland and candice bergen remind us , is that a woman âs face does nât become haggard so quickly ; her skin stays peachy and she wo nât have that mean , cool , pinched , starved - weasel look so common on the social pages
has she looked better , happier , jollier in her skinnier after - years ? i think not
papers were cruel to brand active sarah ferugson ' duchess of pork ' ( pictured ) in response to her broad - bottomed , bouncing shape so hurrah for candice bergen and her rollicking attitude to life
