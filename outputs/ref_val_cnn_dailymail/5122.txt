spacewalking astronauts ventured out for the third time in just over a week on sunday to complete a tricky cable job at the international space station in one stunning shot , terry virts revealed the enormity of the station against the darkness of space as his fellow astronaut , butch wilmore , floated almost unseen
' can you spot the space walker in this picture ? ' terry virts tweeted
' he 's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the # iss '

' he 's very small compared to the enormous starboard truss of the # iss ' virts also posted a space selfie and commented : ' mission accomplished - three # spacewalks , 800 ' of cable , four antennas , three laser reflectors , one greased robotic arm
dramatically , right before sunday 's spacewalk , engineers spotted problems with us astronaut butch wilmore 's suit
a mechanical gauge , however , was operating fine
the astronauts completed installing 400 feet of cable and several antennas associated with the common communications for visiting vehicles system known as c2v2 terry virts took a space selfie , moments after completing the job
he wrote on twitter : ' mission accomplished - three # spacewalks , 800 ' of cable , four antennas , three laser reflectors , one greased robotic arm ' the beautiful shot was taken on sunday during a spacewalk in which astronaut 's laid cables in preparation for future space taxis on the international space station terry virts wrote : ' the camera does n't do it justice - floating in space , looking down on creation , seeing new colour shades ' meanwhile , nasa said a small amount of water got into us astronaut terry virts helmet once he was back in the air lock and the chamber was being repressurised on wednesday
terry virts was never in danger , according to nasa , so they cleared his spacesuit for the last of three spacewalks , friday , to install cable
italian astronaut , luca parmitano , barely got back into the space station after a considerable amount of water filled his helmet during a spacewalk
on wednesday , the amount of water seepage in virts ' helmet was significantly smaller and occurred at the end of the spacewalk when terry virts was already inside
the work , done by us astronauts virts and wilmore , meant 400 more feet of power and data cable has been installed , as well as two antennas installed on sunday

nasa has n't conducted such a quick succession of spacewalks since its former shuttle days , and the amount of cable work is unprecedented construction of the international space station began on 20 november 1998
