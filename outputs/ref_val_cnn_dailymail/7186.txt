more than 300 young people in oxfordshire were groomed , raped and sometimes forced into ' sex slavery ' by gangs over the last 15 years , a damning report will reveal tomorrow
in a scandal startlingly similar to the one in rotherham , police and social services will be criticised for failing to protect vulnerable children from sexual abuse
one gang of asian men was responsible for abusing and enslaving 50 girls , mainly from oxford , but the men were also able to sexually torture girls as young as 11 for eight years after a series of missed opportunities to stop them
the victims , who were mainly girls under the age of 16 in the care system , were targeted by men from mainly asian gangs who raped , tortured and trafficked them for sex between 1999 and 2014
the plight of the victims was laid bare in 2013 when seven members of a sadistic gang were jailed for a total of 95 years for their ' depraved ' and ' evil ' abuse of vulnerable girls
the paedophile network groomed more than 50 vulnerable girls in oxford between 2004 and 2012 with gifts , alcohol and drugs before subjecting them to extreme physical and sexual violence
