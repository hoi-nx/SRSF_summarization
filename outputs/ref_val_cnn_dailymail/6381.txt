photographs capturing soldiers posing with the dogs that helped carry messages , detect enemy troops and simply provide comfort in the trenches while they were fighting during ww1 have been found
libby hall , of hackney in east london , has spent four decades collecting dog photos and stumbled on the collection of wartime snaps at a market stall
the pictures show soldiers , dressed in full uniform , posing fondly with the animals as well as whole companies with the animals that were likely to have been trained to act as messengers , scouts and seekers to find and help the wounded on the battlefield
the series of intimate pictures betrays the high regard placed on the animals - which were vital as the war moved to the trenches , either in providing comfort to soldiers or helping with tactics to foil the enemy
dogs were used for a variety of purposes during ww1 and later became known as the ' unsung heroes ' of the war
the animals were used a lot by german troops and increasingly by the british and france - with troops training intelligent agile dogs such as doberman pinschers to carry messages and even seek out the wounded
dogs performed a number of vital roles for soldiers , acting as scouts and seeking out the wounded
the animals were highly regarded by their owners , such as officers , warrant officers , staff sergeants , of the asc ( asc ) who pose with their company dog in 1917 dogs were quicker , more agile and smaller making them efficient messengers during ww1 , like this dog pictured in france in 1918 others were used to act as scouts
