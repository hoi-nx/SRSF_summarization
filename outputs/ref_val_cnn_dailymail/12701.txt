the tragic news that flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the french alps by a pilot deemed " 100 % fit to fly " challenges the common understanding of the phrase
marseille prosecutor brice robin said co-pilot andreas lubitz apparently " wanted to destroy the aircraft , " taking advantage of the pilot leaving the cockpit and most likely refusing to open the cabin door after activating the plane 's descent
the ceo of lufthansa -- of which flight 9525 is a subsidiary -- said andreas lubitz had been " fit to fly
" but for most of us , the prosecutor 's preliminary finding that the 28 - year - old german purposefully caused the deaths of 150 people on march 24 puts him squarely outside that term
in fact " fit to fly " does not mean the pilot 's psychological state has necessarily been assessed
simon mitchell is a pilot and visiting fellow at cranfield university 's safety and accident investigation centre in southern england
over the last few years the aviation industry has been considering the amount of time spent examining pilots ' skills compared to the time spent examining how they thought , simon mitchell said
" it 's not uncommon for those corporations to have in their assessment matrix a look at pilot selection procedures , " simon mitchell said
" on thursday , lufthansa ceo spohr said the company 's pilots did not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they were flying
but he said lufthansa did consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots
but simon mitchell said aviation regulations only required a physical and not a psychiatric medical examination , looking at a potential pilot 's fitness to fly in terms of factors such as heart attack risk
those being examined were legally required to declare any mental disorder , but there was no standard psych testing from a regulatory point of view , he said , with airlines and industry bodies failing to reach consensus on types of tests to be used
" the doctor is supposed to note any evident issues that he notices -- but what is he going to notice in half an hour 's medical ? the rest of it relies on your medical history and you being honest , " simon mitchell said
" in terms of a pilot 's fitness to fly on a particular day , simon mitchell said attempts by many companies and airlines to introduce random drug and alcohol testing had hit problems with unions
" but managing an industry with global implications was complex , simon mitchell said , pointing out that andreas lubitz was able to lock out the other pilot because of strengthened security measures introduced after the september 11 hijackings
