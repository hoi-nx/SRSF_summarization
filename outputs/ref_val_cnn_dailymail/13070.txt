are the upcoming elections in israel crucial ? will the results -- a fourth term for prime minister netanyahu or a first for opposition leader herzog -- change israel 's policy in a significant way ? as israel prepare to go to the polls , the answer seems to be negative
many observers in europe and the united states seem to be under the impression that during netanyahu 's time in power , israel was hijacked by right wing zealots -- and that herzog , leader of the zionist union opposition party , is the man who will save the country and return it to the path of sanity
but the fact is that when it comes to the most crucial question regarding the future of israel and the middle east -- what to do about the palestinian -- the difference between the two candidates is negligible , a divergence that is short on substance but long on style and rhetoric
while netanyahu 's insistence on israel 's continued ruling over millions of palestinian is expressed in aggressive , often religious and nationalistic language , herzog 's justifications for doing the same thing would sound much softer and easier to digest in the western world
but at the end of the day , neither netanyahu nor herzog have any real intention to put an end to the occupation of the palestinian territories
netanyahu says it clearly and openly ; herzog and his coalition partners only hint at it

the elephant in the israel room is the unending occupation of palestinian territories , and nobody is talking about it
but the occupation also continues to be a non-issue for too many ordinary israel , who know very little -- and care even less -- about the cruel reality for the millions of palestinian who live without civil rights in the west bank and who are kept under siege in gaza
for those who regard herzog and the center - left as the great hope of this campaign , it is important to remember that it was the israel labor who established the occupation and settlement projects in palestinian territory
the more than 500,000 settlers in the west bank and east jerusalem have created what may be an irreversible reality , but herzog 's only answer to it is to get back to the negotiation table
there is no better indication that herzog has no intention of ending the occupation any time soon
" but the reality is that here in israel , it is only the masters who will vote and decide on the future -- not only for themselves , but for the millions of palestinian who have for nearly half a century been living under their control , directly in the west bank and indirectly in gaza
