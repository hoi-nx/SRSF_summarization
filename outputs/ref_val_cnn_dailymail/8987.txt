rangers full - back lee wallace admitted last week that his scotland career effectively ended when he elected to remain at ibrox following the club âs descent into administration , liquidation and the third division
rangers goalkeeper cammy bell ( right ) joins tom walsh as they promote a new four - match ticket package ibrox team - mate cammy bell could be forgiven for adopting a similar approach
the goalkeeper âs only cap came against the faroe islands in 2010 , when he was playing for kilmarnock
his involvement with scotland squads , a regular occurrence during his time at rugby park , ended when he joined rangers in 2013
however , the 28 - year - old , whose international prospects were further hindered by a shoulder injury sustained in august which ruled him out of action for seven months , is in no mood to close the door on his chances of representing his country just yet
there âs also the small matter of david marshall , craig gordon and allan mcgregor being ahead of him in the pecking order
but cammy bell insisted : â i would never say it âs over
â all i can do is keep playing well at club level and keep knocking on the door and , hopefully , the manager will take notice
â of course , as a goalkeeper , cammy bell can afford to be more sanguine than outfield players
all things being equal , he should still be playing at a high level for another decade or so
some former rangers players , including barry ferguson , the 2003 treble - winning captain , have claimed that another season in the championship may prove beneficial for the ibrox club while the first - team squad is dismantled and rebuilt from scratch
lee wallace 's scotland career is effectively over cammy bell does nât see it that way and he wants last sunday âs unexpected victory over play - off rivals hibs to be the starting point on the road to rangers returning to the top flight this year
â you âve got to be ambitious as a player and i want to play at the highest level i can with rangers
cammy bell was speaking yesterday to publicise a new four - match ticket package for this season âs remaining home games but the improved performance against hibs will have done as much to increase attendances at ibrox for those fixtures
â yes , we âve set a high bar but , at the end of the day , we are playing for rangers so the bar should be set high , â he said
â cammy bell credited mccall for the transformation in the atmosphere at ibrox
cammy bell played for kilmarnock when he won his only scotland cap â he was always a passionate player himself and he soon lets us know if we are doing things right in training
