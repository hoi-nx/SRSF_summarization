the international prototype kilogram shed 0.0001g last century , leading scientists to come up with a more accurate measure of mass it âs a problem that has been weighing on scientists â minds for years â how to redefine and accurately measure the kilogram
currently the unit of measurement is based on a metal cylinder - which should weigh precisely 1,000 grams - that is kept under lock and key in paris
but the cylinder is gradually losing mass , leading german researchers to look for a new formula to create the most accurate definition of a kilo
the international prototype kilogram shed 100 micrograms ( 0.0001g ) last century , which although is around the weight of dust particle , means the official kilogram is becoming slowly less accurate
scientists at the german nation metrology institute ( ptb ) in braunschweig have come up with an ingenious way to create a more exact measure of mass , which involves counting the number of atoms needed to make up a kilogram , instead of relying on a piece of metal
but in order to win the international race to redefine the kilogram , they must perfect the method by developing the world âs roundest sphere
â scientists at the german nation metrology institute ( ptb ) in braunschweig have come up with an ingenious way to create a more exact measure of mass , but they first need to perfect their technique by counting the atoms in the world 's rounded spheres ( pictured ) the aim is â to produce the connection between the mass of the sphere and the mass of an atom , ' by counting the atoms
physicist peter becker told the local : â we work out the number of atoms in the sphere , weigh the sphere and therefore work out how much an atom weighs
the company said : ' already at this point , ptb scientists miscount only twice every one hundred million atoms
kilograms of different materials are based on the measurement of the international prototype kilogram ( international prototype kilogram )
but the official international prototype kilogram has shed 100 micrograms ( 0.0001g ) in the last century , prompting experts to find a more exact way of defining the kilogram
â the method could be used to work out how many atoms are needed to make up a kilogram , but leaves the challenge of counting how many atoms make up an object
