long before he was diagnosed with alzheimer 's , reagan 's speech may have contained clues to his worsening mental state
this is according to us scientists who have found subtle changes in the former president 's speech during his term in office from 1981 to 1989
reagan was diagnosed with alzheimer 's in 1994 , and always maintained that he would resign from his post if his mental health went into decline
reagan died at the age of 93 in 2004
now researchers at the university of arizona believe reagan was suffering from the early onset of alzheimer 's while acting as president
they came to the conclusion after comparing transcripts of 46 news conferences that reagan held to the 101 sessions george h. w. bush held in his term
reagan used words such as ' thing ' as a trigger to recall the correct words more often george h. w. bush
' president reagan showed a significant reduction in the number of unique words over time and a significant increase in conversational fillers and non-specific nouns over time , ' the researchers said
' there was no significant trend in these features for president george h. w. bush , ' they added
the findings , published in the journal of alzheimer 's disease , do not conclusively prove that reagan had dementia that affected his judgment as president
the researchers came to the conclusion after comparing transcripts of 46 news conferences that reagan ( right ) held to the 101 sessions george h. w. bush ( left ) held in his term
reagan used words such as ' thing ' as a trigger to recall the correct words more often george h. w. bush
he also used more repetition but the scientists involved in the project hope the technique will help reveal signs of alzheimer 's and other neurological diseases much earlier
crucially , it is nât known how many people who have the early signs of alzheimer âs in their brains in their 20s will go on to develop the disease
alzheimer 's is an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells
