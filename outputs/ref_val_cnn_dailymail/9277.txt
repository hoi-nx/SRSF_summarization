tycoon james caan paid Â£ 5,000 to a firm that helps people get honours - and was later awarded a cbe
the businessman , who has appeared on the bbc âs dragons â den , received the award from prince prince william at buckingham palace last month
mr james caan , who is worth Â£ 100million and was awarded a cbe by prince william last month , paid Â£ 5,000 to awards intelligence , a firm that helps people get honours but mr james caan , who is worth Â£ 100million , has also been caught in controversy â once offering to buy a baby for Â£ 750 from a poor family in his native pakistan
a source close to mr james caan confirmed that he paid Â£ 5,000 to awards intelligence , a firm specialising in securing honours
the source said mr james caan had already been nominated for an honour and had simply paid for â advice on how the system works and its procedure as he was unfamiliar with the awards process â
llewellyn-slade , managing director of awards intelligence , refused to discuss any named clients of his firm , saying only that around half of them went on to secure honours
awards intelligence describes itself as the â uk âs leading queen âs honour nomination drafting expert â
although the services are not banned , those who use them are asked to tick a box on the nomination form
last night a former friend of mr james caan said : â most millionaires are happy to keep a low profile and enjoy their money , but james caan has been desperate for public recognition for years , which explains why he used to be on dragons â den. â i knew he âd used awards intelligence before to successfully draft nominations for a business award , then i heard he was paying them in relation to a queen âs honour
a source close to him brushed that incident off as an ' emotional response ' to the flooding there but the source close to mr james caan insisted : â as mr james caan had an existing relationship with awards intelligence he felt it entirely appropriate to seek advice on the procedural process of the uk âs honour system after he was nominated
â any suggestion that mr james caan instructed awards intelligence or any other third party to nominate him or to in any way exert any pressure or bring influence to bear on the honours committee to obtain an unfair advantage is completely untrue
when asked by the daily mail about his honour , mr james caan refused to comment
