a 17 - year - old male fatally shot an iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new united states hometown , targeting him and then continuing to fire as the immigrant rushed to get inside , dallas police said friday
authorities do n't believe the suspected shooter knew the victim , al-jumaili , dallas police maj. cotner said reporters , nor do they believe he knew al-jumaili 's ethnicity
and they have n't given any indication al-jumaili had anything to do with what led the teen to head out armed in the first place -- a purported shooting at his girlfriend 's apartment , if that in fact happened
" what police do believe , based on witness testimony and other evidence , is that the teenager shot and killed al-jumaili , for whatever reason
" when he saw mr. al-jumaili and their family , he targeted them , he shot at them with intent , " cotner said of the suspect , who is under arrest
" and as mr. al-jumaili ran back toward his apartment , he tracked him with his rifle and continued to fire
" dallas police named the suspected shooter , though cnn is not identifying him yet since he 's a minor and it 's not clear if he 'll be charged as an adult
until the fatal shots ended al-jumalli 's life , march 4 had been a day of fun and joy for al-jumaili and his family
the 36 - year - old , who had immigrated to the united states 20 days earlier , joined his brother and wife taking pictures in the parking lot of a dallas apartment complex amid the snow
that nickname eventually led to the 17 - year - old police believe shot al-jumaili
investigators interviewed him for the first time thursday , at which time he denied ever leaving his girlfriend 's apartment
according to cotner , this witness said he saw al-jumaili taking pictures in the snow , " the witness stated that he observed ( the suspect ) raise the rifle , " the police major said
" speaking friday on behalf of al-jumaili 's family , salem expressed gratitude to police and others for their work on the case and said " our community has been at a loss for words and very saddened by this tragic death
