the desert and dun - colored cliffs around the town of tataouine were once the backdrop for the movie " star wars , " much of which was filmed in this neglected corner of tunisian in 1976
this struggling town on the fringes of the sahara still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict , as a way - station for jihadists crossing the libya border 60 miles to the east
earlier this month , before the gun attack on the bardo museum in tunis , three young men were arrested here as they allegedly made plans to cross into libya to join a terrorist network
two arms caches have also been found in the region this month , one of which included rocket - propelled grenade launchers and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition , thought to have been removed from a libya armory in the aftermath of gadhafi 's ouster in 2011
driving near the border , it 's quickly obvious why the tunisian government is so anxious about libya 's implosion and the emergence there of an isis affiliate whose tentacles stretch half - way across the country
near the town of remada , south of tataouine , a couple of soldiers manned a checkpoint
but already libya was falling apart , as different groups of rebels fought to oust gadhafi
now libya 's descent into chaos means those crossings are sometimes closed , and it 's foreign fighters using the smugglers ' trails that tunisian must worry about
ignoring calls on his cell phone , he lamented the state of the arab world and the expansion of daesh , as isis is frequently called
look at iraq , syria , libya ...
of course tunisian is threatened , he said
the tunisian are doing what they can , he said
there is now a 1.8 - mile no - go zone inside the border , and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles
the border , after all , is 380 miles long
other measures taken by the tunisian authorities , according to the official in remada , include a ban on men aged 18 - 35 from going to libya unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there
even so the two gunmen who stormed into the bardo museum last week -- both of them in their twenties -- had been able to cross illicitly into libya in december , according to tunisian state security minister rafik chelly
chelly told a tunisian network that the pair had received weapons training in the isis stronghold of derna
the mood among many tunisian seems much harder and more pragmatic than it was four years ago
bassim , a taxi driver on the island of djerba , some 60 miles to the north of tataouine , was of a similar view
they rely on tourism to make a living , and fear that isis will -- as it has threatened -- launch further attacks against foreigners visiting libya
