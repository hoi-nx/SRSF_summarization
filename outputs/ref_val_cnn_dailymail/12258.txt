two uk charities have stopped funding a muslim advocacy group that had earlier helped isis 's masked murderer " jihadi john , " now identified as emwazi , before his radicalization , the group said
the human rights and advocacy group cage in west london said it accepted the loss of funding from the roddick foundation and the rowntree charitable trust
but cage blamed a " neo-conservative " leadership on the uk 's commission for pressuring the two charities to halt funding
both of these charities have played a significant role in contributing to the development of muslim civil society here in the uk , " cage spokesperson amandla thomas-johnson said friday
the termination of funding came after the commission " took robust action " and cited how " public statements by cage officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities , " the commission said in a statement
the commission did n't specify those statements by cage , but stated that " in our view , those statements increased the threat to public trust and confidence in charity and raised clear questions for a charity considering funding cage 's activities as to how the trustees of those charities could comply with their legal duties as charity trustees , " the commission said
" cage is not a charity but has been in part funded by uk charities
as it is not a charity and given the nature of its work , and the controversy it has attracted , the commission has been concerned that such funding risked damaging public trust and confidence in charity , " the commission said
" as the regulator of charities , we expect all charities and trustees to ensure that all charitable funds are used according to their charity 's purposes and in the way that the public would expect , " the commission said
emwazi came to cage in 2009 looking for support when he felt that uk authorities were -- in the words of asim qureshi , cage 's research director -- " harassing " him
the rowntree charitable trust has given 271,250 uk pounds , or almost $ 408,000 , to cage since 2007 , the commission said
