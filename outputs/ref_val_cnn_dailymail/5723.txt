a ba pilot threatened to kill himself by crashing a jumbo jet five years before the germanwings disaster in the alps last week
robert brown killed his wife in a horrific attack with a claw hammer , and the next day he considered deliberately crashing his boeing 747 747 in order to ' make a statement '
he had told ba that he was suffering from stress as a result of his divorce from wife joanna , and consulted his gp about his illness , but carried on working anyway
he then buried her body in windsor great park - but he told his murder trial that he had considered crashing a plane the next day after being harassed by joanna 's lawyers

joanna 's mother , diana parkes , told the telegraph that following the case airlines should ahve done more to ensure that pilots can not endanger their passengers
she said : ' robert brown 's claim in court that he planned to ditch a commercial flight the day after he killed her was chilling to hear , and yet there has never been any acknowledgement from ba that lessons can be learnt from that
