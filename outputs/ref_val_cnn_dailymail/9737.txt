forensic tests on the body of argentina state prosecutor alberto nisman who accused the president of a cover - up with iran indicate that he was murdered , his ex-wife said today
he was found shot dead in the bathroom of his locked apartment in january , hours before he was due to testify against president cristina fernandez de kirchner in the congress
he was trying to arrest the president after claiming she helped cover up iran 's alleged role in a 1994 bombing which killed 85 at a jewish community centre in buenos aires
the mysterious circumstances surrounding mr alberto nisman 's death unleashed a storm of conspiracy theories
on the offensive : argentina president cristina fernandez de kirchner ( left ) has denied claims helped iran cover up a terrorist attack

yesterday , a full - page advert , signed by the government of argentina and bearing an argentina flag , questioned mr alberto nisman 's motives and attacked his argument
mrs cristina fernandez de kirchner : the president 's name was on a draft warrant discovered in the home of alberto nisman ' can one think of a hypothesis other than seeking to generate a destabilising political effect ? ' mr alberto nisman had accused the president and top administration officials of helping iran officials hide their and iran 's alleged role in the country 's worst - ever terrorist attack
ms cristina fernandez de kirchner rejected the allegations , and iran denied any role in the bombing
' instead of clarifying anything , fernandez is damaging the investigation into alberto nisman 's death
' anger : protesters clashed with police after the death of the prosecutor in his locked apartment in january horror : the 1994 bombing of a jewish centre , run by the argentine israelite mutual association , left 85 dead and remains the country 's most deadly terrorist attack
