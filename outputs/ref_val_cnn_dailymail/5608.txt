what is the biggest concern for a navy veteran , with no formal managerial experience , preparing to lead another country 's team out in front of 30,000 of his baying compatriots ? ' suit or tracksuit ? ' jokes gibraltar 's interim head coach davie wilson , who will attempt to guide uefa 's newest member to an historic result at hampden on sunday
he adds : ' growing up in scotland , it 's a boyhood dream to step out at hampden for your country
but to step out for another country against your own country â¦ i 'm totally mixed with emotions
davie wilson ( centre ) was born in scotland but is the current gibraltar interim head coach ' i 'm massively humbled , yet there 's a little devil on my other shoulder saying , ' what are you doing ? people might never speak to you again '
davie wilson , part - time head coach , part - time exercise rehabilitation officer , was on the books at kilmarnock during his teens , but decided the navy offered a more realistic opportunity
after two decades at sea , gibraltar was to be his final port of call , and he has an obvious fondness for the british territory
' i miss the scottish scenery but where i am now ticks the boxes , ' he says
' the former assistant head coach , who was handed the reins just three weeks ago , is enjoying every minute of his adventure but the national anthems will throw up an unusual dilemma
' how do you stop a scotsman singing flower of scotland ? you ca n't , ' he admits
scotland are heavy favourites for the clash and will be expecting to vastly improve their goal difference ' i 'll be passionate during the gibraltar national anthem
' gibraltar are close to the scottish in terms of being passionate about who they are
as a nation , scotland feel they 're not given the freedom they deserve , gibraltar is the same
scotland duo christophe berra ( right ) and craig forsyth train ahead of their side 's forthcoming clash ' we 've got to build for the next 10 or 20 years
' davie wilson would clearly relish the chance to oversee gibraltar 's development on a permanent basis
