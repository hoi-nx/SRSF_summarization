a whale that swam hundreds of miles up an african river after taking a wrong turn 17 million years ago is helping shed light on a key moment in human evolution
palaeontologists discovered the fossilised remains of the ancient ancestor to modern beaked whales in the middle of one of the harshest desert areas of turkana , kenya
it has allowed scientists to pinpoint when the landscape in east east africa began to change as the land around the great rift valley began to rise up
this 17 million - year - old fossil shown in the photograph above is from a whale found far inland in kenya and has shed light on when east east africa 's tectonic uplift that drastically altered the climate in the area first began this was a crucial moment in human evolution from primates as it created the dry open habitats that led our ape - like ancestors to walk upright for the first time
professor jacobs , a vertebrate palaeontologist at southern methodist university in dallas who led the study , said : ' the whale was stranded up river at a time when east africa was at sea level and was covered with forest and jungle
' the whale fossil was first discovered in loperot , turkana , kenya in 1964 by palaeontologist james mead , a curator at the smithsonian instution at the time
he named it turkana ziphiid - a type of beaked whale that is related to modern marine mammals like the baird and cuvier 's beaked whales - and estimated it had been 22ft ( 6.7 metres ) long
the whale fossil was discovered nearly 459 miles ( 740km ) inland and 2,000 feet ( 620 metres ) above sea level
palaeontologists found the remains of fish , crocodiles , turtles and mammals including primates , suggesting the area was dominated by a river and surrounded by a forest habitat
the fossil of the whale 's beak ( above ) , was found in 1964 , and is thought to belong to an extinct species that became stranded in an ancient river after taking a wrong turn while swimming down the coast of east africa the fossil was found in an area of desert at loperot in west turkana , in kenya , on the site of an ancient river however , the whale fossil disappeared in 1979 and was only rediscovered in 2011 at harvard university after professor jacobs asked curators to search for it
professor jacobs and his colleagues , whose work is published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , have now re-examined the specimen and claim the whale has provided a definitive date for when the geological changes in east africa began
the area of turkana in kenya where the fossil was found ( above ) is now a desert , but was a forest 17 million years ago when the whale is thought to have taken a wrong turn and swam hundreds of miles up a river professor jacobs said for the whale to end up where it did , it must have swam far inland up the ancient anza river with a low gradient ranging from 78 feet ( 24m ) to 121 feet ( 37m ) over 372 miles ( 600km ) to 559 miles ( 900km )

scientists also discovered fossils of many other species including crocodiles and primates at the same site there are some modern examples of whales making similar mistakes such as the sperm whale that swam up the thames towards london , and other whales what have become stranded in the sacramento river in california and the amazon in brazil
however , the latest study has now provided clues as to when the landscape in the part of east africa where these ancestors are thought to have taken their first bipedal steps began to change
' the whale fossil belongs to an ancestor of modern beaked whales like the blainville 's beaked whale pictured
