it is supposed to be to chelsea âs advantage that they have to leave london only three times in what remains of the premier league campaign
chelsea still collected three points but , by jove , it was tough

they had chances , real chances , to wrest the points from the league leaders , and it says much that chelsea âs prime performers were once again the central defensive core of terry , cahill and courtois in goal
and hazard , of course
not that west ham were excessively dirty â chelsea had four bookings to west ham âs three â more that a player of hazard âs ability is always going to attract a certain kind of attention
if chelsea maintain their supremacy , this is one of those games that will be remembered the day the title is won , one of those they - shall - not - pass performances , all bodies flying , desperate lunges and the ball in row z if needs be
hazard runs to ramires after the pair combined for chelsea 's opening strike which gave jose mourinho 's men a vital victory adrian makes an acrobatic save to keep west ham in the game as chelsea threaten to extend their advantage adrian keeps out another chelsea attack as he thwarts diego costa on a busy night for west ham 's goalkeeper west ham have now failed to score in six of their last seven premier league matches against chelsea , including the last five in a row
hazard âs last four premier league goals have come away from home after a run of 11 consecutive home goals it is fair to say if they are ever pondering a fresh material to use in the construction of those black boxes in aircraft , terry âs cranium may have to be considered
yes , chelsea could have scored more , too
hazard is the premier league 's most fouled player this season and he goes down after some attention from mark noble hazard writhes around on the boleyn ground pitch in agony but continued to play on for the title favourites courtois parries the ball with his foot as nolan closes in during a heart - in - mouth moment for chelsea 's rearguard courtois was once again called in to action as west ham appeal in vain for a handball against cahill ( floored ) jose mourinho âs favourite scoreline is apparently 2 - 0 away
in the 56th minute , a beautiful through pass from hazard set ramires clear on goal
minutes later , west ham âs goalkeeper was in the right place again after terry found hazard whose cross picked out ramires at the far post
hazard broke , for the last time , drawing adrian yet squaring the ball unselfishly to willian , whose shot was somehow smothered on its way to the net
zouma gets stuck in against enner valencia as the centre half continued to play in the holding role in midfield zouma continued in midfield after playing the holding role in the capital one cup final , and regularly battled with nolan kouyate unsuccessfully shoots at goal under the ever - watchful eye of chelsea skipper terry cahill attempts to tackle sakho as kouyate is poised to pounce on the loose ball the first was nât bad either , west ham going close in the 17th minute , when a cross from mark noble found a dangerous area at the near post where nolan caused localised chaos and kouyate arrived late only to have his shot blocked by the shins of courtois
the ever - alert cesc fabregas probes into west ham territory with valencia and mark noble close by west ham werew forced into an early change as winston reid pulled up in the eighth minute with james collins coming on in his place jose mourinho and allardyce share a moment prior to kick - off on a crisp night in east london the chelsea captain weighed the odds in a split second and hauled him down , rugby style
to be beaten by a header playing chelsea is no disgrace ; when the man on the end of the ball is hazard , however , a manager has a right to be aggrieved
it was a neat build - up involving hazard and cesc fabregas , who slipped the ball to ramires overlapping on the right
he had too much room and cut the ball back to leave west ham flat - footed , hazard sneaking between the statues to glance a stooping header past adrian
it was too easy , and it is hard enough to beat chelsea already â a point allardyce seemed to be making on the touchline .
