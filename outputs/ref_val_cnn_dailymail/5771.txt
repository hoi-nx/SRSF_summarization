redemption stories can provide some of the most uplifting moments in sport and in the past few years i have come to admire dwain chambers , a man who will always be known as a drugs cheat , for the way he responded to his downfall
sprinter gatlin signed a lucrative sponsorship contract with nike this week gatlin has twice been convicted of using performance enhancing drugs gatlin 's deal with nike has been met with some unfavourable responses from key figures in athletics what i really have a problem with , though , is rewarding an athlete who has cheated twice with a big , fat sponsorship deal
what i really have a problem with is somehow legitimising the taking of performance - enhancing drugs in sport by making a cheat look cool
that âs what nike have done
that âs the message they have sent out by giving a new sportswear deal to twice - convicted drugs cheat gatlin in the build - up to this year âs world championships in beijing
nike do nât do shame
and now they are going to do that with usa sprinter gatlin who , in the absence of usain bolt , ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the world last year
let âs remind ourselves about gatlin
he was first banned for taking performance - enhancing drugs in 2001 after testing positive for amphetamines
gatlin claimed he had been taking medication for attention deficit disorder
his then coach , trevor graham , blamed a massage therapist for rubbing cream laced with testosterone into gatlin âs buttocks without his knowledge
gatlin was banned for eight years this time , a punishment subsequently cut in half
gatlin won gold in the 100m at the 2004 olympic games in athens , greece gatlin is now 32 but despite his age , is posting some of the fastest times on his career that should have been enough to put him out of the range of endorsement deals for the rest of his career
but it âs not enough for nike , apparently , even though they did drop gatlin after his second positive test
â earlier in his career , â charlie brooks , nike âs vice president of communications for north america told reuters , â gatlin served the ban that was imposed on him and has been competing again for almost five years
here âs the thing that nike do nât say
gatlin is 32 now , a little old for a sprinter , but for some reason , he is managing to run even faster than he was when he was taking performance - enhancing drugs in his prime
nike still seem to think it âs worth making gatlin one of the faces of their brand
nike are taking a hell of a beating so they âre gambling on a two - times drug cheat to get them back in the game
even paula radcliffe , a fellow nike athlete , sounded appalled
â i am very disappointed to hear this news , â wrote paula radcliffe
â i do nât believe it truly reflects the core values of the nike i am proud to represent , nor the integrity and ideals of the people there that i work with on a daily basis
â paula radcliffe , who is also sponsored by nike , revealed her dismay at the news of gatlin 's deal last year , gatlin ran four of the five fastest 100m times in the absence of usain bolt to talk about nike âs integrity and ideals is rather generous
the deal with gatlin reinforces the idea that nike âs integrity begins and ends with making money
if nike really had any ideals that extended beyond maximising market share , they would not have gone anywhere near gatlin
nike have done the opposite of that
in the grim struggle against drugs in athletics , this is nike âs contribution : just blew it
