moscow kim jong un is expected to attend world war ii anniversary celebrations in moscow at russia 's invitation , a russia official speaking on condition of anonymity said thursday
north korea accepted russia 's invitation , but russia is waiting on pyongyang to make the official announcement about the may trip , the official said
this would mark kim jong un 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership in late 2011
this year 's victory day marks the 70th anniversary of the soviet union 's victory over nazi germany in world war ii chatter over whether kim jong un would make his first official overseas trip during the pivotal anniversary started in late december after russia state media reported that moscow had extended an invitation to pyongyang
if kim jong un appears in russia along with other world leaders , he may look like a minor figure , said dr. petrov , an asian studies professor who specializes in the political history of north korea
" in a setting with a large crowd of state officials , in group pictures , he would look like a minor figure instead of what he 's portrayed in north korea media as supreme leader , invincible marshal , jack of all trades
" ties between north korea and russia date back to world war ii , when kim jong un 's grandfather and founder of the country , kim il sung , trained as a communist guerrilla leader in the soviet union
throughout kim jong un 's subsequent reign , the soviet union backed the nation
after the soviet union crumbled in the early 1990s , north korea became increasingly reliant on china
kim jong un 's father , kim jong il , visited moscow several times , with his last visit in 2011
" last year , russia forgave 90 % of north korea 's $ 11 billion debt
