hundreds of daredevil snow kite boarders recently descended on siberia , russian , for the world snow kiting championships the brightly swirling foil kites lit up the cloudy winter sky as the extreme athletes created a stunning visual display against the stark snow the sport sees the boarders perform stunts and tricks by utilising the strong winter winds to help them glide along snow or ice
this year , the competition was held on the frozen waters of the obskoye water reserve , where russian photographer , ilnar salakhiev , 40 , managed to capture the riders in action as their bold foil kites garnered dangerously high speeds
participant andrew , a 26 - year - old extreme sports enthusiast from utah , was on hand on for the spectacular visual display
he first began snow kiting in 2011 when , rather than driving or catching the bus , andrew decided to hitchhike his way to the canyons in his native utah
the sport sees the boarders perform stunts and tricks by utilising the strong winter winds to help them glide along the snow or ice champion snow kite boarder , poliakova , knows a thing or two about gathering high speeds with the help of the kite this year , the competition was held on the frozen waters of the obskoye water reserve , where a russian photographer captured it all among the participants was 26 - year - old andrew , an extreme sports enthusiast , from utah in the united states for muse , his introduction to the sport began in his home state , back in 2011 , when he asked to hitchhike a ride to a local mountain the daredevil athlete wound up meeting a surfer from maui who introduced him to the weird and wonderful world of snow kite boarding andrew describes the feeling of being able to go up mountains and legitimately ' fly ' off of them as ' the most amazing feeling ' ' i was just looking for an adventure when this kid from maui picked me up as he was headed to the same mountain
' ever since 2011 , muse has been pursuing snowkiting with a passion , even going so far as to become qualified in ski patrol among some of the stranger sights captured by russian photographer , ilnar salakhiev , was a snow kite boarder in full bear costume while andrew - and the other competitors - love the rush associated with snowkiting , they do admit that the sport can be dangerous snow kites are n't designed for heights of more than about 300 feet , so competitors must remain be aware of how high they ' fly ' into the air at high altitudes , there is always a possibility that the kites may fail - but andrew still does n't regret any part of his snowkiting journey poliakova , who hails from moscow , shows off her massive , lightweight kite , which sticks out noticeably among the expanse of white snow eight competitors , pictured here , move in impressive sync as they hold on to the brightly coloured contraptions supporting them after seeing his family life turn around , andrew 's focus is now on his snowkiting career fueled by an overriding ambition to compete professionally
' at some points , i was over 300 feet off the ground and kites are n't really designed for that kind of height , so if one part of the system failed i could have died
i 'd really like to compete and take my snowkiting career to the next level , ' he added
