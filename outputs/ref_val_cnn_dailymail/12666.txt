slut , ho , hussy , heifer , bitch -- long before i ever heard those words flow in a rap song , i heard them first in my own home , my own neighborhood
you see , for generations , black girls have been so conditioned to being called these over-sexualized names -- first by our slave masters , then our mothers , sisters , friends and eventually the world -- that today many times we do n't even take offense
we even make excuses for the name - callers because it 's difficult to decipher , especially for young girls , when the offender means it in a tough love , sisterly kind of way or a " he did n't mean it in that kind of way , " as little league standout mo'ne davis said on espn 's sportscenter on monday
mo'ne davis emailed the university to ask for casselberry to be reinstated
here 's what he had tweeted after hearing that disney plans to produce a movie based on mo'ne davis ' life titled : " mo " : " what a joke
but mo'ne davis was quick to respond with a class beyond her years : " everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance , " she told espn
i mean , i was pretty hurt on my part but i know he 's hurting even more , " said mo'ne davis , the first girl in little league world series history to earn a win and pitch a shutout
bloomsburg immediately kicked casselberry off the team but now says it will review the matter
it was the right call and the university 's action spoke volumes about its integrity -- and how it values women and girls
good for mo'ne davis , for rising above the hateful remark â and also above the outrage on social media , where millions rose to her defense â to offer such a gracious response
but it should go without saying : it 's never ok or excusable to attack a successful 13 - year - old girl with such a chauvinist remark
the incident provides a good opportunity , however , for we in the black community to consider how we value our daughters
just about every day in my old neighborhood , a playmate would get called out of her name for violating an unspoken rule about how a 9 - year - old girl should behave : " get your trifflin ' ass in the house , you little hussy
and as kids do , it was n't long before we were all giggling and calling one another those very same names
i do n't really know how other mothers talk to their young daughters , or at least i did n't back then , but in my black neighborhood , often the conversation between mothers and daughters was not pretty
who knows what those beautiful girls , once so full of ambition and curiosity about the world , would have become if they 'd been called : beautiful , strong and smart
