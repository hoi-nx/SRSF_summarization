islamic state leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was attending a nursery school in al-qaim on the iraqi - syria border , with senior aides and dozens of men set to pledge allegiance to him
an elite iraqi intelligence unit known as the â falcons cell â were aware of this thanks to their sources , and the iraqi air force were ordered to strike the school â but the defence ministry did nothing
however by then baghdadi had left the meeting , and iraqi fighter jets were instead forced to target a moving convoy of vehicles â not knowing which vehicle he was inside
one of the cell âs leaders said : â the strike should have killed abu bakr al-baghdadi if it had happened on time , but we were n't able to reveal the target and the fighter jets moved late
