government cuts after the next election will be even deeper than previously announced â but will come to an end earlier than planned , treasury figures revealed today
george osborne said he needed to slash a further Â£ 30billion from government spending by 2017/18 , with Â£ 12billion of savings coming from the welfare budget
the government 's spending watchdog said the planned cuts would be deeper than ' anything seen over the past five years '
but once the books have been balanced the government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade in 2019/20
george osborne 's planned cuts will be deeper than ' anything seen over the past five years '
but once the books have been balanced the government will embark on the biggest increase in spending for a decade government spending as a percentage of gdp will no longer fall to the lowest level since the 1930s , after mr george osborne dropped plans to run a Â£ 23billion surplus in 2019/20 the office for budget responsibility said the plans amounted to a ' rollercoaster ' of public spending
mr george osborne 's proposal to end austerity a year earlier than expected appeared to be designed to blunt labour 's claim that state spending will shrink to a level not seen since the 1930s
under george osborne 's plans , government spending will fall as a proportion of gdp to a level last seen in 2000 under tony blair the government is still spending Â£ 90 billion more than it raises in taxes â and this will only be wiped out by 2018/19
