the saying ' just when you think something is idiot proof they invent a new idiot ' was proven again this week when a man set fire to his car after using a cigarette lighter to see while filling it with a jerry can
in the early hours of sunday morning a man from sunshine in victoria ran out of fuel about one kilometre east of ararat on the western highway
he went on foot to a local petrol station to get a jerry can but could not see what he was doing when he returned to the car
