jonas gutierrez has signalled his readiness to step into the depths of a crisis which is threatening to end newcastle united 's season with a whimper
the 31 - year - old argentine has been used as a substitute in the magpies ' last two games after his return to the squad following a successful battle against testicular cancer
however , as head coach carver prepares for saturday 's premier league fixture against arsenal at st james ' park with suspension and injury severely limiting his options , jonas gutierrez is offering his services in whatever role he is needed
jonas gutierrez posted this picture to his official instagram account on wednesday morning the newcastle united midfielder made his second substitute appearance in the defeat by toffees on sunday he told the journal : ' three years ago when we finished fifth , i played in many positions
' a winger by trade , jonas gutierrez played as a full - back for his country at the 2010 world cup finals , and that ability could come in useful during the remaining weeks of the season
skipper and close friend fabricio coloccini will miss the next three games after failing in a bid to have the red card he received at toffees on sunday overturned on appeal , and with steven taylor and paul dummett out for the rest of the season through injury , mike williamson is the club 's only recognised senior central defender
jonas gutierrez , who recently returned to first team after beating testicular cancer , is ready to step in where needed jonas gutierrez and his newcastle united team - mates applaud the travelling fans after the 3 - 0 defeat by the toffees video bringing jonas on was n't sentimental - carver that could mean a move inside for right - back daryl janmaat against the gunners , and with the dutchman currently the club 's only fit specialist full - back , jonas gutierrez could be required to slot into a re-shaped back four , as ryan taylor has done in recent weeks , although carver will hope to have massadio haidara ready for the weekend
newcastle united have won only one of their last six games and scored just three goals in the process , and with leading marksman papiss cisse just one match into his seven - game ban , their hopes of a top - 10 finish appear to be receding
