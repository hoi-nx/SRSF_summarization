the end of " jinx , " the six - part hbo documentary about real estate heir durst , has launched a debate about whether some potentially incriminating statements durst made while in the bathroom to a microphone may be used in his criminal prosecution
durst , as you probably heard , is charged with murder in a killing in california 15 years ago , and he has been suspected , but never charged , in the disappearance of his first wife in new york
while durst 's attorneys can make a number of arguments to suppress these statements and bar their admission at trial , the bathroom confessions will likely be factored in
let 's go over three main reasons why : 1
hearsay is defined as a statement made outside of court that is offered in court for its truth
it really just means a witness ca n't testify at trial about someone else 's version of the facts
if a sentence starts with " he told me " or " she said that , " it 's probably hearsay
why ? well , the idea is that these statements are reliable
is this a violation of durst 's constitutional privilege against self - incrimination ? again , probably not
durst may still contend that his " confession " was n't voluntary
it 's true that confessions deemed " involuntary " are often excluded at trial under the due process clause of the 14th amendment
what of durst 's likely claim that the filmmakers were essentially acting as an arm of the police ? sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action , constitutionally speaking
durst would have to establish that the hbo interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police
how was durst " pressured " when alone in the bathroom ? however , his attorneys might argue that some mental impairment rendered him incapable of the necessary rational intellect and free will
can durst argue for some " reasonable expectation of privacy " that was violated by his being taped in the bathroom ? not in our modern world , and not in this case
when it comes to giving interviews , it 's probably better for defendants such as durst to keep silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt , especially doubt of the reasonable kind .
