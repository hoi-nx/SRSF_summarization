but miraculously after running round in circles chased by the bear , the red fox was left to return to its search in peace as it appeared the alaska brown bear just wanted someone to play with
a red fox appeared to be facing an inevitable ending when it was locked in a stand off with an approaching bear but it appeared the grizzly brown bear just wanted a playmate , and the fox and bear played a game of chase american photographer nate zeman was photographing the fox when he saw the large bear approach from nearby woods and head straight for the animal - a fraction of its size
' the agile fox managed to dodge the bear and neither animal seemed aggressive , not running at full speed and despite the tense stand - off it soon became clear that the bear just wanted to play
' it was n't aggressive enough in its behaviour to be meaning to actually kill , it just really seemed to want a chase ! the fox had been calmly searching for clams on the tidal flats of the katmai national park in alaska but the red fox 's relative calm was soon disrupted when a grizzly brown bear made a direct beeline for it the 500lb bear was seen to approach from a nearby forest and head straight for the fox that was clamming both animals faced eachother , and at first it appeared there would only be one outcome for the small fox ' soon after i took the photographs the fox walked off in the other direction and continued clamming , the bear lay there for a few moments before slowly getting up and sauntering away
as the bear approached the fox began running and the game of chase between the pair began the fox managed to dodge the bear and both were seen running in circles across the alaska salt flats photographer nate zeman said neither animal was aggressive and both seemed to be playing a game
