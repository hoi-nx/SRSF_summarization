' refugee camps are typically overcrowded with temperatures in tents fluctuating between sweltering hot in the day time and freezing at night
they are strong enough to withstand the harsh climates seen in refugee camps
but it is hoped the specially - designed shelters will bring an end to the grim conditions , with flexible solar panels on the roofs for power , and specially - made walls that can deflect heat during the day and retain it at night
at 1.75 metres high , they are tall enough for people to stand , and even have lockable doors , ventilation , solar panels , mosquito nets and lights
