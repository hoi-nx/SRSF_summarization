a dominatrix based in scotland is challenging a new law in ireland that will make it illegal to pay for sex
laura lee , 37 , believes the legislation will put women 's lives in danger by driving prostitution underground
for the past 18 years , laura lee has earned her living as a sex worker , travelling between scotland and ireland and juggling the job with motherhood , studying and activism
laura lee , 37 , has worked in the sex industry for 18 years and believes new legislation will put lives in danger ' the work i do is very diverse , ' laura lee said
laura lee says her clients fall into three categories - including ' duracell bunnies ' who ' pound away ' until june 1 , laws governing prostitution in ireland remain similar to the rest of the uk and the republic of ireland
once the human trafficking and exploitation act comes into force , it will be illegal for consenting adults to pay for sex in ireland
' laura lee is careful when choosing her clients , ensuring that she 's safe and that men are clear about what the session will involve , especially when they 're booking her as a dominatrix
' at the moment , transactions like this between laura lee and her ireland clients are legal
however , from june 1 , a new law will mean that men who pay laura lee for sex could be arrested
it will make ireland the first region in the uk to ban payment for sex between consenting adults
laura lee says she is a dominatrix providing a ' girlfriend experience ' the so - called ' swedish model ' â which makes it illegal to buy sex , but not to sell it â has been heavily criticised by groups including the world health organisation and amnesty international
police in ireland are not backing the legislation and the justice minister , david ford , has said to will be hard to enforce
' even women who 've suffered terribly within the trade agreed that sometimes what 's needed is refuge and rehab not the criminalisation of clients , ' laura lee said
last year , there were no recorded incidents of sex trafficking in ireland but there were 70 recorded incidences of violence against sex workers
laura lee is worried this violence is about to increase as women are forced to work in more isolated areas and clients refuse to give out personal details over fear of arrest
once the law comes in , the crusading dominatrix and her team of expert lawyers will take their case first to ireland 's high court and finally to the european court of human rights
as soon as legislation came in making it an offence to solicit , violence against sex workers skyrocketed and it was n't too long before [ 21 - year - old sex worker ] sinead kelly was stabbed to death by a client
laura watson of the ecp said they are behind laura lee 's fight in ireland
