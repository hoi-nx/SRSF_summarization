our highest priority during the ongoing budget debate should be undoing the damage caused by defense sequestration and the hundreds of billions of dollars of defense cuts made by the obama administration
a strong , robust defense is seen not to deter aggression , but to provoke it
instead of starting the process by setting arbitrary defense spending levels and then forcing our military to cut vital programs in order to meet these levels , the budgeting process should start by taking into account all the threats against us , listing the programs and capabilities we 'll need to protect our people and interests around the world , and then funding those efforts
even though we 've been able to keep the homeland safe for more than a decade , the threats to u.s. at home and abroad are growing
from the rise of the islamic state and the spread of islamic terrorism , to russia 's aggression in europe , to chinese expansionism in the south china sea , the threats to u.s. security are growing
yet , even as the world outside our borders is filled with more doubt and uncertainty , the u.s. has been steadily reducing our spending on defense
even before sequestration , president obama made defense cuts of $ 487 billion over 10 years and redirected the savings to already bloated domestic programs
this was followed by tens of billions more in defense cuts each year because of sequestration , which , when combined with obama 's prior cuts , will total $ 1 trillion over the coming decade
at the end of this process , our military will be significantly smaller , dramatically less capable and dangerously unready to deploy if these budget cuts remain in place
they have presented not just a crisis of readiness for u.s. , but also a perilous strategic weakness
we believe we must increase the resources available to our military to the levels proposed by ( former ) defense secretary robert gates in his fy12 budget , the last defense budget based solely on an assessment of the threats we face and the requisite military needs to deal with those threats
" now that republicans control both house of congress , it is time to support a defense budget that actually reflects the world in which we live , not the world the way we wish it was
until now , our approach as a country and a party since the budget control act has not been one of u.s. strength
we need to heed the bipartisan warnings of our nation 's military leaders and get back on track toward a defense budget that reflects the realities of the challenges we face and is worthy of our brave men and women in uniform
