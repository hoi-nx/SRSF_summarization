game of thrones spoof game of cuts was produced by campaign group sigoma , which is calling for fairer funding and fewer cuts for the councils it represents - 45 urban authorities in northern , midland and south - coast regions of england made by sigoma ( special interest group of municipal authorities ) , it depicts a fictional kingdom where funding cuts have meant some regions can not fund vital services , while other areas moan about not having luxuries
' we must not jeopardise this by pandering to the whims of the north ... our funding cuts will help to protect the future of the seven kingdoms
he says to the evil king joffrey of the south ( left : ' your grace , what is the meaning of this ? the people of the northern cities are already on their knees ! our old and the sick have no one to care for them ' in the film , queen cersei is seen reinforcing the claims made by her son king joffrey enter honourable northerner lord ned starp ( played in the actual series by sean bean as stark ) : ' your grace , what is the meaning of this ? the people of the northern cities are already on their knees ! our old and the sick have no one to care for them
however , the film has been criticised by conservative party vice-chairman and former local government minister neill
at the end of the short film , the king fires an arrow at lord starp , whose pleas for more funding in the north are scoffed at according to sigoma , by march 2016 , the amount of funding cuts for regions will be : ' it 's a complete waste of money , but also a complete fiction
it 's missing the key plot - there 's a black hole in the kingdom 's coffers , thanks to the bad old days of king gordon
' meanwhile , labour councillor sir steve houghton , chairman of sigoma said : ' whilst councils have made every effort to absorb the funding cuts and adapt , the successive rounds of cuts mean that councils are rapidly running out of options for making the savings required
