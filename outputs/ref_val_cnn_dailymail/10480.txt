a man who shook his two - year - old stepdaughter so violently she fell into a coma and died , has been charged with her murder
david adams , 25 , had been charged with assault and child endangerment in november after acknowledging having shaken thaiya , according to the authorities
yesterday he appeared in brooklyn criminal court on a charge of second - degree murder
thaiya , two , was taken off life support after suffering a brain hemorrhage
' thaiya had been declared brain - dead in november after david adams said he shook her and she was admitted to a hospital with bleeding in the brain , retinal hemorrhaging and bruises
the incident leading to thaiya 's death occurred on november 12 when her mum spruill left her brooklyn apartment for about an hour , leaving thaiya with david adams
ms spruill and thaiya 's father terrell smith disagreed over whether to donate her organs after the toddler was declared brain dead two days after the incident
a judge ordered brookdale to keep the child on life support for at least another day to keep her organs alive until the girl 's parents resolved their dispute
' she was born with that , she 's going to be buried with that , her body , her eyes - it 's what makes her her , ' thaiya told the new york times from thaiya 's hospital bed in brookdale hospital , new york
thaiya 's father terrell smith says she was being systematically abused by her mother 's new husband ' my daughter was born with that , and she 's going to lie down with the same thing
' as organ and tissue donation can only occur when there is agreement among family members , it was eventually ruled thaiya 's organs would not be donated
the parental dispute is reportedly the latest in a series spanning thaiya 's lifetime , as thaiya claims he made repeated attempts to save her from david adams , who he claims was abusive
at his first appearance david adams , who married thaiya 's mother in march , wept before prosecutors in court as they told him the two - year - old had died
