a team hunting for the legendary ' lost city ' of ciudad blanca in honduras has made a dramatic discovery of untouched ruins deep in the jungle that are thought to be thousands of years old , according to national geographic
researchers believe the complex of plazas , mounds , a pyramid and dozens of artefacts belong to a civilization which was blooming thousands of years ago and then vanished without a trace
it prompts the tantalizing possibility that they have found the lost civilization known as the ciudad blanca , which as been the subject of local rumors among tribes people and spain explorers around the mosquitia area of jungle in honduras for hundreds of years
some people call it the white city of gold , after ancient texts described ivory temples filled with treasure - and western explorers first made reference to it from conquistador hernando cortes to king charles v of spain in 1526
one such adventurer even suggested that the city was in fact known as the white city , and saw an ancient civilization worship a giant simian deity , symbolized by a large statue
theodore morde , writing of his adventures in american magazine the american weekly , said that local tribes people told him of the monkey worshiping civilization and went on with even more outlandish suggestions that a monkey from the city
locals even told him that one ' monkey god ' from the city kidnapped a local woman and bred half - human , half - chimp children
local tribes people also reportedly related the same story to an anthropologist , according to a honduras media report
theodore morde said that local people told him of a huge monkey temple inhabited by a civilization known as the chorotegas , and claimed to have fond evidence of such a place on his expedition in 1939 - 40
traveling into uncharted territory last month , a national geographic team found the mounds of white rubble in the shape of a monkey 's skull that experts believe to be thousands of years old
the national geographic 's douglas preston wrote : ' the tops of 52 artifacts were peeking from the earth
' according to theodore morde , stone effigies of monkeys lined the approach to the city 's central temple , which was built in the shape of the monkey god
' discovery ? american explorer theodore morde ( left ) wrote in 1939 that he had discovered the fabled city described by conquistador hernando cortes centuries before
speaking to locals , he learned the city had been a shrine to the monkey god akin to hindu 's hanuman who is pictured ( right ) hiding rama and sita , two more hindu deities , in his heart to protect them
the honduras monkey god is more menacing , he said the lost city , believed to be full of gold , has merited two names based on legends
texts cite ' la ciudad blanca ' or ' the white city ' it as the birthplace of the aztec god quetzalcoatl and old reports describe elaborately carved white stones
other reports claim there once stood a giant monkey - shaped temple
there were also tales of a monkey stealing three women in the city and raping them to create half - monkey , half - human babies , warranting the name : the ciudad blanca
' centuries later , in 1939 , theodore morde rediscovered the site , and learned from locals that it was home to the myth of the monkey god
according to legend , ciudad blanca or the ' white city ' is full of gold and has been sought out by explorers and treasure hunters since conquistador hernando cortes first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to king charles v of spain
the university of houston and the ncalm team blanketed the mosquitia rainforest with as many as 25 - 50 laser pulses every square metre that totaled up as more than four billion shots during the entire project
if confirmed , the discovery of ciudad blanca would be comparable to the popularisation of forgotten sites such as machu picchu , which lay ruined for hundreds of years until reintroduced to western eyes in 1911 by american historian hiram bingham .
