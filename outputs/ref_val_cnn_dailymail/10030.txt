but just three months after her first skating lesson , the determined 24 - year - old from mackay in queensland was performing high - intensity tricks in cirque shows across the world with her real - life partner
the former dancer met her mexico boyfriend jeronimo , 40 , when they were both working as entertainment staff on a norwegian cruise ship in 2010
' he was in the cirque show and i was working for nickelodeon - they were two completely different things
the 24 - year - old from mackay in queensland met her mexico boyfriend when they were both working as entertainment staff on a norwegian cruise ship in 2010 jessica had never even skated before when the couple decided to start their new routine - and three months later they were performing high intensity tricks on stage ' it started to become a lot trickier
the couple were thinking of unique routines they could perform as a duo so they could tour together when jeronimo suggested roller skating the couple , who met on the cruise ship , decided to create an act together when the strain of not seeing each other for six months at a time became too much it took three months for jessica , 24 , and jeronimo , 40 , to create a routine they could perform together and learnt new tricks by watching youtube videos ' when we were putting it together it was trial and error
' jessica and jeronimo put their act together within three months and landed their first performance contract soon after
the couple , who have been together for five years , now travel the world together performing as a roller duo and they are currently touring australia with le noir - a circque show with a dark twist
we started over in germany on the cruise ship , then we went to ( places like ) london
' the couple , who have been together for five years , now travel the world performing the aerial roller skating act they have a strict cardio and endurance training regime they stick to - only having one day off a week to do nothing and eat what they like while the couple spend their time travelling across the world , they do have a house together in mexico where they spend most of their downtime the couple have an intense and strict exercise regime to stay in shape for their aerial skating routine
jessica and jeronimo , who mostly spend their free time at their house in mexico , practice their high intensity tricks everyday before a show the couple have now been together for almost five years after first meeting on the cruise ship in 2010
