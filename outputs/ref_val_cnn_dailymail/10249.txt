financial accounts for qpr show their ' real ' losses last season were almost Â£ 70million - a figure that still leaves them facing a fine of more than Â£ 50m
earlier this month qpr announced they had made a loss of Â£ 9.8m but the accounts filed at companies house now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of the owners , mainly tony fernandes , writing off Â£ 60m of old loans in an ' exceptional item ' in the accounts
qpr owner tony fernandes was among those to write off Â£ 60million of old loans to the london club qpr 's players get put through their paces in training ahead of saturday 's game against crystal palace q : qpr accounts for 2013 - 14 have now been filed in detail at companies house
they used an accounting method , an â exceptional item â , to count a Â£ 60m write - off of loans to the owners as effective income
q : why does this matter ? a : because if clubs lose lots of money in the championship , where qpr played last season , they face potential â ffp â fines from the football league
q : how much fine do qpr face ? a : if they âd really lost only Â£ 9.8m last season , the fine would have been tiny , perhaps not even a million pounds
but if the real loss is Â£ 69.8m , the fine could be as high as Â£ 58m , and is likely to be at least Â£ 50m
effectively , qpr counted that Â£ 60m write - off as extra income
if the football league ultimately rule that qpr 's ' real ' losses are Â£ 69.8m , then the ffp fine they potentially face will be Â£ 57.9m
qpr will legitimately be able to write off some of that Â£ 69.8m as acceptable losses - for youth investment , and some bonuses , for example - but realistically they are looking at a fine of Â£ 50m - plus
junior hoilett ( centre ) has an effort on goal as qpr prepare for a relegation clash at selhurst park striker charlie austin is in discussions over a new Â£ 60,000 - a - week deal at loftus road qpr could refuse to pay a football league fine if chris ramsey keeps the club in the premier league if qpr avoid relegation from the premier league this season , they can continue to refuse to pay any fine levied and the football league will not be able to force them to pay while they remain in the premier league - and outside football league jurisdiction
the worst - case scenario for qpr is relegation to the football league while continuing to refuse to pay a fine to the football league , who have already said qpr would not be allowed back into the championship if there was an outstanding fine unpaid
in other words , if qpr do n't pay what the football league ultimately demand and go down , they face the nightmare prospect of a drop to non-league football
