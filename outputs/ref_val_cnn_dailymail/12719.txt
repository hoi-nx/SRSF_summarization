well , i 'll be the first to admit , i got caught off guard on this one
if indeed the assessment of the cockpit voice recording of germanwings flight 9525 's final moments is an accurate one , it is shocking
it is inconceivable to me that a fellow pilot would use an airplane for his demise and the demise of his passengers
it is my hope that there is more to this uncanny , horrific tragedy than just an extraordinary suicide event
although a report of normal breathing from the co-pilot in the moments before the crash indicates that he was not incapacitated , how can one really tell ? a farfetched idea , but could he have suffered a fit of schizophrenia never diagnosed , or suffered some other mental disorder , perhaps brought on by medication ? i know , it 's not likely
with all the other fears -- terrorism , disappearances of planes , aircraft malfunctions -- how do i reassure my passengers that they should not add medical illness , mental or otherwise , of the pilot to the list ? for the moment , i 'll have to believe that my customers are intelligent enough to realize that the germanwings co-pilot is an anomaly
sure , as with any profession , pilots have isolated cases of stress - related troubles
it is incumbent upon us to determine our own fitness for duty
whether it 's as simple as suffering from the common cold or suffering from the distraction of a nasty divorce , airline pilots can just say " no " to flying
another part of the test involved pilots listening to an air traffic control recording made during the angst of a thunderstorm event while at the same time completing a battery of math and shape - orientation problems
we were then asked questions specific to the conversations between the air traffic controllers and pilots we 'd heard in the recording
airline pilots in the united states are required by the faa to take a medical examination once every six months
in addition to requiring pilots to indicate any prior health issues during the previous six months , the application for the exam also compels us to self - disclose the use of medications , specifically for the treatment of depression
when it comes to experiencing stress , airline pilots are no different than anyone else
i have been trained as a peer support volunteer in critical - incident stress management , a joint program between the pilots union and my airline uses as a debriefing method to talk pilots through any serious event experienced in flight
i have found that my colleagues demonstrate an above - average ability to compartmentalize their problems and not let personal issues affect their job performance ... most of the time , of course
redesigning an airplane cockpit based on the infinitesimal chance that another germanwings co-pilot is out there seems like an overreaction
