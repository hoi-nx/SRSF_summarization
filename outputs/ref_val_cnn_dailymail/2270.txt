missing : the painting was stolen by the gestapo from julius priester 's vienna home in 1944 a multi-million pound masterpiece by 16th century artist el greco has been reunited with its rightful owners more than seven decades after it was stolen by the nazis
el greco 's ' a portrait of a gentleman ' had been missing ever since the gestapo raided the collection of jewish banker julius priester in 1944
mr julius priester , a prominent art collector , had fled to paris with his wife camilla six years before , when austrian was annexed into germany as part of the anschluss in 1938
when the war ended in 1945 , mr julius priester set about trying to recover his collection - a hunt his heirs took up on his death in 1954
that determination to trace it has been rewarded after a 70 year search , when it was discovered on sale through a london art dealer last year
when they were finally reunited with the oil painting , mr julius priester 's heirs were thrilled to see it was still in the same frame it had when it was hanging above the dresser in the couple 's vienna dining room
' it was very moving when they saw it for the first time - it was still in the same frame it was in when it hung in mr julius priester 's apartment , ' she said
' mr julius priester 's art collection , comprising of pieces by celebrated artists including peter paul rubens and anthony van dyke , was just one of many plundered from wealthy jewish on direct orders from hitler
reunited : the painting , which hung in the dining room , pictured , is still in its original frame in 1953 , the austrian federal police wrote to mr julius priester to say his missing el greco painting had been sold by the gestapo to new york art brokers knoedler , arriving in the city in 1952
but it was during his time in toledo , in spain , where he moved in 1577 , when he would produce his best works - even being commissioned by king philip ii. el greco died in april 1614 , but his genius was not recognised until the 20th century , when his work began to be noticed by the art world
a breakthrough came last year when the commission discovered the el greco listed for sale in a gallery in new york via a london art dealer - and a claim was immediately put in for it
' the dealer acted admirably as soon as he realised the painting 's true history and we were able to negotiate a deal to return the painting to mr julius priester 's heirs , who now live in britain , ' said ms webber
christopher a. marinello , ceo of art recovery international , which represented the art dealer the painting was acquired from , added : ' this case proves that equitable restitution of looted works is attainable
