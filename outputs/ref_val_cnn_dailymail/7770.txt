now scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought
researchers at oxford university found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of sabaragamuwa in southern sri lanka
scientists have discovered that humans may have first begun living in the rainforest around 20,000 years ago - 12,000 years earlier than was thought
researchers at oxford university found the evidence trapped inside human teeth discovered in the rainforests of sabaragamuwa in southern sri lanka ( pictured ) they say isotopes in the teeth suggest the people they belonged to had a diet mainly composed of food foraged from the forest
the study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago
the findings contradict the idea that tropical rainforests were largely human - free environments until around 8,000 years ago
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal science , studied the fossilised teeth of 26 humans of a range of dates - from 20,000 to 3,000 years ago - found around sri lanka
by examining the carbon and oxygen isotopes in the teeth , the researchers were able to see that the humans had a diet that matched those of people living in slightly open ' intermediate rainforest ' environments
the study also notes that there are hints that humans may even have occupied rainforests around 45,000 years ago
the findings contradict the idea that such rainforests were largely human - free until 8,000 years ago the teeth were found in rainforests in southern sri lanka including in the batadombealena cave ( marked ) patrick roberts , an archaeology student at oxford university and lead author of the study , said : ' this is the first study to directly test how much early human forest foragers depended on the rainforest for their diet
