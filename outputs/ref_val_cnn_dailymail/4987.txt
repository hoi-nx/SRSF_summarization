' unacceptable ' : lib dem mp jo swinson has spoken out about women not being rewarded equally in the workplace companies with more than 250 workers will be forced to publish details of their gender pay gap in a major government u-turn
lib dem mps are pushing to bring into effect measures in the 2010 equality act â which were not implemented by the coalition â making companies publish the difference between male and female pay
conservatives resisted the plans on the basis that companies should not be loaded with more red tape as the economy recovers from the financial crash
but government sources said that with labour backing a change in the law , the tories were confronted with the prospect of defeat in a crunch vote in the house of lords
the new law will make it compulsory for larger companies to publish the average difference between the pay of their male and female employees
a voluntary approach to pay transparency encouraged by the government has so far led to only five of the country âs larger companies revealing their gender pay gaps
labour says that analysis of the office for national statistics â annual survey of hours and earnings show that over a career , from the age of 22 to 64 , a woman earns an average of Â£ 209,976 less than men
â deputy prime minister nick clegg said : â while the lib dem have made real progress in areas like shared parental leave and extending the right to request flexible working , the labour market is still stacked against women
â a lib dem source added : â in discussions this week it was clear that the tories wanted to delay taking any action on equal pay and kick the can down the road , just like they have for the last five years
â a tory source said : â we have made sure there must be proper consultation with business about how it works â not something either labour or the lib dem were concerned with
