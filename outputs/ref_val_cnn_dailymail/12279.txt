there have been a few times in my career when i 've been thoroughly disappointed -- even disgusted -- with my fellow women in the workplace
no , i certainly do n't expect all my female colleagues to go out of their way for me and sing " kumbaya " together in the office , but i 'm always stunned when a woman who could have been helpful to me was n't , when a woman who could have been a mentor chose not to be , when a woman tried to hurt me because of her own fear , anxiety or what have you
i 'd love to say more about each of the women i 've met along the way who fit those descriptions , but my point is not to single anyone out
my goal is to ask the question , " why ? " obviously , not all women are like this and there are plenty of men guilty of the same behavior , but why do so many women try to tear each other down instead of lift each other up ? i figured this would be a perfect question for sophia nelson , author of a new self - help book for women called " the woman code , " and she did n't disappoint
unlocking ' the woman code ' : 4 tips to know your value " from the time we 're little girls , we 're taught to compete , " said nelson during a recent conversation at cnn
i need to always be better than because we 're taught to come from a place of lack as women
" the way nelson , an award - winning author and journalist , radio and television personality and motivational speaker , sees it , we women need to start operating like the boys
men " operate from a sense of , there 's this whole pie , and i want my piece , and i do n't care if he gets his piece , and maybe we even have to work together to start that business , start that company , " said nelson
of course , it 's easier for a man not to worry " if he gets his piece " since there are plenty of pieces of pie available for men in terms of management positions in corporate america , but that is n't the case for women
today , just 5 % of s&p 500 chief executives are women and only 14 % of the top five senior leadership positions at those companies are held by women , according to a cnn money analysis
when i was just starting my television news career in 1990 , women who were in their 40s and were in high - level positions were the only women in a position of influence
naturally , many of them often viewed other women as threats who could take their job
" because they did n't think there could be ten of them , they only thought there could be one of them , " said nelson
now there ... are a number of women partners at big firms , a number of women in congress
" which means we can lift as we climb , we can help our younger sisters and even our cohorts while still moving up and on in our careers , says nelson
" " if you hear another woman say , and i 've heard this , ' i do n't do women friends , i do n't have women friends , ' believe her and leave her alone
there are too many women who believe in the sisterhood of women , so do n't invest any time , if possible , with people who do n't , she says
... so you lift other women as you climb by collaborating versus competing
" when you lift other women as you climb , said nelson , you realize it 's reciprocal
" we women win when more women are in executive roles in organizations , i added
and again , i do n't mean to be mean or catty but ... i know a lot of women in power positions that do n't help other women but there are a lot of women in power positions that do
" why do you think women too often tear each other down instead of help each other in the workplace ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter @ kellywallacetv or cnn living on facebook .
