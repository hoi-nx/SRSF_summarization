a mother has described how she heard a doctor asking her husband about switching off her life - support as she lay in a medically - induced coma after collapsing from a rare condition
bone , who was feared to have catastrophic brain damage after going into cardiac arrest , lay listening to the life - or - death conversation but was paralysed and unable to intervene
she recalls her husband john ruling out ending her life â despite a previous conversation when she said she wanted to die if incapacitated permanently
the 40 - year - old later recovered and now says she is relieved he went against her wishes
near death : bone , 40 , pictured , was in a coma in hospital but heard doctors discuss ending her life only for her husband to refuse to switch off her life support machine much - loved : mrs bone , pictured with her son david and husband john , had said she would want her life support switched off , but mr mrs bone refused to give up on her â i was aware of conversations around me , â she said
â the most alarming was between a doctor and my husband enquiring as to my wishes surrounding being kept alive on a ventilator and that they were unsure whether my mental ability had been impaired due to lack of oxygen while they were attempting to restart my heart
i am very pleased my husband gave me that extra time
â mrs bone , a government building surveyor , felt pins and needles in her legs on march 14 last year but still went to work
she managed to catch a train home to leighton buzzard , bedfordshire , and went to her gp who immediately sent her to luton and dunstable hospital with a letter saying she might have guillain-barre syndrome syndrome
the condition involves the immune system attacking the peripheral nervous system â the network of nerves outside the central nervous system â leaving the brain unable to control muscles
â new life : mrs bone , pictured left and right during her recovery , had been minutes from death before she was diagnosed with rare autoimmune disease of the nervous system guillain-barre syndrome while in intensive care mrs bone was finally diagnosed with guillain-barre syndrome
doctors realised she had a chance of surviving if kept in the coma to allow her body to repair itself
a hospital spokesman said : â we are glad that mrs bone is recovering from her illness
