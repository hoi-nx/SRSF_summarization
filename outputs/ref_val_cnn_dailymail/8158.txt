chocolat author joanne harris blasted the app , saying what starts out with blanking out a few words ends with ' burning libraries ' as one person bluntly put , it is â f * * * * * * horrifying â
an app that blanks out swear words in e-books has prompted outrage among writers including chocolat author joanne harris , who have accused it of censoring their work without permission
last night mrs joanne harris , 50 , took to her blog to write a scathing critique of the clean reader application which has been designed to help parents protect their children from explicit content
it operates on a sliding scale from â clean â , which removes only the worst swear words , to â squeaky clean â which even takes out â damn â
condemning the app on her blog , in a post titled â why i âm saying â f * * * you â to clean reader â , mrs joanne harris , whose book was turned into a hollywood film starring juliette binoche , 51 , and johnny depp , 51 , likened the programme to examples of suppression from history
she said : ' anyone who works with words understands their power
' they take the author âs words and replace them â sometimes very clumsily â on the basis of some perceived idea of â bad words â versus â good words â
â mrs joanne harris was not the only writer to take offence to the app , which is downloadable on apple and android devices and is free
laurie penny , a journalist and author , said : â there âs now an app for taking the swearwords out of books
â the app has three settings , clean , cleaner and squeaky clean ( left ) that will blank out offensive words on a table reader
the ' squeaky clean ' setting will even cross out ' damn ' and ' darn ' ( right ) linda acaster , a novelist from yorkshire , argued : â the first act of a dictatorship is to censor books
see what i did there clean reader ! â in an attempt to placate the anger , messages were posted by the clean reader twitter account , including one which read : i âm sure the f - word is nât the only thing that makes your books great ! â but it only appeared to add fire to the row , with one writer posting â you should have a very serious think about your app. it âs censorship , plain and simple
publicity material for the app , states : â we told her that there was probably an app for this type of thing that would replace profanity with less offensive words and perhaps we should get her a tablet that she could use to read books with
