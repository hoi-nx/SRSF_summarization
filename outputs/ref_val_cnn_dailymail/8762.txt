switcheroo : wisconsin governor walker changed his tune in an interview on sunday governor walker once envisioned a world where the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally could embark on a path to citizenship
but now the wisconsin republican calls that position ' amnesty ' and says his view has changed
walker told the wausau , wisconsin , daily herald newspaper in 2013 that ' it makes sense ' when he was asked whether he could see a world where ' those people ' could get citizenship , with the right penalties , waiting periods and requirements in place
' walker drew criticism last month after former new york mayor rudy giuliani questioned obama 's patriotism during a speech at a walker fundraiser
