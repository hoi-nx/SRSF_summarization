hodgson will lead england out at wembley ahead of the euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania on friday hodgson reveals all in 4gee fan q&a what âs the best way for a young captain to get players playing together ? i do nât think it âs the captain âs total responsibility
to get all of the team together and playing off the same hymn sheet and playing together as a team , i think that it âs a question of what goes on in the training sessions , what the coach or manager is asking of the players and encouraging the players to do
the captain plays an important role of course , as the game starts the manager or coach will have less chance to influence what âs happening on the field of play and that âs where the captain comes to the fore
he very much needs to be in tune with what the team is trying to do , how they âre trying to play and what âs s been agreed upon and hopefully what âs agreed upon has been a matter of discussion and work amongst the players and training staff
hodgson believes as an england captain , wayne rooney must be in tune with the rest of the players it âs also important that the players feel as though they trust their captain , hopefully look up to him but most importantly can go to the captain with their problems or doubts and with fears
it âs important for the captain to show he cares about all of the players and takes responsibility and , most importantly , accept that being captain puts more burden on him both before and after games , to lead from the front and if some of the unpleasant jobs sometimes need doing â with us at the level i âm talking about it can mean spending more time with the press or doing things for the commercial department
the england boss plumped for alan shearer ( above ) when asked to pick a player from previous squads who âs the best manager you âve competed against ? usually it âs teams that concern me the most , and the players within the teams , but i âve been lucky enough to have a long career to come across some very good ones
