a dog walker who spent two years thinking he owned a Â£ 100,000 piece of rare whale vomit has discovered the pungent rock is actually worthless
wilman thought he had found ' floating gold ' when he stumbled across what he believed was a 3kg lump of the highly sought - after ambergris on the beach in morecambe , lancs
but his dream of netting a small fortune has now been shattered after an expert in the u.s revealed the ' stone ' is not authentic ambergris - and has absolutely no value
mr wilman said : ' if i had my time over again , i would kick the rock to one side and walk away
' the 52 - year - old was walking his boxer dog madge along the beach in january 2013 when he stumbled across what he believed to be the rare item
the highly sought - after ambergris , or ' grey amber ' , is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales , which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem ( file picture ) ambergris is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales , which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem
the decades of floating and exposure to sun and salt will then turn the matter into ambergris , a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell
it is that quality which means it is highly sought - after with perfume makers , who use it to prolong the scent of perfume
but the true value of the stone was discovered when documentary maker peregrine -- who produced a radio 4 show called wilman , madge and the strange rock following the find - sent a sample to an expert across the atlantic
to add to mr wilman 's heartbreak , his beloved dog has also passed away since he made the discovery
' then i had a text from wilman telling me madge had died
' mr peregrine has since contacted a dealer in new zealand who has promised to send mr wilman a 2g piece of real ambergris
although it is virtually worthless , mr wilman is delighted at the gesture
in 2006 a couple walking on an australian beach found a 32 - pound chunk of ambergris , which netted them $ 295,000 ( Â£ 155,000 ) .
