marine le pen 's hopes of becoming president of french suffered a huge blow tonight as her national front was beaten into joint second place in regional elections
the far - right party was predicted to make massive gains , but early exit polls put sarkozy 's conservatives out in front
the figures made a mockery of ms le pen 's claims that her fiercely anti-immigration and anti-europe party could mount a serious challenge for power
ms le pen had positioned the national front ( national front ) away from its overtly racist and anti-semitic roots , and won 25 per cent of the vote at local and european elections last year
sarkozy immediately ruled out any alliances between his party and national front candidates in next sunday 's second round

' do you think a national front scoring twenty five per cent in european elections , perhaps thirty per cent in local elections , and so on , can not win the presidential election ? ' he asked
while the vote means she can no longer argue the national front is french 's most popular party , le pen said the result was still a gain for a party almost totally absent from the departements at present , and a slap for hollande 's prime minister manuel valls
