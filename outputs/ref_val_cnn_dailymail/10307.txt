qpr defender isla is convinced his chile international colleague sanchez will become the best player in the world after a sensational start to his arsenal career this season

and isla , who is on a season - long loan deal at loftus road from juventus after impressing for chile at last summer 's world cup in brazil , believes sanchez has all the ingredients â and the temperament â to eclipse even barcelona striker lionel messi and real madrid 's cristiano ronaldo as the best in the business
arsenal 's sanchez can become the best players in the world , according to isla ' i have known him for ten years and i think sanchez has shown what he is made of , ' said isla
sanchez was one of chile 's star men at the world cup and will be a key man at the copa america ' sanchez is a leader as are the other two
' qpr 's isla is proud to play for chile alongside the likes of sanchez and arturo vidal of juventus also included in the squad is barcelona goalkeeper claudio bravo , former cardiff midfielder gary medel , fiorentina 's david pizarro , qpr 's eduardo vargas and juventus midfielder arturo vidal
and isla has issued a warning to brazil boss dunga to expect a serious test against fellow chile at the emirates
the friendly in london will take on extra significance as brazil secured a dramatic penalty shootout win against chile to reach the last eight at the world cup last summer and set up an all - south american quarter - final against colombia
' it 's a game that give brings up some pain , for everything that happened in the world cup which was a beautiful game , i think as much for brazil as it was for chile , ' added isla
