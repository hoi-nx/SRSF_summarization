but when rory mcilroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the wgc cadillac championship into a lake friday , he might as well have been channeling the much loved adam sandler character
before continuing his round with a dropped ball , the four - time major winner launched the 3 - iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well
" ( it ) felt good at the time , " a rueful rory mcilroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the pga tour website
it was heat of the moment , and i mean , if it had of been any other club i probably would n't have but i did n't need a 3 â iron for the rest of the round so i thought , why not
rory mcilroy composed himself to finish with a second round of 70 , leaving him one - under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader holmes
while an improvement on last weeks performance at the honda classic event , where he failed to make the cut , the northern irishman 's frustration with elements of his game was still clear
