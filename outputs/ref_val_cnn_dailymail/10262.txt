a mother racked up Â£ 45,000 in debt and maxed out five credit cards after becoming addicted to online bingo while she was off work sick
nield , 32 , would gamble for eight hours at a time and drained all the money she and her boyfriend had saved up together
her addiction became so bad that she began to have suicidal thoughts and turned to self harm after worrying about how she would ever escape the habit
' she first stumbled across bingo while watching the jeremy kyle show when she was signed off sick from her job as a childcare worker in 2012
foxy bingo was advertised with a bright , brash logo on the daytime television show , luring ms nield in before she went on to use other sites too
the mother - of - one would play for eight hours non-stop while she was signed off work sick ' i 'd been to bingo with friends in the past but not spent more than about Â£ 20
' ms nield 's online bingo habit quickly spiralled out of control , and the first thing she would turn to in the morning was her smartphone , where she could get her kick within seconds
' for the first two years i put everything on credit cards
' the mother took out more credit cards , arranged more overdrafts on her bank account and began to dip into the family 's savings
' i 've ended up with five credit cards in total - one for Â£ 10,000 and the others all have around Â£ 5,000 on them , ' she said
' my partner and i were saving around Â£ 500 a month and i would just access the accounts and spend what i could
now ms nield , who is paying off Â£ 300 of debt a month , is now calling on the gambling industry to rein in its adverts , which are aired on television throughout the day
ms nield is now undergoing counselling after kicking the habit , and is paying back Â£ 300 a month to clear her debts she said : ' they target vulnerable people and make them believe they can make money from gambling
' we know that women in particular are drawn to online forms of gambling and they are more likely to access these services online
