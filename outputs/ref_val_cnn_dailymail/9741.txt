eventually Â£ 45,000 of this was seized after a previous court hearing , but the rest of the inheritance - meant for the eldest granddaughter - was ' squandered ' , as well as a further Â£ 100,000 spent on ' shopping and entertaining herself '
judge bentham criticised brown-mitchell for stealing Â£ 15,000 from a minor as he jailed her for two years
he said the defence of her actions was ' incredible ' and said she had ' wilfully and deliberately ' failed in her actions as a trustee
grout-smith , prosecuting , told the court how brown-mitchell , who fostered young offenders before being struck down with multiple sclerosis , had pleaded guilty to the theft of Â£ 15,000 between september 2011 and october 2014

brown-mitchell was jailed for two years for stealing from a minor ' she was the executor and trustee of the will and was to give a legacy of Â£ 15,000 to each of the four grandchildren , which they would get once they reached the age of 18
donna mitchell , the deceased 's daughter , said in her impact statement : ' [ brown-mitchell ] isolated him from us and his friends
' but laura heywood , defending the ' black widow ' , said that mr mitchell 's relationship with his daughters had deteriorated
