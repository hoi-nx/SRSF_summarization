real madrid squeezed through to the quarterfinals of the european champions league -- but only just
the 10 - time - winner escaped a humiliating exit from the tournament after going down 4 - 3 at home to german side schalke allowing it to sneak through 5 - 4 on aggregate
had it not been for cristiano ronaldo , who scored twice to ensure his place as the record goalscorer in european football competitions , then it could have been far more embarrassing
as it was , real madrid 's players were met with the waving of handkerchiefs and whistles on an evening which threatened to spiral from disaster into ignominy
make no bones about it - real madrid was rumbled
as lethargic and lackadaisical as real madrid was throughout the contest , cristiano ronaldo 's two goals , both headers , ensured its place in the next round
leading 2 - 0 from the first leg in gelsenkirchen , real madrid was firm favorite to progress
no team in the history of the competition had lost the first leg 2 - 0 at home and managed to progress -- and schalke appeared unlikely to alter that statistic
coached by roberto di matteo , who led chelsea to european champions league glory in 2012 , schalke arrived hoping to give a good account of themselves , according to the italian
a 4 - 0 defeat by champion and city rival atletico in february was difficult to stomach as was the defeat in the basque country to bilbao -- but real madrid 's problems stretch beyond results
those in white shirts appeared to be running in slow motion as schalke took the contest to its opponent with a zest and spirit which real madrid could not match
fortunately , in cristiano ronaldo , real madrid has a man who has power beyond those of his fellow mortals
schalke 's lead lasted just five minutes -- cristiano ronaldo finding both time and space inside the penalty area before heading home from close range
soon after , the dutchman struck the crossbar with a fine volley from 25 - yards which left casillas , the real madrid goalkeeper , clutching at thin air
schalke sensed its opportunity and with four minutes of the first half it finally struck when max meyer , the 19 - year - old , fired home after casillas had fumbled huntelaar 's effort
real madrid was reeling -- and yet it was cristiano ronaldo once again who got it out of trouble
fabio coentrao , the left - back , produced a fine cross and cristiano ronaldo eased away from his marker to head his second of the game
that should have been that for schalke , at least real madrid might have felt that way when karim benzema put his side ahead for the first time on the night
real , unbeaten at home in the european champions league since april 2011 , remained vulnerable , particularly at the heart of the midfield
" porto power through in the night 's other game , porto trounced swiss side basel 4 - 0 to secure a 5 - 1 aggregate victory
" we deserve to be in the european champions league quarterfinals even if we came through qualifying
