the disease occurs when â friendly fire â from the body âs immune system destroys myelin , the fatty protective sheath around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord , disrupting the transmission of vital signals
the sheffield treatment uses the stem cells to â reboot â the immune system so that it stops attacking the body and brain
first , a sample of the patient âs blood is taken and stem cells are removed from it and stored
the patient is then given a high dose of chemotherapy to wipe out their faulty immune system
finally , they are given their stem cells back
as master cells , they are able to form a new , healthy immune system
