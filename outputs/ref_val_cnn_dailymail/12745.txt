israel has again voted for a national leader who acts as if he considers one - fifth of its country 's citizens -- including me and my family -- to be an existential threat
when israel prime minister netanyahu warned that arab were " being bused to the polling station in droves , " people around the world were justifiably horrified
and monday , in response to the outrage , he apologized for his statement , offering that he knew his comments " offended members of the israel arab community
israel 's war on its palestinian citizens is nothing new ; our rights have been under attack for years ( imagine a proposal that forced jewish america to sign a " loyalty oath " to the america as was proposed for palestinian and other non-jewish citizens of israel )
" even israel 's supreme court has come under attack in recent years for occasionally defending minority rights , which some view as a threat to the legal privileges afforded its jewish citizens
today , the sole arab supreme court justice , salim jubran , very often serves as a dissenting voice in judgments where the court favors legislation demeaning to israel 's palestinian citizens
" the law caused an outcry among palestinian citizens and human rights groups , who assert that it 's simply a thinly disguised effort to discriminate against israel citizens on the basis of ethnicity
opinion : will netanyahu win seal iran deal ? the greek philosopher aristotle once said that the essence of democracy is " to rule and be ruled in turn , " but as hassan jabareen , head of adalah : the legal center for minority rights in israel , puts it , in israel , " arabs are always ruled and arab citizens are always in the opposition , never in the coalition , no matter how many seats they win
" it is very telling that netanyahu could well form his coalition with avigdor lieberman , who called for beheading disloyal arab citizens of israel and whose party yisrael beiteinu only won six seats in the knesset , and not with the arab joint list , which won more than twice as many seats and is calling for equality and an end to israel 's military occupation of palestinian lands , which has lasted nearly half a century
if netanyahu 's re-election is an ill omen for the palestinian citizens of israel , it is even worse news for the 4.5 million palestinian under occupation who are ruled by a state that denies them all rights
opinion : the danger of netanyahu 's win renouncing palestinian statehood rallied netanyahu 's base by reminding them of how much he has done to preserve and extend israel 's grip on its west bank settlements , built in violation of international law and considered illegitimate by official america policy going back decades
the lip service he has paid to palestinian statehood and his desire to return to the bankrupt " peace process " has provided him with a useful smokescreen behind which he continues to actively realize the vision he revealed in his recent political campaign when he ruled out a two - state solution -- a vision of a greater israel where palestinian live under apartheid rule , without a state and without equal rights the policies that israel 's electorate has chosen are directly at odds with america interests , not to mention america values
citizens around the world , including in the america , are increasingly frustrated with israel 's treatment of palestinian and its role in helping to fuel armed conflict in the region , as demonstrated by its current effort to scuttle america - iran nuclear talks
netanyahu is expecting to attempt to resume business as usual with washington , offering occasional platitudes about peace in exchange for the freedom to deepen the occupation and strip away the rights of israel 's palestinian citizens
