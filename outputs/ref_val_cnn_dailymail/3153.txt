banks including lloyds and rbs have come under fire for their treatment of small businesses banks including rbs and lloyds have again come under fire over their treatment of small businesses
it has emerged many put firms into high - interest fixed - rate loans then charged them huge fees to switch when interest rates plummeted
banks have already paid Â£ 1.8billion in compensation for mis - sold ' interest rate swaps ' , meant to protect firms if interest rates rose
but fixed - rate loans and tailored business loans â the centre of the latest row â are not regulated by the fca , meaning customers mis - sold them are not eligible for compensation
according to the treasury committee , fixed - rate loans and tailored business loans can be just as dangerous as interest rate swaps
in a damning report earlier this month into the treatment of small firms by banks , the treasury committee said it had received evidence clydesdale bank mis - sold tailored business loans
' rbs said it is trawling through its sales of fixed - rate loans
lloyds said its fixed - rate loans were ' fundamentally different ' to the tailored business loans sold by clydesdale bank , with lower break costs .
