now , for the first time , scientists have taken uncontaminated samples from deep beneath the glacier in the hope of finding microbial life
in the vast , white expanse of antarctica , one glacier bleeds a shocking red
known as blood falls , the dramatic colour comes from the two million - year - old iron - heavy seawater trapped under the ice they believe that ' extremophiles ' possibly living under the surface could be unique in their ability to survive â and they may even help in the search for alien life on other planets
scientists recently sent a probe into the ice of taylor glacier to extract salty samples of water from the main vein that feeds the red - stained feature
' this is going to be an exciting sample to play with , ' mikucki , an assistant professor of microbiology at the university of tennessee told the antarctic sun. she explained that blood falls ' deep red hue is caused by the discharge of iron - rich , brine liquid
its chemistry is changed by bacteria , which transforms sulphur and iron compounds in order to survive
blood falls ' deep red hue is caused by the discharge of iron - rich , brine liquid.its chemistry is changed by bacteria , which transforms sulphur and iron in order to survive the midge ( minimally invasive direct glacial exploration ) project , led by professor mikucki has developed a unique probe , dubbed enex-icemole
but to learn more about the bacteria , scientists needed samples that were oxidised
the team focused on locating the channel through which the brine moves from the reservoir to the surface at blood falls
' it offers us a portal , or window , to the subglacial world â¦ a sample of material from that ice - covered interior , ' said professor mikucki
scientists say the results could reveal how life could exist on moons like saturn 's enceladus and jupiter 's europa
the scientists sent a probe into the ice of taylor glacier to extract salty samples of water from the main vein that feeds the red - stained feature
the crevassed , rough , slick surface of taylor glacier makes it a challenging location for research blood falls is an outflow of an iron oxide - tainted plume of saltwater , flowing from the tongue of taylor glacier onto the ice - covered surface of west lake bonney in the taylor valley the team focused on locating the channel through which the brine moves from the reservoir to the surface at blood falls
