einstein may have been a genius , but even he could get it wrong sometimes
in the 1920s and 1930s , einstein said he could n't back the strange theory that the measurement of a particle actually affects its location

professor wiseman at griffiths university , who worked with the university of tokyo , made measurements to show what einstein did not believe to be real - namely the non-local collapse of a particle 's ' wave function '
this phenomenon is explained in quantum theory by what einstein disparaged in 1927 as ' spooky action at a distance
einstein did n't believe the phenomenon existed because it violates the theory of relativity which states that the speed of light is a limit on how fast any information can travel
almost 90 years later , by splitting a single photon between two laboratories , scientists have used homodyne detectors - which measure wave - like properties - to show the collapse of the wave function is a real effect
according to live science , the paradox was resolved years later , when experiments showed that even though the interaction between two quantum particles happens faster than light , it is impossible use it to send information
by splitting a single photon between two laboratories , scientists have used homodyne detectors - which measure wave - like properties - to show the collapse of the wave function is a real effect the report adds that while other experiments have shown entanglement with two particles , the new study entangles a photon with itself
' einstein never accepted orthodox quantum mechanics and the original basis of his contention was this single - particle argument , ' said professor wiseman
' einstein 's view was that the detection of the particle only ever at one point could be much better explained by the hypothesis that the particle is only ever at one point , without invoking the instantaneous collapse of the wave function to nothing at all other points
' ' through these different measurements , you see the wave function collapse in different ways , thus proving its existence and showing that einstein was wrong
