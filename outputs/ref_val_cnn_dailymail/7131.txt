is there any sport better at self - criticism than formula one ? here we are barely 24 hours after watching one of the greatest drivers ever to turn a wheel , lewis hamilton , winning the australia grand prix in the most advanced car ever devised , yet some people have already applied the match to the paraffin
lewis hamilton celebrates his australia gp win in front of second - placed rosberg and sebastian vettel lewis hamilton stormed to victory at the season - opening australia grand prix following a dominant performance rosberg followed lewis hamilton home as mercedes picked up where they left off with total domination i remember when , in 2010 , refuelling was done away with and the season started with a horrific bore in bahrain
even last year , with mercedes dominant , there were some memorable races â the best of them , this time , in bahrain , with heart - in - your - mouth , wheel - to - wheel scrapping throughout the field
yet , unlike in football , formula one feels an insatiable need to reinvent itself to â improve the show â
lewis hamilton and rosberg ( right ) shake hands after mercedes pair finished more than 30 seconds ahead of third lewis hamilton sprays champagne from the rostrum as he celebrates the 34th grand prix victory of his career video hamilton cruises to victory in australia gp it is also mostly self - serving
teams cry for changes when they are failing to match their opponents , as red bull âs christian horner did in calling for mercedes to have their grunt reined in
wolff responded by telling christian horner and the rest to get their â f * * * * * * heads down and work hard â
yes , is formula one not about striving for the best , winning the arms â race and getting your super-rich rewards ? in passing , it is worth pointing out that the teams are far too powerful
the fia , now presided over by jean todt , should surely be leading formula one rather than following the consensus
if the sport does need an injection of competitiveness , we look to rosberg to play his part by challenging lewis hamilton in a way he did not manage in melbourne
last year see - sawed until lewis hamilton took near total command towards the end , and there is no reason to believe that rosberg may not get the better of lewis hamilton at some stages this year
but for now we should celebrate the brilliance of lewis hamilton and his mercedes machine , and stop moaning
hollywood star arnold schwarzenegger interviews lewis hamilton after his winning start to the season red bull chief christian horner is concerned that mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport red bull âs motorsport adviser helmut marko has warned , not for the first time , that the drinks company is considering leaving formula one because the rules are not to their liking
it probably is not genuine , but , even if it is , so what ? global companies such as mercedes , toyota and honda use the platform of formula one to promote themselves so long as their boardrooms see an advantage in doing so
christian horner 's red bull team won consecutive titles between 2010 - 2013 with sebastian vettel behind the wheel mercedes chief wolff has told critics of his team to work to find a solution some wagging paddock tongues suggest that manor never intended to race here in australia
manor âs revival , after the team previously known as marussia went into administration last autumn , has been widely seen as a tonic for formula one , beset by the overspending of the less successful teams ( my interpretation ) , or by the iniquitous way it the sport is run ( the popular narrative )
â graeme lowdon , ceo of manor arrives in the paddock but the team did not start the race in melbourne imitation being the sincerest form of flattery , it was gratifying to note lewis hamilton âs contribution to mercedes â post-qualifying press conference
he stood at the back , put his hand up and said to his team boss wolff : â from the daily mail , is there any news on the contract ? â wolff : â no news on the contract , to the daily mail journalist
â i am happy to swap salaries with lewis hamilton
