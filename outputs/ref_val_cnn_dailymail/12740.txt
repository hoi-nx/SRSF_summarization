it will be months , or longer , before the causes behind tuesday 's crash of germanwings are known , but there are initial clues that aviation experts say will be the most important to investigators
the most useful clues so far : one of the plane 's " black boxes " has been recovered , the france interior minister said
the data recorder will be the most useful in determining the cause of the crash
its contents are still unknown , but it is a good sign that it was found just hours after the crash
france 's aviation accident investigation bureau will examine the device immediately , the interior minister said
real - time flight data available to the public tells a key part of the story
according to online flight trackers , the germanwings plane had been flying at 38,000 feet when , about 30 minutes into the trip , it started descending
the rate of descent indicates that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , cnn aviation analyst schiavo said
departure : barcelona , spain , at 10:01 a.m. ( 26 minutes late ) destination : scheduled to land in dusseldorf , germany , at 11:39 a.m. passengers : 150 ( 144 passengers , six crew members ) airplane : airbus a320 ( twin - jet ) airline : germanwings ( budget airline owned by lufthansa ) flight distance : 726 miles last known tracking data : 10:38 a.m. last known speed : 480 mph last known altitude : 11,400 feet last known location : near digne-les-bains , france , in the alps sources : cnn and flightaware.com the initial data about the plane 's descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , schiavo said
another aviation analyst , soucie , said the quickness of the descent shows something went wrong , but also that the plane was not out of control
contrary to some early reports , the french civil aviation authority told cnn that the crew of the germanwings plane did not issue a distress call
in other words , before turning on a distress call or transponder , the pilot 's first concern is to fly the plane , and secondly , to find the safest option for a crash landing , if it comes to that
the germanwings pilot " was definitely aviating and navigating from what we can tell , " soucie said
a big part of determining the cause of the crash will be whether such a code was sent or not
" i do n't think you 'd rule anything out at this point , " cnn aviation analyst o'brien said
" o'brien pointed out the known details of the crash -- a rapid descent , no radio call and a flight that continues into the mountains -- are not part of a " typical emergency scenario
" there were no reported weather issues during the plane 's flight , but that does not mean you can rule these out as a possible cause , pilot and cnn aviation analyst abend said
reduced visibility in and of itself is not a huge issue , but the weather may have deteriorated as the plane descended and be a possible factor in the crash , he said .
