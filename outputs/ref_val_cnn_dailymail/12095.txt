it was n't just the clasico â victor valdes always prepared for every game by imagining the worst things that could happen
if he had a stinker , or even if he had a blinder but still could n't stop his opponents getting the better of barcelona , then he would have a store of precious images and memories with which to dilute the pain of defeat or failure
this will be barcelona 's first clasico at the nou camp without victor valdes at the club since 2002 - 13 years
bravo in training at barcelona 's joan gamper base ahead of clasico against real madrid despite the million - kilowatt glare given off by the stars on the playing surface , i 'll miss his presence â saturnine , deeply competitive , gently eccentric , hugely effective
i am still learning what bravo 's mind usually does to him before a big game , and , vice versa , what the former real sociedad keeper tries to do to either dominate or harness the powerful psychological alert system which should be telling him , right about now : ' oh no ! real madrid again
' from the moment when beckham scored past him with a free - kick at the anoeta stadium in february 2007 , where the ball squirted past bravo like a wet , angry salmon trying to evade capture , the contest with real madrid has appeared to have been bravo 's room 101
following that beckham moment , bravo has faced real madrid 10 times , losing nine , drawing one and conceding 33 goals
like colin montgomerie and a major golf tournament , brazilian ronaldo and the champions league , real madrid are the sharpest thorn , digging into the goalkeeper 's side
bravo joined barcelona in the summer of 2014 and is looking to improve his record against real madrid bravo comes up against messi in 2012 while playing for former club real sociedad back in october , leading 1 - 0 , perhaps he allowed himself to dream
it 's important to be clear , in not one of real madrid 's goals â cristiano ronaldo 's penalty , pepe 's thunderous header , karim benzema 's blitzkrieg counter-attack third â did the chilean carry any blame
the barcelona no 1 ( right ) and jordi masip lopez train in preparation for the game against real madrid ' but thinking about it and assuming it 's going to happen are totally different things
' the match will be barcelona 's first clasico at the nou camp without victor valdes in 13 years just under 105 metres away from him for most of the night will be someone who would have nodded , with a knowing grin , at all of those sentiments
' victor valdes ( right ) joined manchester united this season where he is currently no 2 behind david de gea but that 's not so
thirty - seven times he ' s played barcelona , far more than any other rival
real madrid were n't 2 - 0 down at home , real madrid pressed the accelerator and crushed luis enrique 's side in ' lucho 's ' first clasico as a coach
it 's an anecdote that casillas ' first clasico at the nou camp , nearly 15 years ago , also saw the first goal he conceded to barcelona â scored by that same lucho
