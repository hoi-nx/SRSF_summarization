a disabled woman who defied the odds to exchange vows with her partner and become britain 's first married couple with down 's syndrome has died aged 45
andrea and her husband paul defied the odds - and social workers - to marry one another in 2004
the childhood sweethearts met in a home for children with learning difficulties and after falling in love as teenagers they fought a long battle to be allowed to marry
disabled annear , 45 , from st annes on sea , lancashire , has died aged 45
she and her husband made history in 2004 when they became britain 's first married couple with down 's syndrome ( pictured ) when the mail interviewed them in 2006 , andrea , then aged 37 , said : ' i love paul this much
' i give him a kiss in the morning when he leaves for work , and i shout after him ' i love you , paul ' and he says ' i love you , andrea ' , and i watch him as he walks all the way down the road
' andrea had a known heart condition related to her disability , and the couple relied on a daily carer to check that they are coping with domestic tasks - but other than that , they were much like any other married couple
the couple ( pictured ) met in a home for children with learning difficulties when andrea was just three andrea was just three years old when she was sent to live at the ormerod children 's home in st annes on sea , lancashire
paul , who had been raised in a foster home , arrived at ormerod when he was 13 , when his elderly foster mother was unable to cope
they became fast friends and eventually fell in love , but in 1996 andrea was re-housed in a secure community house , while paul remained at ormerod , which had been turned into an adult centre
while social workers were pleased with the move - with her high - functioning down 's syndrome , andrea was able to take a part - time job at a local hotel - no one realised she was missing paul
' after arrangements by social workers caring for the pair paul was driven to andrea 's house for a three - hour visit
the couple battled against the odds to continue to see each other and eventually said they wanted to marry when the front door opened they fell into each other 's arms - much to the astonishment of onlookers
disabled people often have to fight the assumption that because they have a learning disability they lack the capacity to marry or to have sexual relations mencap 's chief executive , jan tregelles , said last year : ' for someone with a learning disability to have their right to marry so seriously interfered with is not only heartbreaking for the couple and their families , but a denial of their basic human rights
' andrea was so thrilled to see paul - she took him by the hand and led him to her little sitting room , and they were both so happy
' the couple battled against the odds to continue to see each other and eventually said they wanted to marry
but for andrea and paul this was not enough
andrea said at the time : ' paul asked me to marry him and i told him yes
' andrea said : ' i am just a normal wife and paul is just my normal husband
that 's all we 've ever wanted to be ' andrea was given anti pregnancy injections because her weak heart might not have coped with childbirth and the couple saved up for gold rings , wedding dress and suit
sue sharples , then director of the trust said : ' their were many barriers put ibn their way but their love for each other was so obvious but the birth control was needed to protect andrea 's heart
' they were the first couple with downs to marry in this country and were inseparable in their time together.this is a difficult time for paul and my thoughts are with him
' andrea told the mail in 2006 : ' we love being mr and mrs together
' she added : ' i am just a normal wife and paul is just my normal husband
