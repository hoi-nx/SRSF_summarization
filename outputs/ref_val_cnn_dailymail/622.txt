so you 've been publicly shamed by jon ronson shame stalks the land
it wakes us up at three in the morning
it inhabits the most secret corners of our lives
it âs a complete waste of time and energy , but for many of us it âs a lifetime âs work to get shot of it
i think i âve lost most of mine , but i still have a little spare if you âre running short
at the same time , the real villains of the piece , the people who really should feel shame for what they have done and continue to do , feel none at all
i know a few bankers , and i do nât know one who feels anything but delight that he and his kind have got away with it
so this is an important subject , and a fascinating one
two new books consider shame from different points of view
jon ronson is a journalist and broadcaster who has built up something of a reputation writing about extremely odd people
for this book , however , he has spoken to normal people who found themselves in distinctly abnormal situations
for these are people who have been shamed , publicly , humiliatingly , horribly
sometimes what they have done is pretty bad ; sometimes what they have done is nothing much at all
in his book , jon ronson insists that there is potential in everyone for this merciless judgment ( stock image ) take the case of justine sacco , a young new york pr who tweeted this : â going to africa
jon ronson tells this terrible story in his deadpan way , his sympathies clearly with the victim
justice , says jon ronson , has been democratised
take the case of jonah lehrer , the sharp young american hack who made up one too many quotes and was shamed into unemployment
jon ronson âs book is nât always the easiest read , although his characteristic wit and wonderful , sinuous way of telling a story guide you effortlessly through the horrors within its pages
he is also insistent that the potential for such behaviour is in us all
he is a clever man and this is a magnificent book , subtly argued , often painfully funny and yet deeply serious , and absolutely of the moment
we can do this in much the same way that jon ronson âs trolls have
i still prefer jon ronson âs book , though , which sits uncomfortably in the memory , like something you did long ago , and really wish you had nât .
