in the final days of the israeli election campaign , prime minister benjamin netanyahu disavowed the two - state solution and said there would be no palestinian state on his watch
and now , facing international uproar and a stern united states response , israeli officials have started backing away from these statements
the israeli ambassador to canada , rafael barak , said wednesday on cbc tv , " this is an election campaign and you have to take with a grain of salt what was said at the last minute when the polls say you are going to lose
" benjamin netanyahu himself , in an interview on nbc , tried to qualify his words about a two - state solution , saying what he meant to say was that a palestinian state was not viable under present conditions
the fact is , rhetorical if not actual support for a two - state solution has served benjamin netanyahu well for the past several years , and has provided him with a convenient shield against international pressure to end the almost 48 - year occupation of the west bank and gaza
also helping benjamin netanyahu was the presence in his cabinet of israeli politicians who actually do believe in a two - state solution and worked hard to make it happen -- notably former foreign minister livni , who headed up the failed 2014 negotiations with the palestinian
it should take the initiative , in consultation with its international partners , in drafting a resolution that lays out the detailed parameters for an end to the israeli - palestinian conflict
the resolution should of course state unequivocally that the solution rests in an israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines , with equivalent land swaps to incorporate some of the major settlement blocs within israeli
in his campaign statement , benjamin netanyahu took pride in approving the construction of a huge suburb on the southern fringes of jerusalem in order to block palestinian construction from neighboring bethlehem
benjamin netanyahu 's statement was a moment of truth for him , for israeli and for the world
