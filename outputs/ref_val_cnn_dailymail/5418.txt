kentucky sen. paul , a libertarian - leaning senator will officially announce his candidacy for president at a rally in louisville , kentucky on april 7 , a senior adviser to the republican politician told daily mail online
with texas sen. cruz in the race for the white house as of this morning , when he kicked off his own bid with a tweet , paul plans to follow suit and launch his own campaign in just over two weeks
louisville , the adviser said , was selected over paul 's hometown , bowling green , the city from which he set in motion his quest to become a america senator , for optimum venue space
kentucky sen. paul is scheduled to follow cruz 's lead and announce his presidential bid at a campaign - style event on april 7 in louisville , kentucky even before cruz , 44 , kicked off his 2016 bid , paul , 52 , had his eye on april 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign
but the fellow republican 's formal announcement helped to solidify paul 's plans
determined not to be the first major white house hopeful to wade into the shark - infested waters , paul intended to wait until at least one other prominent republican contender swam out to sea
already , south carolina sen. lindsey graham , retired neurosurgeon ben carson and wealthy businessman and reality tv star donald trump had publicly said they were forming presidential exploratory committees
as a result , the state will have a one - time caucus , paid for by paul , to determine its presidential nominee so that paul can remain on a statewide ballot as a candidate for the senate , as well
even before cruz kicked off his 2016 bid , paul had his eye on april 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign
but the fellow republican 's formal announcement solidified his plans additional heavy hitters presumably joining the crowded field of republican presidential candidates - former texas gov. rick perry , florida sen. marco rubio , wisconsin gov. scott walker , former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum and new jersey gov. chris christie - have offered fewer hints about when they drop the curtain on their expected campaigns
the political front was mostly quiet on monday morning , however , as cruz prepared to lay out his vision for the country in a convocation speech at liberty , the largest christian higher - education institution in america , save for a few tweets from his well - known detractors paul is pictured here exiting beantowne coffee house & cafe march in hampstead during his weekend trip to new hampshire
the freshman senator has not yet signed paperwork legalizing a presidential exploratory committee but could do so in the two weeks before his campaign formally kicks off the democratic national committee hit him several times over the social media network as the ' architect of the disastrous 2013 government shutdown ' and forwarded reporters an article positing that cruz , a hispanic whose father fled communist cuba , could actually ' make the relationship between republican and latinos even tougher
american bridge , a progressive , political action committee , tweeted that that the gop 's ' race to the extreme starts today ' with cruz 's personal announcement
