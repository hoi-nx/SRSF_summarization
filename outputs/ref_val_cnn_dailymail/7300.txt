carson stated in an interview on wednesday that he thinks being gay is ' absolutely ' a choice
' because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight â and when they come out , they âre gay , ' said carson
' he then went in on the issue of gay marriage
' for this reason he said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level , this on the same day the supreme court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state 's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples
carson has long been outspoken when it comes to his opinions on gay marriage , which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech
in an interview with sean hannity , carson said ; ' my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman
the backlash was so strong , especially among young americans , that carson was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater johns hopkins
earlier this week carson launched an exploratory committee to run for president , becoming the first high - profile republican candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race .
