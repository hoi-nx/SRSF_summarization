hero : collier survived 63 bombing missions in the wwii and helped plan the dambusters raid the secret history of a decorated bomber command hero who survived 63 missions , bombed hitler 's barges and planned the dambusters raid has been uncovered after his death
collier was awarded three top medals for his heroic and brave service during the wwii , but lived a humble life after he left the raf and rarely spoke of his incredible achievements
he died aged 83 in 2000 , only for an unpublished memoir recording his feats to be unearthed by his family in his home in the new forest , hampshire
mr gooch and the family of mr collier discovered that the airman 's first mission took place mere hours after war against nazi germany was declared on september 3 , 1939
the mission was one of the first bombing missions of the war and involved searching for german warships in the north sea
another mission described in the memoir described mr collier flying a twin - engined hampden bomber on a raid on a canal lock in munster , nazi germany , on august 12 , 1940 , when his plane was hit
and sit on it he did without a murmur of complaint ... ' squadron leader collier was mentioned in despatches and is aid to have been recommended for a victoria cross
he might have been given that highest award for valour if another person on the operation had not got the victoria cross
his second war career came in planning bombing missions as britain and its allies gradually gained the upper hand
later he would plan the pinpoint missions to stop the german ' revolutionary rocket weapons that collier feared might swing the conflict back in the nazis ' favour
bomber : the brave airman 's first mission took place mere hours after war against nazi germany was declared after being presented with three medals for his service as a courageous bomber , mr collier ( standing second from left ) was transferred into a crack team of specialist mission planners seven days after the munster raid , mr collier was awarded the distinguished flying cross ( distinguished flying cross ) , jointly for that mission and an attack on oil tanks in bordeaux
his close friend victoria cross - one of the most famous airmen of the war - noted sadly that by late 1940 most of the original comrades of 83 squadron were dead , missing , prisoners of war or wounded
mr collier stopped flying because the ministry needed an experienced bomber officer to join a crack team of specialist mission planners , where he stayed until the end of the war
mr collier was given the distinguished flying cross , was awarded a bar to it and was also given the distinguished service order , among a host of other medals writing shortly after the war ended , mr collier said : ' it is difficult to imagine that adventure can be found in the ministry , surely the excitement and glory of wwii is on the battlefield ? ' i suppose it could be said i had my fair share of adventure during the four years i was on operations in bomber command
' mr collier died in 2000 aged 83 , with loved ones only realising the extent of his achievements when his memoir was unearthed ' i found my adventure in this war in the ministry ...
' mr collier 's work in the ministry was outstanding and vital
even late in the war , with allied troops closing in on victory in europe , mr collier and his team were doing vital work targeting and attacking the factories making and supplying the ' v ' weapons that were wreaking havoc in britain
the v1 and v2 missiles caused terror among civilians in london - and even struck fear into mr collier
after leaving the military , collier worked as a land agent and after retiring from paid work devoted time to helping the children 's charity barnardo 's
