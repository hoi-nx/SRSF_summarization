britain 's first dedicated hedgehog conservation area is launched today in an attempt to slow the species â dramatic decline
part of the reason that hedgehogs have decline so far is thought to be linked to the widespread loss of bushes and hedges , which have been replaced in many back gardens by hard wooden or metal fences
mr thompson said : â something as basic as linking up a series of small isolated green patches with a hole no bigger than the size of a cd is a remarkably powerful and positive action for hedgehog conservation
â fay vass , chief executive of the britain hedgehog preservation society , which is backing the project , said : â we are delighted to be funding such an exciting and important project in warwickshire wildlife trust that will hopefully benefit many hedgehogs
