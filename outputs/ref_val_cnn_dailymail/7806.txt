a china furniture shopping mall which invited the public to release butterflies back to nature has seen the event ended up in a complete opposite direction â hundreds of colourful creatures were stamped to death by onlookers who hoped to capture them
more than 10 boxes of butterflies were flown to chengdu on the same day from yunnan in southern china
tragedy : hundreds of butterflies were stamped to death during an event to release them back into the wild set free : 10 families were selected from thousands of in the crowd to release the butterflies from shoe boxes keen participants : the butterflies were transported in the cardboard boxes from yunnan on the same day
as soon as they were let into the air , crowd started chasing and trying to capture them the ceremony , named ' freeing of butterflies ' , attracted thousands of chengdu citizens who eagerly awaited the release of the insects
this resulted in excited onlookers and their children chasing and trying to capture the butterflies with many people treading on them without realising
picture time : some participants were so busy taking photos that they did n't realise many butterflies had been stamped to death on the ground organisers said some butterflies failed to take off properly because they had just arrived from tropical yunnan where the temperature was higher than chengdu and so they were slightly sleepy
