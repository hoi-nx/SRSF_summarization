traditionally at this time of year , a clutch of nervous owners in charge of struggling clubs in english 's top flight grapple with the prospect of relegation , and the enormous hole it threatens to blow in their finances
do they stick by a floundering manager hoping he can regroup and lead his team out of the mire , or do they get rid and hope the appointment of new coach can transform its fortunes ? on monday , sunderland 's u.s. owner ellis short elected to twist and fired the club 's uruguayan manager gus poyet , confirmed by a statement on its official website
now that task is for someone else as ellis short and sunderland try to protect the cool $ 106m it pocketed last season , with one eye on the new television deal in 2016 that 's worth over $ 7.8 billion to the epl 's 20 clubs
" particularly television money , because it now accounts for over 50 % of most , if not all , epl clubs ' turnover
" the tipping point came saturday when fellow strugglers aston villa fired in four unanswered first - half goals against sunderland , having scored four away goals in its previous 14 epl matches
even though cardiff city , which finished bottom of the epl last season , still banked $ 92.1m for its efforts , the disparity between tiers one and two in english is vast
" most obviously , the tv revenues from the epl deal , " chadwick answered when asked what sunderland stands to lose if it does fall through the trapdoor
aston villa 's u.s. owner lerner , who is in the process of trying to sell the club , decided to act after a miserable run of form that saw them score just 12 goals in its opening 25 epl matches
after saturday 's win , the birmingham club is now three points clear of the relegation places and ellis short will be hoping for a similar bounce when he appoints a new man
and he suggests the approach of ellis short and lerner proves u.s. owners still do n't fully understand the dynamic of english football as well as they perhaps should
" we 've seen it with aston villa -- this is probably a prime example of an owner that many people speak highly of even now but i do n't think they understand local communities or the somewhat parochial nature sometimes of english football still
" chadwick also says the bumper television revenue afforded to clubs in modern football has created a tiered epl in which few teams outside the established giants can realistically expect to compete at the top end
