it is easy to visualise them together , those barn - storming runs of shearer and the clever link - up play from rooney alongside him
in the no 9 and 10 shirts of england , they would have been lethal
â i admired shearer when i was growing up , â admitted rooney , as he prepares to lead england out for a prestige friendly against italy in the juventus stadium on tuesday night
shearer is the england striker rooney would love to have joined up front for his country former newcastle striker shearer celebrates his goal against luxembourg at wembley in 2000 â i loved the way he played and he was a real goalscorer , as his record shows
i would have worked well with him as a strike partner

so what does rooney , who scored his 47th goal for his country in the 4 - 0 rout of lithuania on friday evening , look for in a partner ? â i âve played with a lot of different players with different qualities and i âve adapted to every player , â added rooney

gary neville laughs with england players including phil jones and rooney during a team stadium visit a debutant harry celebrates his maiden england goal in friday 's 4 - 0 win over lithuania harry is expected to gain his first england start during the international friendly match against italy â i âm probably as excited about harry as everyone in the country , â admitted rooney
