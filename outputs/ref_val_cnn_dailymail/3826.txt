with 60 years of managerial experience between them , louis van gaal and arsene wenger have more big match experience than most coaches still involved in european football
games like this , however , still throw up unique questions and challenges , both before and during play , and on monday night he two men faced one of their biggest nights of the season in a competition their respective clubs are unusually desperate to win
arsene wenger âs decision to include danny welbeck ahead of giroud seemed baffling
giroud had scored five goals in his last five games and it was hard to think danny welbeck would have anything in his repertoire that his former team - mates in the manchester united ranks did nât know all about
for an hour here it seemed as though the arsenal manager had blundered a little
arsenal were familiarly quick and progressive through midfield but danny welbeck seemed unable to hold of possession long enough to bring his supporting players alexis sanchez and oxlade-chamberlain in to play
arsenal left back nacho monreal jumps in the air after putting his side in the lead manchester united captain rooney cancelled out nacho monreal 's opener ultimately , though , arsene wenger âs decision was vindicated when danny welbeck was bright enough to anticipate antonio valencia âs back pass and calm enough to win his subsequent challenge with david de gea and score the winner
daley blind was selected as manchester united âs only holding player and that , in turn , released ander herrera and fellaini to try and hurt arsenal further up the field
ashley young has looked good going forward from left - back this season and by shunting him further up the field , van gaal gave him licence to trouble young bellerin
ashley young celebrates with rooney following the manchester united and england captain 's equaliser tactics and style arsene wenger is nothing if not brave when it comes to these games and that was reflected in his decision to pair santi cazorla and mesut ozil as central players
arsenal âs three - man attacking formation took a while to click but the holders â full - backs bellerin and nacho monreal got significant change out of their opposite numbers , forcing them back , and this allowed the visiting team to stretch the play in a fashion that made manchester united look distinctly uncomfortable
one final question , here : if rooney is the man chosen to take your free - kicks from out wide , just what does that say for the abilities of ashley young and angel di maria ? technical area savvy arsene wenger once got so animated here that he ended up standing on the platform behind the dug - outs after being sent from his seat
arsene wenger ( left ) was animated on the touchline during arsenal 's win against manchester united substitutions van gaal sees football as an 18 - man game and his use of substitutes â both good and bad â has been a feature of his time at old trafford , just as it was during last summer âs world cup
arsene wenger âs response was positive , sending on a like - for - like replacement in aaron ramsey
arsene wenger gambled with his selection and tactics and knew he would be criticised if it did nât come off
