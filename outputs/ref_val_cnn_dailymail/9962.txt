parents are in danger of being reported to police by their children 's head teachers if they allow them to play video games for over 18s
a letter sent by a group of schools in cheshire raised concerns about the ' levels of violence and sexual content ' young people are being exposed to by playing games such as call of duty and grand theft auto , which are renowned for their violent characters and have an 18 classification
it warns that if teachers are made aware their pupils have been playing these video games they will contact police and social services
it comes amid fears children could be left more vulnerable to grooming and abuse by being exposed to early sexualised behaviour as well as extreme brutality , often seen in video games in the upper age classifications
the letter says : ' call of duty , grand theft auto , dogs of war and other similar games , are all inappropriate for children and they should not have access to them
the letter also warns : ' if your child is allowed to have inappropriate access to any game or associated product that is designated 18 + we are advised to contact the police and children âs social care as it is neglectful
' the teachers claim the games can expose children to sex and violence , making them vulnerable to abuse there is now more pressure on teachers and social workers to report concerns about children after david cameron announced they could face up to five years in prison if they do not speak out about suspicions children are being neglected or abused
headteacher mary hennessy jones , who helped draft the letter , told the sunday times : ' we are trying to help parents to keep their children as safe as possible in this digital era
' the letter was sent by a group of primary and secondary schools , warning people over the dangers video games with an 18 classification are known for their violence
call of duty allows players to take on the role of a blood thirsty soldier in a number of violent scenarios - arming themselves with an arsenal of weapons including rifles , pistols and grenades
games such as grand theft auto are renowned for their violent scenes and brutality towards women grand theft auto is well known for its violence which includes carjacking , gambling , killing and simulated sex with prostitutes
however the message from nantwich education partnership has been criticised by parents as going too far , and threatening parents rather than helping them
