kane did not just score the two clinically taken goals that took spurs to victory over qpr at loftus road on saturday and lifted them into the scrap for the champions league places
the england manager , roy hodgson , watched from the directors â box and it must surely have reached the stage now where naming kane in his squad for the forthcoming matches against lithuania and italy later this month is a formality

the sub-plot in west london was that the spurs striker won his personal goalscoring duel with charlie austin
kane has now scored in six consecutive away games for spurs , whose victory took them to within three points of manchester united , the side sitting uneasily in fourth place

spurs soon shook off their uncertainty , though , and five minutes later kane met a cross from walker at the near post with a glancing header and brought a brilliant point - blank save out of robert green
the half sank into a stalemate until a defensive error by walker almost allowed qpr to snatch the lead
the england full - back attempted a headed backpass but austin saw it coming and intercepted it , turning it goalwards
even though spurs were dominating possession and eriksen was orchestrating play beautifully , the best chance of the half fell to qpr after half an hour
sandro celebrates his goal with qpr team - mate yun suk-young sandro scores from the edge of the area to pull a goal back for qpr but they are unable to draw level sandro 's shot beats lloris and goes into the bottom corner of the goal to bring qpr back into the game charlie austin has an attempt on goal after beating the offside trap charlie austin watches his shot beat lloris but come back off the cross bar and away to safety charlie austin reacts after missing a chance to score for qpr during the game with spurs matt phillips played the ball into the box and when it ran on to austin , his left - footed rising drive beat lloris but smashed against the underside of the bar and away to safety
none of the qpr defenders attacked the ball , nedum onuoha ducked under it and kane beat green to the ball to head it past the onrushing keeper and into the empty net
kane showed in stoppage time at the end of the half what a fine all - round player he is becoming with a fine pass out to andros townsend
and spurs began the second half in the same vein when a ferocious , whipped shot from eriksen beat the despairing dive of green only to rebound off the inside of a post
spurs keeper lloris is left standed as qpr 's mauricio isla has an attempt on goal qpr striker austin beats jan vertonghen to the ball and gets his shot away on goal sandro looks to win the ball while surrounded by spurs duo mason and andros townsend both ramsey and pochettino do their best to get their message across to their players qpr were desperately trying to stay in touch now and it took some desperate defending to stop spurs extending their lead
qpr could nât hold spurs at bay any longer , though , and midway through the half , kane put the match out of their reach
he beat the offside trap and ran on to a ball from mason , whose energy and ability will also have caught roy hodgson âs eye , before taking the ball round green and sliding it into an empty net
rangers then laid siege to the spurs goal in the dying minutes but spurs defended stoutly and ramsey âs team were left to rue their shortcomings at the back and contemplate an increasingly forlorn fight for premier league survival
