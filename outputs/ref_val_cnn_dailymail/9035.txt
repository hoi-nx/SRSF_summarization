the gangster who supplied the murder weapon which killed rhys has attempted to return to the area where the late boy âs family live , it was claimed today
james yates , who provided the smith & wesson revolver used to kill the 11 - year - old child , can not enter the croxteth park neighbourhood of liverpool where the murder took place
but the 27 - year - old applied for his exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted so he could visit a relative - meaning he could have been in the area where rhys âs parents steve and jones still live
gangster : james yates ( left ) , who provided the smith & wesson revolver used to kill rhys ( right ) , can not enter the croxteth park neighbourhood of liverpool where the murder took place mrs jones , 49 , said it was â awful â to learn of his application in a letter last saturday - the day before mother âs day , which she described as an â emotional occasion â
â how can they be allowed to apply for dropping the exclusion zone ? this is the third time this has happened now
however , the moj was said to have revealed yesterday that james yates 's request had been denied
reacting to this decision , mrs jones said : â at last , common sense prevails
shooting location : rhys died on august 22 , 2007 , outside the fir tree pub in croxteth park
james yates applied for his exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted so he could visit a relative after james yates walked free it meant only rhys , who was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years , was left behind bars after seven people were convicted over their involvement in the horrific crime
following his release , mrs jones called james yates the â most evil of them all â
nathan quinn , kelly , gary kays , melvin coy and a 16 - year - old who can not be named have all served sentences
grief : if james yates had been successful in his bid , he could have been in the area where rhys âs parents steve and jones ( pictured ) still live james yates was 21 when he was jailed for just seven years for supplying the gun used to kill rhys and helping rhys cover his tracks
he and two other members of the croxteth crew-quinn , 18 , and kelly , 17 - winked , smiled , smirked and cheered in the dock as they were handed sentences blasted as ' disgusting ' by rhys 's family
the ' wall of silence ' faced by police meant that while rhys 's name swiftly emerged as the prime suspect in the shooting outside the fir tree pub , months of painstaking detective work was required to charge him with murder
