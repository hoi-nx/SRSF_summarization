it was a decade ago that terry , who has captained chelsea 528 times , first learned the tricks of the role under the tutelage of mourinho
after impressing mourinho upon inheriting the armband from marcel desailly , the manager wanted to see terry evolve from a very good centre half into a great captain , using his profile to control games and influence decisions in the way roy keane , patrick vieira and alan shearer did
like them , terry proved quite an expert

mourinho , questioning a decision with the officials , saw his chelsea side crash out of europe the chelsea squad are left reflecting what might have been after the costly 2 - 2 draw with psg mourinho muddies it all with his quotability and media strategy , always seeking to gain a small advantage , which can be vital at the rarefied end of european competition where teams are so tightly matched that each big decision is magnified in importance
it might be time to rekindle the spirit of the respect campaign , because seven years is a long time in football and unlike the words of wisdom from mourinho into terry âs shell - like , many of the basic points have been forgotten
