welcome to nigeria 's free readers associations -- where mostly young men gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day
they are called " free " because nobody actually buys the newspapers they are reading
discussions among the free readers are loud and furious and have only intensified as nigeria goes to the polls to decide who will be the next president
newspaper vendor mgbachi , a former shoemaker from nigeria , who has a stand in tinubu square on lagos island said that far from being bad for business , he welcomes the free readers
the free readers come from all walks of life and cnn spoke to analysts , an accountant and unemployed youth at the stand we visited
mgbachi added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet
