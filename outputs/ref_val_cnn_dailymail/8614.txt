the footage could show scenes from any amusement park , anywhere in the world , yet it is a propaganda video designed to show the ' lighter ' side of living under the bloodthirsty islamic state caliphate
shot in dijla city , a fairground just north of the iraq city mosul , children and adults describe life under isis control
' in the video , we see men and children playing in dijla city theme park , which is located just on the outside of mosul in northern iraq , ' mr charlie winter said
' safe to say , this is a heavily idealised version of events
' fairground fun : children and adults are asked by the interviewer what life is like under isis control and they are all very complimentary caliphate : if the footage were to be believed , children living under islamic state rule live a good life and spend their days playing in the sun deceiving : a small boy waves at the camera in an islamic state propaganda video and youngsters enjoy the fairground rides all the fun of the isis : shot in dijla city , a fairground just north of the iraq city mosul , children and adults what life is like under isis control the isis interviewer asks one child , who is standing alongside an armed companion , what his life is like
' one child tells the isis interviewer that life under the caliphate is ' very good ' and said he is ' at ease ' and relaxed a man , who carries a young girl in his arms , tells the interviewer : ' all is good here , there is security that is enviable
would we want more ? there is a huge difference now , it is better than before ' charlie winter , a researcher at the quilliam foundation , a counter-extremism think tank , analysed the footage and said : ' safe to say , this is a heavily idealised version of events ' smiles : youngsters are interviewed in the video and it is no surprise they are complimentary of bloodthirsty isis the footage , which shows no women , could n't be more different to chilling new images of a sword - wielding isis executioner publicly beheading three men accused of homosexuality and blasphemy , also in northern iraq
