the build - up to manchester united âs fa cup quarter - final against arsenal has inevitably rekindled memories of their epic encounter in 1999 ; roy keane âs sending - off , peter schmeichel âs penalty save and giggs â mazy , mesmerising winner followed by a shirt - stripping celebration
manchester united âs semi-final victory at villa park that night came to epitomise sir ferguson âs treble - winning team
so as manchester united prepare to face the gunners again for a place at wembley on monday night , it âs perhaps understandable if their supporters are growing disillusioned by the brand of football being offered up by louis van gaal âs team
giggs ( right ) scored arguably the greatest fa cup goal in manchester united 's 1999 win over arsenal giggs watches his left - foot strike fly past david seaman as defender toy adams slides in too late giggs ' semi-final winner was followed by a shirt - stripping celebration in an iconic moment at villa park manchester united won the treble with ole gunnar solskjaer 's late champions league strike against bayern munich it does nât seem to matter what tactics the dutchman employs , the result seems to be the same
whether it âs down to a three - man defence , a midfield diamond , or simply a case of launching high balls up to marouane fellaini , manchester united simply have nât been very entertaining this season
current manchester united boss louis van gaal has been criticised for his brand of football this season van gaal 's philosophy this season is different to manchester united 's trademark cavalier style of play juan mata ( right ) leads the way as manchester united 's current crop prepare to face arsenal in the fa cup david de gea , marouane fellaini and luke shaw ( l-r ) could all start against the gunners at old trafford scholes , giggs âs former team - mate who joined him on the coaching staff for that brief stint last year , has described manchester united âs football as â miserable â
â manchester united âs history was built on attacking football , which does not always mean that the team kept clean sheets or did not concede chances , â says scholes
the goalless 2005 fa cup final against arsenal ranks as one of the worst in recent memory , though largely due to the negative tactics employed by arsene wenger before his side won on a penalty shootout
his sacking two years later in 1981 was attributed to the fact that his team were just too boring even though manchester united had just ended the season with seven straight wins , typically six of them by a one - goal margin
â dave sexton ( centre ) was sacked as manchester united manager in 1981 after failing to play the manchester united way manchester united supporters displayed a banner demanding the sacking of ferguson during the late 1980 's tommy docherty embraced busby âs philosophy
when home attendances dropped to 33,000 during ferguson âs darkest period in late 1989 , it was largely down to a dreadful run of results that left manchester united hovering above the relegation zone
they find it hard to take when wayne rooney is dropped into midfield , marouane fellaini goes up front , and sam allardyce of all people gets to label their team â long ball united â
but as manchester united aim to move a step closer to lifting the fa cup for a record 12th time , he would do well to remember that style counts every bit as much as silverware at old trafford
angel di maria 's form has dropped alarmingly after a bright start at old trafford following his summer move di maria ( centre ) was substituted at half - time during manchester united 's 2 - 0 win at home to sunderland last month deploying marouane fellaini ( right ) as a makeshift forward has also received negative feedback this term
