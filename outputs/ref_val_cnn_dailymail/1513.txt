but , when rodgers turns around a season by simply deploying players in different areas of the pitch , even the most hardened sceptic ought to be able to see just how important tactics are and that tweaking your system can be a game - changer
rodgers addresses his players as they prepare for the united clash at anfield the liverpool manager was under pressure earlier in the season after a poor start to the campaign the liverpool manager was on the back foot in december
his team were conceding goals , they could not score and they did nât look anything like the side they had been the previous season
what a bold and clever move to go to three at back and push the wing - backs on
ironically , he first did it at old trafford in december â and his reward was a 3 - 0 defeat
they had six one - on - one opportunities and should not have lost the game
those two in the pocket â the merson / scholes pairing in my team or two of adam lallana , coutinho and raheem sterling for liverpool â have the freedom to get wide , to move in front of wing - backs or to go inside into positions that threaten in the box
liverpool manager rodgers talks to midfielder adam lallana at training ahead of the visit of united rodgers issues instructions to his players before a training session at melwood on friday glenn hoddle played three at the back when he was england manager the shock factor : why liverpool âs 3 - 4 - 3 works ... the key is that no one else plays it
i watched the 2 - 2 draw against arsenal in december and although liverpool equalised in the last minute , it was clear that arsenal did nât have a clue how to play the system
liverpool had 63 per cent of the possession
liverpool can push the front three up to press the opposition high up the pitch
the wing - backs do nât have to get back and cover as much as a full - back does , so they can be right in behind and the side has five , six or even seven pressing up top
it has restored the energy to liverpool âs game , enabled them to pin teams back and to dominate possession
suddenly , they looked like the 2013 - 14 side
but liverpool usually deploy it in a positive fashion and the way in which it uses space to ensure that everyone has an option means it is incredibly hard to play against
martin skrtel heads the equaliser in injury time during the 2 - 2 draw with arsenal back in december arsene wenger tries to organise his arsenal side as they relinquished 63 per cent possession to liverpool ... but louis van gaal âs back three does nât work louis van gaal has used a back three several times in his career â in his ajax team that won the champions league , at barcelona and very successfully in the world cup with holland
but at united he has nât been able to deploy it with the success that rodgers has at liverpool
liverpool are prepared to give their defenders the ball under pressure and they âve been comfortable with that
united , with the likes of chris smalling , phil jones and jonny evans , have not succeeded because they are not comfortable in possession under pressure
rodgers has deployed emre can , originally signed as a midfielder , as one of the back three louis van gaal has also used three at the back with united but has not enjoyed success like rodgers the likes of chris smalling ( above ) and jonny evans are not accomplished enough on the ball united have hit on a system to match rodgers sunday âs match against tottenham saw united produce an impressive performance when they looked to be back to where they should be for the first time this season
after their best results earlier in the season â the 3 - 0 win over liverpool , the 2 - 1 win at arsenal or the 2 - 1 win at southampton â they will have come away thinking : â how did we do that ? without david de gea we would have been struggling ! â but after the tottenham game , for the first time in a long time , they would have come off knowing that they dominated the game and that they had deserved their victory
that âs why i believe van gaal will stick with this format for a while , although it might need a tweak at anfield
fellaini produced a smart finish to open the scoring against tottenham last weekend carrick showed no hesitation in celebrating against his former club after finding the net last sunday they played one holding player against tottenham â and having carrick back in that role really makes a difference â with herrera and fellaini as the inside right and left
they âll try to do that against liverpool âs wingbacks and pin them back
but united must ensure an extra player drops in deep alongside carrick , especially in that opening 20 minutes
but initially i would drop players deep and tell rooney to save his energy for the times when united have the ball
ashley young and juan mata played so wide against tottenham just like marc overmars and finidi george did for ajax under van gaal but it âs liverpool who now have the momentum liverpool âs win at swansea on monday was so important
certainly a trophy and top - four finish was unthinkable when these teams last met
not so now , largely thanks to rodgers âs tactical rethink
