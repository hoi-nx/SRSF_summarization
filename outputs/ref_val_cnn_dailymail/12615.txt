over the past several years , a number of studies have indicated a likely link between higher levels of maternal ozone exposure and poor health outcomes in infants , including changes in lung structure and function , low birth weight and neuro - behavioral abnormalities
these studies add to a substantial amount of evidence showing the ill effects of ozone for people of all ages
estimates place the toll in 2007 at 15,000 premature deaths related to ozone among individuals of all ages
in addition , studies confirm that these daily pollution alerts are inadequate to protect our health because they are based on the present federal ozone standard , which does not include evidence from current , critical health science
thinking that it 's safe to work or play outside when ozone pollution levels trigger a yellow air quality alert ( indicating a " moderate " level for ozone pollution ) can significantly threaten the health of many vulnerable individuals
in order to truly protect our children , we need strong , national standards limiting ozone
the americans epa ( epa ) proposed new ozone standards in november that would bring limits in line with the science
epa is accepting comments from the public on the standard until tuesday , march 17 , and both of our organizations have expressed support
â strengthening the ozone standard to reflect the best current science will help save lives and protect our families , including pregnant women and their babies .
