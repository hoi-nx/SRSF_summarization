egypt is ready to ditch cairo and build a shiny new capital if the government has its way
fed up with pollution , traffic gridlock , a packed population with soaring rents and creaking infrastructure , egypt is teaming up with a developer in the emirati to build a city in what could be one of the world 's most ambitious infrastructure programs
the yet - to - be - named city will spread out over 150 square miles , or roughly the size of denver , and could eventually be home to 7 million people , the developers and government announced friday

an exact location was not announced , but the city is expected to be built east of cairo
