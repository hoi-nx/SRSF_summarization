scientists are working to prevent painful and potentially deadly foot diseases in captive elephants by finding the best way to trim their feet
wild elephants benefit from walking long distances on different surfaces and rubbing their feet in abrasive dirt , but their captive peers can experience problems without these â natural pedicures â
dr olga panagiotopoulou , from the university of queensland âs school of biomedical sciences , is working with collaborators around the world to understand how captivity influences elephant foot form and function , as well as identifying the best method of preventative foot trimming
wild elephants ( a stock image is shown ) benefit from walking long distances on various surfaces and rubbing their feet in dirt , but their captive peers can experience problems without these â natural pedicures â pressure plates were transported to the adventures with elephants safari park in south africa ( pictured ) to study the foot pressures of elephants kept in semi-wild conditions with natural terrains â we know that when these large animals walk , a huge amount of pressure is applied to their feet
â preliminary data has indicated that foot pressure is more evenly distributed across the sole of the foot when the animals walk on natural grounds , but when they are walking on surfaces such as concrete the pressure is concentrated around parts of the foot that are more prone to disease , such as the lateral toes
working with zebris biomechanix in germany , she has developed pressure platforms to measure the pressure and forces applied to elephants â feet while they are walking
â the plates were recently transported to the adventures with elephants safari park in south africa to study the foot pressures of elephants kept in semi-wild conditions with natural terrains , â she said
â the elephants were trained to walk over the pressure platforms and the individual footsteps were processed using a state - of - the - art neuroimaging technique called statistical parametric mapping , which , in simple words , gives us a high - resolution image of foot pressure changes over the foot
â if a captive elephant walks over a pad and a different digital pressure pattern from normal is seen , this can be investigated further
