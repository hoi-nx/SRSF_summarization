the secret of how the legendary star wars spaceship the millennium falcon was built has been revealed - in a high - security project codenamed ' magic roundabout ' in the welsh countryside
the only full - size model of han solo 's iconic craft was constructed at an aircraft hangar in pembroke dock , west welsh , where workers were sworn to silence over what they were making
newly released photographs show dozens of joiners , welders and metal - platers at work during the three months they spent putting together the giant freighter flown by harrison ford in the famous science fiction series
the giant steel doors were kept shut from morning until night to hide the construction - there were no unauthorised visits , photographs were banned and the workers were sworn to secrecy
the never before seen picture shows how the millennium falcon earned its wings in the town of pembroke dock
' pembroke dock is a military town and we have people coming from far and wide to follow family footsteps , be it navy , army or air force
' people can still see the very building where the millennium falcon was made
work on the model ( pictured ) finished in 1979 and it was transported to film studios in hertfordshire mr clark recalled : ' one of the directors was in cahoots with someone with the studios or someone associated with the star wars films
it was just a reasonable size team of workers that built all the framework
' the artists in the film industry , the craftsman , went to work on it and made it into what you see on the empire strikes back
