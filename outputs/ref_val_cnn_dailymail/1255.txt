to begin with , cavendish seems like he might rank among the more challenging interviewees
he anticipates questions before they âve been asked , refuses to give an answer to some and offers monosyllabic responses to others
he curses when he talks about the doping scandals in his sport and complains that the newspapers only cover such stories in cycling
has he not read the recent coverage of similar scandals in athletics and rugby ? with a wry smile , he accepts that he has nât
british cyclist cavendish , pictured with lee matthews , insists he has plenty more to give help for heroes patron cavendish is confident he 's not past his best following his 11 wins in 2014 cavendish believes he does n't get the media coverage he deserves because he no longer rides for team sky it might be that we âve got off on the wrong foot
we meet in the bar of a hotel in windsor and i congratulate him on his victory in belgium the previous day
i remark that he âs had a â couple â of good wins already this season
â i âve had six , â he responds a little tersely
but this is what makes him interesting beyond his brilliance at the business end of professional bike racing , beyond the explosive drama of a peloton hurtling towards the finish line at 40 - odd mph
he has long proved himself a master racer with his sharp bike skills and that explosive turn of pace
but cavendish has a sharp mind , too
it makes interviewing him something of a contest but an experience that is utterly fascinating
when he talks about the support he provides our injured servicemen and women as a patron for help for heroes , there is genuine emotion
he takes a swipe at â the government â for not doing enough for these â amazing people â
he can relate to the â team mentality â that develops among soldiers
â it âs more than a job , â he says
cavendish left team sky because he thought the focus was on sir bradley wiggins and chris froome cavendish felt chris froome ( left ) and wiggins ( right ) received preferential treatment during his time at team sky â people think i âm past it , â he says , unprompted
at 29 , is he ? â no , â he says
cycling is pretty scientific these days , after all
â i had 11 wins last year , which is more than any other british rider
but because i ride for a team that âs not supported by a media giant i do nât really get the coverage other riders enjoy
â he is having a dig at team sky here , the â british â team he represented for a year but left when he realised the focus was more on sir bradley wiggins and chris froome and winning the grand tours than on delivering him to the front of the peloton to win stages
but the truth is last year was not as successful as previous seasons
at least not in the eyes of cycling fans who measure cavendish by his grand tour stage victories
he crashed out of the tour in that opening - day sprint into harrogate and appeared to have been superseded by the giant german , marcel kittel , as the main man in a tarmac tear - up
the 29 - year - old believes he will reach his peak during his 30s and is confident he is now at the right team a significantly larger man than cavendish â 6ft 2in plays 5ft 9in â kittel is a powerhouse
but cavendish makes the point that his best is yet to come because â sprinters often peak in their 30s â and also says â it âs not simply about pure power â
cavendish , pictured during a race in lido di camaiore , has had a successful start to 2015 â my team has had a rival , â he says
but now i âm pretty confident i âve got the strongest lead - out team
we did nât build anything at team sky
â last year he ( kittel ) only won one more race than me and i was out for half the season
but do nât forget the amount of times i âve been in the final run - in and he âs already been dropped on a climb
â even after all the he success he has enjoyed , the 43 grand tour stage wins , the world titles , cavendish insists he remains as hungry as ever
cavendish is confident dopers will be kicked out of cycling because ' the system is working ' andre agassi claimed in his autobiography open that he did not like tennis despite his success â you know in andre agassi âs book , where he says he did nât like tennis ? i âm telling you , he liked tennis
if you âre doping in cycling i ca nât believe how s * * t you must be as a cyclist
but year on year it âs got better
it shows the system is working
â cavendish is encouraging daily mail readers to ride with heroes by signing up to the help for heroes hero ride 2015 : the biggest ever cycling show of gratitude and support for our injured servicemen and women
