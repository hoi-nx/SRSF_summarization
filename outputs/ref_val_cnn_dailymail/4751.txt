he 's better known for his fancy footwork on the pitch but liverpool and england striker daniel took time out of scoring goals to get some kitchen action
the 25 - year - old birmingham lad was taken through his culinary paces by his mother grace , who taught him how to make her favourite dish ahead of mother 's day
and like her reds son , mum grace is a fan of healthy eating and requested the kop ace to create a high protein meal of spicy grilled chicken with seasoned quinoa and vegetables
daniel and kisses his mother grace after he successfully cooks spicy chicken with quinoa and vegetables as part of his mother 's day challenge the 25 - year - old birmingham lad in action on the pitch , competing with alex baptise of blackburn rovers during the fa cup quarter final match on sunday 8 march the duo joined forces in the kitchen as part of a sainsbury 's active kids event at a school in st paul 's rc junior school , liverpool
daniel , who cooks his own meals every day , told femail : my mum is amazing , she has provided me with so much support and continues to do so always
' to spoil my mum i would probably cook her something healthy with a bit of spice to it , fish based maybe
' for the challenge the sainsbury 's active kids ambassador had to prepare quinoa - which is a superfood favourite of the family - and marinate the chicken with grace 's home - made spicy ' sturrcrazy ' sauce , made to a secret family recipe
the pair cook together when they can although these days it 's becoming rarer
grace said to femail : ' when we can we like to cook together , but it does n't happen so often these days , as daniel lives away from home
mother and son work together and start off by seasoning the chicken with a mixture of spices as the chicken marinades the pair chop the vegetables and prepare the rest of the meal what was daniel like as a child ? daniel has always been really active , he played football in and out of school
at home he would play out whatever the weather ! because of his naturally active lifestyle , he always loved meal times and eating afro - caribbean food
what is his favourite food ? i would say he has two favourite dishes , fish and chicken
' his favourite meal to cook is ' salmon , kale , sweet potato , broccoli and quinoa ' which he covers in sturr crazy sauce
' a typical day will see him pack away three scrambled eggs with berries for breakfast whilst lunch and dinner are heavy on protein - rich foods ' lunch and dinner could be quite similar to each other with something like quinoa , with perhaps chicken or fish [ as ] they are both great for recovery and full of protein , ' he said
tara hewitt , head of sponsorship for sainsbury 's active kids 's said : ' it was great to see daniel and grace cooking together at the event ; they clearly have a passion for great tasting , healthy food
