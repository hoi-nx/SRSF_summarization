i 'm 33 and have been single for nearly four years
most of my friends hint , imply or say it 's my fault for being too shallow , picky and prone to falling for bad boys
i use tinder , the dating app synonymous with casual sex , to meet attractive men who meet my high standards
yvette caster , 33 , had been single for four years , before she decided to do an experiment where she swiped right to all men on tinder for a week it 's a great way of filtering out those you find physically unattractive - just swipe left and they ca n't even message you
but , after another friend accused me of being picky , i decided to see what would happen if i swiped right to all men on tinder for a week
why would i want to ? i 've already received 43 matches and seven messages before 9am
after the first day of swiping right to all men , the london - based journalist was met with 43 matches and seven messages , all before 9am tuesday i have messages from 22 men and am chatting to all of them to avoid being ' too picky '
i usually have messages from two men a week , tops
keeping 22 different chats going is hard work and confusing , especially when so many men are called dave
tinder clocked on to yvette caster 's promiscuous swiping and sent her a message banning her from ' liking ' anyone else for 24 hours thursday the chats have gone so well that i 've given my number to three men , although i 'm still doubtful about whether i could be physically attracted to them
friday i 've been asked on three dates - nice dinner dates , not hook ups
the 33 - year - old found that attractive men were more likely to message sleazy pick - up lines ( left ) , whereas less attractive men tended to be more polite and seek relationships saturday just because i can , i go back to swiping right on all men again - men with big beards ( yuk ) , men pictured with their much better looking friend and men who think women are attracted to star wars screen grabs
i also have 69 matches and those dates to prepare for
in the end , none of them prove to be the one , but i did have some lovely evenings - good company and intelligent conversation
