this is how two of china 's most popular websites chose to celebrate international women 's day sunday , unleashing a storm of criticism , especially on social media , which ridiculed their home page " doodles " as sexist stereotypes
internet users were quick to point out how the efforts of baidu , china 's biggest search engine , and youku , dubbed china 's youtube , contrasted with global rival google
" this is how you define women and celebrate them ! " said weibo user @ zoexiaoyizi of baidu 's music box
baidu and youku did n't immediately respond to calls for comment
the doodle uproar came as china authorities detained several women right 's activists this weekend
on monday , five were still being held police , said an activist and a friend of the women , who asked not to be identified
" in other countries , doing such things on international women 's day is natural , while in china you get detained for fighting for women 's rights , " she said
under chairman mao zedong , women famously " held up half the sky " but there is a growing sense that china women today face more , not less , discrimination than in the past
and china 's state - run media often appears more concerned with women 's looks and marital status than equal rights
showing the same tin ear as baidu and youku , the people 's daily , the communist party 's official newspaper , published an online gallery entitled " beauty with brains
guo , the professor , said that more and more women are n't happy with the gender roles china society ascribes to them , and this year 's string of " sexist incidents " reflects men 's concerns that women are n't as " feminine " as they once were
