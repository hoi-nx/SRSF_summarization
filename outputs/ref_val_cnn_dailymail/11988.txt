recent arrest durst poses for a mugshot photo after being arrested for murder and detained on march 14 in new orleans , louisiana on friday , millionaire durst 's attorneys claim that he was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered susan berman in california , as well as drug and weapons charges filed in new orleans
in the papers filed at the state criminal district court in new orleans , william gibbens and dick deguerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep durst jailed
... they 're gon na find nothing , " dick deguerin , the lead attorney on durst 's team , told ktrk-tv
' ' invalid arrest ' : durst 's legal team accused authorities in documents today of arresting the real estate heir illegally , as his attorney blasted louisiana officials for wanting a piece of the ' publicity pie ' ' i think he 's an easy target and everybody 's piling on ... they 're gon na find nothing , dick deguerin ( pictured ) , the lead attorney on durst 's team , said on friday the judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by durst on monday in new orleans
durst 's arrest came shortly before the hbo finale about his links to three killings â that of his first wife , who disappeared in new york in 1982 ; susan berman , the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared ; and a 71 - year - old neighbor in texas whose dismembered body was found floating in galveston bay in 2001
frail : durst is on suicide watch at a louisiana detention center durst has only ever been tried for the texas killing , and he was acquitted of murder
durst waived extradition in new orleans but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance
however , durst 's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge
he has been charged in los angeles with first - degree murder in the 2000 killing susan berman , the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in new york in 1982
while legal experts said durst 's remarks off - camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible , prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing
' prosecutors are not commenting on the susan berman case while durst is still held in louisiana , where he also faces firearms charges .
