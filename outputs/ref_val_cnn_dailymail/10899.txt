labour has been accused of suppressing a major report because it did not support its claim that the nhs is under threat from privatisation
the health select committee was due to publish its study of nhs funding before the election
the mps were told that , on the contrary , the pace of privatisation had actually slowed since the election , and that there had been no extension of charges and top - ups â meaning that there was no reason to think the nhs would not remain free at the point of use
healthcare row : tory mps on the health select committee have accused four labour counterparts of blocking a report that suggested the ' pace of privatisation ' in the nhs has in fact slowed since the last election this dealt a blow to labour 's argument that david cameron can not be trusted with the nhs
rather than publish the report weeks before the election , the four labour committee members blocked it after reading a draft , claimed their tory counterparts charlotte leslie , robert jenrick and percy
' last night , the angry tory mps released a dossier of some of the report 's findings
conflict : tory mps charlotte leslie ( left ) , robert jenrick and percy claim their rivals blocked the report because it made the tory look good , but labour mp valerie vaz says the report they released themselves ' did not make full use of the evidence ' the dossier also said expenditure on nhs administration had fallen from 5.1 per cent in 2009/10 to a planned 2.7 per cent in 2015/16
' a labour source said : ' the tory mps did n't want to admit to what their government has done
