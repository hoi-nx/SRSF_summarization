it 's already had ripple effects , including a u.n. statement on friday condemning what it called " the brutal killing and burning of a 27 - year - old mentally ill woman
" that corresponds with what the woman 's parents told cnn affiliate tolo , saying their daughter suffered from mental health problems for the last 16 years
