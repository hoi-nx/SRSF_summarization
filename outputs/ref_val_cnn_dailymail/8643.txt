league one and two clubs have been asked to consider proposals allowing premier league under - 21 clubs to take part in the football league
clubs were very much against the addition of premier league b teams to the football league pyramid when it was suggested in june 2014 , and this has now been put forward as an alternative
the football league could involve premier league ' b ' teams in future if plans get the go - ahead youth squads from the likes of manchester united and chelsea could soon be headed for the lower - tier cup if the football league do bring ' b ' teams into the football league , they could adopt a similar format to that suggested by greg dyke last year , meaning teams would : it would see a change in format for the football league , with a group system being brought in
a statement from the football league clarifying the situation read : ' clubs have been asked to consider the concept of permitting 16 u21 teams from clubs with category one academies to participate in the football league
' the competition would feature 16 groups of four teams with one u21 team in each group , before a knockout stage leading to a final at wembley
' given the previous concerns of the premier league and its clubs about premier league b teams playing in the pyramid , any final proposal would also be accompanied by a change to the premier league 's articles of association that would protect the current 72 club constitution , save for any changes to promotion / relegation that clubs wished to make
' therefore , having provided them with this comfort , clubs willingly debated the potential commercial , financial and player development benefits of having u21 teams in this competition from 2015/16
' instead , league one and two clubs were asked to indicate whether they were content to see the football league progress the matter , which would include discussions with the premier league and football association , so that clubs can consider a full proposal at a future point
' therefore , as yet , no club has voted in favour or against the idea of having u21 teams in the football league , they have only indicated whether they wish to consider the matter further
' ultimately any changes to this competition will only happen with the support of league one and two clubs
' what is the football league ? more commonly known as the football league because of its sponsor , the football league is a competition for the clubs of league one and league two
how would this work ? 16 of these under 21 sides would enter the football league
