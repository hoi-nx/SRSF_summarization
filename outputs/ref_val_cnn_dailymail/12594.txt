from the sweltering heat of the sahara desert to the subzero temperatures at both north and south poles , oakes ' running obsession knows no bounds
dubbed the " queen of the extreme , " the record - breaking runner has completed more than 50 marathons and ultramarathons , but she remains determinedly modest about her feats
i do n't have trophies -- people have cabinets of trophies -- the dogs have chewed most of mine , " oakes told cnn 's human to hero series
" perhaps the 48 - year - old needs to rethink her definition of special given her punishing schedule is religiously maintained despite her suffering from a potentially crippling knee complaint -- a legacy of reconstructive surgery during her teens
" i had a tumor ( in my right knee ) when i was 14 years old , it was n't discovered until i was 17 , by which time i had lost an awful lot of weight -- i think i weighed around five stone , " she explains
" in the end i had radical surgery to remove the kneecap and knee joint
" oakes started running properly just over a decade ago and soon found her stride , winning her first half - marathon in a course - record time before stepping up to compete over 26.2 miles and beyond
today , she routinely finishes conventional marathons in around two hours , 50 minutes and has a personal best of two hours , 38 minutes -- a shade over the a standard required to qualify for the 2012 olympic games
when she 's not pounding the tarmac in city marathons , oakes competes in some of the world 's toughest endurance races counting the volcano marathon in chile 's atacama desert -- an 150 - mile ultramarathon run at altitudes in excess of 4,400 meters ( 14,600 feet ) -- and the similarly challenging marathon des sables where competitors run six marathons in six days through the sahara desert among her conquests
she still winces at the memory of competing in that 154 - mile saraha event , dubbed the world 's toughest footrace
the following year , oakes broke three world records becoming the fastest woman to run a marathon on each continent -- clocking an aggregate time of 26 hours , 18 minutes and 43 seconds -- as well as recording the fastest aggregate and elapsed times for running marathons on all seven continents plus the north pole -- a place she remembers warmly
" there is no let up in her schedule when she 's crosses the finish line -- once she 's got her breath back it 's straight back to the day job running an animal sanctuary at her home in asheldham , essex
with 400 animals including horses , pigs , sheep and dogs to care for around the clock as well as keeping up her training routine of 100 miles every week , it 's no surprise that oakes has little time for anything else
" running has helped her raise money for the animal sanctuary and also allowed her to promote a positive image of veganism , though oakes , who has n't eaten animal products since her teenage years , is keen not to sound too preachy
" i do n't like to dwell on the vegan thing because ( you ) quickly gets marked as some sort of fruitcake or an animal rights extremist and i do n't want to appear to be telling people what to do -- it 's a personal thing , " she says
" i just want to be an example to say that if these people are considering this lifestyle , it can be done on a plant - based diet
" as if to hammer home her point , oakes recently attempted to run seven marathons in seven days on seven continents -- running in a " cow costume " to raise awareness of animal cruelty
next month , oakes will be off on her travels again , returning to morocco to compete in her third marathon des sables , before heading back onto the road to compete at the berlin marathon later in the year where she aims to better her 17th - place finish achieved in 2006
