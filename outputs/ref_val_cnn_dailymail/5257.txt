they wrote : ' the estate agent showed us architectural plans for the completed development as we marvelled at the power of human ingenuity
' despite forcefully voicing our concerns that the view was limited to only 360 Â° , the estate agent assured us that on a good day we âd have a great view of some prime london real estate ' the bed was comfortable and the bath was more than spacious enough for both of us at once
' we went in with an offer of Â£ 800 , which is the sum of our overdrafts combined
