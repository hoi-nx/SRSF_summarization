johnson has criticised a controversial government ruling to stop 430,000 civil servants talking to journalists
the mayor of london raised concerns about a change to the civil service code , quietly introduced last week , which makes it clear that officials can be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister
cabinet office minister francis maude agreed to redraft guidance to â strengthen protection â for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money , and include a commitment to being â as open as possible â with parliament and the public
the mayor of london , pictured during a visit to kew gardens last week , disagrees with the new rule to stop civil servants speaking to the press however , that has failed to satisfy critics who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign
mr johnson , a former journalist , told the daily mail : â i believe in maximum possible transparency
sunlight is the best disinfectant
â there âs virtually nothing that you can say or do that is nât instantly foi - able
mr johnson said he believed in ' maximum possible transparency ' â most civil servants understand that there âs a difference between being useful and helping public debate , and undermining the operation that they are in
â the cabinet office insists that the amendment to the civil service code will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media
the change appears have been agreed by sir jeremy heywood , the cabinet secretary , who has been dubbed sir cover up over the long delays to the chilcot report into the iraq war
however , the impetus is understood to have come from ministers , who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they , not civil servants , are ultimately in charge
