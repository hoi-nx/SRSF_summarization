at the front of this room stands an afghanistan freshly back from fighting in syria , and intent on recruiting other afghanistan to fight alongside him for isis
this seems to be part of isis 's first moves into afghanistan , a bid to bolster their ranks for the fight in iraq and syria by vacuuming up disgruntled former taliban fighters -- or even just students looking for a cause
there 's no shortage of battle - hardened militants here
and as nato leaves , the taliban looks strong if a little fractured -- and the possibility of peace talks ahead with the afghanistan government could alienate some of the group 's more radical elements
" concerns are growing about how isis may expand into afghanistan
when asked why isis might be on the rise here , afghanistan president ghani told cnn 's fareed zakaria : " the reason it 's happening is because ( the ) collapse of yemen , syria , iraq has created an environment where instead of one weak link in the interrelated system of states , now there are wider spaces
" the united nations special representative to afghanistan , nicholas haysom , told the security council that isis 's presence in afghanistan was " of concern , " but was most troubling in its " potential to offer an alternative flagpole to which otherwise isolated insurgent splinter groups can rally
" a senior u.s. official told cnn that " the terrain is there " for isis to grow in afghanistan
pakistan government is concerned , " he said , before adding that disaffected taliban might also be attracted to the group
an afghanistan cameraman working for cnn was introduced at first to militants seeking to recruit fighters to assist an al qaeda - linked group in syria
the group the militants say they come from -- khorasan -- is better known as a radical part of the al qaeda faction of al-nusra , in syria , where many afghanistan fight
yet isis experts say some of khorasan 's militants have defected to join isis , and those defectors in turn sent recruiters to afghanistan to try to bolster their ranks
at the meeting that our cameraman was permitted to film , the militants produced application forms that bear the logo of the islamic state -- the name the group prefers to be called -- although they appeared to be using the group 's older nomenclature of isis on the documents
