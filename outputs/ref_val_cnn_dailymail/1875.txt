greedy rail firms are charging customers up to Â£ 215 per day to park at city centre stations in what has been branded ' daylight robbery ' by union bosses
the ' outrageous ' parking charges amount to a ' stealth tax ' on train travel adding up to 50 per cent of the total cost in some areas , according to the tssa rail union
the worst offenders were birmingham new street , liverpool lime street , manchester piccadilly and leeds , all of which charge Â£ 215 for a 12 - hour stay
liverpool lime street station was named among the most expensive for parking in the country , forcing customers to pay Â£ 215 for a 12 - hour stay union bosses accused train companies of using parking charges , such as the Â£ 215 - per - day fare at birmingham new street , as a way to get around rail fare price caps issued by the government the most expensive annual parking tickets are snow hill at Â£ 3003.30 , reading at Â£ 1805.50 , guildford at Â£ 1,800 and cambridge at Â£ 1,596.30
per 12 - hour stay birmingham new street new street - Â£ 215 liverpool lime street - Â£ 215 manchester piccadilly - Â£ 215 leeds - Â£ 215 per year snow hill - Â£ 3,003 reading - Â£ 1,805 guilford - Â£ 1,800 cambridge - Â£ 1,596 union bosses claimed companies were using the extortionate charges as a way to get around the caps on rail fares which are imposed by the government each year
the report says : ' rip off rail firms have been profiteering at passengers expense by hiking ' back door ' car parking increases to by - pass inflation only curbs on fare rises
' network rail and the private rail firms are charging as much as Â£ 215 for day long stays at city centre rail car parks while also charging as much as Â£ 3,000 for annual parking tickets
' he added : ' charging over Â£ 200 for all day parking in station car parks at birmingham new street , manchester piccadilly and leeds is little short of daylight robbery
' mr cortes said : ' parking charges as high as Â£ 1,800 at commuter hot spots like guildford and reading were effectively putting another 40 per cent to 50 per cent parking tax on top of annual season tickets which are already way too high
annual car parking fares at some train stations such as guilford , which charges Â£ 1,800 for a pass , come on top of annual travel tickets which cost more than Â£ 3,000 edmund king , president of the aa , said : ' station car parks face a difficult balancing act in not setting parking charges that are lower than those in neighbouring car parks , encouraging non-rail users to take spaces intended for train travellers
unfortunately , this becomes an excuse for much higher parking charges , although longer - stay car parking does demand a higher and more costly level of security
they said many stations do not charge for car parking , and where they do , charges set by train companies are similar to those in town centre car parks
