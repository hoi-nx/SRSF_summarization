as many as 13 senior leaders of al-nusra , including the terror group 's military commander , were killed in two syrian airstrikes thursday , a middle eastern security source who was briefed by syrian intelligence told cnn
al shami was among those killed in the strikes against al-nusra , al qaeda 's largest affiliate in syrian , the source said
syrian 's state news agency sana also reported al shami 's death
the special operation that took place in hobait , in idlib province , was part of a wider effort by syrian forces to destroy areas believed to be gathering points for al-nusra militants around the province , according to sana
also killed in the northwestern province of idlib was a senior saudi operative in the group , the source said
but on friday , the source told cnn the latest assessment of syrian intelligence was that al jolani was not injured
one strike targeted a meeting of senior al-nusra leaders ; the other was on a home being used as a base , the source said
by the time of the 9/11 attacks , al shami had started to train recruits in afghanistan and was named as the head of the syrian jihadist contingent within al qaeda
when he got to the afghanistan - pakistan region , one of bin laden 's top deputies , attiyah abd al rahman , tasked al shami with leading al qaeda efforts in syrian , but he was arrested as he traveled through lebanon , according to the video , and was detained for five years
