' toby attacks his mother during a tantrum sara and her son casey try to get toby off a bike during one of his outbursts the brunt of toby 's behaviour is borne by his parents - richard and sara have both been strangled by their son and during the hour - long programme , he is regularly filmed punching , biting and kicking them both
