france is filled with foreboding about the fate that awaits philippe saint-andre 's misfiring team at twickenham
the coach has come in for fierce criticism during another six nations campaign of grinding , mid-table mediocrity , but according to two members of the last gallic team to win a championship match in london , exactly a decade ago , the problems run deeper than the man in charge
their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the top 14 league which has stalled the development of home - grown talent â and the death of french flair

yachvili , the goal - kicking hero of france 's 18 - 17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005 , describes it as a ' bad time for our rugby ' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue
' to me , the problem is that we have too many foreign players in the top 14 and all the good young french players do n't play enough , ' said the former biarritz scrum - half
the young players do n't play and that is not good
' when young players arrive in the french team , they do n't have enough experience of the high level
a few years ago , you had to be good for one or two years for your club , before you could be picked for france
former france scrum half yachvili fires out a pass during his side 's clash against england in 2004 yachvili 's sublime goal - kicking performance secured france 's last victory at twickenham back in 2005 ' wales at france and against ireland in dublin , we were not very far from winning those games , but we are missing the experience that is needed
if we did n't have so many foreign players in our league , the players would have more experience and we could win those games
' serge betsen was another stalwart of the france team that stormed the twickenham barricades 10 years ago
' former france flanker serge betsen ( right ) is worried by the amount of overseas players in the top 14 noa nakaitaci once captain of the fiji schoolboys team , the powerful winger moved to france after clermont auvergne set up an academy in the pacific islands
asked if his country have tried too hard to play like england , yachvili said : ' yes , yes
we have lost our french rugby a little bit , because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the french clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing
' serge betsen echoed his former team - mate , adding : ' england has taken parts of the french to add that x-factor to their game â guys like george ford â who are n't just about kicking but can spot the gap
serge betsen believes players such as gael fickou ( left ) and wesley fofana are hindered by the current system ' of course , it is the biggest game for us
it is the last game this year and england can still win the six nations
' that is certainly what yachvili did in 2005
it was his special goal - kicking that helped france rally from a 17 - 6 half - time deficit to win 18 - 17
' it was crazy because , in the captain 's run training session the day before the game , my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game , ' he said
giant new zealand - born prop uini atonio ( right ) is another foreign player that is part of the france squad ' i broke my kicking tee in the captain 's run training session and i had to ask a friend living in london where i could buy a tee , because i wanted the same one
he said the only shop around was at twickenham , so he went to buy my tee for the game there , but nobody knew it ! i will not tell you the name of the friend , but he is english ! ' france surely wo n't be short of a tee or two this time , but better preparation may not be enough to end their long wait for a championship win in the english capital
