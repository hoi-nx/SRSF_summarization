an islamic state propaganda website geared towards celebrating the sacrifice made by melbourne teenage jihadi , bilardi , has done anything but glorify the actions of the 18 - year - old suicide bomber
the post , titled as the story of abu abdullah al-austrälä« â the name bilardi adopted after he travelled to iraqi to join is â gives the teenager some praise as a devout muslims who prays and fasts often
iraqi military spokesman general tahssin ibrahim said no one was killed and just a few vehicles were damaged in bilardi 's suicide mission
the extremist site seeks to praise bilardi but delivers backhanded comments describing his weakness and ultimately the futility of his sacrifice
it goes on to say that bilardi volunteered for a ' martyrdom operation ' - code words for a suicide bombing - and that he was eager to carry out the mission
