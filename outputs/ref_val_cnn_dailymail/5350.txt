higher earners are to benefit from the first real terms rise in the 40p tax threshold for seven years
in a surprise move , the chancellor announced a modest â down payment â on tory plans to raise the bracket for paying higher - rate tax to Â£ 50,000
david cameron vowed last year to end the scandal of so - called â fiscal drag â , which has seen millions dragged into paying 40p tax by freezing and cutting the starting threshold
but mr osborne cheered tory mps by announcing a series of modest increases in the 40p threshold in the coming years , culminating in a 1.4 per cent rise in 2017 â just above the forecast inflation rate of 1.2 per cent
the chancellor announced that the amount a spouse can transfer to their partner is being raised by Â£ 50 â in line with the rise in the personal income tax allowance
now that the personal allowance has been raised , the chancellor âs move means that taxpayers will be able to transfer Â£ 1,100 of their allowance to their spouse â an increase of Â£ 50
the plans mean that the income at which the higher rate is payable will rise from Â£ 41,865 to Â£ 42,385 in april 2015 , Â£ 42,700 in april 2016 and Â£ 43,300 in april 2017
mr osborne also announced that , unlike in some previous years , higher - rate taxpayers will benefit in full from another planned increase in the personal allowance
the chancellor said the allowance â the starting point for paying income tax â would rise to Â£ 11,000 by 2017 , from its planned level of Â£ 10,600 next month
the changes announced yesterday are worth Â£ 80 to basic - rate taxpayers and Â£ 172 to those paying the 40p rate , and will cost the treasury Â£ 1.6billion by 2017
the decision to raise the personal allowance to Â£ 11,000 takes a big step towards mr david cameron âs pledge to raise it to Â£ 12,500 by 2020 if the tory win the election
the announcements confirm that the tory will have to implement massive rises in the 40p threshold in the later years of the next parliament in order to hit mr david cameron âs Â£ 50,000 pledge
the number of people paying 40p tax has risen by around three million to five million since 2010 , as a result of coalition decisions to cut the threshold to help pay off the huge budget deficit left by labour
ministers initially cut the threshold for paying 40p tax and then raised it more slowly than inflation
an aide to the chancellor insisted that hitting mr david cameron âs targets by 2020 would be â affordable â in the context of the Â£ 7billion surplus which the government is forecast to be running by the last year of the parliament
â zac and suzanna furbank are among the 27million individuals to benefit from the rise in tax - free personal allowance
it means lower earners like 33 - year - old mr furbank , who makes Â£ 11,000 as a trainee public relations officer , will be lifted out of paying income tax altogether
