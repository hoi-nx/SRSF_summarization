clive betts , chairman of the communities and local government committee , said ofsted 's ' credibility is on the line ' ofsted 's credibility suffered a major blow yesterday when scathing mps said the inspectorate was partly to blame for the rotherham child sex abuse scandal
the education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs
yesterday a parliamentary committee probing ofsted âs work there called for urgent inspections of every council in the country with responsibility for child protection â to ensure large - scale abuse is nât being ignored elsewhere
clive betts , chairman of the communities and local government committee , said ofsted âs â credibility is on the line â
the labour mp added : â the perpetrators bear ultimate responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children in rotherham but the ineffectiveness of ofsted âs inspections contributed to a failure to expose the extent of the problem
â the fierce attack came on the day a second group of mps found flaws in ofsted âs handling of the trojan horse affair , in which birmingham schools were accused of fostering religious extremism
meanwhile , the rotherham report pointed to ofsted inspectors repeatedly labelling child protection in the town as â adequate â â yet they were tied to their paperwork and had no idea what was really going on
the education and child protection watchdog had given a clean bill of health to the town ( pictured ) where as many as 2,000 children were exploited by gangs â we conclude that the experience of whistleblowers at rotherham was the antithesis of what a good whistleblowers policy should be , â the mps said
