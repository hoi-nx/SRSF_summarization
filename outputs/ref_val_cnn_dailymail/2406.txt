ibrutinib is one of only a handful of new medicines to be made available via the cancer drugs fund after two trials in 28 british hospitals showed it to be extremely effective in treating both mantle cell lymphoma ( mcl ) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( cll )
â about one in every 25 people will be diagnosed with blood cancer during their lifetime â that âs 25,000 people each year in the british
of these , 2,800 will have cll , the most common type of leukaemia , and 500 will have mcl , a rare type of b - cell lymphoma
for the time being , a course of ibrutinib â which costs up to Â£ 74,000 a year â will be prescribed only to patients whose disease does not respond to chemotherapy , or those who have relapsed following chemotherapy
