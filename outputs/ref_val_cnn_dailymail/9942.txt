the complexity of the human brain - with its 86 billion neurons - has puzzled scientists ever since the greek philosopher plato attempted to understand how it worked
now researchers are claiming that our brains may in fact be far simpler than had previously been believed - and it took research on sea slugs to reveal it
neuroscientists based at manchester university and the rosalind franklin university of medicine and science in chicago , have studied the brains of sea slugs as they move
researchers studied the brains of the sea slug aplysia ( pictured above ) , which have around 18,000 neurons their brains , while far smaller than our own , share some of the complex structures of higher organisms while their neurons are large and easy to observe
the researchers found that rather than creating a mass of confusing signals that appear in scans of the human brain , they were able to see neurons acting as groups
the study from the university of birmingham and the mrc cognition and brain sciences unit in cambridge is the first to isolate the ' adaptive forgetting ' mechanism in the human brain
they found that these groups were actually laid out like tiles to form a circuit
' sea slugs have just 18,000 neurons in their entire nervous systems yet have been found to be remarkably similar to other organisms
the scientists studied neurons in the ganglion area of the brains of sea slugs , shown in the image above the human brain ( shown in the model above ) is known to have specific structures that perform different roles but how neurons are organised within those has remained a mystery as studying them as they work is difficult in the new research , which is published in the journal neuron , the team of scientists were able to map how the large neurons in the brains of the sea slug aplysia as they moved
until now scientists have had to study electrical signals of individual neurons or the whole brain ( like above ) these tended to be organised into modules or tiles that had related activity and pass signals between them in a loop
