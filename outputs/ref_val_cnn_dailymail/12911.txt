perth , australia in the swan valley on the outskirts of perth , a petite , blonde woman opens the front door
dressed in skinny jeans , a gray t - shirt and black heels , danica weeks welcomes us inside her family home
her warm smile and sparkly green eyes briefly disguise the deep - seated grief and sadness that constantly envelops her
the mother of two young boys ca n't move on
her life is stuck on march 7 , 2014 , when she kissed her husband paul goodbye at perth international airport
he was heading to mongolia , where he would begin work as a mechanical engineer at one of the mines
it was a big job with enormous opportunity that could set up his young family
unable to wear jewelry at the work site , he gave danica weeks his wedding band saying that if anything was to happen to him , she should give the ring to the first son that marries
wearing it on a simple chain around her neck , she touches it as she speaks
" i 'm so glad that happened , that i 've got this for the boys , " she said
" and for me , because i may never get anything
" paul weeks , 39 , left perth that day and flew to kuala lumpur , malaysians , for his flight on to beijing
just after midnight on march 8 , he boarded mh370
weeks had no idea about the plane 's disappearance until she got a call from a news reporter asking if her husband was on board the missing boeing 777
how is a 4 - year - old going to understand ? she tells him daddy is working in mongolia -- the truth is just too painful
" you create your own scenarios in your head and you ca n't bear to think that someone -- your best friend , amazing husband , the father of my children -- went through any of that
when the " pings " were discovered and authorities believed they would find the black boxes within days , she was told to prepare for her husband 's memorial service
" when i 'm alone and i think ' what if he comes back ? ' i see our wedding pictures and i think if he was to come back it would be amazing ( for me ) and for the kids
jack has grown so much -- he was 11 months when paul left
paul weeks looks deflated -- she 's physically , mentally and emotionally exhausted
" week 's eyes well up with tears as she talks about her husband whom she met at the munich beer festival 15 years ago
no country has said this but it does n't stop danica weeks from thinking it
" you know , that 's so unfair -- where does that leave us ? we ca n't move on beyond mh370
they may be able to but they do n't come home to an empty house and 2 young children that should have their father here
when asked what she 'll be doing on march 8 -- one year since mh370 disappeared and since she last saw paul -- tears stream down her face
he gave everything to us
