' they 're so beautiful ! ' leuschen , who runs the farm with his wife and their two young sons , said he first noticed about half of his 600 to 700 ' easter egger ' hens were missing after returning to work following a brief illness
the targeted hens are known for laying colorful eggs which are particularly in demand around easter special : the ' easter egger ' chickens lay pink , blue , green and cream eggs ( pictured ) but owner leuschen said his family is now collecting just half of the eggs they would expect to have right now he told ktvu that the birds apparently vanished overnight from their coop , which he had always left closed but unlocked until the theft
heartbroken : leuschen , pictured , runs the sonoma county farm with his wife , sons and brother - in - law and said he is emotionally and financially devastated by the disappearance of the chickens loved : he said he misses his beautiful easter egger chickens , all of whom he hand - reared from birth leuschen , who started the business a few years ago , said he is down around $ 75 a day in earnings from eggs and about $ 100 invested in each chicken , for a total of more than $ 22,000
their eggs may be blue , green , pink , brown , olive or cream
an olive egger lays green eggs because it is the result of cross breeding between brown - and blue - laying chickens
likewise , because easter egger are a hybrid breed , a coop will lay a mixture of colors
if a chicken has white earlobes , it will likely lay white eggs , while if the earlobe is pink , the eggs will likely be non-white
easter egger are kept for their eggs but are not large enough to be used for meat
the birds , which he and his family incubated inside their home before hand - rearing , are a mixture of heritage and standard breeds , which allows for their colorful eggs
the demand for the eggs , which are blue , pink , grey , green and olive , is particularly high ahead of easter , now less that two weeks away , the family said
leuschen explained they should be collecting around 30 dozen eggs a day , and would expect to be getting as many as 50 dozen a day in a month - but right now they 're only collected 21 dozen
' he asked for anyone with information about the whereabouts of his stolen hens to contact the sonoma county sheriff 's office , which said it is unclear if it will investigate
