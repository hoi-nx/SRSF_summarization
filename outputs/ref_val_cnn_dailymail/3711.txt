and now sydney - based trio sketchshe are back with a second hilarious car jam titled ' mime through time ' featuring over 14 classic songs from the 40s through to now ... and this time they appear naked
the stunning models turned comedy act , comprised of shackleford , 28 , lana , 25 , madison lloyd , 27 , became an overnight sensation when they released ' bohemian carsody ' last month
' shackleford , 28 , says the reason she thinks they 've struck a chord with such a global fan base is that their song choice was so relatable , people love the song , it transcends the age and at some point in time everyone has had a ' rock out ' to it
another reason behind the sydney trio 's success is the natural sex appeal they inject into the humorous skit
