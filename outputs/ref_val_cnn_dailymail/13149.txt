washington during his upcoming speech to congress , israel prime minister netanyahu will lay out the details of what he understands to be the nuclear agreement between world powers and iran , hoping it will prompt lawmakers to question the administration and delay the march 24 deadline for a political agreement
a senior israel official traveling in netanyahu 's delegation , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the israel government had " a good understanding of the agreement we can draw conclusions from
" the prime minister is going to congress to explain what they do n't know about this agreement that it is a bad agreement
" will speech backfire ? the official said congress has " no understanding " of the deal shaping up
he described the prime minister 's speech as a " last chance " to speak directly to congress before a march 24 deadline for a political framework agreement about the elements believed to be in the deal
the official would not disclose how the israel government reportedly had more information on the deal than the congress , but noted that many of the parties were leaking details of the talks
" the official suggested netanyahu would urge lawmakers in his tuesday address to pressure the obama administration to push the deadline so more discussion can take place about what he perceives is a dangerous deal that leaves iran with the ability to develop a nuclear weapon down the line
they can change it " the official said that as the march 24 deadline approaches , netanyahu will warn " be careful of giving up compromises
" that deadline was agreed to by the five parties and iran , which is why kerry is having marathon meetings with the iran foreign minister mohammad javad zarif in geneva beginning again this week
