some of the 100 fraternity brothers of the now - disbanded sae chapter at the university of oklahoma have received death threats after the release of a video in which a racist chant was heard , a lawyer for the chapter 's board said friday
attorney jones said other members of the former chapter of the fraternity have been physically assaulted , though he would n't go into specifics
jones told a news conference that he had been retained by the board of trustees -- the alumni advisers for the chapter -- " to assist them in evaluating certain legal issues and other matters that may impact local chapter of sae
" there are no plans right now to sue the university , which shut down the chapter 's house and disbanded the sae chapter , he said
the national chapter of sae also revoked the university of oklahoma chapter 's charter
jones said he is involved to protect the due process and first amendment rights of members
the fraternity 's national office said it is investigating the incident in the video to see if it needs to take action against any of the students
" we are committed to following the due diligence and protocols that we have set forth in our fraternity laws , " the national sae office said after the news conference , " as they are designed to enable us to make deliberate , thoughtful decisions that reflect our commitment to our standards and to our members
another chapter of the sae fraternity is under fire over alleged racial slurs -- this time in seattle
university of washington students are accusing fraternity members of offensive comments during a protest to raise awareness about racism last month
" people were called monkeys and apes by members of sae , " said negussie , president of the university 's black student union
sae 's university chapter denied the allegations , saying an investigation determined the culprits were not members of the fraternity
michael hickey , president of the fraternity 's university chapter , said the chapter was notified of the protest incident on february 25 -- the same day it happened
" we have determined this due to eyewitness accounts from our members viewing nonmembers of sae yelling offensive comments on the sidewalk near our chapter house , " he said
