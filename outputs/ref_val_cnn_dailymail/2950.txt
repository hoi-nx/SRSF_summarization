when an indiana man spotted a ratty old painting at a yard sale , even one dollar seemed like too much
ronnebaum is n't sure what exactly it was about the painting of seven men playing pool that captured his attention a decade ago - just that it ' jumped out ' at him
but last week he discovered it was painted by esteemed artists from chicago 's palette and chisel academy of fine arts ' that one just stood out to me , ' he told wthr
it was just last week that ronnebaum , who lives in batesville , realized the bottom of the painting was signed ' palette and chisel club 1910 '
ronnebaum said he went on ' the almighty google ' and found out the artwork had been painted by esteemed artists from chicago 's palette and chisel academy of fine arts
the palette and chisel academy was founded in 1895 by students at the art institute of chicago 's night school
the painting is now being restored and will go up for auction in may in chicago seven members from the renowned artists organization came together to paint each other for the artwork , which could fetch up to $ 10,000 realizing the history that was hanging on his wall , ronnebaum contacted churchman , a gallery owner in indianapolis
the painting is now being restored and will go up for auction in may through leslie hindman auctioneers in chicago
although churchman said the auction ' seemed perfectly timed , ' he believes the fact that the painting was created by seven different artists could make it a hard sell
' the academy ( pictured today ) was founded in 1895 by students at the art institute of chicago 's night school
some founding members mortgaged their own houses so that they could buy the studio that still stands today
