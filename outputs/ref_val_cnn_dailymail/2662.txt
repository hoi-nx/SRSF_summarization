but chris benn and dennis knew they were getting their potential dream home at a bargain â for it cost them just Â£ 1
now , after six months of hard work , they have a property worth Â£ 60,000
however the couple are not in a hurry to cash in â which is just as well because to get the two - bed mid-terrace for such a low price they had to agree not to sell it or rent it out for five years
through the keyhole : this is the refurbished interior of the house that dennis , 21 , and chris benn , 22 , bought for just Â£ 1 dennis , 21 , and chris benn , 22 , pictured left , are quids in after the property in stoke-on-trent , pictured right , is now believed to be worth Â£ 60,000 car factory worker mr benn , 22 , and his 21 - year - old fiancee bought the house in stoke-on-trent under a regeneration scheme
buyers receive a Â£ 30,000 interest - free council loan to help cover the cost of essential repairs and refurbishment
the new homeowners agree to repay it over ten years â by which time the property will be worth far more than Â£ 30,000
photography student miss dennis , who is eight years younger than the average first - time buyer , said : â it âs a dream come true to have a house of our own
â the couple has transformed the property , which was just a shell when they bought it , and turned it into a home that they can be proud of to qualify for the scheme , miss dennis had to get a regular part - time job as mr chris benn is self - employed
mr chris benn and miss dennis now believe the house is worth around Â£ 60,000 as a similar but slightly smaller property in the same road â which was not part of the regeneration project â sold for Â£ 55,000
the Â£ 3million scheme , funded by the council and central government , was announced in 2012 following the success of similar projects in liverpool and rotterdam
the council had to complete some structural work on the mid-terraced property before the couple could begin updating the inside the small but modern kitchen the couple has installed in their new home after buying the property for just Â£ 1 in stoke-on-trent - on - trent the couple told how they had to fight to get onto the popular council run scheme , which saw miss dennis take a third job working hard : the couple has said all the hours of work it took to get the two - bedroom property and then to transform it has been worth it to support the transformation , police have increased the number of patrols , while the labour - run council has installed cctv to deter crime and improved other services
miss dennis said : â although the area used to be really good it gradually got a bad reputation
to get it all sorted is lovely â though we are still working on the garden ! â miss dennis and mr chris benn , who have been engaged for four years , have now completed the work on their dream home miss dennis said her parents had hoped she would marry mr chris benn before they moved in together , but they understand this offer was just too good to miss a proud miss dennis said ' we would never have been able to afford a house without the scheme , ' as she showed off her new home the couple took out a Â£ 30,000 loan with the council for 10 years to carry out the work on the rundown property miss dennis said : ' we 're looking forward to it becoming a family area again where we can bring up children and people know their neighbours ' one of the streets in stoke-on-trent where boarded up properties have been sold for just Â£ 1 in a bid by the city council to improve rundown areas ( file picture )
