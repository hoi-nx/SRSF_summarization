as a manager at several prominent media outlets , zaleski did not understand the demands on working moms and often belittled their work ethic
zaleski said she committed multiple " infractions , " against these women , including scheduling late - afternoon meetings or happy hours without considering that mothers with after - work responsibilities would n't be able to attend
' " now a mother to a young daughter , zaleski said she was wrong to undervalue mothers ' contributions by counting hours logged in the office and not the actual work done
" zaleski 's piece has been shared more than 1,000 times and has been hailed on social media by many commenters who applaud her for seeing the error of her ways
since the essay was published tuesday , zaleski told cnn she 's received more than 2,000 emails from readers who admit they 've committed similar infractions in the workplace
some people refuse to accept zaleski 's apology and accuse her of borrowing from similar apologetic essays by other new moms
" this woman has basically stolen another woman 's post about her views on mothers with children in the workforce for her own personal gain ! ! , " wrote one commenter on zaleski 's essay
others accuse zaleski of writing the essay just to promote the new company she co-founded , power to fly , an online platform that matches women with technical skills to freelance projects they can do from anywhere
zaleski said that notion is " just silly , " and she 's taken a huge risk leaving a stable job to start a company that is a part of the solution
zaleski said her company , which launched in august , enables women to work from home so that they can " be valued for their productivity and not time spent sitting in an office or at a bar bonding afterwards
" i like this article a lot , but wish the solution was n't to have a company that helps mothers find jobs that keep them tucked away at home , but to change the dominant culture to create better , more supportive workplaces where flexible schedules are encouraged , " said suzanne pekow carlson on facebook
others say they wish zaleski went further , and instead of only addressing the challenges of the working mother , wished she 'd included other caregivers , like dads
" i hope the convo ... expands beyond just working moms to working dads , folks taking care of sick parents , etc. , " abc 's karen travers said on twitter
and said another commenter on zaleski 's essay , " if it takes this woman becoming a mother to understand the value of working mothers and have compassion for them , then i guess we ca n't expect men to understand and have compassion because they will never be able to be mothers themselves
" zaleski said she finds the criticism " frustrating , " but said she refuses to dwell on the negative
she wants to " stay focused on helping women find fulfilling work they can do from home
" she said her essay represents her " own personal experience , " which happens to mostly involve working with mothers
women not supporting women " is a systemic problem in our society , " zaleski said
