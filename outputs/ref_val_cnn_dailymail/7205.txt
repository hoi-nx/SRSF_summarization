there has long been tradition for mothers to pass on beauty lessons to their daughters
but now , mums are just as likely to ask their daughters for advice â particularly because the boom in online beauty bloggers means that young people have access to professional techniques at their fingertips
all you need to do is google â smoky eye â and you âll find dozens of videos showing you how to do it
it âs no surprise that these online beauty gurus have legions of followers , and two of the biggest youtube stars are norwich - based sisters sam and nic chapman , whose pixiwoo site has millions of viewers worldwide
when i met the girls , they were quick to credit their mother judy , 58 , with giving them some of the best tips they still follow
nic chapman ( left ) and sam chapman ( right ) credit their mother judy ( centre ) with giving them some of their best beauty tips which they still follow judy , too , loves having make - up artist daughters and readily admits that some of the best tricks she has learned have been from sam and nic chapman
with mother âs day coming up , i met with judy , sam and nic chapman to learn their top tricks
sam , 37 , and nic , 34 : mum has taught us
always remove your make - up
dirt builds up on the skin throughout the day and it blocks your pores and leads to breakouts
cleanse thoroughly before bed to remove both dirt and make - up â it will also keep your pillowcases clean ! moisturise twice a day and remember to apply the cream to your neck , too â our neck and hands are often the first places to show signs of ageing but they are nearly always forgotten
judy chapman : my daughters taught me
i am lucky because the girls help me shop for foundation
nic chapman ( left ) and sam ( right ) say their mum , judy ( centre ) , taught them to stay out of the sun and drink plenty of water as it helps to flush out toxins and improve moisture thin eyebrows can be so ageing and mine are a little overplucked from embracing the thin brow trend in the seventies
now the girls have taught me how to cheat my way to fuller brows with a brow pencil , i have a more youthful look
my eyelids are quite oily and my eyeshadow often creases , so when sam and nic chapman taught me to layer eye products , starting with an eyeshadow primer , it totally changed my look
