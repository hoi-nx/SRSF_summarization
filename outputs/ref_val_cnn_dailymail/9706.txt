speaking exclusively to daily mail online , yoga teacher allison urged durst to be honest with police if he knows anything about what happened to her sister , honors student kristen modafferi
before they retired parents bob was an engineer and debbie an elementary school teacher , have both now retired durst , who is worth an estimated $ 100 million , was arrested in new orleans last weekend
the family of kristen ( right ) want him to help end their agony ' we hope that one of these days we will get some answers as to what happened to kristen
' kristen disappeared from san francisco in 1997
oakland police now say there is no hard evidence to suggest that durst was involved , even though he was living in the city at the time
but in a statement , issued through family friend scanlon-petruski , parents parents bob and debbie modafferi pointed out that the fbi , which had investigated durst before , could come up with new evidence now.cops in the northern california town of eureka are probing whether he could have been involved in the disappearance of another teen , 16 - year - old karen who vanished just five months after kristen
home sweet home : last december the family sold the five - bedroom , four - bath family home in an upscale development south of charlotte where kristen and her three sisters had grown up summer in the city : kristen during her freshman year at north carolina state university
she planned to spend the summer in the san francisco before returning to her sophomore year at north carolina state university where she was studying design but as new interest has been aroused in durst , he finds himself linked to cases in at least four states , including the disappearances of kristen modafferi and mitchell
kristen modafferi moved to san francisco on her 18th birthday , june 1 , 1997
within days she started work at spinelli 's coffee shop in the crocker galleria in san francisco 's financial district to help pay for a photography course she was due to start at uc berkeley the day after she vanished
the last sighting of kristen was walking through the upscale mall with a blonde woman , who has never been identified
speculation has risen in recent days that it was in fact durst , a noted cross-dresser
' that blonde woman has never come forward and no - one has ever found her , ' said allison
this is not the first time that durst has been linked to kristen modafferi or to mitchell , who was 16 when she was last seen in eureka , california , five months after kristen 's disappearance
durst owned a house in san francisco at the time kristen vanished and he was known to be living in trinidad , california , some 25 miles north of eureka when karen went missing after getting into a car
the fbi checked durst out at the time but could not prove that he was connected to either woman
allison is also skeptical even now that durst , who was found not guilty of the 2001 murder of black , his neighbor in galveston , texas , despite admitting that he chopped his body up and threw it in the sea , will be charged in connection with her sister 's disappearance
' kristen 's parents , parents bob , an engineer and debbie , an elementary school teacher , have both now retired
last december they finally sold the five - bedroom , four - bath home in an upscale development south of charlotte , that kristen and her three sisters had grown up in , and moved to florida
in a statement , issued through family friend scanlon-petruski , parents bob and debbie modafferi pointed out that the fbi had investigated durst before
' it is possible though that the ongoing interrogation of durst by law enforcement that 's taking place right now could uncover new information that could be of value and lead to the truth about what happened to kristen , ' they added
' but police in oakland , california say there is nothing new to link durst to kristen modafferi
' the oakland police department conducted an investigation with the assistance of the fbi regarding the 1997 disappearance of kristen modafferi
