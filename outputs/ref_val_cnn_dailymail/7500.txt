move over kim kardashian - the ideal female body shape is leggy , tall and thin like taylor swift , not short and busty with a big bottom like the us reality tv star , claim scientists
a major study involving almost 60,000 volunteers rating almost 1,000 variations of the female figure discovered tall and slender is more attractive than curvy and hourglass - shaped
they created computerised images of different female body shapes based on 24 basic factors from bust and bottom size to length of legs and waist circumference
the 60 body shapes with the lowest ratings were eliminated
taylor swift is known for showing off her long limbs in short dresses whilst performing on stage again , they were rated by volunteers and the bottom 60 eliminated and the process was repeated for eight ' generations ' - a total of 960 different shapes and sizes of female body
what the researchers found was that in every generation , the 60 lowest rated body shapes were generally the fattest , shortest and roundest of the computerised figures
overall , nearly 60,000 volunteers took part in the ratings of whom 80 per cent were men and from all over the world
the report admitted that an ideal female body shape was still very much a matter of opinion - athletic men like athletic women , for instance , and different cultures had different tastes
volunteers were shown side and front on profiles of these women but the faces were pixilated in order for them to be rated purely on body shape and physical features
walking through la kim showed off her curvier figure , the new research claims to provide some of the most extensive research on female body shapes but overall it suggests tall and thin is preferred to short and curvy
it said : ' no study of a subject as complex as body shape attractiveness can provide all the answers
