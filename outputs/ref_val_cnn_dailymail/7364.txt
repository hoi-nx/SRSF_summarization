what will it take for arsenal fans to really love giroud ? yes , he is appreciated by the home faithful at the emirates but not to the same degree as other top strikers
aguero , costa and kane are worshipped at their clubs
but with similar goal - scoring exploits this season , giroud does nât get anywhere near the same level of affection from his fans or the rest of the football world
of the strikers mentioned , only aguero has a better minutes per goal rate in all competitions this season than giroud , who is a good link man and an important source of goals for arsenal
giroud has scored 11 premier league goals - and 15 in all competitions - during an injury - hit season giroud rounds monaco keeper danijel subasic during arsenal 's win in the champions league the frenchman slots home past brad guzan during arsenal 's 5 - 0 rout of aston villa he started the season in fine form and then was unlucky with injury but he hit the ground running as soon as he returned
if costa or aguero have a bad game , there is no discussion
arsenal fans have been fed a diet of pace and movement ever since wenger arrived
aguero won manchester city the title in 2012 and the argentine is worshipped by the club 's fans kane has burst onto the scene this season and is already adored by the tottenham faithful costa hit the ground running in england and has become a terrace hero amongst chelsea fans giroud is not as quick or graceful across the turf but he was bought as a replacement for van persie
it âs also interesting that danny welbeck and alexis sanchez were signed almost as giroud âs replacements but the frenchman is still the go - to man in the middle
now he has reverted to giroud , who is in a similar mould â there âs not a great deal of difference between a welsh battering ram and a frenchman one
giroud âs link - up play is exceptional and arsenal use him like a backboard , holding up play and waiting for others to run from deep and join the attack and he has been at the heart of many of arsenal âs best team goals
after robin van persie 's departure to manchester united , giroud was purchased to replace him alexis sanchez was signed to replace giroud , but the frenchman continues to keep his place danny welbeck has also been unable to dislodge the totemic striker from his role in the middle although he does not have the same movement as previous arsenal greats , he is versatile and wholehearted , and that has endeared him to most of the fans
wenger has an outstanding track record of improving strikers â i witnessed how he transformed emmanuel adebayor â and he is doing the same with giroud
he has done that and hopefully arsenal fans will come to love him more
