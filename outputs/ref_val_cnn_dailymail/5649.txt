noah , the new host of daily show , has spoken out in defense of himself following a social media backlash over comments he made about women and jewish in tweets dating back to 2009
the south-african comedian , who is little - known in the american , rocketed to national fame on monday after he was named as longtime host jon stewart 's replacement on the satirical news program
however , the excitement surrounding the announcement was tinged by hundreds of internet users accusing the 31 - year - old - who is a quarter jewish - of anti-semitism for his ' offensive ' posts
but in a tweet on tuesday , noah told his two million followers : ' to reduce my views to a handful of jokes that did nât land is not a true reflection of my character , nor my evolution as a comedian
' it comes as comedy central , which hired noah as a correspondent on the show just three months ago , has defended its newest star as a ' provocative ' comedian who ' spares noone , himself included '
' it added : ' noah is a talented comedian with a bright future at comedy central
' noah , the son of a half - jewish xhosa mother and a swiss father , was a trending topic on twitter on monday night as he drew fire for jokes that were described as tasteless , hateful , and unfunny
in may last year , noah tweeted : ' behind every successful rap billionaire is a double as rich jewish man
' a year earlier , he posted : ' note to self - langostines are not jewish prawns
' and in 2009 , noah , who can speak an impressive six languages , wrote : ' almost bumped a jewish kid crossing the road
he did n't look b4 crossing but i still would hav felt so bad in my german car ! ' on tuesday , the tweets were being posted online by enraged bloggers , who slammed noah as ' racist '
one said : ' jon stewart , born leibowitz , wo n't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets
' meanwhile , a blogger posted noah 's tweets in an article , with the comment : ' noah , the racist , hack taking over for jon stewart is also quite the anti-semite too
' viewers have lamented the end of jon stewart 's 16 - year stint on the show regardless of users ' opinions , the tweets showed a different side to noah than the picture painted by comedy central and the comedian himself just a day earlier
in a phone interview on monday from dubai , where he was traveling on a comedy tour , noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on - air - likened himself to new york - born jon stewart
' noah , who joined daily show just three months ago and speaks an impressive six languages , was being pitched by comedy central as reflecting a new age of global multiculturalism
successor : the 31 - year - old south-african comedian ( pictured in 2012 ) has been named successor to jon stewart , 52 , who will step down from his role on the show this year appearance : in 2012 , noah became the first south-african stand - up comedian to feature on nbc 's tonight show ( pictured )
in 2013 , he became the first to appear on cbs 's letterman noah was named as the program 's new host a little more than a month after jon stewart unexpectedly announced he was leaving daily show following 16 years as its principal voice
noah , who grew up in gauteng and starred on the south-african soap opera , isiding , will take over soon after
tough act to follow : noah was not surprisingly reverent of extremely popular departing host jon stewart as he tweeted monday about the news he 's the next host on monday , ganeless spoke of the advantage of introducing noah to a mainstream american audience through daily show , with viewers coming to the show he hosts with no preconceptions
born to a black mother and white father in south-african , 31 - year - old noah was not allowed to live with either parent and even passed off by family as albino because , under apartheid laws , different races could not mix noah , 31 , grew up in soweto , south-african , the son of a xhosa mother and swiss father
' noah began doing stand - up in south-african in his twenties and has since leveraged his ability to speak six languages into an international career
noah is also the only south-african comedian to ever perform on the late show and tonight show
' nonetheless , noah 's past is firmly rooted in south-african 's turbulent racial history
' south-african is a microcosm of the world and there is no doubt that a global audience will find resonance in his humor , ' he added in an email .
