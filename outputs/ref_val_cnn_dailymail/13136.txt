entertainers are paid for entertaining and it 's time athletes received financial recompense for taking part in the olympic , says 100m hurdler sally pearson
in 2014,while the winner of wimbledon received $ 2,600,000 and the augusta masters champion picked up $ 1,620,000 , when pearson won gold in the olympic three years ago she received zero prize money
" people come for the entertainment from the athletes -- we are entertaining them , we are entertainers " the australia , who set an olympic record of 12.48 seconds in her 2012 winning run in 2012 , told cnn anchor alex thomas
" billions might have tuned in to watch london 's london 2012 olympics which saw over 10,000 athletes compete across 302 events in a battle for golden glory , but the ioc 's current policy is to ( ioc ) hand out gold , silver and bronze medals as well as a bouquet of flowers to athletes , but no financial remuneration
the fifth fastest 100m hurdler in history , pearson told the australia 's daily telegraph in 2013 how a year after her olympic gold medal in london she still was n't attracting enough sponsors
now targeting more medal success at the 2016 rio olympics , pearson achieved a resounding win at the queensland track classic on march 7 with a time of 12.74s
" i think the times have changed from 1896 to 2016 , i think it might be time to at least have a think about it , and discuss it because there 's no such thing as the olympic without athletics or athletes , " said pearson .
