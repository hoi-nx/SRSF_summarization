england will kick off saturday 's game knowing precisely what they need to do to win the six nations and take huge momentum into the world cup
they had a similar chance a year ago â although they did nât play last â but blew it badly in rome
the common language of coaches in this position is â let âs win the game first , â but that is nonsense
this is not about beating france , it is about winning the title
they need a clear game plan to maximise points difference
chris robshaw 's england will know exactly what they have to do to win the six nations when they kick off luther burrell breaks with the ball during the england captain 's run at twickenham it is tempting to think england must throw caution to the wind and play a wild , attacking game
they do nât look comfortable on or off the field but the french have a habit of performing under pressure and they âre capable of beating england
england 's players gather as head coach lancaster looks on during the captain 's run joseph passes the ball during the england captain 's run ahead of the game with france lancaster must make it clear to his players exactly what they need to do to win the title if england need a big score , chris robshaw and the half - backs will face big decisions from the first minute
the amount of points they need to win by should be printed in big , bold type
england should be very pleased with the situation they find themselves in , especially after the hiding they received in dublin
personally , i would like to watch as much as possible ; if nothing else , it takes your mind off our game for a few minutes
some of the players may want to watch the wales v italy game while others wo nât
they âll be warming up while the scotland v ireland game is being played so there âs no question of them watching that , but i âd let the players know i would be putting the score from the ireland game up on the board in the changing room at 4.30pm so they know precisely what âs required of them
france are more susceptible than any international side if they are put under pressure and they have lost on their last three visits to twickenham
so england must try to ensure they take the lead early and force france to chase the game
joseph scores england 's first try against scotland and they must build a score against france this game is crying out for three drop goals in the first 20 minutes , even if you do nât score tries until later in the game
2 maintain discipline england must be squeaky clean and aim to concede no more than four penalties in each half
the contact area and scrum will be key and england can not afford to gift france easy points
scrum - half youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee nigel owens and england must not allow france to have the ball at the breakdown
ford passes the ball and england must keep the ball in play as much as possible also , to score maximum points , you need the ball in play for the maximum amount of time
england must also employ an exciting restart policy
4 kick well , chase hard this is a huge test of england âs tactical kicking game , which i âm not sure is as good as it needs to be yet
france will believe they can get at ford so brown needs to support his kicking game
field position gave jonny wilkinson the opportunity to get three drop goals as england won that semi 24 - 7 against a french team who were favourites to beat us
england must make sure the second half is played as a game of 40 minutes understand , france are currently the best defensive team in the tournament , having only conceded two tries
danny cipriani can be england 's trump card coming off the bench i âd expect england to win â then it becomes about by how much
it âs a massive gamble as courtney lawes and geoff parling have a history of injuries , potentially leaving nick easter to play the majority of the match out of position in the second row
