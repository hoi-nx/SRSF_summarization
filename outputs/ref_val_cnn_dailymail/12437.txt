washington a bill he is drafting would likely have a " profoundly negative impact " on the ongoing negotiations between the united states and iran over tehran 's nuclear program
corker is working on legislation that would force the obama administration to submit any deal reached with iran for a vote by congress
white house chief of staff mcdonough , in the three page letter released publicly saturday evening , told corker his legislation could be detrimental to the talks with iran by " emboldening iran hard - liners , inviting a counter-productive response from the iran majiles ( majles , the parliament ) ; differentiating the united states position from our allies in the negotiations ; and once again calling into question our ability to negotiate this deal
" as the united states and iran prepare for the next round of negotiations this coming week , there has been a growing debate between republican on capitol hill and the obama administration about how much authority congress has regarding the fate of the agreement
" the legislation you have introduced in the senate goes well beyond ensuring that congress has a role to play in any deal with iran
instead , the legislation would potentially prevent any deal from succeeding by suggesting that congress must vote to ' approve ' any deal and by removing existing sanctions waiver authorities that have already been granted to the president , " mcdonough wrote
the chief of staff said that only congress can terminate the existing iran sanctions that are included in laws , but the president can relax some sanctions put into place by executive order unilaterally
the chief of staff told corker , " the administration 's request to the congress is simple : let us complete the negotiations before the congress acts on legislation " and added " we will aggressively seek public and congressional support for a deal -- if we reach one -- because we believe a good deal is far better than the alternatives available to the united states
" mcdonough also mentioned a separate letter sent to iran 's leadership and signed by 47 republican senators
on sunday , iran 's speaker of parliament and former nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said the letter signed by the senators tarnished washington 's reputation internationally , according to state - run tasnim news agency
