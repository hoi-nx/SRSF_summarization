an egyptian widow lived her life as a man for 43 years so she could earn enough money to support her children and grandchildren , it has been revealed
sisa abu daooh , 65 , was six months pregnant with her first child and living in a highly conservative community in the city of luxor when her husband died
unable to support her family as a 21 - year - old single mother and unwilling to marry a man she did n't love , abu daooh decided to shave her head , dress herself as a man and seek employment - first as a brick - maker and then as a shoe - shiner once she got older
however abu daooh decided she could not marry somebody she did n't love and set about shaving her head and purchasing loose - fitting male clothing in order to become the breadwinner herself
the decision shocked and angered her family , but abu daooh ignored their pleas to remarry and instead set herself up as a brick - maker
by her own account she was as ' strong as 10 men ' in her 20s and 30s , but as she got older her strength began to fade and she started a new business , this time as a shoe - shiner
