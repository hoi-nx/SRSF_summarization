life on earth may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago
chemists claim they may have finally solved the riddle of how life first got going on earth
they have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - dna , proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide , hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light
meteorite impacts , like the one in the illustration above , may have triggered the creation of hydrogen cyanide that scientists have found can create the three basic building blocks of light in reactions powered by sunlight their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams , coming together to form the first cells
this suggests that life may well have first emerged here on earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space
genetic information in a cell flows from dna through rna to proteins
they claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the late heavy bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide
this poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions , along with hydrogen sulphide , driven by ultraviolet light
professor sutherland , a chemist at the medical research council 's laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge who led the study said : ' although it necessarily has to be painted with broad brushstrokes , the picture that emerges is of an overall reaction network developing over time in separate streams and pools , according to a dynamic flow chemistry scheme
meteorite fragments and bedrock in craters like this one could have reacted with hydrogen cyanide dissolved in pools of water to create salts that react with heat and ultraviolet light to create rna , lipids and amino acids the researchers behind the new paper propose a number of geochemical steps shown above that could have seen hydrogen cyanide start a series of reactions that led to the creation of amino acids , nucleic acids and lipids necessary for life
first the hydrogen cyanide is dissoved in water ( a ) and then reacts with metals to create salts ( b )
the researchers behind the latest study , which is published in the journal nature chemistry , found they could make nucleic acids - a precursor for rna and dna - from hydrogen cyanide , hydrogen sulphide and uvlight
they also found the same basic ingredients could also lead to the creation of amino acids , the building blocks of proteins , and lipids which form the protective membranes around biological cells
the conditions necessary to create all of these were found to be the same , meaning a single set of chemical reactions could have given rise to life 's basic building blocks simultaneously
professor sutherland and his colleagues argue that the early earth would have been a favourable setting for these reactions
hydrogen sulphide is thrown out in volcanic eruptions like the one above and may have been a vital ingredient in the formation of the first biological building blocks needed to create living cells , according to new research one of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on earth is how complex organisms began to take shape
creating longer strands of rna to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply would n't have been possible in most conditions on earth
hydrogen cyanide would have formed in large amounts due to the bombardment of comets raining down on the earth a few hundred million years after it formed
hydrogen sulphide was also thought to be common on the early earth - thrown out by volcanic eruptions - while the sun would have provided more than enough ultraviolet light
