the morning after she so memorably sashayed through westminster abbey clad in a cream silk dress that showcased her famous derriÃ¨re , the world seemed to be pippa 's oyster
but almost four years on from the royal wedding of april 2011 , things are looking very different for 31 - year - old miss pippa
' from the moment she appeared in butter satin at her sister âs wedding , pippa has struck absolutely no one as the kind of girl you would always find in the kitchen at parties , ' continued moir
next came news of a column for waitrose kitchen , which launched in april 2013 although not before a storm of criticism had broken over both magazine and writer 's heads
established chefs were appalled that a woman with no obvious cooking experience had been hired and accused waitrose kitchen of publicity seeking , while pippa was once again charged with capitalising on her royal connections
at the time , editor william sitwell hit back , arguing that pippa ' will be an excellent contributor to the magazine , bringing with her a wealth of experience of entertaining , gained in part from working at her family 's party business
nevertheless , the pippa bandwagon rolled on , with the duchess of cambridge 's sister adding a telegraph column and the role of contributing editor at vanity fair to her cv
first , in march 2013 , she was dropped by her literary agent david godwin who had helped her launch celebrate ! royal relations : pippa , left , at the royal wedding and right , at the 2013 christening of prince george speaking after the news broke , he said : ' i am very sorry it has happened , but yes , it is true : i no longer represent pippa and i wish her every good luck
in january 2014 , her us publisher viking dropped her altogether having sold just 18,000 copies of the book , with a source telling the sunday times that ' pippa 's celebrate sales are nothing to celebrate
passion : pippa 's most recent column for vanity fair focused on the best places to ski problems : brother james , seen at the invictus games , has also been accused of trading on his royal relations one particularly memorable line in a piece on royal ascot written in june 2014 read : ' car park 7 ( which is reserved for royal enclosure members ) is also a lovely spot to soak up the atmosphere and watch people , their hats , and general activity pass by
but while pippa 's foray into travel writing went relatively smoothly , her attempt to move into tv is apparently over before it even began
wooed by us broadcaster nbc after an interview conducted by host matt lauer proved a ratings winner , attempts to turn her brand of pippa magic into something more substantial hit the buffers when she apparently ' failed to convince ' in pilot scenes
' not convincing ' : pippa was a ratings hit when she appeared on nbc but contract talks have stalled ' wyoming is real cowboy country , ' she continued
and yet , sources say that the breakdown of talks is n't only because of pippa 's ' two left feet '
taking priority : pippa has taken on an increasingly busy role at the british heart foundation love : boyfriend nico lives in geneva and friends say pippa was reluctant to put more distance between them then there 's boyfriend nico jackson , 36 , who has been part of her life since 2012 , but lives in geneva - friends say she was reluctant to make the distance between them even larger
more reasons to stay include her job editing the party times , the online magazine belonging to her parents ' company party pieces , and her continuing work for the spectator and waitrose kitchen
she might have lost a column and a Â£ 400,000 deal with nbc but while she is no longer the fresh - faced ingenue who burst onto the scene so memorably in 2011 , the younger pippa sister clearly is n't beaten yet .
