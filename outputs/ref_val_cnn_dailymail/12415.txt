beijing if you live in china and have n't watched -- or at least heard about -- " under the dome , " you must have been living under a rock
the almost two - hour documentary on air pollution in china produced by a famous tv journalist has quickly gone viral since its online release saturday , clocking millions of views on various video sites and stirring ferocious debates across china cyberspace
the air pollution that 's choking asia here are five things to know to put the phenomenon in context : the slickly produced video shows journalist chai presenting a comprehensive slide show , intercutting with fast - paced footage of her travels across china and the rest of world , to find answers to three questions : what is smog , where does it come from and what can be done to tackle it ? as shocking levels of air pollution continue to choke much of china regularly , the video has struck such a chord with the audience that , in two short days , it 's easily attracted over 100 million views -- a hugely impressive number even in the world 's most populous nation
many internet users have compared it to " an inconvenient truth , " the oscar - winning documentary on former u.s. vice president al gore 's effort to raise awareness on the dangers of global warming
as a long - time cctv anchor and investigative reporter , chai stood out from her peers by covering sensitive topics -- ranging from the environment to homosexuality -- in a country where many journalists at state media stay away from such potential landmines
declaring a personal war against smog as a worried mother , chai tries to dig deep in her self - funded documentary
a former chief engineer of the state - owned oil conglomerate sinopec brushes off chai 's suggestion that his powerful industry -- which oversees pollution standards for itself and has rendered environmental authorities toothless -- should become more socially responsible
also , the timing : the video was released just days ahead of china 's annual parliament session , during which legislators are expected to rubber - stamp the communist leadership 's policy agenda
and the cacophony surrounding it seems to have caught even china 's seasoned censors off guard
heated arguments have raged online , including blaming pollution on china 's political system due to its lack of accountability
with discussions on the video shifting to social media , a common consensus seems to have emerged : love it or hate it , chai 's documentary has stirred an important debate in a country where authorities censored air pollution data from the u.s. embassy as recently as november
