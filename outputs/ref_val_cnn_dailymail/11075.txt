when the ireland team sheet for oâneill âs first competitive game against georgia was released an hour or so before kick - off , one name stood out : stephen quinn
midfielder stephen quinn is in the reckoning to line up against poland on sunday this was oâneill making his point and giving a player previously overlooked a chance to make his own point , too
stephen quinn provided energy and forward thinking alongside glenn whelan and james mccarthy in a three - man midfield
he was given the ultimate compliment by the manager when he was rested for the 7 - 0 stroll at home to gibraltar in october so he would be ready to help stifle germany a few days later
when he failed to start any of the four hull games between the 1 - 1 draw in gelsenkirchen and the november date with scotland , it was no surprise stephen quinn was left on the bench at celtic park before being introduced in the second half
and while his last start in the premier league came on january 18 , circumstances may dictate that he is in the reckoning to line out against poland on sunday
jeff hendrick has been unable to join up with the squad at all through injury while darron gibson returned to everton on wednesday because of his groin complaint
stephen quinn , though , is nât feeling as if he âs a shoo - in to step back into the starting xi. â i do nât think you can ever [ think like that ] , there are lads who have been here a long time and you can never rest on your laurels
â poland may be the group leaders having set the cat amongst the pigeons by beating germany , but the dubliner maintains ireland must be the ones to set the tempo and impose themselves on the visitors
â scotland and germany are both highly likely to win this weekend against gibraltar and georgia respectively , so there is little room for error with ireland level on seven points with them both
