dortmund 's mini renaissance which had seen them win four bundesliga games in succession came to a halt , as they were held to a frustrating goalless draw at hamburg
the tight contest saw the visitors dominate possession , with aubameyang and reus typically at the heart of dortmund 's attacks , but try as they might , they could not circumvent a well - drilled hamburg defence

for dortmund , it is a blow to their aspirations of qualifying for continental football next season , while relegation - threatened hamburg remain without a win in their last four league outings
