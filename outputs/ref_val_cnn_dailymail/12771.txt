rome as the dust settles after italy 's high court ruled on friday to overturn the latest guilty verdicts for amanda knox , 27 , and her former italy boyfriend sollecito , 31 , in the 2007 murder of meredith kercher , many questions still linger in the case
knox and sollecito were tried together and convicted of murder by two separate courts
there wo n't be any civil trials like in the o.j. simpson case because , according to italy penal code , italy 's high court decision is final across all courts in the country
according to italy lawyer canestrini , who works on extradition and criminal cases between italy and other countries , " the high court decision is seen as the truth for the whole system
" we expected more from the italy judicial system , " he said
" if they think italy has n't fulfilled the duty , they could sue italy , " canestrini told cnn
such a claim could be made based on the final conviction handed down to meredith kercher , a man from the ivory coast who was convicted for his role in kercher 's murder in 2008 in a fast - track trial that is still under seal
knox and sollecito both spent four years in prison during their initial trial and first appeal
they applied to italy 's high court to be put under house arrest but because knox was a foreigner and deemed a flight risk , they were both denied
sollecito may now have cause to sue italy for false imprisonment
italy pays around â¬ 12 million every year for locking up people who are later cleared of charges , according to italy prime minister matteo renzi who is introduced measures to reform the judicial system
sollecito changed his story more than once before finally settling on an alibi with knox , so a legal battle could focus on whether anything he told investigators led directly to his arrest
canestrini also says that knox could potentially sue italy for one year of false imprisonment , but because she admittedly lied to investigators early on which led to her arrest , she would likely not have much of a case
in one of her initial interrogations in 2007 , she told investigators she was in the house when kercher was killed at which time she accused meredith kercher , her boss at a pub where she worked , of the murder
knox 's lawyer carlo dalla vedova told cnn that knox does n't feel any revenge or resentment towards italy
