the image that caused a public outcry of a woman changing in the toilets at a bangkok airport the woman in the picture is said to have been chinese , although this can not be verified , and while the incident raises barely an eyebrow with many - when shared on english speaking sites the woman who took the photo was vilified more than the woman changing - the thailand government felt moved to act
another woman in the toilets took the above image and posted it to the facebook page of csi la with the comment : ' chinese tourists are terrible ! i saw a group of chinese tourists stripping in the ladies ' room
a public beach in thailand , where nudity on beaches is considered offensive to locals ' the chinese government has made a campaign telling its citizens how to behave when travelling abroad
we should not berate them by sharing the photo , ' mr anek said public nudity in thailand is illegal and it 's considered disrespectful to locals - mostly buddhist or islamic - to go topless in public
