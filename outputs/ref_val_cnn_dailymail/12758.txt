are your heroes disappointing you ? you 're not alone
most people yearn for role models , for someone to admire and emulate
but then sometimes : crash ! unless the superheroes perform their awe - inspiring work in the comic books or the movies , they eventually slide off the pedestal ; or perhaps they get smashed down to the ground , breaking into too many pieces to repair
the admirer is left heartbroken or disillusioned
if you want to admire someone fully , you should not look too closely
if you want to admire them smartly , you should brace yourself for at least some measure of disappointment
in the political arena , the season of scrutiny and revelations is just getting started with hillary and her email practices as secretary of state under the microscope
after a press conference at the united nations on tuesday , worries that she is too secretive and calculating are emerging again
for some diehard supporters , this is all about clinton - hating republican politics
is hillary a hero or is she not to be trusted ? or , is there an altogether different answer ? for me , two individuals in particular were once important heroes
a couple of weeks ago , during a trip to the middle east , i had the unexpected good fortune to meet someone i have admired for many years : the liberians president and nobel peace prize winner ellen johnson sirleaf
moments later , i received a reply ( since deleted ) from a twitter connection informing me that ellen johnson sirleaf has a dismal record on gay rights and had very publicly announced she would refuse to sign a bill to end prison sentences for gay liberians
the incident reminded me of what has happened with another woman i have admired greatly over the years , the myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi , also a nobel peace prize winner
aung san suu kyi endured decades of house arrest and great personal hardship to help gain freedom for her people from a harsh military dictatorship that entrenched itself for half a century
like ellen johnson sirleaf on lgbt issues , aung san suu kyi is making cold political calculations on the issue of the rohingya , weighing cost against benefit , and setting aside principles in the process
does that mean we should ignore these women 's incredible track records ? should we ignore the fact that ellen johnson sirleaf became the first woman to be democratically elected president in all of africans , taking over a country racked by a brutal civil war and guiding it toward a better future ; inspiring africans to fight against corruption , showing women everywhere that they can make a difference ? should we ignore aung san suu kyi 's astonishing ability to draw international attention to a repressive regime , paying an enormous personal price and ultimately succeeding ? or should we ignore their deliberate blind spots on politically inconvenient issues , even if they concern human rights , which were supposed to stand at the core of what drove these leaders ? the challenge is for each of us to make judgments based on our own values
from lance armstrong and all those who took performance - enhancing drugs to the athletes who abuse their spouses , the sound of heroes crashing off the pedestals has been deafening
the fact is , there are no perfect human beings
