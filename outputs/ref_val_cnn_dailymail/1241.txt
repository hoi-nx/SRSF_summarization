an aspiring singer who made it to boot camp on x factor has become the first short - haired finalist in the england pageant
jade bagged first place in her regional competition when she beat off long - locked competitors to take home the title of miss surrey
jade is the first dark - short - haired contestant to earn a place in the england finals jade wowed the judges at the regional contest , her first ever pageant , in a dark blue satin dress as a she shared the tale of how she delivered her sister younger sister in her family 's front room
before jade earned her place in the england final there had only ever been one other shorter - haired competitor , but even she had a traditional look
jade says : ' there was a short - haired contestant in 2009 with blonde hair but hers was shoulder length and that was considered short
' jade says that for her winning was especially important after the short - haired miss jamaica lost out to the long haired miss columbia at last year 's miss universe final
jade took home the crown at the miss surrey finals which was her first ever beauty pageant jade wants to demonstrate to other potential contestants that you do n't have to conform to win ' everyone was so shocked that short hair would get in the way of winning
so i am pleased that more short - haired women are being recognised in beauty pageants now
' with her cropped hair and undercut jade does n't exactly fit the pageanting stereotype , however jade says that her alternative looks have helped her secure modelling jobs in the past that led to her success at the miss surrey contest
' jade says that by winning a beauty pageant she hopes to show other women that you do n't have to conform to a stereotype to win or even enter a contest
jade also hopes to further her singing career having appeared on last year 's x factor ' i want to use the way i look to promote diversity and i want to inspire other girls and show them that you do n't have to be stick thin to enter
' when it comes to beauty inspiration jade looks to fellow short - haired celebrities
' jade is certainly ambitious and as well as aiming for gold at the england finals in september the 24 - year - old hopes to progress in her singing career having reached the boot camp stages of x factor last year
