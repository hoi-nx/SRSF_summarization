a jury awarded marvin gaye 's children $ 7.4million on tuesday after determining singers thicke and pharrell copied their father 's music to create blurred lines , the biggest hit song of 2013
marvin gaye 's daughter nona wept as the verdict was being read and was hugged by her attorney , busch
it was previously revealed that the song had made a staggering $ 16million for pharrell , thicke , rapper t.i. and the record company , though t.i. and various record and music companies had previously been cleared of copyright infringement charges
the jury decided that the family should receive $ 4million in damages and $ 3.4 million in profits from the song , with thicke forced to pay $ 1.7million from his own pocket and pharrell $ 1.6million
' blurred lines â was created from the heart and minds of pharrell , thicke and t.i. and not taken from anyone or anywhere else
' ' right now , i feel free , ' an emotional nona said after the verdict
' free from ... pharrell and thicke 's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told
' this was no doubt in response to the fact that pharrell and thicke had filed a lawsuit against nona 's estate back in august 2013 in an attempt to stop his family from suing them for copyright infringement
' nona , best known for such classics as sexual healing , i heard it through the grapevine and how sweet it is ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father when he was just 44 - years - old nona ( second from left ) , daughter of late singer marvin gaye , and her lawyer busch ( front right ) speak to the media following the verdict the gayes ' lawyer branded pharrell and thicke liars who went beyond trying to emulate the sound of nona 's late - 1970s music and copied the r&b legend 's hit got to give it up outright
he also brought up the fact after the verdict that the defense 's legal team did everything they could to stop the jury from hearing nona 's song during the proceedings , allowing them to just listen to certain snippets of the music
for this reason the infringement charge only applied to the sheet music for the two songs , making the case against thicke and pharrell that much more difficult for the nona family
busch however pointed out during his argument that thicke said in interviews while promoting the single that he and pharrell were trying to write something like nona 's got to give it up
thicke told jurors he did n't write blurred lines , which pharrell testified he crafted in about an hour in mid- 2012 , as he was too high on painkillers and alcohol
he also took time on the stand to play a variety of songs that sound similar in music and tone in an attempt to strengthen his case pharrell told jurors that nona 's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth , but the seven - time grammys winner said he did n't use any of it to create blurred lines and that the songs were alike in genre only
' busch , far left , walks with the late singer , marvin gaye 's family members , from left , daughter , nona , ex-wife , jan , and son , frankie according to the los angeles times , he song brought in $ 5.6 million for thicke , $ 5.2 million for pharrell and another $ 5 million to $ 6 million for the record company , as well as an additional $ 8 million in publishing revenue nona 's children - nona , frankie and marvin gaye iii - sued the singers in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read
nona 's ex-wife janis testified that as soon as she heard the song she recognized the similarities and was thrilled thinking that this would introduce the music of her late husband to a new generation of music lovers
that quickly turned to anger however when she learned the rights to nona 's song had not been licensed
