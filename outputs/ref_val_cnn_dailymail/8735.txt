artist tracey emin has insisted she is actually ' very neat ' as she unveiled her Â£ 2.54million unmade bed - complete with discarded condoms - on its return to its ' home ' at the tate
my bed became notorious when it was shortlisted for the turner prize and displayed at tate britain in 1999
now , 15 years later , it is back at the gallery on a long - term loan for at least 10 years
wiping away tears , the artist said that seeing the work - which is now subject to rigorous security in the form of a sensor and a guard to prevent visitors from getting too close - left her emotional
' that bed belonged to a young woman and hopefully in 20 or 30 years ' time the bed will be here but i wo n't probably
' the work , which expressed the artist 's suicidal depression following a relationship breakdown , is displayed in its own room alongside two paintings by francis bacon and six nude drawings by emin which she has given to the tate
emin said she felt validated seeing the installation on display alongside works by some of tate britain 's ' greats ' after all the criticism about the bed at the time
the controversial artwork was created by emin in her waterloo council flat in 1998 and features empty vodka bottles , cigarette butts , stained sheets , discarded underwear , old slippers , a waist belt and even condoms my bed was one of the key works of the 1990s yba ( yba ) movement and was bought by millionaire collector charles saatchi for Â£ 150,000 in 2000 before later being sold to christie 's 's and auctioned my bed , which fetched Â£ 2.54million at auction last year , is now on a long - term loan to the tate britain and will be shown at both turner contemporary in emin 's home town - and tate liverpool later this year ' i love it , why would n't i ? i was right ... it 's a good feeling ... it feels like home , ' she said , later adding that her fellow students at art school had ' thought i was a bit thick '
' it was quite clear from 1999 when it was first seen in the turner prize prize that it was going to be regarded as one of those iconic works from the late 90s
' emin insisted she was actually ' very neat ' as she unveiled the return of my bed at the tate today
the 51 - year - old said the artwork ( part of which is pictured right ) was ' a time capsule of a woman living in the 1990s ' my bed fetched Â£ 2.54m at auction , a record for the artist , when it was purchased by dealer and white cube gallery owner jay jopling last year
my bed is on long - term loan to the tate and will be shown at turner contemporary in emin 's home town - and tate liverpool
the work fetched Â£ 2.54million at auction , a record for the artist , when it was purchased by dealer and white cube gallery owner jay jopling last year
it later emerged that jopling acquired the work on behalf of german industrialist and collector count christian duerckheim , who announced the long - term loan to the tate for at least 10 years
sir nicholas said that he hoped that the tate would be able to hold on to my bed for longer than 10 years
emin , who is now 51 - years - old and a cbe , made the piece in her waterloo council flat in 1998
emin 's my bed 1998 exhibition opens to the public at tate britain tomorrow .
