she shot to fame as the relentlessly cheery but dim - witted nursie , mocked by lord blackadder for her dotty , unworldly utterances
and it seems that in real life , actress patsy byrne was equally naive when it came to her own financial affairs â her newly released will reveals that she grossly underestimated the fortune she had amassed
her instructions were that five of her six stepchildren should inherit Â£ 20,000 each , with the remainder of her estate going to the sixth
happily , ms monica seccombe has shared out the money equally with her four sisters ; their brother christopher having died last year at the age of 58 , leaving no children
â and explaining why she had been in line for a bigger share of the legacy , ms monica seccombe added : â there was no family bust - up ; she just wanted me to sort things out after her death as i am a solicitor
â probate records released last week reveal that byrne left Â£ 50,000 to both the theatrical guild , which supports backstage staff , and the denville hall care home for actors in northwood , middlesex , where she died last june
the family also agreed to make a further Â£ 50,000 donation to st joseph âs hospice in hackney , london , and Â£ 20,000 to the little sisters of the poor care home in kennington
â a classically trained actress who toured with the rsc , byrne became a household name in 1986 when she took the role of nursie to miranda richardson âs petulant elizabeth i in blackadder ii. the rowan atkinson sitcom was the highlight of a long career in theatre , which started when she attended drama school in london
