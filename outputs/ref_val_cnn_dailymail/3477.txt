allardyce admits he was wrong to claim reid had been tapped up after the west ham defender finally penned a fresh contract with the club
talks between the west ham and reid had been ongoing for several months , with reported interest from the likes of liverpool , tottenham and arsenal leaving many west ham supporters on tenterhooks over the future of their new zealand international
allardyce said in january that it was ' highly unlikely ' reid had not already verbally agreed to leave upton park given that he was yet to sign a new contract and went on to suggest earlier this month that he needed to rope in the questioning techniques of jack bauer from television 's ' 24 ' to get an answer out of the player
reid signed a new six - and - a - half year deal west ham last week after it appeared he would leave allardyce had said it was unlikely that reid had not verbally agreed to join another club but the 26 - year - old , who will miss saturday 's trip to arsenal through injury , has now signed a six - and - a - half - year contract to keep him tied down to the east london outfit - with allardyce quick to admit he had misread the situation
' i was wrong , so i admit that , ' he said when asked if he was surprised to see reid sign a new deal having questioned whether he had been tapped up
' allardyce believes a strong showing for west ham this season would have helped convince reid to stay put - insisting no club bigger than the west ham had looked like making a move for his signature
