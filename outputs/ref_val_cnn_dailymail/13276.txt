i 'm candida moss , and i am professor of new testament and early christian at the university of notre dame
i was an adviser on the " true cross " episode and served as one of the many on - camera experts in cnn 's " jesus " series , which airs on sundays
viewers were invited during the show to tweet and post their questions on the " finding jesus " facebook page
below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them
they have been edited for style and clarity for this article
what 's " true " about the cross that killed jesus ? lynn santos : where might there be other pieces of the " true cross " ? is anyone attempting to carbon date these relics ? candida moss : there are churches all over the world that claim to have fragments or splinters of the true cross
these are n't being carbon dated and there are a few reasons why
first , carbon dating is expensive , and your average church does n't have the funds for this kind of endeavor
second , carbon dating is seen as intrusive and a little destructive
even if only about 10 milligrams of wood are needed , you 're still chipping away at a holy object
this is n't something that churches like to do , especially as -- and this leads me to my third point -- almost all carbon dating tests end up discrediting the relics that are being tested
matt marino : are you able to tell what type of wood the cross was built from ? candida moss : unless we know with complete certainty that we have a fragment of the true cross , then we wo n't be able to assert what kind of wood was used
daniel : how can we be certain the romans did n't reuse jesus ' cross ? candida moss : this is a great question
candida moss : it is certainly true that early on ( first - third century ) christians did not use the image of the cross in their art. this in part seems to have been because crucifixion was so shameful and humiliating
