it 's called the grand renaissance dam -- and the clue is in the name
with some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction , the imposingly - named dam is surely one of africa 's most ambitious infrastructure projects , reaffirming ethiopia 's ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power
the most striking aspect of the nearly $ 5 billion enterprise is , however , that it is entirely funded by ethiopia , without any foreign investment
" it was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the ethiopia people are financing it 100 % , " says negatu , managing partner at ernst & young ethiopia
hydroelectric powerhouse so far , ethiopia at home and abroad have contributed about $ 350 million , and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening , with 40 % of the work already complete
ethiopia 's per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world , but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000 , averaging 10.9 % annually , which has resulted in a 33 % reduction of people living in poverty
if the grand renaissance dam and other hydroelectric projects , such as the gibe iii dam on the omo river , are completed on time , the world bank estimates ethiopia could earn $ 1 billion a year from electricity exports
negatu says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in africa , and second only to africa when it comes to installed capacity
unhappy neighbors yet , not everyone is happy about ethiopia 's energetic drive to harness its water resources
the grand renaissance dam is being built on blue nile , a tributary of the nile which has been powering the agriculture of sudan and egypt -- through which it flows -- for millennia
passions have been calmer more recently , and today the reuters news agency reported that representatives of egypt , sudan and ethiopia reached a preliminary agreement in khartoum on how to operate the dam
