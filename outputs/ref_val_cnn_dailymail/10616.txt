years ago , when our house was always full of small children , i staggered downstairs with a couple of fellow mothers after a chaotic communal bath - time and found the visiting dads pouring well - earned drinks
we reported that , just before we battened down the hatches , all the three and four - year - old boys had been snapping at their pyjama elastic and comparing the size of their willies
so did the fathers , for a brief moment , but then , in chorus , they ask â¢ ed : â um
? â civilized , cultured , happily married men , not a porn - hound or a libertine among them , but they could nât help it
willy - worship , willy - pride , is hard - wired deep in the male brain
however much they deny it , men do seem to care
actors jonny lee miller ( left ) and benedict cumberbatch ( right ) were subject to much speculation and discussion after their stark - naked performances as frankenstein a few years ago why else would king 's college london have bothered to trot around 15,000 men with a tape measure ( one hopes not the hard , cold , sharp steel sort ) and proudly report that the average length , unstimulated , is 3.6 in and 5.16 in erect
i do admire the chaps â willingness to collaborate in that measurement in the presence of a researcher with a white coat and a ruler
but the very fact that 15,000 men were happy to go through this bizarre academic exercise shows that they mind about their little friends
and that they all secretly , privately hoped that their willy would be bigger than average
the academics explain that it âs all about â using the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position â , and that it will be very helpful to worried guys with body dysmorphic disorder , and to those prone to ordering the wrong size of prophylactic online
so , do nât tell me men do nât care
further evidence was provided when some of us managed to see both versions of the astonishing frankenstein play at the national theatre a few years ago , in which on alternate nights the role of the creature , stark - naked during a long opening scene , was taken by benedict cumberbatch and jonny lee miller
conversations between the male viewers who saw both were predictable , centring on who won that particular contest , and including the immortal line in a theatre - bar argument
â ah yes , i see what you mean , but is it a show - er or a grower ? â we women edged away , to continue our serious analysis of which of the buff actors made the most alluring and convincing monster and which was best at being dr frankenstein
but honestly , hand on heart , i suspect that very few of us during early courtship â or afterwards , or even after the golden wedding â are particularly worried about whether we are getting the full 3.6in average
