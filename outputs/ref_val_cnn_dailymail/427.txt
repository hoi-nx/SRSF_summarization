researchers analysing elephant remains in israel have discovered signs of animal residue on primitive tools called ' handaxes and scrapers ' alongside cut marks in the remains themselves
and by replicating the flint tools for a modern butchering experiment they said the ' handaxe was prehistoric man 's ' swiss army knife ' - capable of breaking down bone , sinew and hide
researchers analysing elephant remains ( rib pictured ) in israel have discovered signs of animal residue on primitive tools called ' handaxes and scrapers ' alongside cut marks in the remains themselves
this analysis is said to be the first time proof of prehistoric butchery has been scientifically verified the slimmer , more delicate scraper was then used to separate fur and animal fat from muscle tissue
the tools and remains were discovered at a lower paleolithic site in revadim , israel , by professor ran barkai , natasha solodenko and andrea zupanchich from tel aviv university 's department of archaeology and ancient near eastern cultures
the team used a process called ' use - wear analysis ' which involves examining the surfaces and edges of the tools to determine their function
the researchers studied three tools found in the revadim quarry in israel - a flake , biface or ' handaxe ' and scraper
both tools showed residue of adipocere , or animal fat and on the scraper , both tissues and vegetable residues were found
it also used so - called fourier transform infrared ( ftir ) residue analysis to identify organic residue
from this , the researchers were able to demonstrate for the first time direct proof of animal exploitation by flint tools
' at the revadim quarry we found butchered animal remains , including an elephant rib bone which had been neatly cut by a stone tool , alongside flint handaxes and scrapers still retaining animal fat , ' continued professor ran barkai
' the tools and remains were discovered at a lower paleolithic site in revadim , israel ( marked )
it also used so - called fourier transform frared ( ftir ) residue analysis to identify organic residue the researchers studied three tools : a flake , biface ( pictured ) and scraper
no use - traces or identifiable residue were found on the flake but the biface and scraper both revealed ' clear use - wear traces '
both tools additionally showed residue of adipocere , or animal fat , and on the scraper , both tissues and vegetable residues were found the experts said the ' handaxe ' was the equivalent to a prehistoric ' swiss army knife ' ( stock image ) - capable of breaking down bone , sinew and hide the paper said the tools would have also been used to process hides
