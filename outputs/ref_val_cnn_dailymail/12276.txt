but who is debrah , the wife of millionaire heir durst ? and what role has she played in his life ? debrah has n't spoken publicly since her husband 's arrest in new orleans over the weekend , and cnn was unable to reach her for comment
in " the jinx , " the hbo documentary about durst 's life , she appears in a police interview from more than a decade ago
debrah says she met durst in 1988 , six years after his first wife went missing
the two were married in a rushed ceremony just weeks before durst 's longtime friend susan berman turned up dead in beverly hills , california
this week , the los angeles county district attorney 's office charged durst with first - degree murder in that case
recorded jailhouse calls from durst 's imprisonment during that case suggest that debrah was his rock
" she was also a driving force behind the decision to fire attorney kennedy , a lawyer durst 's wealthy real estate developer family had tapped to handle the case
the insanity defense kennedy was planning to use , she said at the time , could have meant both durst and debrah were cut out of the family fortune
like durst himself , debrah is a powerful player on the new york real estate scene
why does n't the hbo documentary feature any more recent interviews with her ? debrah did n't want durst to participate in " the jinx , " korangy said , and she has n't spoken with him since it started airing
