putin today demanded an end to ' shameful ' political assassinations in the wake of the shooting of a kremlin critic last week
he was the most prominent opposition figure to be killed in russia during putin 's 15 - year rule
in a speech during a meeting with officials from the interior ministry , putin said : ' the most serious attention should be paid to high - profile crimes , including the ones with a political subtext
' law enforcement officials have said one lead they were exploring was that the killing was linked to nemtsov 's personal life or business dealings
putin 's comments indicated that version is now being discarded
