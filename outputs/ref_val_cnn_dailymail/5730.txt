earlier this week , supermodel - turned - actress suki revealed the secret to achieving her perfectly - tousled red carpet - ready hair : washing her tresses with coke
during an interview with us weekly , the british - born 23 - year - old , who is currently busy promoting her new sci - fi thriller insurgent , admitted that she rinses her hair with the popular soda because it gives her hair the perfect amount of volume and texture , saying : ' i do n't like my hair when it 's washed - it 's fine and limp - but coke makes it tousled , like i 've gone through the amazon or something
as suki was n't particularly clear about what method she prefers when it comes to rinsing her hair with fizzy soda , i did some research online to see whether there was a general consensus about the easiest and most effective way to use coke as an alternative to shampoo
i admit i was quite surprised to see that suki 's cola theory seems to have a lot of support from various outlets online ; along with advice on how to use the beverage in order to clean your windows and remove rust from metal , there were several coke - based haircare tips
and while some articles suggested using the soda as a pre-shampoo rinse , the majority claimed that using coke as your only ' haircare ' product would produce the best results , prompting me to abandon my beloved serge normant shampoo in favor of my cans of cola
it is highly likely that i 'm also far less coordinated and graceful than suki , who boasts years of red carpet and catwalk experience , but i found the logistics of the whole coke rinse to be really quite tricky
pre-cola and post-cola : having suffered from limp , lifeless hair in the past ( l ) , charlie decided to give suki 's coke rinse a go but found it left her with very greasy roots ( r ) first of all , the soda - predictably - fizzes everywhere and i was left with several sticky brown splashes of cola in my bath which , although not a complete disaster , was just a bit of a pain
after the cola rinse , and the subsequent water rinse , i left my hair alone , wanting to see exactly what the soda would do to it , without any additional styling products
however , after brushing it through properly , my hair looked really rather greasy - yes there was some texture in the roots , and some added volume through the lengths , but my slick - looking style just made it look as though i had failed to wash my hair in days
