scientists have assembled the largest and most accurate timeline of life on earth containing more than 50,000 different species
the new timetree , as it is known , has revealed that rather than expanding in bursts , the diversity of life on our planet has actually been growing at a constant rate
the different colours correspond to the main taxonomic divisions that appeared on earth to create this lollipop , or spiral galaxy , shaped evolutionary tree the finding contradicts the prevailing view of diversification slowing down as ecological niches fill up with species , only to surge forward again in the wake of a major extinction
the remarkable discovery was made by finding birds had regrown a bone previously discarded by dinosaurs millions of years ago
the study was carried out by a team of scientists from the university of chile they found that 230 million years ago , two - legged dinosaurs no longer required the strong wrists of their four - legged brethren , and thus they became weak
the scientists used data from nearly 2,300 studies examining the molecular biology and genetic diversity of different species
they have now produced a database that can be searched to find out when species separated in evolutionary history and when they last shared a common ancestor
' the constant rate of diversification that we have found indicates that the ecological niches of life are not being filled up and saturated
combined with the fossil record , the technology is helping to provide a far more detailed view of how life on the earth is related and how it evolved
the timeline above shows from the perspective of humans how we diverged from other groups of organisms the timeline on the left shows when man first diverged from their best friend , dogs , as pictured on the right the traditional view of evolution has been as a tree that grows ever more complex branches over time by searching in the database compiled by the researchers , which is available as a free iphone app and online , it is possible to see when two species separated in evolutionary history
for example , homo sapiens and dogs split from a common ancestor 94.2 million years ago while cats and dogs separated sometime later at around 55.1 million years ago
crows - a bird that has been shown to have intelligence equivalent to chimpanzees and even young children - separated from chimps and the rest of the primate family 296 million years ago
however , the new research by professor hedges and geneticist professor sadhir kumar at temple university , showed that evolution has actually occurred at a relatively constant rate
