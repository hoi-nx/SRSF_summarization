doctors say a 45 - minute epileptic seizure may have caused a transgender woman to revert back to being a man
a new psychiatric study has described how an unnamed australian man , aged in his mid 30s , had believed he was really a woman since he was four - years - old
the patient received breast augmentations , hormonal treatment and facial surgery to appear more feminine in her mid- 30s
but after suffering the seizure , the transgender woman radically changed her mind about her gender - and her psychiatrist said it may be because the fit triggered biological changes
