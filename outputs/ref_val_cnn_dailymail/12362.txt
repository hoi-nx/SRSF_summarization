havana , cuban photos published in cuban 's state - run press on monday show fidel castro meeting with five cuban intelligence agents who served lengthy prison sentences in the united states
fidel castro reportedly met the agents saturday at his home in havana , ending speculation over why the former cuban president had not yet seen the men , who are referred to as " the five heroes " by cuban 's government
the last of the agents returned to cuban in december following a prisoner swap that also freed u.s. state department contractor alan gross , who was jailed in cuban
these " anti-terrorist heroes never did any harm to the united states , " fidel castro wrote in an article published in the daily communist party newspaper granma on monday , which said he met with them for five hours
fidel castro on monday though said the men were not spying on united states military capabilities , stating that a now - shuttered russia spy station allowed the cuban to be aware of any impending united states attack on the island
the remaining three agents -- ramon labaã±ino , 49 ; ramon labaã±ino , 56 ; and ramon labaã±ino , 51 -- were transferred to cuban a part of a prisoner swap after serving 16 years in united states prisons
many cuban though wondered why the men had not yet met with fidel castro , who had championed their cause during his final years as president
