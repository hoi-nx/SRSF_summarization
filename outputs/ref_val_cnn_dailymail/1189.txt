polar bears are suffering potentially harmful changes to their brains due to the accumulation of pollution in the arctic , according to a new study
scientists have found that key processes in the brains of polar bears are being disrupted by man - made chemicals such as stain repellents and water - proofing treatments
they claim this could result in changes to polar bear behaviour and hormone balance that may ultimately affect their ability to survive
as an apex predator , pollutants in the food of polar bears , like the one above , can accumulate in their tissues the pollutants , known as perfluoroalkly compounds , accumulate in specific areas of polar bears ' brains over years of eating contaminated food
a team of scientists have recently reported that chemical pollutants accumulating in the arctic may be reducing the density of the bones in the penises of male polar bears
the researchers warn that the presence of such chemicals , which tend to accumulate over time in the bodies of top predators from the prey they eat , may have disastrous consequences for polar bear mating
the researchers found that areas of polar bears ' brains where levels of perfluoroalkyl substances ( pfas ) were highest also had disrupted levels of enzyme activity
katherine eggers pedersen , a toxicologist at the university of copenhagen who led the research , said : although pfass have been increasing in the arctic , and in particular in greenland polar bears , over the past three decades , several of the most dominant pfass have started to decline around 2007
' however relatively high levels have recently been found in polar bear brains ' results from our study support the hypothesis that pfas concentrations in polar bears from greenland have exceeded the threshold limits for neurochemical alterations
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal environmental research , examined the brains of nine polar bears that had been killed by hunters in greenland
researchers found pollutants were associated with lower levels of neurotransmitters in polar bear brain tissue the highest levels of pfas were highest in the brain stem , which controls vital life functions , and the cerebellum , which is responsble for coordinating movement and balance
they found that in particular perfluorooctane sulfonate ( pfos ) , which is as a strain repellent treatment for fabrics , and perfluorinated carboxylic acid , which are used to make non-stick coatings , were associated with changes to key neurotransmitters in the bear 's brains
professor bjarne styrishave , another scienitist at the university of copenhagen who was also involved in the study , told science nordic : ' we do n't know whether the disruption of enzymes and signal substances is enough to have an effect on the polar bears ' senses and behaviour
' it is not the first time pollution has been found to be taking a toll on polar bears
