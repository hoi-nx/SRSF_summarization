a small town in upstate new york stands divided after their high school 's decision on wednesday to broadcast the pledge of allegiance in arabic
it was meant as a way to celebrate national foreign languages week -- each day , the announcements and pledge at pine bush high school would be recited in a different tongue
however , the outrage it caused in some students and parents quickly forced administrators to issue an apology and a promise to henceforth only recite the pledge of allegiance in english
now , lines have been drawn in pine ( pop. 1,600 ) as some students and teachers are outraged that an apology was issued at all while others applaud the decision and say the pledge should never have been recited in a language other than english
' the intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than english still pledge to salute this great country , ' the statement read
' we sincerely apologize to any / students , staff or community members who found this activity offensive
in our school district the pledge of allegiance will only be recited in english as recommended by the commissioner of education
however , administrators were quickly forced to apologize students came out both against the reading and against the backlash as superintendent joan carbone said the controversy had ' divided the school in half ' though he did n't make the decision to make the day 's announcements in arabic himself , according to twc news , zink says he was perfectly okay with reading the arabic script for the day , though he knew it would be controversial
it is foreign language week but we do n't even offer arabic in pine bush high school , ' he said
others supported zink 's decision and were appalled by the backlash , like senior miranda monroe , who tweeted : ' " i go to pine bush but i 'm not racist " * me introducing myself to new people * ' despite all the controversy , zink wo n't apologize for his decision to read the pledge in arabic
