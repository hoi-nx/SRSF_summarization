twelve tries were scored in total - seven against five - but ultimately england finished six points adrift of the total they needed as ireland claimed the title for the second season running
england could barely have done any more but were punished for a second - half lapse of discipline which saw haskell sin binned for tripping and france scored two tries
' ireland 's crushing victory over scotland at murrayfield earlier in the afternoon left england with a huge mountain to climb
suddenly , the perceived advantage of playing the final game of the tournament had become a burden of pressure around england 's throat
and from the very first scrum there were indications they may deliver as england wheeled their opposing eight enough for no8 billy vunipola to put extreme pressure on france scrum half sebastien tillous-borde
the france no9 threw a pass to nowhere with vunipola breathing down his neck and england centre joseph â england 's find of the tournament â gathered and fed the ball down the right to full back brown
george ford added the conversion from the right hand touchline to make it 7 - 0 and england were away
the france scrum half sped in from fully 60 metres to silence the twickenham crowd
plisson missed the conversion but moments later france went even further ahead when winger noa nakaitaci broke away down the left to score his side 's second try inside a couple of minutes
england 's jack nowell goes over for his second try of the match but england could not find enough points to jump above ireland france 's noa nakaitaci scores a controversial try after getting away from youngs during the first half noa nakaitaci was deemed to be in control of the ball as he touched it down before falling over the dead ball line england 's joseph ( centre ) is tackled by france duo maxime mermoz ( left ) and vincent debaty england 's players were left to rue some costly mistakes as they missed out on yet another six nations title under lancaster plisson 's conversion made it 15 - 7 after 17 minutes and suddenly england 's task was even greater than at kick off
now it was england 's turn to get lucky
but this time the tmo ruled in england 's favour and the try was awarded with the ball deemed to have come off haskell 's knee
the centre lost out to bernard le roux but earned a penalty which england took quickly and youngs wriggled over for his side 's third try
george ford converted to make it 24 - 15 and england dared to dream again
seven of those came four minutes later when youngs , enjoying his best game in an england shirt , made a searing break down the right and fed inside for ford to canter over for his side 's fourth try

england struck again when jack nowell crossed after more good work from youngs and ford 's conversion made it 41 - 25 after 53 minutes
but in keeping with this incredible game , jack nowell crossed for his second try after clever work by george ford , who converted , to leave england needing six more points with four minutes left
