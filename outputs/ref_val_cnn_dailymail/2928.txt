a mysterious skeleton found buried inside a lead coffin beside the remains of richard iii could belong to a revered holy woman who was said to reduce time spent in purgatory for those that prayed for her soul
archaeologists believe the elderly woman , whose lead coffin was inlaid with a crucifix , may have been buried nearly 200 years before the last plantagenet king of english
her coffin was discovered within a limestone sarcophagus under a car park in leicester city centre on what was the site of the grey friars church , just feet from richard iii 's grave
genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton , discovered under a council car park in leicester three years ago , has confirmed that it did belong to richard iii scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet
analysis of isotopes preserved in her remains by researchers at the leicester university has shown that the woman was show that she had lived a privileged life , eating plenty of protein and large amounts of sea fish
this suggests she had been wealthy and had been carefully buried in a prominent position under the choir of the friary and close to the high altar
this all suggests she had special significant to the catholic order and may have been an early benefactor of the friary , archaeologists leading the excavation believe
records dating back to around the time the monastery was founded , more than 700 years ago , show that the bishop of lincoln offered a 30 day indulgence for anyone who would pray for a woman buried beneath a franciscan church in leicester
however , according to morris , lead archaeologist at leicester university and site director for the excavation , she is thought to be from nevill holt in leicestershire
however , little more is known about emma holt , and it was likely none of women found buried under grey friars will ever be completely identified
the lead coffin was found inside a limestone sarcophagus ( above ) under the choir of the grey friars church archaeologists had to carefully remove stone lid on top the coffin ( above ) in order to exhume the body the lead coffin had been damaged by water around the feet ( above ) causing the skeleton to become damaged ' we do n't have any known descendants who can provide a dna sample , so despite having a known woman buried here and a skeleton with a set of attributes we can not link the two together
' the twisted and battled scarred skeleton of richard iii was discovered in a shallow grave beneath the site of the friary in 2012
further excavations on the site in august 2013 , however , revealed the sarcophagus containing the mystery elderly woman
scientists believe their could be at least seven more graves on the site of the old grey friars church , which was being used as a car park when archaeologists began excavating in their search for the body of richard iii the sarcophagus was first uncovered in 2012 at the same time as richard iii but due to bad weather archaeologists had to wait until the following year before being able to return to begin excavating the coffin mr morris said : ' what stands out more is the contrast between the care and attention taken with these burials â large , neatly dug graves with coffins â and the crudeness of richard iii âs grave
' in total archaeologists exhumed three of the women found buried on the site of grey friars and left six undisturbed
the stonework of the sarcophagus had cracked and crumbled ( shown above ) due to the weight of the lid morris ( above ) led the excavation , which was done by hand rather than using heavy lifting machinery archaeologists uncovered medieval floor tiles during the excavation that they believe would have formed the floor of the friary under which the body of richard iii and the women found on the site were buried another skeleton , which had been disturbed and reburied in early building work , also showed signs of hard physical work and is believed to have died in her mid- 20s
however , it was the coffin found within the stone sarcophagus that has attracted most attention from archaeologists
' however , inside the inner lead coffin was undamaged except for a hole at the foot end of the casket where the lead had decayed and collapsed inward exposing the skeleton âs feet
stable isotope analysis of her bones suggest she had a very high status diet and she was eating a lot of fish and meat
