tory peer lord wolfson , who last year took home Â£ 4.6million , said the living wage was ' irrelevant ' the multi-millionaire boss of next sparked anger last night after declaring that the living wage was â irrelevant â
tory peer lord wolfson , who last year took home Â£ 4.6million , said it was â an invention â and â not a reality â
the living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living in the uk and is Â£ 7.85 an hour and Â£ 9.15 in london
lord wolfson earns a basic salary of Â£ 729,000 which works out at Â£ 233 an hour assuming he works 12 hours a day and excludes weekends
he believes the living wage is irrelevant because it depends on how many hours staff work as to what they earn and whether they can live on it
he said : â i think retail wages are a living wage for a lot of people but not for everybody
' what is a living wage will depend on the circumstances of the person earning it more than the amount being paid
â i think there are a lot of people for whom Â£ 6.70 an hour is a wage they can live on but it âs not a wage everyone can raise a family on
â lord wolfson made the comment on the same day next posted bumper annual figures the next chief executive employs 48,417 full and part time staff earning an average Â£ 11,000 annual salary
the firm says its rate of Â£ 6.70 an hour is above the minimum wage of Â£ 6.50
labour mp ann mckechin ( pictured ) said the comments were â ill - judged ' â they are probably better judges of its relevance than lord wolfson - and with estimated wealth of more than Â£ 100 million , it does feel a bit crass for him to be passing comment on whether people can get by on less than Â£ 7.85 an hour
