for decades their names have been at the heart of britain life but cadbury , heinz and marks & spencer have now dropped off the list of our favourite â superbrands â
instead , john lewis , lego and hã¤agen-dazs are seen as integral parts of the country âs fabric
love lost : cadbury , heinz and marks & spencer have now dropped off the list of britain 's top 20 favourite â superbrands â , having been replaced by john lewis , lego , virgin atlantic and hã¤agen-dazs topping the chart for the second year running is british airways , followed by rolex , which was founded in london in 1905
cadbury was last year no 11 but does not even feature this year â following a string of controversies since it was taken over by us company kraft in 2010
heinz â famed for its baked beans , tomato ketchup and tinned soups â has also slipped off the list after appearing at no 5 last year
what 's not to love : ice cream brand hã¤agen-dazs is new on the top - 20 superbrands list but our increasing curiosity in more exotic flavours and dishes could be one reason
however , the demise of marks & spencer , which was no 18 in 2014 , will be particularly painful for its bosses , especially as rival john lewis has leapt into the chart at no 6
