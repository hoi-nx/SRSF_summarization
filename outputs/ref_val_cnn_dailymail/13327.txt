cycling 's international governing body for a long time failed to tackle widespread and well - known doping problems in the sport and gave special treatment to armstrong , according to a damning new report
the report highlights multiple instances in which top uci officials protected , defended and made decisions favorable to armstrong despite concerns that he was doping
current uci president brian cookson , who was elected to his post in september 2013 , told cnn monday that he had written to one of his predecessors , dutchman verbruggen , to " consider his position " as the honorary president of the world governing body in the light of the findings
both zerbruggen and irishman mcquaid , who brian cookson unseated , both come under intense scrutiny in the report for their dealings with armstrong
" uci exempted armstrong from rules , failed to target test him despite the suspicions , and publicly supported him against allegations of doping , even as late as 2012 , " it says
the uci " saw armstrong as the perfect choice to lead the sport 's renaissance " after a devastating doping scandal at the 1998 tour de france , according to the report
under brian cookson , the uci set up the independent three - person commission to investigate the causes of doping in cycling and allegations that the uci and other governing bodies were ineffective in their responses
in one case , the commission says , the uci limited the scope of a supposedly independent investigation into allegations that armstrong had tested positive in a drug test at the 1999 tour de france
uci officials and armstrong 's team became heavily involved in the drafting of the investigation 's report , which was released in 2006
" the main goal was to ensure that the report reflected uci 's and armstrong 's personal conclusions , " the commission says
" between 1992 and 2006 , uci 's top officials focused on protecting cycling 's reputation rather than trying to root out " endemic " doping practices of which they were well aware , the commission 's report says
the commission says although there is no direct evidence of an agreement between mcquaid and armstrong , mcquaid " made a sudden u-turn and allowed armstrong to return 13 days early " to take part in the competition , " despite advice from uci staff not to make an exception
" " there was a temporal link between this decision , which was communicated to uci staff in the morning , and the decision of armstrong , which was notified to mcquaid later that same day , to participate in the tour of ireland , an event run by people known to mcquaid , " the report says
the report says the commission found no evidence to support allegations of corruption over payments made to the uci by armstrong
" armstrong , who cooperated with the commission 's investigation , thanked it for " seeking the truth and allowing me to assist in that search
" the report confirms that , for more than a decade , uci leaders treated riders and teams unequally -- allowing some to be above the rules , " said usada chief executive travis t. tygart
