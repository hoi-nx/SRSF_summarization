dangerous man - eater on the loose in downing street ! on closer inspection it turned out to be itv presenter susanna reid interviewing the prime minister for breakfast
yesterday morning âs broadcast was , unintentionally , comedy of a high order
it confirms miss susanna reid as heir to the late kenny everett
the american - style steel fridge is covered with family photos and magnetic letters while the shelves house a mug collection and gleaming saucepans he had a character called cupid stunt , a glammed - up tv dolly who would lift her whole derriere off the chair when she crossed her thighs
oh , susanna reid , we âll make a windmill girl out of you yet
mr david cameron , we will deduce , is on a personal publicity push
tidying up : the pm at his fridge with some wine on show
nigel farage was giving it full bluster on yesterday âs daily politics and had posed for another of his man - with - beer portraits in that pub - bore coat
mr david cameron , in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry susanna reid , yesterday had a soft double - page in london âs evening standard and an astonishing effort in the sun. he had given personal access to that red - top for an entire day , starting with jamie oliver - style footage of him in his kitchen at dawn
what is it with politicians and their kitchens at present ? appearances : mr david cameron , in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry susanna reid , yesterday had a soft double - page in london âs evening standard politics has surely not been so serious for decades yet our party leaders are behaving like teenagers mr david cameron âs in downing street , by the way , has a fridge as large as imelda marcos âs shoe closet
he also let the sun attach a camera to his body so we could see what it looked like to walk into no 10 as pm
thanks to the sun âs intimate web - video we saw a shirtsleeved prime minister licking his hellman âs mayonnaise spoon and concocting a lunch of sardines on toast for the paper âs political editor , who , when asked , declined to say they were delicious
when the hellman âs went back in the enormous fridge we copped sight of a fair few bottles of vino
one actually quite interesting disclosure was that the prime minister calls cabinet to order by ting - a - linging a little bell , the sort of thing found on the reception desks of small seaside hotels
puppy eyes : a flirtatious susanna reid interviews david cameron in number 10 for daybreak yesterday yes prime minister ! susanna reid pulls a mischievous smile ( left ) and chews her pen ( right ) during the interview he yacked away happily with miss susanna reid about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see shaun the sheep the movie with his little daughter florence endless , soft - focus shots caught the pm bidding hello to office underlings and doorkeepers , quite the breezy brigadier telling the little chaps what a splendid job they were doing
the camera lingered lovingly on the camerons â cat and on photographs on the walls of no 10
johnson will have to wait until 2016 for a cabinet post if the tories win the general election , david cameron signalled yesterday
the london mayor , who is the prime minister âs chief leadership rival , is bidding to return to the commons and has been tipped for various posts , including party chairman or head of a new infrastructure department
but mr david cameron suggested that any appointment would have to wait until mr johnson steps down as mayor next year
â asked who he would back to succeed him , mr david cameron declined to name an individual â but identified five potential candidates : mr johnson and mr osborne as well as theresa may , michael gove and philip hammond
he stopped the camera at the door to his family quarters , saying it could go no further
back on itv yesterday morning , miss susanna reid was unstoppable
there were times , it must be admitted , when mr david cameron gave her what we might call an old - fashioned glance , plainly wondering what on earth she had put in her tea
soon he was yacking away happily with miss susanna reid about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see shaun the sheep the movie with his little daughter florence
