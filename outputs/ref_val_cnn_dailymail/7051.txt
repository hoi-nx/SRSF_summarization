coe has warned against calls from the ukraine president to boycott world cup 2018 in russia over the conflict between the two nations
lord coe is challenging ukraine 's pole vault icon sergey bubka for the presidency of world athletics governing body the iaaf , to replace lamine diack , who steps down in august
coe , the former chairman of the locog ( locog ) , believes sporting boycotts only ' damage competitors and athletes '
ukraine president petro poroshenko told germany newspaper bild the country 's allies should consider boycotting the 2018 fifa tournament in russia if moscow does not pull all of its troops out of his territory
lord coe believes that boycotts only serve to ' damage competitors and athletes ' ' i will always oppose boycotts of sport , because i do n't think they actually achieve what they set out to do , ' said coe
' petro poroshenko told bild he will push germany 's chancellor angela merkel towards tougher sanctions against russia , citing the fact shakhtar donetsk are forced to host matches 1,200km away in lviv because their home city is occupied by pro-russia separatists
' i think there has to be discussion of a boycott of this world cup
as long as there are russia troops in ukraine i think a world cup in that country is unthinkable , ' petro poroshenko told bild
coe , however , believes politicians should use sport as a ' soft power ' to try to bring about change through inclusion rather than exile or boycott
ukraine president petro poroshenko wants russia to withdraw all troops from his territory conflicts have been ongoing between ukraine and russia , leading to a call for a 2018 world cup boycott ' i think it is far better to have sport as a soft power , helping change all sorts of things , and we ca n't pick , we ca n't a la carte menu sport , ' said coe
