sherrington , head of highbury grove school sent 300 pupils to detention a day during his first week in charge back in september a super-strict headmaster has transformed behaviour at his secondary school by putting more than 300 pupils a day in detention
sherrington joined highbury grove school last september and immediately enforced a tough discipline policy , which was called â orwellian â by some parents
the approach led to â huge numbers â in detention â more than 300 every day in the first week
the turnaround contributed to society magazine tatler naming it one of britain âs best state schools this year
writing in the times educational supplement , mr sherrington said : â standards continue to improve ; behaviour is not yet impeccable but we âre well on the way
this trendy discipline method in many schools involves taking a no - blame approach to bullies
mr sherrington wrote : â the perception was that it had created a need for constant negotiation , enacted inconsistently across the school because of a lack of clarity around the rules and the consequences of breaking them
â in january , tatler magazine said the school , pictured , had been transformed by ' a brilliant new head ' pupils were given a set of coded warnings and consequences , so they had to make a choice between meeting standards or â sit a detention â
mr sherrington said : â after 15 weeks , the impact has been clear
in january tatler said the school was â transformed â with a â brilliant new head â who was keen on â impeccable behaviour â and â details â including top buttons being done up at all times
