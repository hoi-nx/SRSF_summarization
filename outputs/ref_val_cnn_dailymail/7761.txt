a documentary maker who embarked on a high - sugar diet for 60 days to demonstrate the dramatic effect of sugar on the body has weighed into the debate about controversial new coke product , ' coke life '
health experts have accused coca cola of â health washing â consumers with the launch of its new â lower - calorie â soft drink as it still contains the full amount of an adult âs recommended daily allowance of sugar
damon gameau spent two months eating so - called ' healthy ' foods such as juice , cereal and sports drinks for a documentary called that sugar film - exposing the prevalence of ' hidden sugars '
australian actor damon gameau reintroduced sugar into his diet after three years with shocking results coke life ( left ) comes in a green can and although it has less sugar than regular coke life ( right ) it still contains six teaspoons of sugar dr rooney highlighted research carried out in the eighties where rats were given a sugar solution , a saccharin [ artificial sweetener ] solution and only drank a certain amount
â it âs called a super mix , a little bit of sugar and sweetener drives over consumption â¦ if this translates to the human population then that is fantastic for coke life âs profit line , â dr rooney said
coke life has its very own â super mix â of both sugar and stevia - a type of sweetener
â coke life will be pushing more products but we will be doing more detriment to our health , â dr rooney warned
when it comes to the green colour of the coke life packet it can give off a â healthy vibe â , dr rooney said
he noted coke life would have done a great amount of market research before they launched the product
rosie huntington-whiteley launched coke life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - back in london in september in documentary ' that sugar film ' he aims to highlight the sugars that are often hidden in ' health ' foods â there would have been some work that went into the association of green with health
â but people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits , â he said
and when it comes to coke life âs claims that they are trying to help battle the obesity epidemic , dr rooney said it is â disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate for coke life to frame their products as healthy
â dr rooney said it is ' disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate ' for coke life products to be marketed as healthy coke life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant stevia , which has been in japan as a sweetener for over 30 years sugary drinks do not just cause weight gain they rot teeth , increase fat on the liver and fat around the waist , he explained â i think it is deceitful and they are sitting there saying the only health worry is weight , which is absolutely wrong
â dr rooney explained that ' liquid calories ' are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food professor amanda lee of queensland university of technology , and former chair of the national health and medical research council 's dietary guidelines working committee , told the sydney morning herald the launch of coke life is an example of â greenwashing â
â there 's a high risk that many consumers could be confused , thinking that it 's a low - energy option when it 's not
lisa winn , coke life south pacific marketing director , said : â coke life truly is another example of us keeping in step with consumer demands
â â coke life is nât simply a new product from coke life â it âs another great choice for people who want a delicious coke life to fit their lifestyle
peach flavour lipton ice tea has over eight teaspoons of sugar , while vitamin water has seven v energy drinks which promise to give you ' energy ' have 13 teaspoons of sugar in them the new addition to coke life 's range of 3,500 beverages , should also not be mistaken for coke zero , which is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men who do n't like the word ' diet ' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic coke life
however , it has 35 per cent less sugar than classic coke because it uses the natural plant stevia and sugar as sweeteners , rather than just sugar
aspartame is a man - made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages
coke zero ( left ) is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate ' diet ' drinks with women
unlike diet coke ( right ) , which is completely sugar free , coke life still has sugar nutritionist aloysa hourigan from nutrition australia said that stevia is not known to have any health risks but that does n't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink coke life
