in 2007 i had my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent my getting ovarian cancer
it was a surgery of the kind that jolie recently underwent , as she revealed tuesday in a new york times op - ed. two years ago , jolie divulged that she 'd had a prophylactic double mastectomy -- i had done this as well , in 2012
along with the effects of the surgeries themselves , we now also share a related fallout : surgical menopause
when i had my ovaries removed at age 37 , i suddenly felt less vibrant and beautiful , and instead experienced the slow creep of feeling old
what will this transition mean to someone like jolie , so identified for her attractiveness and glamour ? ( she may keep that part of her transformation private , but -- as with her disclosures about the surgeries -- it might do some good to discuss that , as well
) i 've been talking and writing about brca1 since i learned more than 10 years ago that i carried this insidious , inherited genetic mutation
but often it takes someone as public , as gorgeous , as famous as ms. jolie to powerfully move the conversation about cancer prevention surgeries forward
now ms. jolie has changed this
but i like to think ms. jolie and i , two women who truly have nothing in common , are linked in our determination to be proactive
