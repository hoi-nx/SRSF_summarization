almost 400 years after miguel de cervantes ' death , a team led by etxeberria announced tuesday that they were confident they had found miguel de cervantes ' coffin in the crypt of the convent of the barefoot trinitarians in the barrio de las letras ( literary quarter ) in madrid

but they are not in sufficiently good shape , and some of the remains found may be of miguel de cervantes ' wife , catalina
