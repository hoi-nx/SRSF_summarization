from their heavy build and short limbs , to the shape of their skull and teeth , there are many ways that the anatomy of neanderthals differed to our own
researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a neanderthals child , whose remains were discovered in france 40 years ago
researchers created a computer model of the middle ear bone of a neanderthals child , whose remains were discovered in france 40 years ago to make the discovery
the entirety of the auditory ossicle is shown the remains from a two - year - old child , which are known as la ferrassie 8 , were discovered at la ferrassie in the dordogne , south western france , between 1970 and 1973
they yielded the remains of female and male adults to provide scientists with the first evidence of sexual dimorphism in neanderthals , according to the smithsonian
the skull of ferrassie 1 is the most complete neanderthals skull ever found and includes traits such as the low , sloping forehead and large nostrils
gã³mez-olivencia , an ikerbasque researcher at the university of the basque country in northern spain , produced a 3d computer reconstruction of the remains
his work , published in the journal of human evolution , reveals another anatomical difference between the neanderthals and modern humans in the smallest ossicles of the body
among la ferrassie 8 âs bones â including a skull , jaw , vertebrae , ribs and hand phalanges â is a very complete left temporal bone with an auditory ossicle inside â a complete stapes
the bone comes from a two - year - old of the extinct species the la ferrassie site ( marked on the map ) yielded seven neanderthals skeletons ranging from foetuses to almost complete skeletons of adults the bone , which lies in the middle ear of humans and other mammals is involved in the conduction of sound vibrations to the inner ear
dr gã³mez-olivencia made a computer model so he could virtually â extract â the bone to study its shape closely
he found that the shape of the neanderthals stapes differs from our own , meaning they may have heard sounds differently too
he explained : â we do not yet know the relation between these morphological differences and hearing in the neanderthals
scientists at csic ( csic ) in madrid analysed 99 incisors and canine teeth of 19 neanderthals found at sites in spain , france and belgium
