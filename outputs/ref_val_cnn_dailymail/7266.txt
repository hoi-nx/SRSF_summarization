it may be one of the most iconic shots in the musical history , but abbey road has left visitors to the scene somewhat disappointed
the abbey road crossing became a must - see site for fans after beatles were snapped walking across it for the cover of their 11th studio album
' one visitor gave the attraction a respectable four out of five but warned other tourists that it is ' smaller than you imagine ! ' meanwhile another reviewer was left wanting more as they took to the website to tell others it ' is just a road
' another visitor also gave the crossing full marks saying ' does not disappoint ! ' abbey road was the eleventh studio album the beatles and was recorded in 1969 at the north london emi studios in abbey road
