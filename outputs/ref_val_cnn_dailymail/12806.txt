nigerians go to the polls saturday to determine who will lead south africa 's most populous nation
the stakes are high in this election as the nation faces intensified attacks by extremist group boko haram
with security catapulting into a key issue , which candidate will voters trust to keep them safe ? as nigerians decides , here 's what you need to know : nigerians is home to about 173 million people and is considered a powerhouse in the region
its stability is crucial to combating the growing risk of islamist terrorists , who thrive on instability
as boko haram seeks to extend its tentacles with its recent pledge of allegiance to isis , nigerians has teamed up with neighboring chad and cameroon in a counteroffensive against the terror group
and it appears to be working , with its military saying it has recaptured several key cities from the militants
the next leader will have to ensure the gains stay on track
as we have learned with isis in iraq and syria , any unaddressed local insurgency has the potential to spiral into an international problem
and let 's face it , the world does not need another failing state , especially one with such a massive population
nigerians is also one of south africa 's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the u.s.
but with the rise of boko haram , security has taken center stage
boko haram has become increasingly brazen , seizing towns in bloody attacks and declaring them islamic caliphates
although the current government is " having successes here and there " in its fight against boko haram , it 's not winning the war against the terror group , says johnson , a documentary filmmaker and analyst on african affairs
the government has made tremendous gains on the economy , johnson says , but those gains have been buried under the constant threat of boko haram
the two faced off in the last election in 2011
buhari : the retired general has unsuccessfully run for election three times
" the election was originally scheduled for february 14 , but was delayed for six weeks
like their u.s. counterparts , the nation 's governors have a lot of clout
if no candidate wins , a runoff election will be held seven days later
