suspended : dr adam osborne was suspended by the general medical council two weeks ago amid sex with patient allegations , and has now stepped down as director of the company he owns with his wife the psychiatrist brother of chancellor george osborne has resigned from his private medical company , leaving it with assets of just Â£ 551
dr adam osborne , 38 , was suspended by the general medical council two weeks ago pending an investigation into allegations he had a two - year sexual affair with a vulnerable woman patient â a married mother of two with psychiatric issues
now he has stepped down as a director of elitemed , the private company he co-owns with his wife noor , a plastic surgeon
the company recently filed accounts which showed it was worth just Â£ 551 , had Â£ 71 in the bank and owed creditors Â£ 7,337
the couple each own 50 per cent of the company , but general medical council rules mean adam osborne can not practise as a doctor until an investigation into the allegations is concluded
another firm called devonport psychiatry , which was registered to adam osborne âs west london home , appears to have had its 0845 number disconnected since the mail on sunday revealed he had been suspended by the general medical council
elitemed was set up in 2010 shortly after adam osborne was suspended over earlier claims which centred on his relationship with a cocaine - addicted prostitute
