like it or not , it 's no wonder bush is emerging as the gop 's 2016 frontrunner
of course , there is that awkward little name thing , something he seems fully aware of -- despite only being in the exploratory phase of a potential campaign , bush has already declared he 's not just another bush
" they did n't need to be persuaded , " howard leach , a gop fundraiser for bush , told the washington post
and if bush wins the nomination in 2016 , it will likely be less " joyfully , " as he promised last year , than ruthlessly
after all , we 're still more than 18 months from the election and bush 's locking in many of the same kinds of consultants that worked with his brother and father
bush 's campaign is seeking to hire " donors , advisors and operatives , " wrote the times , with " deep connections to the bush family 's past presidential campaigns and administrations
" those same family members from whom bush swears he 's different ? and if consultants do n't abide by bush 's rules of loyalty and decide to work with other 2016 gop aspirants ? " swift rebuke follows , " the times notes , pointing to the example of imge , a technology company that reportedly fell out of favor with the bush campaign after one of the firm 's founders indicated imge was hoping not to be tied to a single candidate
none of this is to suggest that bush does n't have appeal as a candidate -- i like some of the things he did as florida governor , like his record of cutting $ 19 billion in taxes and supporting school choice programs
but what troubles me a little about bush 's early attempts at " corning the market " is that he 's relying on the same consultants that have cycled through the last 20 - plus years of elections -- some of whom worked for romney 's campaign
this raises the question of why , if bush does n't want the public to view him as just another bush running for president , he seems to be relying on the bush network of consultants ? the same playbook that helped get his brother and father get elected president is n't going to work for this bush
he ( let 's face it , the gop wo n't nominate a woman ) will have to hire minorities and women in meaningful campaign positions and have a strategy to aggressively compete for minority votes
as a black conservative who would like to see a gop in the white house again , i hope bush is n't romney 2.0 .
