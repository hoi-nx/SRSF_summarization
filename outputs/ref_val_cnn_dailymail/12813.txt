how can i describe life in crimea after a year under russia 's control ? you start saying things like " let 's not talk about this on the phone " and become careful about the facebook pages you " like
" because total surveillance and control has become routine -- like it was in the soviet
in just one year so much has been lost and many crimeans seem to have forgotten rights that were part of everyone 's life
there is a growing level of censorship , inequality and political repression of those who do n't agree with the government
in everyday communication , crimeans , including those who support putin and russia , have to think about what they do and say
thanks to the activities of the fsb ( russia 's secret police ) denunciation -- where a citizen tells the authorities about the wrongdoing of another -- is popular again
in the soviet , especially in the late 1930s , denunciations written by soviet citizens about their neighbors , friends and even relatives resulted in millions of victims in prisons and gulag camps
now in crimea , no one feels safe
anyone who does n't like you can write a denunciation and the next day you will take part in a " joyful " conversation with the security services
significant changes have also taking place in the most basic of rights , like freedom of movement
of course , permission is mostly given to people or organizations loyal to the kremlin
more than half of all tourists who used to visit crimea in the summer were ukraine and last year tourism was down by 50 %
despite of the deteriorating economic and human rights situation , many of those who were for the annexation of crimea continue to support russia
as strange as it may sound , the harder life becomes here in crimea , the more people support putin and hate ukraine
