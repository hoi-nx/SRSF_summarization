blair has given the labour more than Â£ 100,000 , in an apparent bid to ingratiate himself with ed miliband
the former prime minister , who has a strained relationship with the labour leader , announced last night that he had given Â£ 1,000 to each of the 106 candidates fighting target seats for the party in may
in a letter to candidates , mr blair said : â i know how hard it can be to raise money to fund a local campaign , but for you , in one of our 106 battleground seats , it is even more vital
former prime minister blair , right , has given the labour more than Â£ 100,000 in an apparent bid to ingratiate himself with ed miliband , left â as one of our key seat candidates , you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face , but i have every confidence that with your drive , determination and organisational skills , you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government
â labour indicated that mr blair will also play a role in the election campaign , despite having made clear that he disapproves of mr ed miliband âs left - wing stance
the donation represents a relatively modest gesture from mr blair , whose personal fortune is estimated at anything up to Â£ 100million following years of lucrative consultancies with big corporations and foreign regimes and a string of high - profile property deals
a labour spokesman last night welcomed mr blair âs intervention , adding : â we âre delighted that blair has given so generously to the local campaigns in the battleground seats our party is targeting at this general election
