republican presidential hopeful carson has been forced to apologize for comments made on wednesday in which he said prisoners ' changing their sexuality in jail proves that being gay is a choice
the retired neurosurgeon posted a statement on his facebook page just hours later in which he said he ' realized that my choice of language does not reflect fully my heart on gay issues
carson 's opinion is at odds with many in the medical community , including the american psychological association , who says ' most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation
' carson had landed himself in hot water on wednesday morning after appearing on cnn 's new day
asked by chris cuomo if being gay was a choice , carson replied : ' absolutely
he then spoke out against gay marriage
carson 's apology only went so far and he remains adamant that it is n't certain whether people are born either gay or straight ' why ca n't any two human beings , i do n't care what their sexual orientation is , why ca n't they have the legal right to do those things ? that does not require changing the definition of marriage
' carson said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level , this on the same day the alabama supreme court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state 's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples
carson has long been outspoken on the subject of gay marriage , which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech
