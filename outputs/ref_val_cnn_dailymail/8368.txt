indiana governor pence pushed back today on claims that his state 's new religious freedom law is a ' license to discriminate
' the gop politician said to be considering a presidential campaign stated that he 'd veto any bill that ' legalized discrimination against any person or group ' - but that 's not what indiana 's law does
with the storm that has gathered over his state since he formally approved the law last thursday showing no signs of dissipating , pence called off public appearances on monday
meanwhile , sports officials planned an ' indy welcomes all ' campaign ahead of this weekend 's ncaa final four in indianapolis as lawmakers scrambled to quiet the national firestorm over the new law that has much of the country portraying indiana as a state of intolerance
the measure prohibits state laws that ' substantially burden ' a person 's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs
' what we had hoped for with the bill was a message of inclusion , inclusion of all religious beliefs , ' brian bosma house speaker brian bosma said
what puzzles me is how this effort came to the top of the legislative agenda when clearly the business community does n't support it , ' said bill oesterle , an aide to gop former governor mitch daniels and ceo of consumer reporting agency angie 's list , which canceled expansion plans in indianapolis because of the law
indianapolis mayor ballard , a gop , said the law threatens to undermine the city 's economic growth and reputation as a convention and tourism destination and called for lawmakers to add protections for sexual orientation and gender identity to indiana civil - rights laws
' i call upon governor pence and the indiana legislature to fix this law
in the the wall street journal essay , pence argued that the religious freedom measure ' contains no reference to sexual orientation
' it simply ' mirrors ' federal law , he stated
the federally mandated affordable care act , he said , ' renewed concerns about government infringement on deeply held religious beliefs ' compelling the gop - controlled indiana legislature to introduce enhanced protections for persons of faith
' with the passage of this legislation , indiana will continue to be a place that respects the beliefs of every person in our state
' pence and gop senate president gop long have stressed that the new law is based on the federal religious freedom restoration act of 1993 , which has been upheld by courts
a group of more than 2,000 protesters lined up outside the state capitol on saturday , as the tide of public opinion turned against the hoosier state 's new religious freedom bill hrc 's legal director , warbelow , said the federal law was designed to ensure religious minorities were protected from laws passed by the federal government that might not have been intended to discriminate but had that effect
indiana 's lack of a law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is also a contributor , she said
demonstrators react to the city county council passing a resolution calling on the state to repeal or revise it 's controversial religious freedom restoration act long and brian bosma did not appear eager to add such protection into the measure , noting that it is a big policy decision and that only four weeks remain in this year 's legislative session
' two states ' democratic governors , connecticut 's dan malloy , and washington 's jay inslee , said they were imposing an administration - wide ban on state - funded travel to indiana
