barclays boss : antony jenkins has accept his first bonus since taking the helm in 2012 , as his bank enjoyed Â£ .5.5billion profits for 2014 the high street bank is braced for huge penalties from uk and us regulators after refusing to reach a settlement in november

antony jenkins had assured investors that the 2014 bonus round would be ' less controversial ' after a bitter row last year
this year , with improved results , the bonus pool is around Â£ 1.8billion
calling his own bonus ' appropriate ' he said today : ' barclays today is a stronger business , with better prospects , than at any time since the financial crisis
' mr antony jenkins ' bonus is his first since taking the helm in 2012 and will be justified because barclays ' profits rose this year and were around Â£ 300million better than expected
contrast : after a year barclays has described as its best since 2014 , it recorded a rise in pre-tax profits and reduced its bonus pot to a five - year low but when the other five banks involved settled last , barclays did not , so could face a higher fine as a result
barclays said it is reviewing its foreign exchange trading over a several - year period and continuing to co-operate with relevant bodies , and that these probes could result in ' substantial monetary penalties '
mr antony jenkins said : ' we remain focused on addressing outstanding conduct issues , including those related to foreign exchange trading
changes : in 2014 barclays slashed 14,000 jobs - with another 5,000 to go by 2016 - and closed a net 72 branches the results come after a year in which barclays shut 89 branches while opening 17 amid an increasing push for customers to contact it via skype or by telephone , or to use post office banking or new sites in asda stores
' the chief executive rightly recognises that the bank 's culture must change , but it is hard to have a positive view of any organisation that pays its boss Â£ 5.5 million in a single year - a sum that would take a full - time worker on the minimum wage 465 years to earn
