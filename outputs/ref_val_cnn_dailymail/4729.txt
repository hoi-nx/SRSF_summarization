the stampede by rugby âs dinosaurs to defend that monstrous lawes tackle against france as perfectly legal has been as alarming as the potentially back - breaking hit itself
not so when seen in the context of mr steven gerrard âs words of contrition for a rare blood - rush late in his honourable career
england lock lawes made a bonecrunching hit on france fly - half plisson lawes crumples plisson in the aftermath of his monstrous tackle on the french fly half steven gerrard stamped on ander herrera 's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half steven gerrard walks off the anfield pitch in what was his last appearance against manchester united in a liverpool shirt jeff powell âs piece has provoked much debate , including the above tweet from lawes himself ... they also like to say that rugby is a game for thugs played by gentlemen
steven gerrard sought forgiveness from his team - mates and fans for how his stupidity left it impossible for liverpool to avoid sunday âs critical premier league defeat
there has been no apology from lawes for a violent act 24 hours earlier which cast a pall over an otherwise heroic england victory , which came close to snatching an improbable six nations championship
at twickenham even the low - swinging charioteers gasped in horror as lawes came close to cutting in two french fly half plisson
referee nigel owens and his video - reviewing assistant agreed that the lawes â tackle was within the regulations
a livid yoann maestri pushed lawes in the face and grapples with the england man following his challenge lawes and maestri continue their disagreement on their feet as matters threaten to boil over the majority of the rugby fraternity gave vent to their customary splutterings about this being â a man âs game
â not when you blind - side an opponent after he has passed the ball
the officials and the executives who are responsible for rugby were of a consensus that lawes was already committed to the tackle so therefore he was not late enough to justify a red card
but did he really have to go through with it at such ferocious velocity ? was it vindictive or mere happenstance ? lawes is not telling us but if it had happened in a street outside the stadium police may well have been called to investigate if there were grounds for an assault charge
the rugby authorities â with the exception of the french who are asking for the on - the - spot not guilty verdict to be reviewed â are saying he did nothing wrong
ander herrera gestures and points at steven gerrard as the liverpool midfielder reacts following the challenge steven gerrard looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for liverpool at anfield if it is ok for a young man of average build like plisson to be hit so hard by a giant that his head is shaken around like that of a rag doll before slamming against the ground , then what chance the campaign we at sportsmail are leading for the reforms needed to prevent concussive head injuries ? if the supply of youngsters dries up , rugby âs future will be bleak indeed
england internationals charlie hodgson and owen farrell and another french cap , morgan parra , are among a lengthening list of creative fly - halves who have been hammered â and in some cases injured â by trade - mark batterings from lawes
plisson continued to play after his mauling by lawes and comes up against luther burrell here england and france captains chris robshaw and thierry dusautoir listen to referee nigel owens was lawes well - intentioned towards plisson , who played even more poorly thereafter although going beyond the call of duty in carrying on ? as the decision to let lawes remain on the pitch came down he gave me the smug impression of someone who had got away with another one
and his own team - mates talk with increasing awe of how he targets the fly - halves he dwarfs
