make no mistake , this is a huge game for england and scotland
after the anti-climax of an uninspiring defeat in ireland , england must strike back and show that they are a nation to be feared at this year âs world cup
scotland , after a promising start under vern cotter , are without a win , have lost at home to italy and are looking increasingly desperate
this is a huge game for england 's players - but they are not an arrogant group and will look to perform well scotland go through their paces at twickenham on friday - it 's an important game for them to restore pride england forwards coach graham rowntree talked about the home side being able to â win by many â if they get their game right
but sometimes saying something this provocative makes him and his team a hostage to fortune and feeds the stereotype that england are arrogant , which i do nât believe we are
i doubt scotland will come back to haunt graham rowntree in the same way but why risk it ? then we have scotland âs stuart hogg , a brilliant player - on the back of losing to italy at home , a run of 15 games at twickenham without a win and the last seven games conceding on average 36 points - saying england do not respect scotland
you earn respect by winning big games and scotland âs performance against italy suggests it was they who were guilty of not respecting their opponents
this england team is not arrogant - in fact , in many ways i âd like to see them carry themselves more confidently to demonstrate self - belief - and stuart hogg âs comments were wide of the mark
scotland âs players should look at themselves and ask themselves if they really believe they are good enough to win at grounds like twickenham
as for england , the most worrying aspect of that defeat to ireland was their lack of intensity at the breakdown so i was pleased to hear that they have been having some pretty spicy training sessions this week
stuart hogg said that england do not respect scotland which could make things worse at twickenham this england team are not arrogant , in fact , they could do with carrying more confidently to show self - belief england 's players trudge off the pitch at the aviva stadium after their defeat to ireland last time out the breakdown is the responsibility of every single player in the team , not just your back row
this is world cup year , england are at home and they need momentum and to cause fear and dread among their opponents
i want to see england take out their pent - up frustration on scotland by producing their most clinical , technically proficient and above all fierce performance
england showed a worrying lack of intensity at the breakdown in dublin , which is everyone 's responsibility george ford is our â creative director â and i want to see his most expansive game against the scots there is no question scotland are massive underdogs going into this game but underdogs will always lift their performance levels and it is up to the favourite to respond
wales â scott gibbs dancing his way over at wembley in 1999 , watching it the other day was horrible again andy nicol ( right ) showed sheer joy at the final whistle at murrayfield in 2000 when beating england keith wood bulldozed his way across for the match - winning try at the old lansdowne road in 2001 then there was scotland âs andy nicol âs sheer joy on the final whistle at murrayfield in 2000 and ireland âs keith wood bulldozing his way across for the match - winning try from a line - out peel at the old lansdowne road in 2001
this game is at twickenham , where scotland have not won in 32 years and i simply can not see england losing this game
â captain chris robshaw was bold to kick to touch rather than take three points a few times against ireland england lost the ball at the line - out and that can not happen again - if england dominate there they will win big we then defined england âs basics quite simply as line - out and scrums - in the three grand slams we lost , simply we did not get these basics right
i hope england have spent this week drilling their set - piece to death
chris robshaw was bold to kick to touch rather than take three points a few times against ireland but then the line - out which followed was stolen
if they dominate that area of the game - and i am sure england will - expect a very high score .
