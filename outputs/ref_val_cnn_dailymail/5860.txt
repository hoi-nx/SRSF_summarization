millions of ducks raised for the dinner table are being denied essentials like a pond to swim and bathe in , warns the rspca
it says the reality for the 14.3m ducks reared for meat in the uk every year is very different from the beatrix potter and jemima puddle-duck view of farm life
the rspca said not one of these ducks are raised according to the minimum welfare standards it supports under its â freedom food â scheme and it is demanding new laws to improve conditions
however , producers insist there is no need to provide ponds as ducks â have a low motivation to swim for any length of time â
a survey by the rspca found most consumers have no idea how the ducks are raised and most would be appalled that they do not get access to water to swim and bathe in
calling for action : the rspca wants conditions to improve for the millions of ducks reared for meat in the uk there are no legal requirements to provide farmed ducks with anything other than water to drink , and the duck industry âs own standards , through the red tractor scheme , only require ducks to be able to cover their heads with water
there are no legal requirements to provide farmed ducks with anything other than water to drink , and the duck industry âs own standards only require ducks to be able to cover their heads with water some 78 per cent were â appalled â that ducks farmed for their meat may never get access to bathing water
it warns : â it is very difficult for consumers to find any meat from ducks reared to welfare standards the rspca would find acceptable
the organisation claimed ducks â have a low motivation to swim for any length of time â
uk favourite : the rspca have called on shoppers to stop buying the meat until improvements are made it has set up a das ( das ) to cover rearing policies and ensures there is enough water to allow the ducks to dip their heads in and use the water to preen their feathers
it said : â it is not practical to provide deep water for swimming - especially in indoor systems - and ducks do have a low motivation to swim for any length of time
