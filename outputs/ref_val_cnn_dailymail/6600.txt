the striking sight of a solar eclipse will capture the attention of commuters across britain on their way to work this friday
it will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush - hour in the britain , and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment
experts have warned that drivers may be dazzled as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter
the right - hand animation shows how the shadow created by the eclipse on 20 march will travel over europe on 20 march , the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun , casting a shadow over earth
the proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near - total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the britain , so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in london , manchester will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in glasgow , aberdeen and edinburgh
timeings will vary , so that in london , the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will begin at 8.24am
the eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. by 10.41am , the moon will leave the sun 's edge and the partial eclipse will end
the solar eclipse is set to block out nearly 90 per cent of sunlight across parts of europe
on the morning of the 20 march the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over earth - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 august 1999 ( pictured over germany ) the eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in london and around 94 per cent in glasgow , aberdeen and edinburgh
driving experts have warned drivers to keep their eyes ' on the road to avoid accidents the last solar eclipse of a similar size took place on 11 august 1999 and had an eclipse magnitude of 1.029
an eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the sun âs diameter obscured by the moon
it is based on a ratio of diameters and differs from an eclipse obscuration , which is a measure of the sun âs surface area covered by the moon
but rac spokesman simon williams told mailonline : â the biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist âs perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness
â it is imperative that rush - hour drivers maintain good focus on the road ahead rather than being tempted to catch a glimpse of the moon obscuring the sun and therefore not fully concentrating on what âs going on around them , ' he added
â anyone that does , is not only taking their eyes off the road , but may well end up being temporarily blinded from the sun âs brightness before it is eclipsed
an rac spokesman told mailonline : â the biggest danger of the eclipse from the motorist âs perspective is likely to be distraction rather than being plunged into darkness
telescopes with solar filters : there are sun - specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse
referring to the rush hour problem , robin scagell , vice president of the society for popular astronomy ( society for popular astronomy ) told the independent : â it âs not the best time [ for an eclipse ] from a safety point of view
' it will still be broad daylight and no darker than if there were some cloud in front of the sun. but danger could occur if a driver decides to take a quick look at the sun. he said : ' there are the obvious issues about being distracted while driving , whether it 's looking at the sun or anything else that attracts your attention away from the road
' he said that while drivers often have to cope with driving in a low sun , they typically concentrate on the road , but ' reflex action prevents you from actually staring at it , and moves your centre of attention around
the solar eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered over london and around 94 per cent in the main cities in scotland ( pictured is a full eclipse over australia in 2012 ) the highways agency has advised road users to drive carefully and adjust their speed , just as they would for unusual weather or road conditions tom kerss , astronomer at the royal observatory greenwich said : ' since the moon is smaller than the earth , and very far away , the properly dark shadow it casts will only be about 100 miles wide , and will spend most of its time darkening the chilly waters of the north atlantic and arctic oceans
' what âs more , lunar perigee - the time in the moon month when the earth and moon are closest together - will occur the evening before the eclipse
with power supply so reliant on the sun âs rays , the solar eclipse on 20 march might lead to blackouts
