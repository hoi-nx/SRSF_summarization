one in five instagram users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. to capitalise on this , the californian firm has launched its latest standalone app called layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations
photos can be selected from the phone 's camera roll , or taken with the photo booth tool , and layouts can then be ' remixed ' and edited with mirror effects and flips
as they add more images the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired ( right ) it is branded in the same way as instagram 's other standalone timelapse app , hyperlapse
the layout app has four main features called faces , mirroring , photo booth and previews
there are a number of different tools which allow users to ' remix ' their layout including mirror effects , flip , pinch to zoom , and rotate
once the layout is complete it can be shared to instagram or facebook , or saved to their camera roll to be shared elsewhere
the app has therefore added a faces tab that scans all the photos in the user 's camera roll to show those in which it detects a face
all collages can be previewed and saved , or they can be uploaded to instagram or facebook
