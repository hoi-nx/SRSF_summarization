the fbi has increased its reward for information on missing american robert levinson from $ 1 million to $ 5 million , it announced monday
levinson , a retired fbi agent , vanished after traveling to the iran island of kish island in march 2007 and is one of the longest - held american citizens in history
the fbi announced the reward increase on the eighth anniversary of levinson 's disappearance -- and the day before his 67th birthday
" levinson traveled to kish island , iran , on march 8 , 2007 , working on behalf of several large corporations , and his whereabouts , well - being and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance have been unknown since that time , " it said in a statement
american secretary of state john kerry issued a statement asking iran to cooperate with the investigation into levinson 's whereabouts
that prompted his family to speak out , saying they kept it quiet for years that levinson was working for the cia , because the american government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy
in the video , he asked the american government for help : " please help me get home , " a gaunt - looking levinson said on the tape , citing his 33 years of service in the fbi as a reason for that help
