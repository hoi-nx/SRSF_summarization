sturgeon is behaving like putin by ' stoking division in english ' , a senior tory warns
in a provocative intervention , wallace last night accused scotland 's first minister of trying to break up uk using the same tactics as the russia president in the early days of the ukraine crisis
miss sturgeon will use her keynote speech at the snp 's conference in glasgow today to insist that she will ' demand an end to slash and burn austerity ' in return for propping up miliband in downing street
a senior tory has said scotland 's first minister sturgeon ( right ) is behaving like russia 's putin ( left ) by ' stoking division in english ' she will claim to be sending a ' message of friendship and solidarity ' to english voters who want an end to spending cuts that ' tear at the very fabric of society '
but mr wallace , a serving government whip who was once a member of the scottish parliament , last night accused her of masterminding a plot designed to anger english voters and hasten the break - up of the uk
' sturgeon is intent on stoking division in english in the same way putin used it to break apart ukraine , ' he said
sturgeon may dress it up as friendliness , but that is what she wants â she wants english to tell the scotland to get lost
but if labour 's greed for power allows her to succeed , then god help the uk
miss sturgeon has said she has no qualms about installing mr miliband ( pictured ) in no 10 she said she would have no qualms about installing mr miliband in no 10 , despite believing that scotland should not even be part of the uk
however polls predict the party could win more than 50 of scotland 's 59 seats at the election â and could potentially prop up a minority labour government
we will demand an alternative to slash and burn austerity
