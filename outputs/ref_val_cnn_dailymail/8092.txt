for years wozniak dismissed claims that technology , and particularly artificial intelligence , could threaten humans
but in a recent interview , the 64 - year - old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human - like computers could be a dangerous reality
he even quipped : ' will we be the gods ? will we be the family pets ? or will we be ants that get stepped on ? i do n't know
he even quipped ' will we be the gods ? will we be the family pets ? or will we be ants that get stepped on ? i do n't know ' the apple co-founder made the comments during an interview with paul smith at australian financial review
he said : ' computers are going to take over from humans , no question
if we build these devices to take care of everything for us , eventually they 'll think faster than us and they 'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently
he directly referenced warnings issued by both musk and stephen hawking about the threat ai has on humanity
the pair is part of a group of experts , known collectively as the future of life institute , who recently drafted an open letter saying scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind
the authors said there is a ' broad consensus ' that ai research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of ai had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak
for instance , in the short term , it claims ai may put millions of people out of work

' aldebaran 's human - like robot is pictured mr wozniak directly referenced warnings issued by both musk ( pictured ) and stephen hawking about the threat ai has on humanity
for example , tesla boss mr musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will , instead , be controlled by robots earlier this month tesla boss mr musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will , instead , be controlled by robots
the entrepreneur claimed that computers will one day do a much better job of driving and that humans are simply â too dangerous â behind the wheel
this will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in japanese
with this in mind , mr benzell and his colleagues at the national bureau of economic research asked whether ' human replacement ' - the act of building better versions of ourselves - will deliver an economic utopia or leave us earning too little to buy the goods the robots are making ? using a simulated economy , they found that the value of coders and developers will increase as the demand for smart machines rise
using a simulated economy , a recent paper found the value of coders will increase as demand for machines rise
but over time , the stock of so - called ' legacy code ' will grow causing demand for new code and high - tech workers to drop and see them replaced by robots the eventual decline in jobs will limit what young people can save and invest
these robots contain the stuff of humans - accumulated brain and saving power , ' said the paper
now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including musk and stephen hawking , have signed an open letter promising to ensure ai research benefits humanity
stark warning : professor stephen hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence the document , drafted by the future of life institute , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind
the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that ai research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society
' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools ai may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of ai had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak
for instance , in the short term , it claims ai may put millions of people out of work
