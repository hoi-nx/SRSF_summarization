leicester , english " god save richard iii ! " a cry rings out in the bright spring air as the simple oak coffin of richard iii is carried away from the tower block - filled campus of the leicester university for the final time
the medieval monarch 's skeleton has been kept at the university since its discovery beneath a council car parking lot in the city sparked excitement around the world in august 2012
but on sunday the bones -- which have been studied by archaeologists and experts from all fields in the years since -- ended their tenure as scientific specimens and became , once more , the mortal remains of a king
some 35,000 people lined the streets of leicester and the surrounding towns and villages as the cortege wound its way through the countryside to the site of richard iii 's final battle , bosworth , where he died in 1485 , before returning to the city for a commemoration at leicester cathedral
the day began on the freshly - mown lawns in front of the university 's fielding johnson building , where a crowd gathered for a solemn service of farewell , dignitaries dressed in their sunday best alongside students and local families clad in jeans and waterproof jackets in case of a march shower
leicester university 's president and vice-chancellor paul boyle said the discovery of the bones had been a " defining moment " which " reshaped history , " and pointed out that the university had been custodian of richard iii 's remains for longer than he ruled english
genetics expert king , who proved the identity of the bones by matching their dna to a living relative of the monarch , michael ibsen , said : " it has been an amazing project to be part of -- we all feel very privileged to be involved
" king , who read robert frost 's poem " the road not taken " at the university service and laid a white rose -- a reminder of richard iii 's heritage as a member of the yorkist -- on the coffin , said she considered the commemorations the end of a chapter in his story , but not the end of the story itself ; she is still working to sequence his entire genome
michael ibsen and another living relative of richard iii , wendy duldig , were there as the hearse carrying the coffin pulled away from the somber grey - brown bricks of the fielding johnson building ; accompanied by archaeologist richard buckley , who led the dig which uncovered the king 's bones , they walked silently behind as the cortege 's journey began
thousands of people lined the route of the procession , out through the leicestershire villages visited by richard iii on his way to the bosworth
here , richard iii 's role as a " warrior king " was commemorated and tributes were paid to the others who died fighting alongside him
" ellis , who named her son richard iii , said she had used the parking lot where the king 's remains were found
more than five centuries on , those who sparked the search for richard iii 's remains were determined to put right that ancient wrong by giving him a more fitting farewell
the coffin is a simple affair : english oak and yew , made by richard iii 's relative michael ibsen who , as chance would have it , is a cabinet maker by trade ; it is carved with the king 's name and a white rose
but with those puzzles overcome , the first of several high profile pre-reinterment services was held sunday evening : the coffin was carried through the city on a gun carriage , accompanied by two " knights " in full suits of armor , riding on horseback , to the cathedral
as the city 's church bells tolled and dusk began to fall , the coffin was lifted onto the shoulders of the pallbearers and taken into the cathedral , accompanied by four official " mourners " -- descendants of some of those who fought with richard iii at bosworth
as those who had attended filed back out into the darkening spring evening , one final illuminated tribute was paid : the initials riii and a crown were projected onto the cathedral 's tower , while nearby , white roses surrounded a statue of the king
