" the stomp " remains one of the most controversial plays in ncaa history -- when duke 's christian laettner lifted his foot and stepped on kentucky 's timberlake during a critical moment of what has been called the greatest college basketball game ever played , the 1992 ncaa east regional final
mention the stomp in a diner or bar in kentucky and you best be prepared for a string of expletives -- from the blue - haired elders to the wealthiest thoroughbred trainers -- about how christian laettner is the vilest human on earth
the stomp returned to headlines this week after espn aired a " 30 for 30 " documentary called " i hate christian laettner , " detailing the life of one of the best players to ever play college ball and why he remains a lightning rod to this day
when it comes to the stomp , christian laettner says he decided to give a " little payback " while timberlake lay helpless on the ground
if kentucky fans needed more reason to hate christian laettner , those words might 've been it
but on twitter , christian laettner issued a video apology to timberlake , the first time he 'd ever done so : timberlake could 've lashed back , but he 's too classy for that
) he responded to christian laettner , saying he appreciates and accepts the apology
at the end of his 23 - second message , timberlake 's voice turns into a smooth baritone and he ends with : " go big blue
the thing he prefers to remember from that game was the honor of playing in it -- and the locker room speech by coach pitino after the game
pitino held up an old sports illustrated cover that said the kentucky program was in shambles
pitino told his players that although they lost on the court , his players had done something much bigger : they 'd put kentucky basketball back on the map
" timberlake has had fun with the stomp over the years , even donning a " i still hate laettner " t - shirt that was given to him and posing with fans when kentucky and duke played a couple years ago
