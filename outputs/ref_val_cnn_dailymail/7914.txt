the days of gooey toothpaste tubes , bottles of stubborn ketchup and sticky glue pots are numbered
after unveiling its super slippery liquiglide coating last year , a team of massachusetts - based scientists has signed its first deal to bring the technology to supermarket shelves
elmers brand glue an adhesives is the first firm to publicly announce a deal , and there are rumours a mayonnaise brand , and toothpaste company are also on board
elmers brand glue an adhesives is the first firm to sign up , and reports claim a mayonnaise brand , and toothpaste firm , are also on board liquiglide was invented at mit and its designers call it ' the first and only permanently wet , slippery surface technology '
a conventional super-hydrophobic surface is similar to a lotus leaf - it is a highly textured surface that creates a cushion of air for the product to sit on
this so - called ' liquid - impregnated surface ' is a multi-layer surface consisting of a customised solid texture and a liquid
as a result , the ketchup , detergent or other product slides on the liquid layer , in a so - called ' liquid - to - liquid interface '

for example , when fitted inside ketchup bottles the liquid is plant - based , while other non-food stuffs can use non-edible chemicals
the non-toxic lubricant can be used on both plastic and glass containers and can be adapted for different applications

a conventional super-hydrophobic surface ( left ) has a highly textured surface that creates a cushion of air to reduce friction , but liquiglide replaces this air with liquid ( right ) according to the inventors , each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers can not be scraped from jars and bottles , with up to 15 per cent of a product remaining in its container
