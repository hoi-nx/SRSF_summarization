and as this incredible video shows , planes flying into manchester battled against the winds that saw many appear to be ' hovering ' on their descent in
posted on twitter by user@philip2004 , the action was taken from near the airport pub close to the runway
' i never fear the aircraft landing but it did look nice and they will land ok
' the only thing is predicting when there 's a long enough day of winds
i was here for the emirates one last week when they had to abort the landing
' the wind was thought to only be around 35mph , but the direction and pressure affected the landing hunter , british airline plot 's association ( balpa ) head of flight safety told mailonline that pilots are well - trained to deal with a crosswind landing
' the pilots here are performing a cross-wind landing which we train for all the time , and which are not that unusual , ' said mr hunter
' mr dodd told mailonline that he was always confident the plane would make a safe landing as well as capturing the windy landing for an etihad , he also videoed british airways and easyjet planes having a less - than comfortable descent
the plane that had flown in from dubai came around a second time , and despite a few wobbly moments , made a safe landing
