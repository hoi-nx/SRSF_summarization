oldham chairman corney believes scholes will manage the league one club ' one day ' , but admits it will be ' difficult ' to tempt him to take the vacancy at the moment
the former england and manchester united midfielder , 40 , was immediately linked with his boyhood outfit when the football league 's third youngest manager lee johnson exited sportsdirect.com park last week to join league one rivals barnsley
the romantic notion that scholes would take his first managerial position with latics appears fanciful but corney does think he could take the helm one day
oldham supporter scholes will manage the latics in the future according to corney however , oldham chairman corney was doubful scholes could commit considering his current media duties speaking on a bbc radio manchester phone - in alongside director anthony gee , who suggested that the oldham job ' may interest ' scholes ' at some point ' , corney said : ' we speak on a regular basis and scholes occasionally comes down and does training sessions
we know what scholes 's all about , he 's very low key , he does n't make a big deal about things
again , you have to ask would oldham be the right club for somebody like scholes ? it 's not just about us wanting scholes , it 's also would it be the right thing for him ? ' i think anthony gee 's right that one day he will come and manage the club but it 's all about timing with him
' anthony gee also confirmed scholes , who now has media commitments with the likes of bt sport , had not applied for the position but that they did intend to hold talks with him in the near future
the two oldham board members also touched on the club 's controversial move to attempt to sign convicted rapist evans in january , a signing they eventually pulled out of in the face of overwhelming pressure from sponsors promising to withdraw their support , while staff members were also subjected to abusive threats
since his retirement from football the former manchester united star has taken up a role with bt sport latics had originally indicated they had no desire to acquire evans back in december , but anthony gee revealed they returned to the possibility in the new year when lee johnson told the board of directors he had had a change of heart
