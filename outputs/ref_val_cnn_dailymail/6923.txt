the mystery surrounding the demise of jagger - an irish setter which died under suspicious circumstances after returning from a dog show in birmingham - could finally be solved
the beloved dog died days after returning from the crufts show in birmingham , sparking an international murder mystery and claims he was ' murdered ' by a bitter rival
and just as toxicology reports this week showed he had died after ingesting a fast - acting illegal pesticide , residents of his hometown of lauw , belgium , have revealed the small village is in the grip of a suspected serial cat killer
however , toxicology reports released this week suggested he must have ingested it at his home in belgium as the poison discovered in his system is notoriously fast - acting
prize - winning irish setter jagger was actually poisoned after he returned to his home country of belgium local veterinarian patrick jans , ( unrelated to ms jans ) , said he was waiting on toxicology reports to reveal what killed the local cats , but said there were ' symptoms suggestive of intoxication '
' there has been a lot of concern about whether the poisoning happened at crufts and we are now able to reassure all dog lovers who came to crufts that this could not have been possible and it is highly likely that the poisons , thought to be on a piece of beef , were eaten in belgium , shortly before jagger 's death
' considering we are told that jagger showed the first clinical signs usually associated with these two poisons shortly before his death in belgium , late on friday march 6 night , leading to the immediate call for veterinary attention , we must conclude that it is inconceivable that he could have been poisoned at crufts on thursday march 5 , some 28 to 36 hours earlier
