sian , 51 , consulted her gp about an unusual freckle she found on her ankle as a redhead , 51 - year - old sian was used to having freckles â they âd covered her arms , face and chest since childhood
but in 2008 , she noticed a new freckle , darker than usual and larger â the size of a small fingernail â on her ankle
â i do nât have many freckles on my legs , so i noticed it straight away , â says sian , a mother of three and grandmother of five
â my gp told me it was nothing and not to worry about it
at the time , there was a campaign about the importance of early detection of skin cancer
every time i caught sight of the freckle , i would be reminded of how much i wanted to be around for my family
â however , instead of returning to her gp to ask for a hospital appointment , sian , from boston , lincolnshire , turned to her mobile phone for medical advice
â one evening , i searched online for â large freckle â and found my way to a free app that claimed to be a mole evaluator that would identify at - risk moles
i thought : â why not ? what have i got to lose ? â â sian was ahead of the times
apps , short for applications â programs that can be downloaded to run on a smartphone â were few and far between in 2008
one in five health apps claims to support a diagnosis , as with sian âs mole app. one program turns your mobile phone into an electrocardiogram , tracking heart rhythms and emailing the results to a doctor , while others allow patients to record blood pressure or blood sugar
dr dhaliwal , a gp in walsall , west midlands , says three or four of the 40 or so patients he sees a day bring along their phones to provide information from an app. â they might have diabetes or high blood pressure , and we âll use the app to look at an updated graph of their latest tests to see how well they âre managing the condition
and sian âs experience shows why this needs urgent attention
sian later downloaded a health app that said it would be able to identify at - risk moles ( file image ) the app sian had downloaded consisted of several pages of photos of abnormal moles
the app confirmed what the doctor had told me , and i stopped worrying
â two years later , though , in summer 2010 , sian scratched her ankle on her staircase and the freckle started to bleed
a couple of months later , sian âs new gp caught sight of the messy spot , by then double the size , when she made a routine surgery visit
â he said , â that âs rather unsightly , why do nât i remove it ? â he made an appointment for me the same week , and later told me he knew straight away it was a skin cancer
â tests showed sian âs â freckle â was the most dangerous form of skin cancer â a malignant melanoma , which was at a stage where the cancer is liable to spread to the rest of the body
â i owe my life to that doctor and the fact that he noticed the spot while i was in his consulting room , â says sian
â sian says that there may have been a warning on the health app to check with a doctor â â but i did nât see it and , in the circumstances , i do nât think i would have taken any notice â
newer versions of mole - checking apps are more sophisticated , allowing users to photograph a mole and using mathematical formulas to check for skin cancer symptoms , such as asymmetry , irregular borders or varied colour
â this is very dangerous when a lesion can grow deeper and spread to other organs within a matter of months , â says lead researcher and skin cancer specialist dr laura ferris
it was n't until two years later that sian ( pictured ) discovered that the mole was in fact the most dangerous form of skin cancer â reports of actual harm to consumers are still rare , but this could simply mean the potential for harm has nât yet translated into an actual event , â she says
so while the manufacturers of mole detective , an app that claims to be able to â help to detect skin cancer earlier â ( and is downloadable in british ) has been fined by the u.s. federal trade commission for making misleading claims in its advertising , the app is still doing business as normal
â health apps will have to be approved with the same urgency â in days or weeks , rather than months or years , as with new drugs
â certainly , sian has been put off health apps
â obviously , my first gp got it wrong when he told me not to worry about my freckle , â she says
