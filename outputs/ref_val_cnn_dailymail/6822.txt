the human eye is optimised to have good colour vision at day and high sensitivity at night
but until recently it seemed as if the cells in the retina were wired the wrong way round , with light travelling through a mass of neurons before it reaches the light - detecting rod and cone cells
new research presented at a meeting of the american physical society has uncovered a remarkable vision - enhancing function for this puzzling structure
israel institute of technology researchers studied human retinas ( image of an eye interior shown )
they looked at why cells in our retinas are wired the wrong way round
light travels through a mass of neurons before it reaches the ' back '
the research suggests the structure appears to enhance our vision about a century ago , the fine structure of the retina was discovered
before arriving at the cones and rods , light must traverse the full thickness of the retina , with its layers of neurons and cell nuclei
these neurons process the image information and transmit it to the brain , but until recently it has not been clear why these cells lie in front of the cones and rods , not behind them
the human eye can see more that we thought , researchers said in december
it had previously been believed the human eye can not see infrared light , in the same way we ca n't see x-rays and radio waves
an international team of researchers co-led by scientists at washington university school of medicine in st. louis used cells from the retinas of mice and people
by firing powerful lasers that emit pulses of infrared light , the researchers found that when laser light pulses rapidly , light - sensing cells in the retina sometimes get a double hit of infrared energy
this is a long - standing puzzle , even more so since the same structure , of neurons before light detectors , exists in all vertebrates , showing evolutionary stability
in view of this , my colleague amichai labin and i built a model of the retina , and showed that the directional of glial cells helps increase the clarity of human vision.but we also noticed something rather curious : the colours that best passed through the glial cells were green to red , which the eye needs most for daytime vision
before arriving at the cones and rods , light must traverse the full thickness of the retina , with its layers of neurons and cell nuclei like humans , these animals are active during the day and their retinal structure has been well - characterised , which allowed us to simulate their eyes just as we had done for humans
