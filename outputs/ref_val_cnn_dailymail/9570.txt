generations have flocked to the isle of wight to see queen victoria and albert 's magnificent seaside home osborne house
and now the island is gearing up for a wave of interest after the valentine 's day wedding of oscar - nominated benedict cumberbatch and sophie hunter
fit for a king , queen or prince : the george occupies a splendid spot on the shoreline in yarmouth victoria and albert were newlyweds when they fell in love with the island
they designed and built osborne house as a refuge from the stifling royal court , a place to relax with their nine children
not all the royals were so enthused by the island , however
after a couple of nights at osborne house , we set off for the george hotel in the harbour town of yarmouth , driving past 110 - year - old thatched st agnes church and on to the chalk stacks of the needles
keeping it under his hat : benedict cumberbatch enjoyed his last night as a ' free man ' on the isle of wight the wall of henry viii 's fortress gives shelter from the sea winds so you can dine alfresco for most of the year
it might only be a matter of time before the george boasts its first michelin star , which explains why benedict cumberbatch and 140 of his friends spent the night here
