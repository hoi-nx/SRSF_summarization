a fortnight ago , eight - year - old janshir gingerly stepped off a plane at heathrow , his lips blue
rather , it was a combination of rare heart problems that meant blood was not getting around his body properly
ever since birth , congenital heart defects meant janshir was being slowly starved of air , much like a climber marooned at high altitude
since janshir was four , he and his family have had to live with the devastating conflict that has ripped syrian apart , claiming more than 200,000 lives in the process
dodging bombs and bullets , his family first fled their aleppo home just weeks before it was blown to bits by president assad âs jets
unsurprisingly , his health suffered â and his family frequently feared he would die
but today , thanks to a uk charity which brought him here for a life - saving operation , janshir looks like a different boy
like any impatient eight - year - old , he grabs a mobile phone from his father omar â with whom he shares an unmistakable likeness â to show him how it really works
â janshir is a walking miracle , â says emma scanlan , chief executive of chain of hope , which brings children to uk for heart surgery and conducts operating missions abroad
devastation : a man walks with children in jansir 's home town of aleppo after it was hit by bombs last year â most children in the uk with his condition , called tetralogy of fallot , would be treated on the nhs soon after birth
but he has been walking around with this for eight years , been bombed , and had to flee
â curling up on his father âs lap , shy janshir simply says he is â happy â to be recovering after his operation
it involved patching up a huge hole in his heart , widening a crucial vessel taking blood out of the heart , and correcting a narrow valve
the operation , performed without charge by consultant cardiothoracic surgeon kostolny , means his heart now pumps more efficiently
aged three , janshir was flown to france to be fitted with a stent to widen a heart opening , but the family knew that was a temporary fix
as daily life became more difficult , janshir âs health went slowly downhill
homeless : the apartment block jansir and his family were forced to flee before it was blown to bits by president assad âs jets â i was in prison for 25 days , â he recalls
since being set up 20 years ago by pioneering heart surgeon professor sir magdi yacoub , the charity has treated more than 2,000 children
janshir and his family were in syrian when news filtered through that the operation would take place â prompting mr janshir and his wife awash , 31 , to break down in tears
from there janshir and his father travelled to istanbul and caught a flight to london , accompanied by a chain of hope doctor as there were concerns over how janshir would cope on the flight
while janshir âs heart has been fixed , what his life now holds â like countless other syrian children â remains uncertain
