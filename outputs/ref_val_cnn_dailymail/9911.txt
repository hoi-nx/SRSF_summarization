clapper claims failing to extend part of the patriot act , which allows the bulk collection of telephone records , will take away a vital tool in the kit of the intelligence agency
should congress not renew section 215 - due to expire on june 1 - then it must be prepared to shoulder the blame should an ' untoward incident ' take place , the director of national intelligence added during a question and answer session in new york on monday
warning : clapper told a meeting in new york that failure to renew section 215 of the patriot act - which allows mass collection of phone records - would effectively raise the risk of a terrorist incident ' in the end , congress giveth and congress taketh away , ' clapper told the group gathered at the council on foreign relations
' if that tool is taken away from us , and some untoward incident happens which could have been thwarted if we had it , i just hope that everyone involved in that decision assumes responsibility
' section 215 , to me , is like my fire insurance policy , ' he said on monday
