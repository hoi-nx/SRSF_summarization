fernandes thought qpr were not getting enough out of their players
darnell furlong , 19 , was removed at half - time against crystal palace and replaced by a 36 - year - old with flu , having been given a terrible time by yannick bolasie
adel taarabt played a full 90 minutes and looked heavy and poor

darnell furlong ( right ) finds it tough going against glenn murray and was substituted at half - time charlie austin tries to point adel taarabt in the right direction but qpr look to be heading down fighting relegation all season , qpr would have been one of the easiest teams to make
