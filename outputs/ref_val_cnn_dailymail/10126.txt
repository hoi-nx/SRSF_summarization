the chairman of the committee is issuing subpoenas to two secret service agents who witnessed an episode in which two allegedly intoxicated agency officials drove through a secure area at the white house , interrupting a bomb investigation
committee head chaffetz said the agents can shed light not only on the march 4 incident , ' but also on why the secret service appears to be systemically broken and in desperate need of both leadership and reform
' chaffetz had asked secret service director clancy to allow four agents and officers to testify at a hearing last week on the march 4 incident
clancy is pictured here at the hearing the committee is trying to get to the bottom of allegations that two senior agents had been drinking when they drove into the area and nudged a construction barrier with their vehicle as they intruded on the investigation of a suspicious item
chaffetz said the committee 's top priority in its review of the incident is to ensure that the secret service keeps the president and his family safe
the republican lawmaker said homeland security , the parent organization of the secret service , ' requested that information remain secret and be kept from congress and the american people
the only videos that remain from the night in question are those taken of the investigation into the suspected bomb and they do not give a complete picture of what happened after the agents bumped into the barrier police surveillance video shown publicly for the first time last week shows secret service agents in their government vehicle driving through the secured area and nudging a temporary barrier at low speed as it drove toward a checkpoint but homeland security secretary johnson took issue with chaffetz ' complaints about the cooperation given his committee
' i regret that chairman chaffetz and his staff have taken the unprecedented and unnecessary step of subpoenaing two members of the secret service with the responsibility for the protection of the president , his family and the white house complex , ' johnson said in a statement released tuesday night
' chairman chaffetz 's assertion that this department has been " uncooperative " is simply wrong
' johnson said his department offered to let ' a number of secret service personnel , including the two that have been subpoenaed ' to participate in ' transcribed interviews with committee staff , ' but chaffetz and his team rejected that offer
the homeland security head asserted that it is his job , as it is clancy 's , to protect secret service agents from the ' visibility , public glare , and inevitable second - guessing , of a congressional hearing ' and the agency as a whole from having its work compromised
' ' this is why the homeland security 's inspector general is conducting a thorough investigation into the matter , ' the homeland security chief said
