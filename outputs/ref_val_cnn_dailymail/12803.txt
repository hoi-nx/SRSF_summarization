the reported kidnapping of a vallejo , california , woman for ransom this week was nothing but a hoax , police said
vallejo police lt. park went as far as to call it a " wild goose chase " that wasted department resources
denise huskins and her boyfriend quinn , who reported the kidnapping monday , are no longer cooperating with police , park said
officers from the huntington beach police department talked with huskins , 29 , at her father 's apartment complex , department spokeswoman jennifer marlatt told reporters
the case has authorities scratching their heads
huskins initially indicated she would be happy to talk with vallejo police and provide details of what happened , according to park
anxious to talk with her , vallejo police and the fbi sent a jet to huntington beach to fly her back to the bay area
charges are possible in the case , park said , but those will be decided by the district attorney once the investigation is complete
the quickly changing developments left authorities frustrated
quinn called on monday afternoon to report that his girlfriend had been kidnapped several hours earlier from his home
at the time , park said that the case was being treated as a kidnap for ransom
" " it 's like a nightmare that i ca n't wake up from , " her father told the affiliate
on it , a woman who identified herself as denise huskins says she has been abducted
" my name is denise huskins
any advance on us or our associates will create a dangerous situation for denise huskins
he called police to ask that the authorities pick her up and make sure she was safe , he told the newspaper
" i tried to get authorities to pick her up , but they kept asking me a bunch of questions
" authorities are unclear what exactly is going on
police said the requested ransom amount was $ 8,500
