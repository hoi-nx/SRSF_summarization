fellaini says it is ' nonsense ' to suggest that manchester united are turning into a route - one team by taking advantage of his height and power
louis van gaal has benefitted from using the 6ft 4in belgium midfielder in a more advanced role as a target man behind the main striker , and it proved effective once again when manchester united won 2 - 1 at liverpool on sunday to go five points clear of their great rivals in the race for a champions league place
it has also led to criticism of manchester united 's tactics , with even west ham boss sam allardyce labelling van gaal 's team ' long ball united ' after fellaini 's physical presence helped snatch a 1 - 1 draw at upton park last month
fellaini ( challenging emre can on sunday ) has slammed manchester united 's critics louis van gaal 's tactics have been heavily criticised during his debut premier league season but fellaini said : ' it is nonsense that our game system is based on me
our system is based on many good players
' we play a beautiful football
' fellaini came under fire for his performances as a defensive midfielder under moyes last season after following his old everton boss to manchester united in a Â£ 27.5million deal , but can also play as a box - to - box midfielder
' fellaini is at his best when he plays , ' he added
i play , that 's the main thing
at manchester united it 's different because i play in a triangle in midfield
it 's simple : i adjust myself to the system of the coach
' fellaini admits that strict disciplinarian van gaal is exactly the kind of character manchester united needed to knock them into shape after they finished seventh in the premier league under moyes last season
fellaini 's performances are vastly improved under van gaal ( pictured scoring against tottenham this month ) it looked as though fellaini would be one of the first players out of the exit , but van gaal reassured him that he could still have a future at manchester united when he arrived last summer
it took a while , but now i can finally enjoy
' the coach is very strict , but that 's good
fellaini also backed belgium team - mate adnan januzaj ( far right ) to make an impact at old trafford ' if he says something , you should do it
' fellaini had some words of encouragement for his belgian compatriot adnan januzaj who has struggled to make an impact under van gaal
the 20 - year - old 's lack of opportunities has also cost him a place in the belgium squad for the forthcoming games against cyprus and israel
' he has accepted his current situation , ' said fellaini
