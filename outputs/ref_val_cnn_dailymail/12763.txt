new york city public schools will now observe two muslim holidays , officials announced wednesday , making the district -- the nation 's biggest -- one of the few to put islam holy days on its calendar
while it 's not known exactly how many of them are muslim , city council speaker melissa mark-viverito said that almost 1 million of the more than 8 million people in the city 's five boroughs practice islam and a 2009 columbia university study found that roughly 10 % of new york city public school students are muslim
the move is n't a surprise , given bill de blasio 's campaign pledge to alter the school calendar with muslim families in mind
" new york city joins school districts in other states , including new jersey , massachusetts and vermont , that similarly observe muslim holidays , according to a news release from farina 's office
and eid al-fitr and eid al-adha join other religious holidays already on new york city 's public school calendar
in addition to holidays like easter that always fall on a weekend , students already have christian holidays such as good friday and christmas off , as well as the jewish holidays of rosh hashanah and yom kippur
