jonny evans certainly is nât part of one of those cultures
i do nât understand why people do it , but i did think there was some provocation on wednesday night
manchester united defender jonny evans ( left ) and papiss cisse have been charged with spitting during the game jonny evans and papiss cisse were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on wednesday night papiss cisse has accepted a possible seven - game ban while jonny evans has until 6pm on friday , february 6 to respond it looked like papiss cisse ran his studs down jonny evans âs achilles and also made a straight - legged challenge on him
that âs why we saw a transformation in the seemingly mild - mannered jonny evans
he says he was unaware of any spitting incident , but i find that hard to believe
i was once spat at during a game in turkey while i was playing for everton
luis suarez ( top left ) was caught biting branislav ivanovic during a premier league clash in april 2013 the chelsea defender appeals to the referee , with luis suarez later receiving an eight - game ban for biting as for punishment , you could argue it is as bad as , if not worse , than biting â and luis suarez , then of liverpool , received an eight - match ban for biting branislav ivanovic
biting causes physical pain , but that is almost a childish , instinctive reaction
for me , spitting is worse
but i do nât think spitting merits more than a three - match ban
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at papiss cisse
' during the game papiss cisse and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting
firstly to my team - mates and to our supporters , secondly to jonny evans , and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and jonny evans
