not only can mcilroy play golf better than anyone else , he can throw clubs further than anyone else as well
with perhaps the most extraordinary act of frustration we âve seen on a golf course in recent years , the northern irishman left no - one in any doubt as to what he thinks about his current erratic form
after a wild three iron plunged into the water at the par five 8th on friday , the world no 1 hurled his club 60 or 70 yards into the adjacent hazard
world no 1 mcilroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on friday mcilroy swings and releases his club after finding the water during the wgc-cadillac championship the northern irishman watches as his club soars into the air and towards the lake the 25 - year - old 's club makes a splash as it lands in the water on friday afternoon maybe when he âs finished breaking golfing records he will take up the javelin
â it was just heat of the moment stuff and not one of my proudest moments , â admitted mcilroy
i probably would nât have done it here but i knew i did nât need a three iron for the rest of my round
â it was an impressive release from mcilroy , â he said , smiling
â for those who would rather bounce up and down with righteous indignation , here âs what the great american amateur jones said almost 100 years ago : â there are some emotions that simply can not be endured with a golf club in your hands
of more concern for mcilroy followers is what it says about his current state of mind
mcilroy takes his tee shot on the seventh hole of the second round in florida mcilroy missed the cut in the honda classic last week and struggled to an opening 73 at trump national doral asked what will he do for a three iron on saturday , he replied : â there âs one on the way , but i âm not sure if it âs courtesy of nike or a scuba diving team
this was mcenroe-esque rather than mcilroy
with the frustration no longer pent - up , he made a birdie with his second ball at the 8th , before birdieing the 10th and 12th holes
â mcilroy is eight shots off the lead held by american jb holmes , who double - bogeyed his last hole to give everyone a break
alongside mcilroy on one under is lee westwood , who is playing in his 50th wgc â the first man to reach that milestone since the four events to enjoy such status were conceived in 1999 .
