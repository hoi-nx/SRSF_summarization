official figures show the proportion of women who are stay - at - home mothers has dropped by more than a third in the past two decades to a historic low
just over one man in 100 brings up his children full - time
last year chancellor george osborne published plans to encourage up to half a million more women into work by the start of 2016
but at the time critics warned that the government risked â stigmatising â stay - at - home mothers
the figures showed the share of adult women who were stay - at - home mothers dropped below 15 per cent in 1995 and had reached 13.5 per cent when tony blair entered downing street in may 1997
the proportion of women who are stay - at - home mothers briefly dropped below 10 per cent last summer , and stood at 10.1 per cent at the end of 2014 , the report said
but critics accuse successive governments of doing nothing to help those who want to bring up their own children since the decision to tax married couples separately in the late 1980s first left stay - at - home mothers without any support in the tax system
while working mothers have gained heavily from tax credits , increasing maternity leave , and state - subsidised childcare , those who stay at home with their children have no help from the benefits system
helping trend : last year chancellor george osborne published plans to encourage up to half a million more women into work by the start of 2016 laura perrins , of mothers at home matter , said : â it is a reflection of government policy that women have to look for work when many want to look after their children instead
â research for the department for education last year found more than a third of working mothers would like to give up their jobs and stay at home with their children
the percentages mean there are now more than 14million women in work , but only two million are full - time mothers or homemakers .
