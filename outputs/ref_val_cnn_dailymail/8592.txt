roy hodgson picks his three lions squad on thursday for a euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania and a friendly against italy
so what do the likes of danny ings , charlie austin and harry kane have to offer ? danny ings he âs a very astute and clever player , aware of what âs going on around him in midfield and around the penalty box
danny ings looks to go in behind the defender and to face up and receive the ball
burnley striker danny ings ( right ) is a a very astute and clever player with a bit of pace as well charlie austin what people do nât appreciate about charlie austin is that he âs scored 15 goals this season yet because qpr are fighting relegation , he âs not had that many chances
i was with him at qpr and charlie austin knows he has to work on his game outside the box , in his positioning and movement
qpr forward charlie austin has scored 15 premier league goals this season , despite the club 's struggles harry kane harry kane âs probably not quite as good a finisher as charlie austin , but his all - round game is better
it âs unlikely harry kane will get much game time against lithuania and italy so he will probably go back to the u21s for the summer tournament
harry kane is the premier league 's form man - winning the january and february player of the month award verdict i do nât think three lions have had this amount of players to choose from up front since i was manager
