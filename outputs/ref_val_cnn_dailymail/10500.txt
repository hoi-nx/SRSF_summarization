under cross-examination from robin allen qc , mrs karen mcarthur told the court she had been a born - again christian since the age of seven and ' sought to please god ' in how she led her life
she claimed she only took the order from mr gareth lee in order to avoid a confrontation
' i did not want to embarrass him or have a confrontation in the bakery , ' mrs karen mcarthur told the court
robin allen qc , representing mr gareth lee , said the baker 's objection on religious grounds was unlawful

mr allen said that , over the next few days , mrs karen mcarthur expressed concern about the requested cake design with her daughter - in - law , amy , and the matter was then discussed with her son , daniel

a lawyer for ashers said the refusal had been down to the content of the cake and was not connected to any characteristic of the customer
david scoffield qc said : ' the defendants neither knew nor cared about mr gareth lee 's sexual orientation or his religious beliefs , if any , or his political opinions
he said they talked about how they could ' stand before god ' by making a cake promoting gay marriage
even though he was unaware of the ' ins and outs ' of equality legislation , mr mcarthur said he could not compromise his deeply held christian beliefs opposing gay marriage
he said : ' the reason for the decision was that , as christian , we just did not feel that putting the message on a cake - gay marriage is clearly in contradiction of the bible
' we felt as christian we could not put that message on a cake
' he told the court : ' we knew the decision in our conscience as christian was one that we had to make
