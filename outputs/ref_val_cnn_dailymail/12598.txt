it 's a striking image : a new baby cradled in the u.s. flag , held by a navy sailor whose face we ca n't see
but is it a patriotic photograph or desecration of the u.s. flag ? navy veteran hicks , a virginia beach photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents , shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her facebook page
" not everyone agreed with hicks , herself a navy wife whose husband is deployed
a facebook page titled " you call yourself a photographer ? " posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture
" the threatening private messages , which she has reported to facebook , saddened her
most people posting to the critical facebook page disagree with the criticism of the picture
