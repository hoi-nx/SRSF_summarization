ashley had her energy adjusted by healer to the stars paul lennard ashley writes a weekly column on femail online about the joys and stress of motherhood for the career girl who may have come a bit late to the party , but is happy to be here just the same
this week she reveals how it feels to be ' healed ' by hands from la la land ... as an avid celebrity watcher i can tell you the buzz around energy healing in hollywood these days is deafening
apparently they are the new shrinks , psychics and therapists all in one

recently w magazine hailed energy healers as the â new shrinks â amongst the a-list , and more and more celebrities have been experimenting with energy work to help with everything from pain , insomnia , weight loss , heartbreak , grief , anxiety , and depression
after all , who ca nât use a little bit of an â energy adjustment â now and again ? i went to see paul lennard , who is the healer of choice for footballers , royalty and yes , dogs
meeting paul lennard , i immediately felt at ease ; at the same time there âs an intensity behind those eyes
the treatment itself is a mix of craniosacral therapy , psychic insights and chi nei tsang - an ancient taoist abdominal massage that releases blocked energy
as i lay fully clothed on a massage table , paul lennard scanned my body without touching it , and occasionally pressed a point which was excruciating
gwyneth paltrow is a fan of energy ' adjustments ' and in hollywood energy healers are the ' new shrinks ' as he worked , i felt so relaxed it was ridiculous
i felt weightless , like i âd just had an intense , hours long massage â without being touched
as i left i felt positive , relaxed and re-energised
