the Â£ 4,800 operation was , she says , the ultimate 50th birthday treat to herself
explaining her decision she said : â a tummy tuck was something i had thought about but the time never seemed right
â it was a lot of money to spend on a birthday treat but i felt i deserved it , and because i had divorced and downsized , for the first time in my life i had the money available
â after giving birth to ben , now 34 , candice , 28 , and nicholas , 27 , by caesarean , she had always been unhappy with the scar
then aged 41 she underwent a hysterectomy and the additional scarring meant her tummy â never recovered
â she explains : â i was left with an apron of saggy skin that i absolutely hated
â so she began researching tummy tucks on line and booked a consultation with transform : ' i was incredibly nervous but the surgeon put me at ease by explaining in great detail how he would perform the operation

in march 2012 simone underwent the procedure â allowing 12 weeks recovery time ahead of her big day
