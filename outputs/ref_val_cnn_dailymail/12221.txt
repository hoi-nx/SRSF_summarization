hong kong australia 's transport safety chief has always described himself as a pessimist
but martin dolan , chief commissioner of the atsb , says that as search teams scour the depths of the indian ocean for any sign of malaysia airlines flight 370 , he is confident they will find the plane , if the aircraft is in the areas where they are looking
" if anything , i 'm slightly more optimistic than six months ago , because we have more confidence in the data , and we have proven the search equipment and techniques work to the necessary standards , " martin dolan said
but as the first anniversary of malaysia airlines flight 370 's disappearance approaches , with no trace of the missing plane found , not everyone shares his outlook
that includes many of the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew on board , who say not a single day goes by without wondering what happened to their loved ones
and for many , the decision in late january by malaysia to officially declare malaysia airlines flight 370 an accident , enabling the insurance payout process to begin in accordance with international protocol , was painfully premature
" how can they say that , when there is no proof that the plane has crashed ? " asked wen wang cheng , whose son wen was one of 153 china nationals on board
what families have been told , they say , simply is n't good enough
but when families submitted a letter to malaysia airlines asking for authorities to explain the declaration and status of the investigation , a written response from the company 's ceo revealed little that had n't already been said
at 12:41 a.m. local time on march 8 , 2014 , malaysia airlines flight 370 took off from kuala lumpur international airport , en route to beijing
the search area widened , then shifted off the coast of australia , when it was determined through careful analysis of a series of messages or " handshakes " between the plane and an inmarsat telecommunications satellite , that malaysia airlines flight 370 eventually turned south , and flew for hours into the indian ocean
roughly a week 's sail from the coast of australia , ships with specialists and equipment capable of searching depths that regularly exceed 4,000 meters ( 13,123 feet ) , work around the clock , methodically ticking off sections of sea floor
in early february a new ship , the fugro supporter , joined the search carrying the hugin 4500 , a programmable unmanned submarine , now scanning areas that other equipment could n't safely cover , including steep mountain slopes
" i asked specifically to come on this job , because it 's a very exciting opportunity to do something that will potentially help a lot of people , " james hancock , a surveyor who usually works in the oil industry in the north sea , told cnn 's anna coren , as he prepared to embark on a trip on the fugro discovery that could last up to six weeks
martin dolan is careful to point out search efforts are meeting or exceeding expectations , dismissing concerns over stormy weather or delays in installing equipment as " part of the deal
his latest theory contends that investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the inmarsat satellite data , and that malaysia airlines flight 370 may have instead flown north toward kazakhstan
" but exner , an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry , says the data " accurately and unambiguously " shows malaysia airlines flight 370 went down near the 7th arc
" the atsb 's martin dolan cautioned that search teams have placed equal priority on all areas within the 60,000 square kilometer search zone
if search teams succeed in locating the wreckage of malaysia airlines flight 370 , australia , which has been leading the search at malaysia 's request , will also lead salvage and recovery efforts , according to the atsb chief commissioner
but malaysia , australia , and china , which had the majority of the passengers on board the flight , have not yet made a decision on whether a recovery will occur , martin dolan said
" malaysia also plans to release an interim statement detailing the progress of the investigation into malaysia airlines flight 370 around march 8 -- though some experts believe it will not contain any information investigators do not already have
aviation experts say there is a key reason the search should continue until malaysia airlines flight 370 is found
" for the families of the 239 passengers and crew on board , who have had nothing but hope and prayers to carry them through the past year , it 's about finding answers
" the search for malaysia airlines flight 370 continues
