it has been one of the most frustrating paradoxes of modern science - that light exists both as a wave and particle at the same time but can never be seen in both states simultaneously
albert einstein was the first person to describe this apparent dual state of light in 1905 in an attempt to explain some of the apparently contradictory behaviour it displays
yet when scientists attempt to observe these states , it has only ever been able to see light behave as photon particle or as an electromagnetic wave
the bottom ' slice ' of the image shows the particles , while the top image shows light as a wave but now researchers based at the swiss federal institute of technology in lausanne ( epfl ) , have captured the first ever snapshot of light behaving as both a wave and particle
the work shows that albert einstein was right when he proposed that electromagnetic radiation could behave as both a wave and a particle at the same time
the technique for capturing the image could be used to help open up new areas of superfast computers that exploit the quantum states of materials
in a paper published in the journal nature communications , the research team conducted an experiment and then used electrons to image the light
dr carbone said that the resulting image produces a fingerprint of the wave - nature of light while also simultaneously demonstrating that it is a particle too
the electrons pass close to the standing wave of light , they hit the photons it contains , again affecting the resulting image .
