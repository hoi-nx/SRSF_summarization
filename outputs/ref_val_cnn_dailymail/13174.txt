the beauty of afghan -- a country blemished by wars , upheaval and the inhumane treatment of women by extremists -- has almost been forgotten by the world , and by many afghan themselves
in the last few decades , little attention has been paid to the other afghan : the sweet melodies , the kind people , and the beautiful land full of ancient wisdom and intersecting traditions
generations of afghan have had their homes surrounded by battles and their lives punctuated by fear
one out of every four refugees worldwide is afghan , according to the united nations
recently , i was watching an engrossing reality tv show featuring singers when a friend peered over my shoulder and asked about the program
i explained that it was " afghan star , " afghan 's answer to " american idol
afghan has a rich tradition of music , poetry , and songs that have influenced its neighbors and any region of the world exposed to the silk road
i started watching " afghan star " last year after hearing about contestant dawood pazhman from afghan 's remote northeastern province of badakhshan , who traveled 16 hours ( sometime on foot ) to kabul to audition for the show
as i watched every show , the beacon of hope of a new afghan became clear to me
this is the new afghan -- the struggles around poverty , religion and resilience are ever - present , but hope shines through in ways that make everyday life brighter
" afghan star " is a source of pride , happiness and escape for many afghan
when you talk to any afghan around the world , they know all about the contestants and the judges
this grounded attitude is meaningful because each one of the judges is a living legend in afghan -- superstars who also have their own war stories to tell
this season , for international women 's day , the show celebrated afghan women
the show ended with a dedication to afghan poetess anjuman
wearing an afghan flag around her shoulders , her hair uncovered , she brought anjuman 's words to life : " i am not that weak willow tree that trembles with the wind
" with three contestants left , the show will end friday night , appropriately on nawruz , the perisan new year celebrated in afghan , tajikistan and iran
though panj shanbe was my initial reason for watching the show , i will be happy no matter which contestant becomes the " afghan star
those living as refugees and those living abroad by choice , away from the homeland , get a taste of the music and culture of their birth country , sparking renewed belief in the new afghan
and people in afghan are given glimpses of what the new afghan can look like -- a vision of young men and women free from war , who can pursue their dreams .
