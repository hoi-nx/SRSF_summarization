theresa may has shelved a decision on whether water cannon can be used on the streets of uk until after the election , in a major snub to boris johnson
mrs may has refused to sign off the controversial riot control machines despite pressure from the london mayor , who last year spent Â£ 220,000 buying three cannon for use in public order emergencies
boris johnson spent Â£ 220,000 last year buying three water cannon to use in public emergencies , such as the london riots , but theresa may has today refused to approve their use ( file image ) soon after buying the three germany machines last year , mr boris johnson said it was â highly likely â the home secretary would sign them off , adding : â my view is we need to get on and equip the police with the water cannon they need , or might need
mrs may 's home office has been locked in a row with the london mayor over the decision to buy the machines and whether they fit with uk policing last night city hall sources insisted mr boris johnson had known about the timetable for some time and was â very relaxed â about the delay
he said : â independent polling shows that the majority of londoners support the police having water cannon at their disposal for use in exceptional circumstances
water cannon have been used in northern ireland to quell public order incidents , but never on the uk mainland
last summer the prime minister âs spokesman also endorsed their use , saying the prime minister â supports â the police âs application for water cannon
when mr boris johnson purchased the machines he said it was ' highly likely ' the home secretary would sign off on their use , a political gamble that seems to have backfired mr boris johnson has previously urged police to get ' medieval ' on rioters , and said officers must never again be left powerless in the face of overwhelming violence like that seen during the riots
police argue water cannon would be useful in a static confrontation where there is a need to create space between police lines and violent crowds
