â at least i got to see the black president , â reads sarah âs page in mr andrew george âs new book , right before i die
mr andrew george , who lives in los angeles , wanted to explore perspective and what people value in their final moments , saying he admired the â brutal honesty â displayed in his subjects â testimonies
instead , as well as the haunting pictures , he gathered stories from their lives , vignettes of experience and fragments of how they would advise others
here , in an extract from his book , he shares some of the photographs and accompanying words ... sarah , in her hospital bed
god , it 's precious
life is definitely not infinite
things are not fair or unfair , it âs just the way life is
dust to dust ... i think the end of the world reaches you when you die â renã© said his biggest regret is not being in touch with his daughter in el salvador
he said : â i did nât give her the right to be part of my life
â he adds that there is â no such thing as happiness in life â
the meaning of life is the search for it â joe wrote just these brief words to accompany his photo
no one could ask for more than that ' sally said she was taking care of her sick brothers and sisters when she developed cancer

you do nât even know what you âre doing and you âre making someone happy â kim said people should take the opportunity to tell others how they feel
i had never been with a man before and from day one throughout all six years of that marriage i had been hit ... to the point where i had to go to work with bruises all over my body , raped many , many times and everything else
i went on with my life , i went to school and i never asked for child support or anything
as far as i know , i âve accomplished what i âve had to accomplish in my life â sara said being loved makes people offer love to others
she said : ' i think growing up with love makes people give love back
i think that âs what i âll be remembered for when i pass on â the exhibition , right before i die , is being held at the musea brugge , belgium , until 28th june 2015 .
