if ignorance is bliss , then america must be a pleasure junkie , because we sure are chasing that dragon
the most recent example : a school in ny sought to celebrate " national foreign language week " by having the pledge of allegiance read in a different language every day
you get one guess as to what happened when it was arabic day
complaints came in from both jewish parents and people who had lost family in afghanistan , according to the school superintendent
what language do they speak in afghanistan ? not arabic
the main languages are dari and pashto
perhaps this complaint illustrates why we need more education , not less
earlier this year in florida , parents were up in arms because a school taught about islam in a history class
because of the outcry , pine bush students will now not hear the pledge in italian , spanish , japanese , or french , as planned
what is worse is that the school district felt that it had to apologize
the district 's statement was a surrender to ignorance
at least they do in modern - day america education
last year , smith college 's president apologized and there was a student outcry because students had " hurt feelings " when alumna wendy kaminer argued at a panel discussion moderated by the college president against using the euphemism " the n - word " in historical discussions
when the cry of " i 'm offended " can shut down debate over philosophies , or learning about other cultures , or learning other languages , then what have our educational institutions become ? how much further will this enforced ignorance and orthodoxy need to go before education is just another word that comes untethered from its meaning ? and the very inspiration for this column , a debate over the pledge of allegiance , makes the problem even more glaring
a rote and thought - free - chant of mindless allegiance ca n't even be expressed in a different language ? is america really so fragile that if a citizen proclaims " fidelit√É agli stati uniti " that it means anything less because it is in italian ? perhaps this highlights more than the fact that we should step away from the brink of ignorance while we can
whether we are talking about learning to say the pledge in japanese , or hearing a speaker who challenges our beliefs , that is what education is about , not enforced ignorance .
