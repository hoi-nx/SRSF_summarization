the original suspect in the murder of an america 's next top model contestant and three others was scheduled to be ejected from the us in 2012 but was granted deferred deportation under president obama âs amnesty policy , it was revealed today
rangel , 19 , was arrested last month in connection to a triple - homicide in charlotte , north carolina , that claimed the lives of aspiring model puhar , 19 , her 23 - year - old boyfriend jonathan alvarado , and 21 - year - old garcia
his alleged accomplice , 19 - year - old lopez , was taken into custody thursday and jailed on three counts of first - degree murder
records indicate rangel , an undocumented immigrant from mexico , was placed in the removal process by ice after being charged with drug violations in march 2012
on december 18 , 2012 , however , removal proceedings were dismissed because rangel was approved for deferred action under the deferred action for childhood arrivals policy , despite his suspected affiliation with a street gang , of which ice was allegedly aware
' accomplice ' : second suspect david lopez , 19 , charged with three counts of first - degree murder in deaths of puhar , jonathan alvarado and garcia - garcia â this raises serious concerns about uscis âs review and approval of other deferred action for childhood arrivals applicants and points to potential vulnerabilities in the system â senators grassley and tillis wrote in a letter sent in february to the homeland security department requesting information about rangel âs status
under the amnesty program , which was enacted by president obama 's executive action , more than 675,000 young immigrants since august 2012 have been granted a work permit and reprieve from deportation
republicans have long decried obama 's executive immigration as a form of backdoor amnesty that circumvents congress
on thursday , a second suspect , lopez , 19 , was charged with killing the former america 's next top model contestant , her boyfriend and another man , in what police were calling a drug - related attack
in late february , investigators arrested 19 - year - old rangel and charged him with the slayings , which have been described as drug - related
