the attempts by some in the gop to undermine president obama 's iranian policy certainly seem extraordinary
first , the gop leadership invited benjamin netanyahu to speak to congress without consulting the white house , and he duly warned against softening of the west 's line on iranian
now , 47 senators have written an open letter to the iranian regime to advise that any deal agreed to with obama could be reversed after the 2016 presidential election
as washington post journalist vincent bzdek notes in his book " the kennedy legacy , " this occurred close to a u.s. presidential election , and some conservatives have interpreted it as an act of treason -- perhaps even a breach of the logan act , which forbids private citizens from engaging in diplomacy with the goal of changing foreign policy
on more than one occasion , kennedy politicized foreign policy while in the senate
according to an account in politico , anna chennault , a gop activist , was given a message to pass onto the south vietnamese government : if they undermined the peace talks by being stubborn , the liberal democrats would lose the election and nixon as the next president would offer them better terms
the extreme lengths that kennedy and nixon went to behind the scenes underlines the point that foreign policy has always been a deeply partisan matter that can often end in a challenge to executive authority
it 's true that the spirit of the constitution indicates that the country is expected to speak with one voice on foreign policy through the president
that bill clinton 's 1994 nuclear deal with north korea was criticized by both gop and liberal democrats
as damian paletta writes , foreign policy is generally conducted quietly by the white house through executive agreements that pass without comment
but the idea that foreign policy is beyond partisanship is naÃ¯ve , and disagreements have gone public when the political conditions are appropriate
the particular matter of the iranian talks is sensitive for the gop because it involves the electoral holy trinity of obama , israel and the presidential primaries
