if the 20th century was the century of the skyscraper , then the 21st century is shaping up as the century of the " plyscaper
" despite its historical reputation for great city fires -- london in 1666 , the great chicago fire of 1871 and san francisco in 1906 -- wood is making a comeback as a construction material
next year in vienna , construction will begin on a 275 - foot building made almost entirely of wood , while stockholm may build a 34 - story wooden apartment by 2023
with faster construction times and a softer environmental impact , could the building material of the past be the future of construction ? vancouver - based architect green says the momentum is gaining as new engineered woods allow for greater strength and heights in buildings
" he said new developments in engineered woods -- small wood components that are glued together to make large panels for building -- are a game - changer for construction
one great bonus of the material is the speed of construction ; panels can be made to measure in the factory complete with openings , windows and doors
while the main advantages of working in wood are manifold -- it 's flexible , robust and easily worked -- green says wood may be the only material to address the growing problems of urbanization
" wood has not been an urban material so we looked at how it could be a contributor to urban environments , " he said
concrete accounts for about 6 - 8 % of man 's greenhouse gas emissions , whereas wood stores carbon dioxide and gives us a vehicle to create carbon - neutral buildings
" there is no other building material that is grown by the sun , " he said
concerns over fire and inherent problems with its acoustic qualities ( apartments need additional acoustic measures to keep noise from traveling ) have meant that the construction establishment has been slow to come to the party
" the main factor is that everyone wants to build higher and higher buildings
even so , the industry remains largely skeptical of a process that -- while having obvious advantages in terms of speed -- is still on par with steel and concrete construction in terms of cost
" the culture of building and the culture of developing buildings is very conservative , " he said
" ultimately , buildings of the future are likely to be a mixture of wooden components and concrete and steel ; combining the stability of concrete with the flexibility and speed of wood
leading timber specialist at the engineering group arup , lawrence , said that shear walls -- the core of tall buildings which provide stability against the lateral force of the wind or seismic activity -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel
however , the real savings from wood come when all the cost elements of making a tall building are taken into account
" clients are missing a trick with wood , " he said , adding that dollar - for - dollar as a pure construction material wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete
" you will save on the program because it 's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially , if you 're making an office building , you can leave a lot of the wood exposed , saving on the cost and time of installing finishes
