we have been here before , of course â a breathless liverpool win over manchester city secured by the brilliant right foot of philippe coutinho
last season , despite their slaying of manchester city at anfield , they could not secure the premier league title and it remains to be seen if this tilt at the top four ends more happily
philippe coutinho lets fly from range to score the winning goal for liverpool as they continued their rich vein of form philippe coutinho , along with the manchester city defence , watch on as the brazilian 's shot arrows towards the manchester city net hart is left helpless as philippe coutinho 's effort rises above his outstretched hand and nestles in the back of the keeper 's net philippe coutinho leads the celebrations as skrtel and allen chase after him after his stunning winning strike philippe coutinho is lost among a heap of his liverpool team - mates as the anfield side celebrate the brazilian 's winner against manchester city liverpool ( 3 - 4 - 3 ) : simon mignolet 6.5 , can 7 , skrtel 7 , lovren 6.5 , lazar markovic 6.5 ( daniel sturridge 76 ) , jordan henderson 8.5 , allen 8.5 , alberto moreno 6.5 ( yaya toure 82 ) , philippe coutinho 9.5 , sterling 7.5 , lallana 8 subs not used : lambert , borini , balotelli , williams , ward

no doubt feeling thursday night âs europa league exit in their minds and legs , rodgers â team faced a fresher manchester city side hungry to close the gap on chelsea at the top
for manchester city , questions remain
that may be overstating it but manchester city continue to be undone the same way in too many big games
the game had fallen into a fallow period with 15 minutes to go
manchester city had started the brighter of the sides and could have taken the lead when yaya toure chipped a cute ball over the top for zabaleta to volley over
jordan henderson continues to impress in the liverpool midfield and he curled home the opening goal against manchester city jordan henderson 's shot flies towards manchester city goalkeeper hart who attempts to position himself to make the save hart attempts to fling his right hand across his body to stop the shot but must realise jordan henderson 's effort will evade his grasp jordan henderson is mobbed by his liverpool team - mates and anfield boss rodgers after his effort beat hart all ends up ten minutes in , though , liverpool suddenly clicked and philippe coutinho was at the heart of it
fernandinho sold kompany short with a pass in midfield and when the belgian could not catch philippe coutinho , the ball was funnelled forwards to jordan henderson
the england man moved the ball out of his feet and curled it past hart with his right instep from 20 yards
for a while , liverpool were at their waspish best and , as a result , manchester city rocked
liverpool were not in front for long as edin dzeko finished off a delightful team passing move to bring parity to the anfield clash edin dzeko celebrates his strike with his team - mates who played an instrumental part in the build up to manchester city 's equaliser aguero fires in a shot under pressure from liverpool midfielder lallana as both sides looked to edge in front sergio aguero did race through to strike a post but at the other end alberto moreno wasted one chance and sterling â once again playing as a centre forward â ran on to a philippe coutinho pass to mug toure and slide a cross-shot wide
at 1 - 0 , liverpool were in the ascendancy
manchester city , though , looked dangerous when they moved forwards and after philippe coutinho had erred for once by presenting a clearance to zabaleta in the 26th minute , the visitors moved through the gears , enabling edin dzeko to run on to aguero âs neat through pass and beat simon mignolet with his right foot
philippe coutinho was liverpool âs go - to man throughout while , for manchester city , silva was equally dangerous
beyond philippe coutinho âs goal , manchester city did raise themselves a little
liverpool boss rodgers ca n't hide his joy at the final whistle as liverpool edged out manchester city to ignite their top - four hopes as rodgers celebrates liverpool 's victory , manchester city boss manuel pellegrini ( right ) looks dejected as his side 's title hopes take a hit hart , beaten by two cracking strikes , looks dejected ( left ) and is consoled by his england team - mate and liverpool midfielder jordan henderson lallana fires a shot across hart but the in - form midfielder ca n't find the target from a narrow angle balotelli and daniel sturridge warm up on the sidelines as they watched their side take on manchester city balotelli looks less than happy as he sits among the liverpool substitutes during his side 's victory at anfield yaya toure and his brother kolo played against each other for the first time when the latter came on for liverpool in the second half
