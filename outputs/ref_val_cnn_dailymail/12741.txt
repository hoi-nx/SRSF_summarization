but when the ceo of starbucks announced a plan he hoped would ease racial tensions , the response was immediate outrage ! this latest controversy started monday when starbucks ceo howard schultz unveiled a new initiative in which starbucks baristas would write the words " race together " on coffee cups to help spark a dialogue on race
as schultz correctly stated when discussing the genesis for " race together , " " if we just keep going about our business ... and ignoring this ( racial issue ) , then i think we are , in a sense , part of the problem
first , i live in new yorkers , where new yorkers barely have the patience to wait for a cup of plain old coffee to be poured let alone stand in line longer while people engage in a nuanced discourse on race
next thing you know , starbucks will have to coin politically correct terms for " black " coffee
and as a practical matter , only 40 % of starbucks employees are minorities
consequently , in most starbucks , the conversation about racial tolerance will between be between two white people
in fact , a recent cnn / orc poll found 40 % of americans believe racial relations have become worse during the six years barack obama has been in the white house
it 's strikingly obvious that if we are going to improve this situation , we need to have a candid and brutally honest discussion about the underlying factors contributing to racism , the lack of empathy for people of other races , etc. and that 's simply what starbucks ' " race together " stated goal is : " to stimulate conversation , compassion and positive action regarding race in americans
" starbucks ' senior vice president of communications , corey dubrowa , deleted his twitter account monday after " feeling personally attacked in a cascade of negativity " and being " overwhelmed by the volume and tenor of the discussion " in response to " race together
" dubrowa 's reaction may just be a teachable moment on discussing race
the initial response by some , like dubrowa , may be to shut down when racial discussions become uncomfortable
the question is how can we begin that talk about race that our nation desperately needs to have ? true , the line at starbucks might not be the best place
