sharing a platform : clegg and sir richard branson yesterday clegg ignited a huge controversy last night by claiming that all drug users should be treated as â victims â
the liberal democrat leader said they should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances â even if they they are caught with â harder â drugs such as heroin or crack cocaine
announcing his party âs new drugs policy yesterday , mr clegg said : â we should nât be treating the criminal â mr bigs â the same as the users
â but his comments were dismissed by the head of the chatham house think tank robin niblett , who said : â are all users victims or is there a large proportion of people who enjoy drugs and take them recreationally ? it is a question of demand , rather than people who need to be treated for an addiction
â other experts have also questioned whether it is right to label all drug users as victims
â the liberal democrat â new policy would end prosecutions for people caught with small amounts of drugs for â personal use â
mr clegg said the policy would be included in the liberal democrat manifesto
the liberal democrat leader said drug users should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances â even if they they are caught with â harder â drugs such as heroin or crack cocaine mr clegg ( bottom left ) is facing opposition to his plan from david cameron ( pictured at pm 's questions this afternoon ) , who claims decriminalising drugs would increase their use with neither labour nor the tories backing decriminalisation , it is unlikely to become government policy even if the liberal democrat remain in power after the election
yesterday 's announcement follows a controversial â research â project ordered by lib dem home office ministers , which used taxpayers â money to study drugs policy around the world
the liberal democrat seized on parts of the report suggesting decriminalisation in countries like portugal cut the health damage caused by drugs
mr clegg received a public endorsement yesterday from sir richard branson , who suggested that smoking skunk is safe
last night , mr clegg also insisted that the so - called â war on drugs â was â not working â , although he was later forced to concede that official figures show drug use has been falling in britain for years
downing street rejected mr clegg âs analysis and said it was not supported by david cameron
