the brownsville , texas federal judge who blocked president obama 's executive action on immigration has ordered the justice department to answer allegations that the government misled him about part of the plan
us district judge hanen on monday denied the obama administration 's request to lift a time - out he enforced on feb. 16 , when he ruled that a lawsuit filed by 26 states might succeed
hot seat : president obama , seen tuesday signing the ' student aid bill of rights ' law in the oval office , faces the possibility that his immigration plans will die in federal court here comes the judge : federal jurist hanen is calling the obama administration on the carpet about the president 's immigration plan ' the court finds that the government 's failure to secure the border has exacerbated illegal immigration into this country , ' hanen ruled in february , saying that states were being financially ' drained by the constant influx of illegal immigrants
last week the government 's lawyers admitted in a paper filing that the obama administration had already granted three - year deportation reprieves to 100,000 people , and granted them work permits , as part of the 2012 daca ( daca ) program
that program 's guidelines provided only for two - year reprieves , unlike obama 's latest executive actions
the president 's more recent attempt to mainstream illegal immigrants , announced in november , will cover 5 million or more people and will ultimately go into force unless the judiciary blocks it
the group of 26 states suing to stop obama 's immigration plan argue in their legal complaint that the government falsely claimed it had n't implemented any part of the november plan before hanen blocked it
hanen 's injunction had no effect on the daca program , but his demand for a new hearing suggest he 's looking at that program in addition to obama 's more recent executive actions , which concern illegal immigrant parents of us citizens born in the us , and other permanent residents who have been in the country for years
