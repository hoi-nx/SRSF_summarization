this was the front cab of an original monorail train that transported millions of visitors throughout walt disney world in the 1970s and 1980s
nowak and his wife are disney fanatics who honeymooned at walt disney world and once visited all the disney parks in the world ( minus paris ) in a month
nowak listed the item last week on ebay for $ 260,000 with a starting bid of $ 169,000
the listing itself was pulled from ebay on sunday
" the listing provided some insight into what nowak might have had in mind for the cab
" some people have train cars in their back yard , imagine your own monorail guest room , or man cave
mount it on a bus chassis and drive it around ! ! turn it into your kids ' ultimate clubhouse , " the description on the ebay page read
" the listing said the vehicle is available for viewing in tampa , where nowak left it with a friend after buying it from a seller in georgia via ebay last year
the listing promised free shipping , but nowak is not sure that he 's ready to part with the item
