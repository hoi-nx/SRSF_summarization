if you were the lucky recipient of a bunch of fragrant roses this valentine 's day , it 's likely that they came from kenya
the country is the third largest exporter of cut flowers in the world , accounting for around 35 % of all sales in the eu
famed for being long - lasting , kenya 's roses , carnations and summer flowers are also popular in russia and the u.s. where last week several growers showcased their blooms at the world floral expo in los angeles
the event is one of the industry 's largest and gathers over 80 exhibitors from across the world , with several ethiopian growers also representing the african continent alongside kenya
kenya also has excellent transport links to europe , and from there , the rest of the world through nairobi airport , which has a terminal dedicated specially to the transport of flowers and vegetables
big business horticulture has been one of the top foreign exchange earners for kenya , and the flower industry alone raked in around $ 600m last year , exporting 124,858 tonnes valued at around $ 507m in 2013
while europe remains the biggest destination for kenya flowers due to its relative geographic proximity and good transport links , this has left producers vulnerable to turmoil on the continent , such as the recent recession
kenya exports also suffered when in october of last year the eu imposed import taxes on cut flowers from the country , but the levy was lifted on christmas day allowing kenya producers to storm valentine 's day sales
kenya growers are now lending their floral expertise to neighboring rwanda by partnering with the country 's government to create a 35 hectare flower park 60 kilometers from rwanda 's capital kigali
