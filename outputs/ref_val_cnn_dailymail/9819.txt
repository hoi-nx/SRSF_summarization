these striking pictures have been selected as the best scientific images of the year in the wellcome image 2015
among the winners are the bulging eye of a greenfly magnified through an electron microscope and the papillae that create the rough surface of a cat 's tongue
this image of a greenfly 's eye ( left ) shows the thousands of lenses pointing in all directions on its surface while the aurora - like image of a cross-section of a mouse brain reveals the complex network of neurons at different depths , with red being the nearest and green the furthest away others show the strange beauty of a goat 's stomach and the neuron connections inside a mouse brain lit up like a multi-coloured aurora
' it 's not just about imaging the very small either , it 's about understanding life , death , sex and disease : the cornerstones of drama and art. ' once again , the wellcome image celebrate all of this and more with this year âs incredible range of winning images
' a scanning electron microscope allowed scientists to reveal the long snout of a boll weevil ( left ) , while the dissected uterus of a new forest pony reveals its foal still in the placenta and preserved in perspex ( centre ) and the strange beauty inside a goat 's second stomach ( right ) the super-resolution micrograph of a natural killer cell ( left ) in the immune system shows it examining a second darker and rounder cell for signs of disease while the multicoloured image ( right ) is a map of a mouse 's nervous system showing how signals are passed between nerves in total there are 20 images that have been selected as winners in the awards by a panel of nine judges
the image on the left shows an interactive multi-sensory unit that vibrates , bubbles and lights up to distract and comfort anxious children receiving treatment in hospital while the image on the right reveals bundles of nerve fibres inside a healthy adult living human brain are revealed using magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) to virtually slice the brain from front to back , with the front of the head on the left side of the image the image on the left shows a map of a mouse kidney as it breaks down food to make energy while the tiny bumps on the image on the right are the papillae - tiny bumps - that make a cats tongue feel rough seen using a light microscope in a slide made by victorian scientists the yellow neuron is able to sense vibrations while messages entering and leaving neurons at synapses are shown as blue and red circles
another of the images shows the curved spine of a 79 - year - old woman suffering from kyphosis , or dowagers back , taken by mark bartley at addenbrookes hospital in cambridge
the picture on the left shows the badly curved spine of a 79 - year - old woman at addenbrooks hospital in cambridge while the picture on the right shows a 3d printed set of human lungs inside the ribcage viewed from the back with the bones of the spine ( vertebrae ) visible in the centre the close up view of the greenfly eye shows in detail the thousands of tiny lenses facing in different on its surface that enable the insect to see very fast movements
' the picture on the right shows a scanning electron micrograph of a single brain cell while on the right there is a tiny parasitoid wasp called wallaceaphytis kikiae viewed from above
