being compared to a household utensil is probably not every premier league footballer âs idea of a compliment , but when sherwood called aston villa âs hoover he meant it with affection kim and aggie would appreciate
roy hodgson is another who recognises the need for an instrument in his england machine capable of covering large ground to suck up danger
it is why roy hodgson handed delph his international debut last august and is liable to pick the 25 - year - old again
delph has been likened to a hoover vacuum cleaner his ability to suck up balls by sherwood delph covers a huge amount of ground in midfield and has been brilliant in aston villa 's recent resurgence sherwood has helped to turn aston villa - and particularly delph - around and improve their form of late roy hodgson names his squad for the forthcoming matches against lithuania and italy on thursday and has been given reason of late to select delph
as aston villa âs season drifted into the mire under paul lambert , delph âs form was a concern
sherwood 's arrival at the club in place of paul lambert has changed delph from a concern to an asset delph scored his first goal of the season in aston villa 's fa cup quarter - final win over west brom delph 's sweet strike got one over aston villa 's local rivals in a high - intensity game that suited the midfielder there were reasons aston villa fans mobbed him so feverishly during the west brom pitch invasion : a goal , a combative performance , a freshly - inked contract
delph is a willing runner â hitting an average 10.59km per game , second only to ashley westwood in the squad â but has undoubtedly benefitted from sherwood âs front foot policy
delph could end up back in roy hodgson 's england squad after his recent resurgence in form touch maps supplied by opta illustrate the point
in the 2 - 0 defeat to hull , paul lambert âs last match in charge , delph was in possession 92 times , 46 in each half
in the 2 - 0 defeat to hull , paul lambert âs last match in charge , delph was in possession 92 times , 46 in each half ( left ) , in the 4 - 0 victory over sunderland , he had 112 touches , 41 in his own half and 71 in the opposition âs chicken and egg scenario , perhaps
did delph âs advanced role come because of the big win or cause it ? aston villa âs possession in both games was roughly the 60 per cent mark , slightly more at the kc stadium in fact
â fighting back from injuries is what got delph picked by roy hodgson
michael carrick is fit again for manchester united and looked imperious against tottenham in midfield jordan henderson is ruling the roost at liverpool and has been labelled as england 's best midfielder roy hodgson knows that delph offers something different to his other midfielders and could pick him again he then started the important qualifier against switzerland , emerging with great credit
