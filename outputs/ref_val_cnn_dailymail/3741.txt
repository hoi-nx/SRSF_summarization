the tsa ( transport security administration ) has its own instagram feed documenting the unusual items it confiscates from airport security checkpoints - and it certainly makes for interesting viewing
from passengers travelling with their beloved eels , to hiding knives in the most unlikely of places , the tsa shares it all with its 238,000 followers
though potentially harmless , this toy must be checked by explosive detection professionals , the tsa says discovered in a carry - on bag at the eagle county regional airport in colorado , it 's hard to know what this odd - looking creature is
while it might be nothing more than a homourous novelty toy , tsa agents have no way of knowing if the grenade in its hand is actually inert until explosive detection professionals have the chance to examine the item
seal bombs , used for fishing , are prohibited from both carry - on and checked luggage one of the oddest items that mailonline came across while browsing the instagram was definitely a medieval mace , which was discovered in a carry - on bag at chicago 's midway international airport
one of the strangest confiscated items ? a medieval mace , found at chicago 's midway international airport these cat - shaped brass knuckles must be checked into the hold in order to be transported in 2012 , officers seized a bag of live eels , which they found in a passenger 's checked luggage in miami officers received a massive shock when they discovered a bag full of live eels back in 2012
the snakes were found using tsa 's advanced imaging technology , which allows officers to find threatening items that have been concealed from plain sight
a scooby doo greeting card was used by a crafty passenger to unsuccessfully conceal a knife also in miami in 2011 , a passenger attempted to smuggle seven snakes , in nylon stockings , in their trousers swords , though fine to check , can not be brought on board an airplane as a carry - on item this jack the ripper - like sickle was seized from a passenger 's bag because no blades are allowed on board throwing stars , which are used in martial arts , are banned in some american states but not others interestingly , one item travellers can bring through security : a freshly - baked pie , like this one from swords and a jack the ripper - like sickle to throwing stars , all bladed objects are prohibited from carry - on bags - but that has n't kept many passengers from attempting to transport them through the security checkpoint
