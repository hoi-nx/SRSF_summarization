rarer -- and some would argue cuter -- than the panda , there are less than 1,000 of these teddy bear - like creatures living in the tianshan mountains mountain range in the xinjiang region of northwestern china , says conservationist li weidong
li weidong discovered the pika , formally known as ili pika , in 1983 and named it after his hometown , ili
last july , li weidong spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s
" in 2008 , the animal was listed as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature but there 's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it , according to li weidong
li weidong says the pika 's habitat has been affected by global warming
due to rising temperatures , glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the tianshan mountains mountains , forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops , li weidong said
ili pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters , he said
it 's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species , so if predators are near , ili pikas are not able to alert each other , li weidong said
in 1983 , when li weidong first came across the mammal , nobody knew what it was
two years later , li weidong found another two and it was declared a new species
in the decade following , li weidong and his colleagues conducted a number of studies , including a census at 14 different sites
however , in 1992 , li weidong left ili to work with xinjiang academy of environmental protection in the regional capital urumqi
in 2002 and 2003 , li weidong , with a team of volunteers , conducted a fresh census
however , by analyzing droppings and snow tracks , li weidong , along with arizona state university biologist andrew smith , was able to conclude that the ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline
this time , on the second day of the field trip , they finally spotted a pika , who jumped and stepped over li weidong 's feet while he was trying to photograph it
" they concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 ili pikas , said li weidong
it 's the lack of official recognition for the ili , and other pikas ' plight
