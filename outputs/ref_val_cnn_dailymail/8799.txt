now engineers at dyson may have the answer â a new model designed specifically for hard flooring
the firm âs cordless v6 fluffy vacuum cleaner â which goes on sale today costing Â£ 399 â aims to cater for the growing trend for exposed wooden floorboards , ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring
engineers have replaced the traditional spinning bristles â which were designed to drive dust out of a carpet â with a large soft nylon brush similar to a paint roller which scoops dust and dirt from hard floors
sir dyson said previously that the company ' must relentlessly invent ' to keep up with changing demand dyson claims the v6 fluffy is particularly good at sucking dirt out of the crevices between floorboards , and is able to pick up a whole 1kg bag of sugar in just four seconds
market researcher the freedonia group estimates that there has been a 70 per cent increase in the use of hard flooring in the last two decades
stephen courtney , head of new product innovation at dyson , said : â in homes today we see more hard floors , so we set out to solve the age - old problem of conventional cleaners simply snowploughing debris across the floor
