in the 1950s it was cancer
" they called it the ' c ' word , and it did n't get talked about in doctor 's offices , " said kallmyer of the alzheimer 's association
" today it 's alzheimer 's , and 55 % of patients and their caregivers say their doctors never told them they have the devastating disease , according to a special report of the alzheimer 's association released this week
compare that to one of the big four cancers -- breast , colorectal , lung and prostate -- more than 90 % said their doctors had no problem giving them the diagnosis
" alzheimer 's not being talked about , many doctors are not giving the diagnosis , " added kallmyer in a webcast
it 's a disease , it 's nothing to be ashamed about
" i am reminded of the rather sobering fact that as many as 60 % of people who have a dementia die without the dementia having been diagnosed by their doctor
" " i think the comparison of alzheimer 's to cancer is appropriate , " said dr. price , medical director for emory university 's geriatric clinic
" i give patients a new diagnosis of alzheimer 's disease many times a week , and every time it is uncomfortable , and i 've been doing it for over 10 years
" what 's at stake alzheimer 's advocates stress the importance of giving a patient all the facts , as early as possible , so they can work with their family to organize legal and health directives and have time to fulfill life - long desires
" there 's another critical factor as well : access to clinical trials that might help slow the illness
" right now , the big studies that are underway in prevention are really looking at people in the early stages of alzheimer 's , " said kallmyer
" " i think that medical school curriculum does need to update to include neurodegenerative diseases in their ' giving bad news ' training -- alzheimer 's and parkinson 's diseases , for example , " said price
" we do need to educate all providers to be aware that hesitance to give the diagnosis reduces the ability of the patient and family to make some choices and planning that is essential for emotional and financial well - being
