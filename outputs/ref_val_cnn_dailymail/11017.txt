brownlee sprinted to victory as he claimed gold in the second round of the world triathlon series though the final stages of the 10 - kilometre run brought with them heavy rain , brownlee reached the final corner clear of his rivals and celebrated along with the crowd over the final few metres before crossing the line in a sprint finish with a time of one hour 55 minutes and 26 seconds ahead of javier gomez and third - placed le corre
brownlee 's brother alistair missed the race because of a minor ankle injury but , with olympic qualification to be decided in august and september at the test event in rio and the world series grand final in chicago , none of the leading triathletes will want to peak too soon
just like the yorkshire hill 's ! ' brownlee now takes up the world number one ranking which he carries to the next round on australia 's gold coast in a fortnight
