the suspension has gone ; only the driver 's door opens from the inside and there does n't even seem to be a speedometer
a bit like cuba , in fact
everyone says you have to go now before the chicken nugget invasion changes everything following president obama 's decision to lift sanctions after 55 years
the real reason to go now is because for all their travails , the cuba people are remarkably kind , honest and polite - and havana is like nowhere else on earth
everywhere we go , there is a healthy scepticism about the fidel castro years and what might happen if outsiders are ever allowed to buy land and property
we 're in the open - top chevy ( not driving it ) on the way to ernest hemingway 's house , 20 minutes from havana
before the day is done , we 'll sink more at la terraza in the fishing village of cojimar , the inspiration for the old man and the sea , which helped ernest hemingway win the nobel prize for literature in 1954
at the wheel : despite various mechanical troubles , mark managed to take to the road in cuba he bought finca vigia in 1940 and lived there off and on for 20 years
when i ask her what ernest hemingway would make of cuba today , her eyes fill with tears
' i do n't know , ' she says , ' but ernest hemingway loved cuba
it makes you wonder why on earth the british gave cuba back to spain in 1763 in return for florida
our best dinner is at mama ines , where fidel 's ex-chef has opened his own restaurant
clutter and colour : cuba 's half - century on a limb has preserved havana in a dilapidated but beautiful state there are n't many decent hotels in the capital
on the way to trinidad , a colonial town three to four hours away , we call in at the bay of pigs and watch a 20 - minute propaganda film about the failed us invasion , then spend a couple of hours in cienfuegos , which , frankly , leaves us cold , despite the 30 degree temperatures
one of cuba 's best beaches , playa ancon , is eight miles away
hitting the right notes : you can find - as mark did - music and art in many corners of cuba on the way back to havana we stop briefly in santa clara , where the remains of che guevara , the poster boy of the revolution , are housed in a grand memorial building
we 've done our bit with respect to cuba 's past and return to havana , where the future is on everyone 's lips
what is going to happen to cuba ? no one knows
life , hopefully , will be better for long - suffering cuba , but it might not be quite such a potent cocktail for the rest of us
