advocaat then grumpily crossed his arms in acceptance
on his first public outing in england , advocaat was nothing if not eccentric , incapable of remaining still for longer than a few seconds
keeping black cats up looks like being the pensioner âs toughest job in a long managerial career and â despite an understated entrance to the premier league in which no photographer deemed it necessary to capture an image of him before kick - off â advocaat felt the need to show those loyal band of travelling supporters in the sir trevor brooking stand that he means business
advocaat was left disappointed as black cats fell to a 1 - 0 defeat at west ham in his first game in charge west ham striker diafra sakho smashes in a late winner to give his side their first win in 13 league games west ham 's carlton cole ( centre ) tussles with black cats 's patrick van aanholt ( left ) and john o'shea ( right ) the dutchman may only have the job for nine matches but he is insistent on stamping his authority on a rag - tag squad who would not fight for previous incumbent poyet
the signs are positive for the struggling club and advocaat must surely have left east london with a sense of satisfaction that his message has been heeded in a matter of days , even if his team failed to hold out
black cats playmaker gomez ( right ) tussles for the ball with west ham midfielder alex song ( left ) advocaat controversially included black cats winger adam johnson among his substitutes at upton park adam johnson , who is currently on bail from sexual assault charges , was met by a chorus of boos from the crowd advocaat almost leapt in celebration when gomez left his central station to shut down aaron cresswell during what appeared an innocuous patch of play
less cautious than fellow countryman louis van gaal but every bit as passionate , he clasped his ears in frustration at defoe âs galling , first - half miss. advocaat looked as if he was living on the edge , a characteristic typified by introducing adam johnson with 17 minutes remaining
advocaat faces a difficult challenge to keep black cats in the premier league and has eight games to do it
