a new alzheimer âs drug that reverses the damage the disease causes in patients â brains could â change the landscape â of future treatment , according to researchers
it has already performed so well at early - stage trials involving people living with the disease in the united states that scientists are now in talks aimed at leapfrogging the usual second stage and fast - tracking it for larger trials
pharmaceutical firm biogen , which developed the drug , called aduncanumab , wants to recruit at least 1,000 patients for tests by the end of the year
a new alzheimer âs drug that reverses the damage the disease causes in patients â brains could â change the landscape â of future treatment ( file picture ) there are currently half a million people in the uk living with alzheimer âs , and as yet there is no cure
â pharmaceutical firm biogen , which developed the drug , called aduncanumab , wants to recruit at least 1,000 patients for tests ( picture posed by model ) the trial shows that aduncanumab significantly reduces amyloid plaque â clumps of protein typically found in the brains of alzheimer âs patients
it will be important to see results from much larger trials before we can understand how effective this treatment may be
