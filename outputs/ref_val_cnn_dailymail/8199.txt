martin harper has unexpectedly backed pheasant shooting , causing outrage among the group 's supporters as uk âs leading bird charity , you might expect the rspb to oppose pheasant shooting
some threatened to cancel their membership while others spoke of their â disappointment â
the row began when martin harper , conservation director of the rspb , wrote a blog saying the charity supported â progressive â shoots as they were good for the countryside
mr martin harper wrote : â yes , we condemn wildlife crime including any persecution of protected birds of prey
â but , the contribution progressive shoots can make to supporting threatened wildlife is significant , and we are delighted to help them further
â defending his view on the topic , mr martin harper went on to write : â this is nât a contradiction
â he added that pheasant shoots were responsible for creating or maintaining 7,000 hectares of hedgerows
twitter users reacted angrily , with one writing : â after 30 + years , i think it âs time to cancel our membership ! ! # itsall - aboutmoney
â â but the british association for shooting and conservation praised the rspb for putting â long - term conservation goals before short - term politicised campaigning â
â the rspb boss said that pheasant shoots were responsible for creating or maintaining 7,000 hectares of hedgerows
but twitter users reacted angrily to the comments you do not need a licence to hunt pheasants or grouse in the uk but a firearms or shotgun certificate is required
in an interview with the observer , mr martin harper added that is was too simplistic to say that the rspb is â anti-shooting â
â spokesman simon clarke told the observer : â when organisations are prepared to put evidence before opinion and long - term conservation goals before short - term politicised campaigning , then there is much common ground to be found
â stuart housden , a director at the rspb , said : â this is what we have been saying for a hundred years
