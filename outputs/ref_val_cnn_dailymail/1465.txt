a website which collects together pictures of london 's most handsome male commuters has proved a huge hit in china - but it might not be quite for the intended reason
tubecrush.net is filled with pictures of the capital 's finest looking men on the underground , uploaded by fellow commuters for others to rate and share
some experts have suggested the popularity of the pictures is down to the impression given of all british men being well - groomed and well - mannered - a china cliche
it transpires some are more taken with the space available to commuters on london 's tube
' you think we like the men ; we just like looking at men taking up so much space on the tube , ' the times reported one commenter as saying
international appeal : the good - looking men of london are also creating waves on the otherside of the world thousands : one picture can get 100,000 shares - popularity boosted by the ' downton abbey ' effect room : but some have alleged it is more to do with the space on the tube , rather than the dashing gentleman packed : the two cities driving most of the china traffic to tubecrush.net are shanghia and guangzhou - which have the fourth and sixth busiest metro systems in the world , respectively
both cities metro systems are in the top ten busiest networks in the world
