the united states has evacuated its remaining 100 special operations forces members from yemeni
what 's more , hundreds of members of al qaeda managed to escape from yemeni prisons on thursday and friday
in addition , the houthi issued a call to arms on saturday to fight those loyal to the embattled president hadi
members of the houthi militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of friday 's suicide bombings further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between president hadi and the houthi rebels
the houthi also launched a strike against president hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of aden , the country 's temporary capital
that same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of president hadi and houthi rebels battled in the same city
he also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the saudi city of riyadh , and no doubt upset the houthi when he also announced his plan to place a national flag in the city of sa'dah , the houthi base
hundreds of yemeni chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings meanwhile , should isis indeed be behind friday 's attack , that would make the situation even more dire as though they and al qaeda are both extremist sunni groups , the two have spoken out against one another in the past with al qaeda finding many isis acts and attacks far too extreme
