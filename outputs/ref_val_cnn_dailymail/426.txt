ancelotti has the best comeback lines
he 's a soft touch , they 've been saying in real madrid ; the club needs to be ruled with an iron fist , they add ; the players need tough love , they complain
ancelotti dealt with the issue last week in a press conference , arching his trademark left eyebrow into its most quizzical state of scepticism
' this soft touch has won three champions league , ' he said
they will argue with it , of course , at real madrid
tuesday 's champions league tie against schalke should be some blessed relief from domestic worries but then this has often been ancelotti 's way
ancelotti characteristically raises his eyebrow during a press conference on monday ancelotti 's laid - back attitude means he is loved by the majority he comes into contact with it was the trophy that saved him last summer
the muttering at the club was that he would be dismissed but , having delivered the much - anticipated ' decima ' - real madrid 's tenth champions league after a gap of twelve years - even the powers that be at the bernebeu did n't quite have the stomach to sack him
at the turn of the year real madrid were considered the most - formidable team in world football ; they had a four - point lead at the top of la liga and the so - called bbc â gareth bale , benezema and ronaldo â looked unstoppable
since then the club has been knocked out of the copa del rey by atletico , which was quickly followed by the 4 - 0 defeat at the vicente calderon to their real madrid rivals
real madrid - and ronaldo - have struggled for results in recent weeks there are doubts over the suitability of welshman gareth bale at the bernabeu athletic players run off to celebrate with aritz aduriz after scoring during the win over real madrid angel di maria with last season 's champions league trophy - which saved ancelotti 's job the 4 - 0 defeat to atletico was the one that really stung president florentino perez and it elicited a presidential visit to the dressing room and promise from the team leaders that things would improve
he is a specialist in working for the most - demanding owners football can fathom , his cv including stints with calisto tanzi at parma , who was eventually convicted of Â£ 6million fraud , former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi at ac milan , roman abramovich at chelsea and now florentino perez at real mardid
the fact that john terry , frank lampard and ashley cole loved ancelotti â they took him to the pub on the last day of the season in 2011 when ancelotti had found out he had been sacked â probably did n't help , given that those three players were not in the good books of the board at the time
real madrid president florentino perez has made his feelings known in the spanish capital there is a deeper parallel between chelsea and real madrid
ronaldo heads home as real madrid comfortably swept aside schalke in the last - 16 first leg in germany mourinho and ancelotti 's feud was defused by the italian in a matter of seconds ancelotti once took david beckham ( centre ) on a 100 - mile drive to show him his favourite restaurant his playful humour is often lost in translation
though progressing through to the champions league quarter - finals should be a breeze , with a 2 - 0 lead secured in gelsenkirchen , there is a meeting with barcelona at the nou camp on sunday week which now looks ominous
significantly all the signs are that the players at real madrid are behind him but then he is hard man to fall out with for long
when chelsea and inter met in the champions league that year ancelotti deliberately sort out mourinho in the tunnel beforehand to shake hands and agree a truce
and if he does need the champions league to save him yet again this year , starting with schalke , at least he knows the competition is like an old friend to him , always there to help him through the critical moments in his career .
