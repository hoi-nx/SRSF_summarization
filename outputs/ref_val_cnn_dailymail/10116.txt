david duckenfield has admitted that his failure was a direct cause of the deaths of 96 liverpool fans at the hillsborough disaster the police match commander in charge of liverpool 's fa cup semi-final with nottingham forest in 1989 has admitted that his failure to close a tunnel was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 fans at the hillsborough disaster
during the inquest into the deaths today , david duckenfield also admitted that he ' froze ' on the day in question , while paul greaney qc suggested that a child of ' average intelligence ' could have realised the consequences of opening a gate to relieve congestion
up to 2,000 fans entered hillsborough stadium 's gate c , with many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them which mr david duckenfield had not ordered to be closed
mr greaney reminded mr david duckenfield of his earlier evidence to christina lambert qc , counsel for the inquest , about his state of mind after the opening of gate c when he told her : ' it was a momentous decision and your decision is such that you do not think of the next step
' asked again if he ' froze ' , mr david duckenfield said : ' it appears to be a distinct possibility
will you accept that in fact you froze ? ' mr david duckenfield responded : ' yes sir
' mr greaney went on : ' do you agree with the following , that people died in a crush in the central pens ? ' mr david duckenfield said : ' yes sir
' liverpool supporters were crushed to death during an fa cup semi-final with nottingham forest in 1989 liverpool supporters and family members of the victims of the disaster have long sought justice the barrister continued : ' that closing the tunnel would have prevented that and therefore would have prevented the tragedy
' mr david duckenfield said again : ' yes sir
' mr greaney said : ' that you failed to recognise that there was a need to close that tunnel
' a young liverpool fan is carried away from the danger as supporters are forced on to the hillsborough pitch mr greaney said : ' that failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the hillsborough tragedy
mr greaney , representing the police federation , put it the retired police chief : ' do you agree that never mind a competent match commander it might only take a child of average intelligence to realise what the consequences of your actions might be ? ' thousands of liverpool fans hold up scarves during a hillsborough memorial service at anfield last year mr david duckenfield replied : ' i did not think of it on the day , sir , because of the pressure i was under
' the inquests have heard that mr david duckenfield told the 1989 taylor inquiry into the disaster that he had made the right decisions on the day but he now accepted that he had made errors - some of which were ' grave '
mr david duckenfield said he did not want to go into detail about his ' personal circumstances ' - he has previously said he suffered post-traumatic stress - but it may have been he was ' confused ' when giving evidence in 1989
supporters pay their respects to the deceased at the anfield gates in liverpool after the disaster in 1989 mr greaney said : ' the other possibility that i put to you is that you did at the time know much more about the geography of that ground and you are seeking to conceal that knowledge from this jury
' mr david duckenfield said : ' i can assure you , sir , i had no idea where fans would go from a to g ( turnstiles ) or the opening of gate c. ' mr greaney pointed out that mr david duckenfield could have looked at a plan of the ground layout in the police control box before opening the gate at 2.52pm and that he could have consulted a fellow senior colleague with greater experience of the ground
a memorial service is held at liverpool 's anfield ground on the april 15 , 1989 anniversary of the disaster the barrister told the court that another officer who was in the control box , who was operating the cctv cameras , had earlier told the jury that he thought mr david duckenfield was ' not a leader in that control room during that critical period '
the retired chief superintendent of south yorkshire police has previously said he had expected police officers on the perimeter track of the ground and those in the west stand overlooking the leppings lane terrace pens to have kept an eye on monitoring the filling of them
