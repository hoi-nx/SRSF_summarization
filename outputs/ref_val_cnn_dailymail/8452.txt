schmeichel has picked his # one2eleven of stars he played alongside throughout his career goalkeeper : schmeichel i 've only ever played with myself in goal
defender : jaap stam i only played with him for one year and that was a very successful year , winning the treble
jaap stam lifts the premier league trophy as he had a very successful year alongside schmeichel defender : steve bruce he was there when i arrived at united
i 've never played with a player so brave
former united player steve bruce ( left ) features in the goalkeeper 's best xi he played with midfielder : david beckham what david beckham has done with his life , people will remember him for that
i hope people wo n't forget how good a player he was
not only was he a good player but he is the one guy with the best kicking technique i 've ever seen in my life
no - one did that at united
midfielder : roy keane a person of many different things but for 90 minutes when we played football this guy was unbelievable
midfielder : scholes when i came to united he was a kid back then , playing in the youth team , but he was a striker
he was converted into a midfield player
scholes 's passes , any kind of distance , from one yard to 40 yards , they were always accurate
roy keane ( from left to right ) , david beckham and ryan giggs all make it from schmeichel 's united days midfielder : ryan giggs we know the goal he scored in the semi-final against arsenal
it 's been shown time and time again because it is the best goal ever scored in the fa cup
from 16 years of age to this year , to be able to perform at that level , to give the team so much , this guy has got to be the best premier league player of all time
what he has given united and what he still gives united is fantastic
midfielder : michael laudrup probably the best player i 've ever played with
it 's a shame he has n't played in this country but this is a guy who played in one of the best barcelona teams ever
he made the journey to madrid , and played in one of the best madrid teams ever
schmeichel has chosen michael laudrup ( left ) as the best ever player he played alongside at brondby
