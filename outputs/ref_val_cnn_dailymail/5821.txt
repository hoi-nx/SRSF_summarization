u.s. secretary of state john kerry delivered a highly cautious assessment on saturday ahead of the next round of nuclear talks with iran , citing ' important gaps ' in the way of a deal before an end of march deadline
at a news conference in egyptian , where he attended an economic discussion , john kerry also said a u.s. decision would come shortly on unblocking hundreds of millions in suspended military assistance for the egyptian government
he said he 's returning to nuclear negotiations with iran with ' important gaps ' standing in the way of a deal but on the obama administration 's most important foreign policy priority - talks with iran to curb its nuclear program - john kerry was circumspect
he said only a negotiated agreement could provide long - term assurance that tehran would not develop nuclear weapons
but with a deadline just two weeks away , he could not say whether the u.s. and other world powers would be able to reach a framework accord with the iran or even were close
' speaking after a week of u.s. political fighting over the diplomatic outreach to iran , john kerry lambasted senate republicans who signed an open letter to iran 's leaders suggesting any deal they reach with the administration could expire the day president obama leaves office
such tactics , which john kerry called unprecedented , will inevitably raise questions among iran and u.s. 's allies in the talks , he said
he said that in order to provide long - term assurance that tehran would not develop nuclear weapons , more negotiations need to occur the conflict between the administration and mainly republicans in u.s. congress has emerged as among the tensest subplots to the diplomatic effort
many in u.s. congress say the u.s. should hold out for greater dismantlement of iran 's nuclear infrastructure
' in previous years when u.s. policy was not to talk to iran and insist at the same time that they can have no nuclear program , whatsoever , the number of centrifuges skyrocketed
' negotiators are talking about freezing iran 's uranium and plutonium programs for at least a decade in exchange for a gradual easing of economic pressure on the iran john kerry , who was schedule to travel sunday to lausanne , switzerland , for several days of discussions with iran foreign minister mohammad javad zarif , noted the islamic republic 's longstanding claims that it has no interest in assembling a nuclear arsenal
' on egyptian , john kerry said a decision would come ' very soon ' on f-16 fighter jets , tanks and other materiel the egyptian say the need to combat an extremist threat operating in the sinai peninsula and spilling over from lawless libya
john kerry said at the conference that negotiations with iran can not stop , because ' every time negotiations have broken down in the past , iran 's nuclear program has advanced ' the aid was suspended after the military 's 2013 takeover of the government
