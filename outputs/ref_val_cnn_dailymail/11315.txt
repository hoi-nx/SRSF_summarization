he has acted opposite mae west , tripped the light fantastic on the great white way and even partied with rita hayworth - and now ryan is sharing his stories about life during the golden age of hollywood
the only problem is that ryan is a 10 - year - old boy from muskogee , oklahoma who was born to baptist parents
ryan began seeing dr. tucker ( above ) soon after he revealed his past life , a highly respected child psychiatrist who works with children who remember past lives , and does not think ryan is lying ryan also recalls parting with rita hayworth ( above ) when he was martin ryan 's father ( center ) is a local police officer and neither her nor his wife knew anything about old hollywood ryan was pointing to an extra in the film , a man with no lines that they later learned was bit - actor - turned - agent martin
that is when cyndi decided ryan should talk to someone , and the family found dr. tucker , a highly respected child psychiatrist from the university of virginia who has spent time talking with and studying children who claim to remember past lives
most remarkable to dr. tucker , besides ryan 's incredible detail , was how accurate his claims matched up with the life of martin , a virtual unknown who neither ryan 's family nor dr. tucker knew anything about , even his name , until they reached out to a film archivist
the film archivist gave them the name , and they then contacted one of martin 's daughters to ask about his life
that is when they discovered that 55 of ryan 's statements matched up perfectly with martin 's life - including the street he lived on , how many children he had , how many siblings he had and those aforementioned five marriages
the most shocking claim however came when ryan told dr. tucker during a session one day that he wondered why god had him die at 61 - years - old only to be reincarnated as a baby
that is until dr. tucker looked through old census reports and discovered that the certificate , and not ryan , was incorrect
ryan now says his memories of martin are starting to fade , and as for dr. tucker , he has compiled ryan 's story and other like it in his book return to life .
