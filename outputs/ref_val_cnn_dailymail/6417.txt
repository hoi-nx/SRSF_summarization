scott peterson horrified the nation when he was convicted 10 years ago for murdering his 8 - months - pregnant wife laci and their unborn son conner
while he was sentenced to death for the crime , the likelihood that the 42 - year - old will actually be executed is unlikely in california where the last death row inmate was killed in 2006
perhaps most shocking though is the fact that scott peterson lives a relatively ' cushy ' life at the bay area 's 163 - year - old san quentin - which houses the largest death row population in the nation

nancy mulane says scott peterson is living in an ' exclusive ' part of the historic prison , in a single cell with the ability to socialize with other prisoners on a roof deck with a half basketball court
' nancy mulane went on to add that there are many death row prisoners in california who spend 23 of the 24 hours in a day locked in their cells
scott peterson has an exclusive life inside san quentin , ' nancy mulane said
