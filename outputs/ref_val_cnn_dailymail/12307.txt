the odds seemed almost impossibly stacked against lily , but she survived
rescuers found the toddler saturday , hanging upside down in her mother 's car , which had flipped into a frigid utah river a day before
lily 's mother , lynn jennifer groesbeck , died in the crash
she was 25 years old
how did her 18 - month - old survive ? one of the biggest factors was the car seat
lily was in the proper car seat for her age and the seat appears to have been properly attached
ironically , the cold might have actually helped lily survive , said dr. walsh , with the university of massachusetts medical school
we tend to over bundle our children , so the fact that she was dry , she probably had on multiple layers because it 's winter , and there 's always a chance that she had just been sort of fed right before this happened probably all played a role , " walsh said
children are very resilient , and i think sometimes we do n't realize how much they actually can withstand , " said walsh
