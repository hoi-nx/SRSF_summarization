photos of u.s. ambassador to south koreans lippert meeting with the country 's leaders have emerged for the first time since the envoy was attacked by a knife - wielding pro-north north korea activist
police are charging the activist , kim , 55 , with murder after he slashed the ambassador while screaming demands for north korea reunification
the attack thursday on lippert , at a forum about reunification , prompted rival north korea to gloat about ' knife slashes of justice , ' that left deep gashes and damaged the ambassador 's tendons and nerves
lippert , 42 , is recovering well but has complained of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage , severance hospital official yoon do-heum said in a televised briefing
doctors will remove the 80 stiches on lippert 's face on monday or tuesday and say he could be out of the hospital on wednesday
police , meanwhile , searched the offices of the suspect for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved kim was detained on friday and police seized 30 copies of books and print materials from his home , some of which were pro-north south koreans , according to yonhap news
dumbfounded : kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on lippert on thursday morning , which left the ambassador covered in blood taken by surprise : injured ambassador lippert is seen leaving the performing arts center where he was slashed by kim thursday morning suspect : police are seeking an attempted murder charge against kim , who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for north korea reunification having material in support of pyongyang is not illegal , but distributing material propagandizing the isolated communist regime is banned in the south koreans
authorities plan on charging kim with attempted murder , violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction
the anti-us activist has denied that he intended to kill lippert
as part of their investigation they have also requested kim 's past travels to north korea â seven times between 1999 and 2007 â during a previous era of inter-korean cooperation , when seoul was ruled by a liberal government
kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former north korea leader kim jong il after his death in december 2011 , police said

kim is well - known among police and activists as one of a hard - core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes
police did n't consider the possibility that kim , who has ties to the korean council for reconciliation and cooperation would show up for the group 's breakfast meeting , according to a seoul police official who did n't want to be named , citing office rules
however , the japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when kim threw a piece of concrete at him , according to police
kim , who was protesting japanese 's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by south koreans , hit the ambassador 's secretary instead , media reports said , and was sentenced to a three - year suspended prison term over the attack
north korea 's state - controlled media crowed thursday that kim 's attack reflected the south koreans people 's protests against the u.s. for driving the korean peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills
