former pm brown warned that leaving the eu would turn britain into europe 's north korea britain would turn into the european if it left the eu , brown has claimed
he rejects claims that britain could succeed on its own by becoming an open , trading nation like switzerland or hong kong
a report commissioned by johnson last year said leaving the eu was ' definitely a viable option ' for the britain
he said this was ' really the north korea option â out in the cold with few friends , no influence , little new trade and even less new investment '
in a bizarre warning ahead of a speech to the commons tomorrow , former prime minister brown said the britain would be ' left out in the cold with few friends [ and ] no influence ' like north korea under kim jong-un mr brown , writing in the guardian , said britain should not contemplate exit when it was on course to overtake germany as the eu 's largest economy
