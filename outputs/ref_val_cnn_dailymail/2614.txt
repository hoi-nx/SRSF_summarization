a reporter for fox 5 in washington dc has come under fire for telling very different versions of a home invasion story that she has repeated while advocating gun ownership
emily miller , the chief investigative reporter for wttg-tv , has previously claimed she fell victim to a terrifying home invasion on new year 's day in 2010 while dog - sitting for friends at their house
in one interview for the nra , she said she returned to the home to find it being robbed before trying to take a photo of the suspect - and being chased by a group of 15 men
but a police report has now revealed a very different - and far less harrowing - tale than the one she has shared publicly
she asked him why he was there and he told her he was delivering firewood , the police report noted , and left
emily miller , who had forgotten to lock the door behind her when she took out the dog , went into the house and ' felt that something was not right ' , according to the report , so left to take a photo of his car
outside , the suspect gave her a business card showing a tree service company before leaving , and emily miller saw that he was driving a silver truck showing the name of a landscaping company
but later that evening , her credit card company called her about fraudulent activity on her card and she checked her wallet and saw the card and $ 50 were missing , according to the report
she had left the wallet out on a table inside the unlocked home while walking the dog
harrowing : in one retelling of the story , for a 2014 video for the nra ( pictured ) , emily miller said she returned to find the home being robbed and the man took off with her wallet terrifying : a reenactment of the crime in the nra video shows it happened at night , rather than at 3pm but when police tried to contact her to take the case further , she did not return messages they left on her phone on three separate occasions and the report was suspended
tale : in her book , emily miller says she attempted to take the man 's photo in the street but he stopped her ' a man - the police believed to be a drug addict - got into the house and started robbing it , ' she said on the video
emily miller has also said she was a ' victim of a home invasion ' on other occasions , including in speeches
advocate : she has shared the story while advocating for gun rights in washington dc in a recent series on fox5 , she charted her attempts to get a gun in the state according to wemple of the washington post , the discrepancies in her story are important because she ' has hitched her career ' on it
