' chick sexers ' are paid Â£ 40,000 a year to spend their days with tens of thousands of fluffy chicks
but despite the seemingly attractive offer , british 's poultry industry is struggling to recruit and is now facing a staff shortage that is threatening exports
the problem , according to one industry chief , lies in the nature of the job : sexers spend 12 hours a day ' staring at the backside of a chick '
each future ' chick sexer ' receives years in training in how to spot ' minuscule differences ' in the size and shape of a newly - hatched chick 's genitalia to determine whether it will be a rooster or a hen
they are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day - old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent
in 2013 the industry failed to recruit a single ' vent chick sexer ' and asked for the job to be added to an official government list of occupations with staff shortages
mr large told the times : ' it takes three years to train someone so they develop the sensitivity and dexterity to reliably sex the bird and a lot of people do n't want to spend that amount of time training
waiting to be checked : chick sexers are expected to be able to sort between 800 and 1,200 day - old old chicks an hour - between three and five seconds a chick - with an accuracy of 97 or 98 per cent
