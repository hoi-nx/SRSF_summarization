it was supposed to be all about mccoy â the biggest name in jump racing on his final day riding at the cheltenham
but instead , gold cup day 2015 shone a spotlight on a jockey in nico de boinville who has ridden fewer winners in his career than the 19 - time champion rides in three months
carlingford lough , 40 - year - old mccoy âs final gold cup mount , finished a fading ninth behind coneygree , the novice chaser representing 10 - horse trainer mark bradstock and his assistant , wife sara
mccoy 's wife chanelle ( left ) passionately willed him on to claim his third gold cup victory but her relentless optimism soon turned to sheer sadness as her husband crossed the finish like in ninth place jockey mccoy could not crown his final cheltenham with a gold cup win mccoy did get a gold cup round of applause but it came as he walked around the paddock before the race
looking down at his friend and colleague ruby walsh , who had yet to be united with his gold cup ride djakadam , mccoy quipped : â they think i âve won
ultimately , mccoy did get on the winner âs podium but that was to present the trophy to the team behind next sensation , winner of the concluding ap mccoy grand annual chase
not surprisingly , the scudamore - trained next sensation , ridden by scudamore âs brother tom , had received a quieter reception than mccoy âs fourth - placed ned buntline
a crowd close to 70,000 had cheered and chanted his name as mccoy brought his mount down the famous walkway off the track
and while they did not get the result they wanted , mccoy did at least break the habit of a lifetime for them
after the gold cup , mccoy conceded he had anticipated his fate on arriving at the track when overnight rain was turning the ground soft
mccoy and ned buntline gave it a good go on the 19 - time champion jockey 's final cheltenham ride an emotional mccoy after his last ever ride at the cheltenham the big screen at cheltenham displayed a tribute to the retiring jockey â i knew when i got here this morning that it was always going to be against him , â mccoy said
â mccoy then paid generous tribute to the winning team
as for mccoy , it was just one of those days as he failed to add to thursday âs ryanair chase victory on uxizandre , who goes down as his 31st and final cheltenham victory
mccoy was presented with a photo album of his cheltenham career after his final fling at the cheltenham mccoy , in the middle of the picture , walks out of the cheltenham weighing room for the last time strongly - backed princely conn was staying on when badly hampered and slipped back to 13th in the county hurdle while fletchers flyer , mccoy âs mount in the albert bartlett novices â hurdle , was a non-runner
