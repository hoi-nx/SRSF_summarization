the pain for the charles must be considerable
in the early days of his son william 's courtship of kate , the waspish duchess of cornwall would jokily refer to the middleton family as ' meet the fockers ' , a reference to the hollywood comedy about unconventional in - laws
as they play a major role in the upbringing of the soon - to - be 20 - month - old future george , charles complains that he ' almost never ' sees his grandson
the mail 's shakespeare diary revealed this week that charles is becoming increasingly perplexed about the peripheral role he plays in the young charles 's life
for there is a ' definite feeling ' among friends of the duchess of cornwall â george 's step - grandmother â that kate 's parents could be thinking of buying a place in norfolk , where william and kate will soon be living virtually full - time at anmer , near the queen 's sandringham
kate 's new baby is due to arrive next month , and william will be starting his new job as a helicopter pilot with air ambulance in the summer
the middletons have often stayed with their daughter and son - in - law at ten - bedroom anmer â they spent christmas there , fracturing the tradition of the normal royal get - together at sandringham when william and kate were absent from the queen 's lunch
getting a place of their own nearby would , of course , mean she could see lots more of kate and her children without people thinking she was installing herself at anmer
she is , after all , the only mother , and grandmother for george , that kate and william have
for prince charles , though , the dismay of seeing much less than he expected of his first grandson is heightened by his dreams of ' mentoring ' the future king
in - law rivalry : friends of prince charles claim he is frustrated by the amount of time george spends with his middleton relatives ith whom he recently holidayed in mustique for carole 's ( pictured left ) 60th birthday just a few days before george was born , charles was jovially asking a ladies ' circle in wales for ' any hints ' on being a grandfather
charles was only three when george vi died , and he never knew his paternal grandfather , prince philip 's dissolute , playboy father prince andrew of greece , who died in 1944
the queen mother stepped into her husband 's empty space and became charles 's counsellor and mentor , a vital sounding board in his life , until her death in 2002 at the age of 101
it is not difficult to see how all of this kindled a desire to closely oversee the development of baby george , a need that is now apparently unfulfilled , despite the fact that the charles has a special connection with his grandson , which , he believes , brings them even closer
the fact is , kate has rushed home to her mother at every opportunity â not just when she was suffering from morning sickness â and she and william have been endlessly taking george at weekends to spend time with carole , 60 , and husband middleton , 65 , at their Â£ 5 million manor house in berkshire
' all carole has ever wanted was to give as much guidance and help to kate and george as any other grandmother , ' says a family friend
' she 'll be horrified to learn that william 's father is apparently upset because he is not seeing enough of george
there are very real tensions between the two of them , and charles often disagrees with william
but if there is an argument , friends say , charles backs down every time
' part of william is a rebel who just does n't want to be another version of his father , or have a stuffy , traditional royal role , ' says a family friend
' could it be this that lies behind prince charles 's complaint that he does n't see enough of his infant grandson ? charles is understandably happy that william has found a loving wife and a new family
but he must surely resent any suggestion that the middletons give william what he himself has n't been able to
carole 's regular presence there only serves to highlight charles 's absence â and the growing sadness he is said to feel at the lack of regular contact with his grandson , as well as william 's apparent loosening of his royal roots
with william and kate living in norfolk , her parents thinking of buying a place down the road and charles spending most of his time 170 miles away at highgrove , it appears unlikely that the charles will see very much more of his grandson â not to mention the new arrival next month â than he has been .
