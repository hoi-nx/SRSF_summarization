jerusalem in a sea of jewish parties campaigning at hebrew university , odeh was the star attraction
but this powerful new face in israel politics is not jewish
while he is an israel citizen , the charismatic 41 - year - old lawyer is of palestinian descent -- one of 1.6 million israel arabs living in israel
under odeh 's leadership , israel 's tiny , splintered arab parties have teamed up for the first time to form a slate known as the joint list
come election day on tuesday , they are poised to take as many as 15 seats
this could potentially make them the third - largest party in the knesset after netanyahu 's likud party and his main rival , the zionist camp coalition , potentially giving them the balance of power
" " netanyahu says the danger to israel is not palestinian in the west bank , but rather israel in israel
" with 15 seats in the knesset , no one will ever be able to ignore us again
" until now , arab parties have failed to unite because of deep ideological differences
many believed lieberman 's goal was to push the arab parties out of the knesset
" with that calm , dignified response , odeh attracted political star status among jewish and israel alike
more importantly , he has given hope to the 1.6 million palestinian who hold israel citizenship that they might finally enjoy social and economic equality
odeh goes door to door with the ease of a natural politician , speaking about the importance of turning out to vote to ensure the joint list gets enough seats to change the face of the israel government
over hummus and stuffed vegetables , he speaks about a 10 - year plan to close the social gaps between israel 's jewish and its arab population , speaking about issues such as education , housing , employment for women , public transportation in arab towns and recognition of unrecognized bedouin communities in the negev
growing up , he says he identified with malcolm x. but as he got older , he began to feel he should follow in the footsteps of martin luther king jr. with a large block in parliament , odeh says he would have a greater platform to press for better treatment of palestinian in the occupied territories and to speak out about the need for a palestinian state living beside israel
sitting on a stoop chopping celery stalks for the grocery store across the street , sami abuliat says odeh is a good spokesman for palestinian living inside israel
it 's a position he says he would prefer over joining an israel government , which he says dedicates a large chunk of its budget to policies that discriminate against the palestinian
odeh would be entitled to a seat on israel 's foreign affairs committee in the knesset and is obligated to address the knesset after every speech by the prime minister
odeh says he needs the help of israel jews , who he hopes one day will become a greater voice in the cause of social justice for all israel
" it is not only a struggle of the palestinian minority living in israel
it 's not a vision shared by most in israel , but odeh 's message to students is " this is your chance
