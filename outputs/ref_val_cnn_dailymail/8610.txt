bernie ecclestone has suggested next year 's german grand prix could also fall by the wayside just days after this season 's race was officially dropped from the formula one calendar
as per their contract , hockenheim is scheduled to host the event in 2016 , but at this early stage formula one supremo bernie ecclestone is uncertain whether it will go ahead
asked whether he could confirm it would take place , bernie ecclestone , speaking to a select media group in the paddock at the malaysian grand prix , replied : ' no. ' bernie ecclestone ( left ) says german grand prix may miss out on the formula one calendar next year informed that hockenheim has a contract for 2016 and 2018 , bernie ecclestone added : ' it does n't make a difference
hockenheim and nurburgring have hosted the german grand prix for the past seven years ' the trouble in german was the nurburgring spent an awful lot of money which they borrowed , ' added bernie ecclestone
' bernie ecclestone did n't confirm if hockenheim would host next year 's race despite having a contract in place historic europe races are now fast falling away with france , san marino and now german losing their place on the calendar in recent times
italy is another that will struggle to pay its way beyond the expiry of its current contract in 2016 unless national government steps in to assist , or bernie ecclestone reduces his fees
' the formula one supremo said hockenheim having a contract in place ' does n't make a difference ' bernie ecclestone did concede , however , ' it would be terrible ' if europe did lose all its races , particularly as the series would no longer become a world championship
' the german grand prix has alternated between hockenheim and nurburgring since 2007
