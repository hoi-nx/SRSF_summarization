a previously unknown species of catfish has been named for the wide - eyed , puckered - mouth " star wars trilogy " character it resembles
its scientific name is peckoltia greedoi , and it is known for its large , dark eyes , puckered lips and protruding bristles
but you can call him greedo , in honor of the bounty hunter from " new hope : a new hope
" you might remember him from the cantina scene on mos eisley , where he was killed by han solo while attempting to collect on a debt for jabba the hutt
" i think it was the whole package that evoked greedo , but particularly the eyes and the underslung mouth , " said armbruster , biological sciences professor and curator of fishes at the auburn university museum of natural history
after talking it over with his colleagues , they realized he was a clear ringer for greedo
greedo has always been a personal favorite of mine
