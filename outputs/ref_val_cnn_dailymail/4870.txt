a lying yelp reviewer has been caught out by restaurant owners after they released surveillance footage showing he was in their restaurant for just 22 seconds
the user , known as dan
w , posted a scathing , one - star assessment of wonderful in millbrae near san francisco , california , claiming staff refused to seat him as he was alone , and even said they turned him down because of what he was wearing
owners of the venue saw the negative appraisal and decided to investigate
after looking over video captured at the restaurant 's front door , they discovered that the disgruntled customer did n't speak to a single member of staff and quickly left after looking at the waiting list
w after he wrote a one - star review of the venue
here he is entering the store at 19:07 in response they uploaded the damning video to their website and barred dan from returning - saying that he will be ' arrested for trespassing ' if he comes back
it 's not that classy of a place , but they refused to seat me
fabrication : he claimed that staff refused to seat him
but the clip shows he does n't speak to anyone else and only peers into the seating area of the restaurant ' the key to a good business is to be consistent in the small things
you spent a total of 22 seconds in the establishment
' this video also clearly shows that there were other patrons waiting
we are sincerely sorry that we forgot to recognize your very , very ' vip ' status at wonderful , a status so special that you do n't have to sign the waiting list like everyone else â¦ i 've never been to a restaurant where to refuse to seat people because they 're wearing what you were wearing â¦ you 're dreaming if you think that 's why you did n't get service
' dan , we did n't refuse to seat you
you refused to wait in line like everyone else
' you are prohibited from returning to wonderful
if we catch you , you will be arrested for trespassing
he insists he is not the man in the video and has demanded that the restaurant take it down busy : another angle shows dan surveying the seating area before deciding to leave
' response : management at the venue have barred dan from returning - saying that he will be ' arrested for trespassing ' if he comes back
