after little more than an hour of a match that was proving difficult for liverpool , jordan henderson removed the captain âs armband from his left bicep and handed it to gerrard
jordan henderson scored a second - half winner for liverpool as they continued their impressive recent form jordan henderson runs off to celebrate his winner that moved liverpool within two points of the premier league 's top four a delighted jordan henderson let out a roar for the liverpool fans in the liberty stadium jordan henderson 's shot was deflected over the top of swansea goalkeeper fabianski 's head and into the back of the net jordan henderson was mobbed by his team - mates after scoring what proved to be the winner in wales swansea : fabianski 6 , kyle naughton 6.5 , amat 7 , ashley williams 7 , neil taylor 6.5 , sung-yueng ki 6 ( dyer 80 ) , cork 6.5 , jonjo shelvey 7 , gomis 7.5 , sigurdsson 7 ( emnes 89 ) , routledge 6 ( montero 73 )

ref : roger east ( wiltshire ) ratings by dominic king jordan henderson , whose heat map is shown above , produced another commanding performance in liverpool 's midfield-click here for match zone it was then , 68 minutes into this contest , that jordan henderson did something that has long been synonymous with gerrard : he came to liverpool âs rescue
if it lacked finesse , and owed more to good fortune , a winning goal that narrowed the gap to manchester united in the fierce battle for champions league places owed everything to jordan henderson âs desire and determination
it was an ugly goal , amat âs attempted clearance spinning off jordan henderson âs shin and flying beyond the reach of fabianski
but it was jordan henderson who made the run in pursuit of sturridge âs flick - on and jordan henderson , after a stuttering first half , who had given liverpool impetus with his ambition and endeavour after the break
the goal was jordan henderson 's third in the last three premier league games after his strikes against manchester city and burnley liverpool recorded their fifth successive premier league victory ahead of their huge clash against manchester united on sunday jordan henderson clattered into jonjo shelvey with this kick to the head after just 16 seconds but roger east opted not to even book him
and the fact the goal came so soon after gerrard âs first appearance in eight games reflected well , once again , on brendan rodgers
brendan rodgers deserves enormous credit for the run of results liverpool are enjoying
brendan rodgers has succeeded where some of his counterparts have failed in addressing the problems of a struggling side
nobody has met that challenge with more authority than a young midfielder in jordan henderson now reflecting on three goals in liverpool âs last three games
the pressure was on here with sunday âs game against manchester united at anfield and a trip to arsenal to follow
liverpool goalkeeper mignolet makes a full - stretch save to deny swansea 's sigurdsson a goal in the first half liverpool 's belgian goalkeeper mignolet had to make a number of important stops in the first half as swansea piled on the pressure swansea midfielder routledge evades a challenge from liverpool midfielder jordan henderson liverpool , by contrast , were disappointing , with jordan henderson among those losing possession far too cheaply
liverpool 's raheem sterling takes on swansea left back neil taylor at the liberty stadium jordan henderson hands the captain 's armband to gerrard after he came off the bench for liverpool in the second half jordan henderson looks set to be in charge of the armband for the long term when gerrard leaves anfield at the end of the season gerrard made a return from injury as he came on in the second half of the premier league clash in south wales monk rues missed chances liverpool have kept six straight away clean sheets in the top - flight for the third time in their history , and the first since 1972
a neat one - two with routledge and he was through on goal with only mignolet to beat , but much to monk âs dismay his shot was scuffed and liverpool âs goalkeeper made the save
but after the interval liverpool were better â there was more urgency , more composure , with jordan henderson very much at the centre of things , even if the arrival of gerrard from the bench was important
that gave jordan henderson freedom to bomb on and in the 68th minute he chased a fine ball forward from skrtel that was diverted into the swansea box by sturridge
but liverpool , rather like jordan henderson at that crucial moment , have what teams need come the business end of the season : momentum
