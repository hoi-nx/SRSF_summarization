when i first became a mum , i never questioned getting my children vaccinated
it was just what you did when you have children - you do what your doctor tells you , because they know best
so as each of our six eldest children got progressively sicker after each vaccination , we never made that connection
out of our six vaccinated children , our 16 , 12 and 10 - year - old have moderate to severe autism , our 25 - year - old has adhd , our 14 - year - old has a severe language disorder , and our 20 - year - old has severe mood swings
tasha david ( back right ) tells how she chose to not vaccinate her two youngest children sasa , eight ( front left ) , and chiante , five ( front middle ) after her first six ( back row l-r : asante , 16 , jourdahn , 25 , middle row l-r : deveraux , 20 , sahara , 14 , acacia , 10 , armaan , 12 ) suffered health problems they also suffered from chronic ear infections , bronchiolitis , asthma , eczema , psoriasis , urinary infections , gastrointestinal and autoimmune disorders , allergies , chemical sensitivities and intolerances
we tried genetic testing to look for answers , but no reason was found for our children âs afflictions
' out of our six vaccinated children , our 16 , 12 and 10 - year - old have moderate to severe autism , our 25 - year - old has adhd , our 14 - year - old has a severe language disorder , and our 20 - year - old has severe mood swings ' fighting fit : tasha david says her two youngest children have ' thrived ' and have never been sick this realization led us to not vaccinate our five and eight - year - old old and they have thrived because of it
out of all their siblings they should have been the most susceptible to genetic problems considering that i was in my late thirties when i had them and was overweight
' they have never had or needed an antibiotic in their lives ' : david 's youngest , chiante , five , and sasa , eight , are healthy people need to realise that vaccination is not one size fits all , that there are families in your community that are struggling with the harm that vaccines have caused
have we so quickly forgotten saba button , lachlan neylan [ both toddlers were left severely disabled following flu shots in 2010 and 2012 , respectively ] , and ashley epapara ? [ who died a day after receiving a flu shot in 2010 ] this is why vaccination must always remain a choice - otherwise we are saying that some children matter more than others
in 2009 a fully vaccinated nurse is suspected to have infected four infants with whooping cough in a maternity ward in sydney , as well as several studies since then that show that this vaccine is not providing the protection that our children deserve
