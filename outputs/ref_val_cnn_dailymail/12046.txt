putin has appeared on television for the first time in a week amid health fears and suggestions that he is being subject to a coup , while rumours persist that his 31 - year - old ' girlfriend ' is about to give birth
channel ntv showed footage of putin meeting with supreme court president vyacheslav lebedev , which it claims was shot on friday
putin is due to meet with the president of kyrgyzstan in st petersburg on monday according to the kremlin
the russia president was last seen in public on march 5
for the past week , the russia government has been reluctantly answering questions about putin 's health and suggestions that his unofficial girlfriend alina kabayeva had checked into a swiss maternity clinic
rumours about 31 - year - old alina kabayeva surfaced with reports in swiss , italian and russia suggesting the gymnast had either given birth or was about to do so
alina kabayeva has been largely out of sight since quitting as an mp in putin 's united russia party last september , when she took over as head of a major media conglomerate
meanwhile , the kremlin today issued a new picture showing putin meeting the chairman of the supreme court vyacheslav lebedev at his out - of - moscow residence novo-ogaryovo
the theory suggests the kremlin 's chief of staff sergei ivanov - a former defence minister - will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre medvedev
under the russia constitution , in the event of a president leaving office , the prime minister replaces him in an acting role pending elections
this latest forecast of an imminent sea change in russia politics came from illarionov , putin 's former chief economics aide , who last year predicted putin 's land grab against ukraine three weeks before it happened
while the kremlin insists putin is healthy and in full control of his government , illarionov claimed : ' in the next few days we should expect the resignation of prime minister medvedev , and sergei ivanov being appointed in his place
putin hands flowers to olympic gold medal - winning gymnast alina kabayeva after awarding her with an order of friendship at an award ceremony in the kremlin in 2001 it has been claimed russia 's former defence minister sergei ivanov ( pictured ) will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre medvedev observers note that in recent days , sergei ivanov - who retained the military rank of colonel general and whose eldest son was killed in a mysterious drowning accident in dubai last november - has been little seen in public
the former gymnast is rumoured to be the president 's girlfriend the kremlin insists he is healthy , but this has done nothing to end speculation from russia who for years were lied to over the health of geriatric soviet leaders , and also putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin
' peskov 's assertion that putin is in good health , however , could also mean recent developments in russia politics required putin 's presence in moscow , ' stated the moscow times today
he is wooden in his public appearances and lacks putin 's common touch with ordinary russia .
