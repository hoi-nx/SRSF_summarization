if it were possible for anything to be hot in buffalo this winter , it was the newfangled ' ice bikes ' that debuted at an outdoor skating rink
the bicycles on ice skates were an immediate hit when they glided onto the ice at canalside the day the new rink opened on the city 's waterfront
since that december day , the bundled riders who have ignored breath - taking cold to rent them have convinced inventor lisa florczak that she 's onto something
' i thought i might end up being the laughingstock of the city
lisa florczak 's family business , water bikes of buffalo , rented pontoon bikes that let riders pedal the buffalo river in warmer months
' they said the ice is going to be pretty large , and they thought they might need something more than just skating , ' ms lisa florczak said
' i thought : ` what a perfect opportunity to go from water biking to ice biking , ' ms lisa florczak said
the 26 - inch bikes work with a dull blade in the front and a rectangular base attached to an ordinary bike frame the inventor had looked up ' things to do on ice ' on the internet and saw that bikes that ride on ice were already being used in beijing , she told the boston globe
she bought a bike off the rack at wal-mart and worked with general welding and fabricating in elma on a design
the finished product is a 26 - inch bike that sits on a rectangular base with a duller blade replacing the front wheel
while originally scared that the bikes would damage the ice , ms lisa florczak told the buffalo news ' the rink guards said they did as much to the ice as a 5 - year - old would do while ice skating
' ms lisa florczak said there were hours - long waits for the bikes during a warm december and riders have persisted despite a frigid and snowy winter in buffalo mr wolf , who has parkinson 's disease , said he rides a three - wheel bike in the nice weather and likes the idea of a winter alternative
