the duke of cambridge made the unannounced â private visit â on thursday to gchq ( gchq ) â the maximum security â listening station â which tracks electronic traffic of terrorists and spy agencies around the world
the duke of cambridge âs first ever trip to gchq , housed in a doughnut - shaped building in cheltenham , gloucestershire , comes after the mail on sunday revealed that he and other young royals were being advised to change their email addresses and cut back on social media activities over fears they could be targeted by foreign spies and hackers
but questions were asked last night about the duke of cambridge âs use of a publicly funded royal helicopter to make the trip , as it was not an official public engagement and was not announced in the kensington palace âs court circular
the duke of cambridge was flown from london âs kensington palace to gloucestershire airport on the queen âs helicopter flight , funded by the taxpayer , and which is supposed to be only used for official engagements by the royals
