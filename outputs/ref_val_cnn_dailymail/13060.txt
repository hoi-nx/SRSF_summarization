igniting a live man in a cage ; severing the heads of dozens ; kidnapping , raping and selling women and children -- isis ' shocking maltreatment of its captives has become regrettably predictable
on sunday , isis released them
ten other assyrian christians christians are expected to join them in freedom after a short time in captivity
all but one of the christian released were part of a group of 220 assyrian christians captured last week during offensives on northern syrian villages , said the london - based syrian observatory for human rights
in the shadow of its sadistic mercilessness , the sudden reversal leaves many asking : why ? the group has not explained its decision
the assyrian christians were all from the village of tal goran
" not to wood , who published a detailed analysis on isis ' religious inner workings this week in the atlantic
he was pleased to hear about it , but he felt it fit into isis ' plans
" isis has claimed for a long time to follow rules , and it claims that these sharia courts will impose limits , " he told cnn
it did win them points with assyrian christians activists
isis has taken heat even from other islamists who accuse it of rogue justice , especially against muslim civilians they 've condemned as " infidels " out of hand
that reduced some of isis ' chances of receiving international moral and financial support , leaving the terror group to make up the gap with other funding
other islamist groups in syrian have frowned on isis for not submitting to decisions from sharia courts
the main issue drawing anger from other islamist groups revolves around muslim civilians , who are isis ' most common victims
it also makes the muslim tribal leaders look good and gets a rapport started between them and isis
isis has a very narrow definition of who is a real muslim and who is an apostate
isis is quick to kill anyone it condemns , because it wants to create a fanatically pure caliphate with only the strictest devotees , wood wrote
the released assyrian christians agreed to acknowledge isis as their new masters and to pay the tax
