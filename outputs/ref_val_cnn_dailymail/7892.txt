dozens of military personnel were injured when an raf transport plane on its way to afghanistan nose - dived 4,400ft after the captain 's camera became lodged alongside the aircraft 's joystick
the voyager jet was around five hours into its journey from brize norton to camp bastion when the nikon camera , used by the captain to take photographs on board , got stuck between the arm rest and the side - stick controller when his seat moved forward
in 27 seconds of chaos , the plane lost 4,400ft in altitude , throwing passengers and crew without seatbelts towards the ceiling , injuring 33 of those on board , while one traumatised passenger was hospitalised with stress , according to the report into the incident
this reconstruction shows how an raf captain 's camera became wedged alongside a voyager aircraft 's joystick before it plunged 4,400ft in mid air , injurying dozens of military personnel on board the voyager jet , similar to the one pictured , had been six hours into its journey from brize norton to camp bastion when the nikon camera , used to take photographs on board , got stuck in the flight controls the new voyager jet had been six hours into its journey from brize norton to camp bastion when the captain 's nikon camer , used to take photographs on board , got stuck in the flight controls the aircraft , a militarised version of the airbus a330-200 passenger jet , was diverted to an airbase in turkey after the incident on february 9 last year , and the state - of - the - art fleet grounded for 11 days while the cause of the dive was investigated by the military aviation authority
the report author describes the incident as a ' near - miss ' and said there was a ' realistic potential for the loss of the aircraft and 198 of our people '
there were nine crew members and 189 servicemen and women on board the flight , who had been served their meal and were enjoying the in - flight entertainment when when the plane suddenly lost altitude while cruising at 33,000ft over the black sea on its way to the main uk base in afghanistan
the digital slr camera , used by the captain in the three minutes before the plunge , had become wedged between his arm rest and the side - stick unit which control 's the aircraft 's altitude , when his seat moved forward , as this reconstruction shows at its fastest , it dropped at a rate of 15,800 feet per minute with the resulting g force enough to lift passengers out of their seats , as their belongings and other items such as pots of hot tea were hurled across the cabin
' a large number of passengers and crew had been thrown towards the ceiling , ' the report states
' a significant volume of loose articles , including bags , personal effects , teapots , paper cups and bins were flying around the cabin while some passengers were shouting
' the two pilots were quickly able to level the plane , and the captain decided to land the air craft as soon as possible so diverted the flight to the us air force 's incirlik air base in southern turkey
of those on board , 25 passengers and seven crew members were injured , and were cared for by medical personnel travelling as passengers , as well as by medics at incirlik
a cabin crew member was also hyperventilating but was cared for by a colleague
passengers without nato travel orders then had to stump up Â£ 10 in cash for a visa allowing them to pass through immigration , with the servicemen and women having to club together to buy the visas as the uk embassy was unable to transfer the money
mental health experts were sent out to incirlik to help ensure that the passengers felt able to get back on a plane so they could be taken back to the uk , and assess whether they were fit to be deployed to afghanistan
but by the time they were flown back to uk , two days after the terrifying plunge , ' several passengers were exhibiting signs of distress , with some requiring counselling from the mental health nurses or medication from the brize norton medical staff
the plane had set off from brize norton in oxfordshire ( pictured ) on the morning of february 9 last year the flight had been bound for camp bastion in afghanistan ( pictured ) , which was the uk 's major base in the country until late last year it states that although using the camera during the flight was not prohibited , its use ' represented a lack of compliance with the policy regarding non-relevant duties '
changes to the design of the cabin to prevent a similar incident were not required , but the report recommends that strengthening rules regarding wearing seatbelts could mitigate ' future in - flight upsets '
the aircraft â a military version of the airbus a330-200 civilian jet â can fly at a top speed of voyager can transport 400 soldiers
