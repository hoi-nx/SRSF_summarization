rap music and muslim women ... they are not four words that usually come together
but two women from london are breaking down the boundaries for islam females across the world with their brand of inspirational hip hop
together , muneera williams , 34 , and sukina owen-douglas , 33 , form poetic pilgrimage - a self - described ' hiphop hijabis ' duo that has created a new type of rap music for the masses that addresses religion , gender and issues of identity
since then , they have cultivated a global fan base of devoted followers from both inside and outside the islam community
the attraction for their followers is , in part , the unlikely partnership between the fact that they are muslim women who have an impressive ability to write and perform verse
sukina owen-douglas and muneera williams converted to islam ten years ago , just three weeks before the 7/7 bombings , and while the path has n't always been easy , they have n't looked back
a few years later , they decided to convert to islam after learning about the religion through the autobiography of malcolm x and academic books about islam and feminism
muneera williams and sukina owen-douglas formed their rap group ten years ago like most other female muslim , they now pray five times a day , avoid alcohol and wear the hijab
sukina owen-douglas told femail : ' there are people who have messaged us from all over the world who are appreciative of the bravery in our character
' but on the flip - side there are people who have been unappreciative from both the muslim community and the non-muslim community
' people who have suggested were using our hijabs as a gimmick to make money and that we are n't muslim at all
' the duo 's lyrics are based around feminism , islam and political issues to say that the woman have cornered a niche in the market is an understatement - their lyrics are based around feminism , islam and political issues
sukina owen-douglas said : ' we talk about political situations but we try and take a different stance
' so we talk about it from a female perspective
sukina owen-douglas said : ' in the muslim community it was very difficult because the topic of hip hop is very flammable
sukina owen-douglas said : ' when we first converted to islam we though tour main following would be young muslim girls from england
