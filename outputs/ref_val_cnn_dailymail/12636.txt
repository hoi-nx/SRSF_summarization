a 20 - year - old man from the st. louis area has been arrested in connection with the shooting of two police officers during last week 's protests in ferguson , missouri , a prosecutor said sunday
jeffrey williams was arrested late saturday , and he has been charged with two counts of first - degree assault , a count of firing a weapon from a vehicle and three counts of armed criminal activity , st. louis prosecuting attorney mcculloch said at a news conference in clayton
" the demonstrations were pretty much over ( when the officers were shot )
people were leaving , and that 's when this happened , " he said , describing jeffrey williams as a demonstrator who had taken part in protests on numerous occasions
at the time of his arrest , jeffrey williams was on probation for receiving stolen property , and mcculloch said he believed jeffrey williams had an outstanding warrant after not reporting to his probation officer for several months
the prosecutor repeatedly thanked the public for the information that led to the arrest
he also said that , because of the public 's assistance in the case , police were able to serve a search warrant on jeffrey williams ' residence where they seized a .40 - caliber handgun , " which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered " at the scene of the shooting
jeffrey williams is being held on a cash - only $ 300,000 bond , mcculloch said , adding that it 's possible jeffrey williams could face more charges and that others could be charged in the case
one element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent , mcculloch said , adding that jeffrey williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he was n't aiming at the police officers
investigators are not sure they " buy " jeffrey williams ' claim that he opened fire after a dispute with other individuals , mcculloch said , but he did n't rule it out
bishop robinson , an area organizer , challenged the idea that jeffrey williams was a well - known protester
the shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city 's police station shortly after midnight wednesday , at the end of a protest against the ferguson police department , st. louis police chief belmar said at the time
" these police officers were standing there , and they were shot just because they were police officers , " he said
the department has been under fire since one of its officers , darren wilson , shot and killed african - u.s. teen michael brown in august , and more recently since a scathing u.s. department of justice report documented a pattern of racial discrimination
while the demonstrators ' focus was ferguson , neither of the wounded officers works for that police department
the officer -- a 32 - year - old with seven years ' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek , just under his right eye , belmar said
