the prime minister said he ' made no apology ' for claims that labour would increase taxes on working families by more than Â£ 3,000 over the next five years â despite the conservative party estimate being criticised by economists and dismissed as ' made up ' by labour
but mr cameron refused to say how he would deliver Â£ 12billion in savings from the welfare budget which he has claimed are needed to avoid tax rises
cameron this morning accused labour of planning to ' pick you pocket ' if they are elected in may on the first full day of campaigning , the pm said labour was planning to hike taxes on businesses on families to reduce the deficit instead of making savings from government spending
mr cameron meanwhile promised that the conservative party would help business create another two million jobs over the course of the next parliament if they are returned to downing street
the pm said the election was ' a choice about whether you want a government that will find savings and not pick your pocket or with labour a government that will pick your pocket , i think , on a pretty frequent basis
' the institute for fiscal studies yesterday challenged mr cameron 's claim of a Â£ 3,000 tax hike under labour , saying the party 's plans did not suggest a rise of anything like that scale and that conservative plans implied a larger overall package of spending cuts or tax rises
ed miliband has accused the tories of using ' made up figures ' asked about the Â£ 3,000 figure , the prime minister told the bbc : ' i think it 's a totally fair assumption
' mr cameron was repeatedly pressed over conservative party plans to save Â£ 12 billion from the welfare budget , as part of an overall Â£ 30 billion cuts package
' meanwhile , mr balls announced that the first budget of a labour government will cut business rates for 1.5 million small companies â worth an average of Â£ 400 â to be followed by a freeze the following year
and it will mean that the tax burden on small businesses will be lower with labour than under the tories
' nick clegg this morning demanded the tories come clean over how they will cut Â£ 12billion from the welfare budget however the move risks re-opening the rift with some big business leaders who have strongly criticised labour 's spending plans
' mr cameron told sky news 's sunrise that labour 's plan to raise corporation tax was ' a crazy thing to do when the economy is growing '
asked for details of how the tories ' Â£ 12 billion benefit cuts would be delivered , mr cameron told itv1 's good morning britain : ' effectively what we are saying is that we need to save Â£ 1 out of every Â£ 100 that the government spends in the next two years
' mr cameron said his party was setting out a ' very positive vision for britain ' with a pledge to help business create two million new jobs , adding : ' i ca n't think of anything more positive than that
