jagger , pictured , died the night after winning a silver medal at crufts following his return to belgium the pedigree dog allegedly â murdered â at crufts was probably poisoned the day after he competed in the show , the vet investigating his death said yesterday
irish setter jagger collapsed and died the night after winning a silver medal in his class at the competition following his return to his co-owners â family home in belgium
his distraught owners willem and lauwers are convinced he was fed beef laced with slow - acting toxins as he sat on the bench awaiting to perform at crufts as it was the only time he was left unattended
but their family vet dr jans said jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died
speaking for the first time about the tragedy , he told the mail : â i doubt that it happened at crufts
â the dramatic new twist came as crufts organisers the kennel club confirmed they are looking into a report that a second dog , an unnamed shih tzu , also died following the event
â the lauwers phoned dr jans â practice at 2am on saturday morning after jagger fell ill soon after they had taken him for a walk in the area around their home in the village of lauw , near liege
everything about crufts is speculation
â it could have happened on their way back or even in the hours after they arrived back
â it was a very long time between the show in england and the trip over to here , where nothing wrong was seen with the dog
â i have my doubts about the story from crufts
â vets believe that jagger , pictured , was fed beef laced with black pellets before his death dr jans said he had sent samples to the toxology department at the university of ghent who are expected to report their findings early next week
â dr minsen , who conducted the autopsy on the dog , said : â the meat seemed to be beef
â but speaking from her family home yesterday , mrs lauwers said : â it did nât happen in belgium â i am 100 per cent sure it happened in england
â the cctv from crufts is being checked by someone we know
â the revelations came as jagger was cremated yesterday at a special centre for family pets twenty miles from the family home
a further four dogs â two shetland sheepdogs , an afghan and a west highland terrier - are also feared to have been poisoned at crufts
but kennel club secretary caroline kisko said : â whilst reports surrounding the welfare of dogs at crufts are taken with the utmost of seriousness , a number of the reports in the news about dogs becoming sick after leaving the show have been from anonymous sources , who have not reported the allegations to us or the police , and we can not look into claims about which we have no direct information
