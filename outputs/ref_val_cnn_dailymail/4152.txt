disturbing questions were being asked last night about four judges caught looking at pornography at work
andrew maw , left , resigned before he could be sacked while immigration judge warren grant , right , confirmed today he lost his job for viewing porn on official judicial equipment but senior judges and the judicial disciplinary board refused to give any detail about the â inappropriate â activities of the judges
north london immigration judge warren grant , district judge timothy bowles of romford county court and recorder peter bullock , who worked on the north - eastern circuit , were all sacked for viewing pornographic material
recorder andrew maw , who worked at lincoln county court , resigned before he could be forced out
an official statement said he had â viewed similar inappropriate material via his judicial it account â and would have been removed from office â had he not resigned before the conclusion of the disciplinary process â
that is how their behaviour could have become a matter of conduct in office
but the jcio , which handles disciplinary complaints against judges and magistrates , refused to give any information about the misconduct or the cases the judges dealt
this means no one can know whether their judge was watching pornography during recesses in their own case or whether cases that might have involved complicated sexual issues were being run by a judge who was using pornography in his office during the trial
the dismissal of so many judges in one day â and behind closed doors â provoked disquiet in westminster and among legal experts
we know little about what happened here , but it was considered serious enough for the judges to be dismissed
â sacked : three judges have been fired and one resigned after being caught watching porn on work computers tory mp dominic raab said : â it is a cardinal rule that britain justice is not just done , but also seen to be done
â one of the four judges jailed a teacher for downloading child pornography and another sentenced a peeping tom for using a mobile phone to film women in swimming pool changing rooms
a statement from the jcio said the three men â have been removed from judicial office following an investigation into an allegation that they viewed pornographic material on judicial it equipment in their offices
â it said the judges were not linked in any way
the statement added that â the lord chancellor and the lord chief justice were satisfied that the material did not include images of children or any other illegal content , but concluded that this was an inexcusable misuse of their judicial it accounts and wholly unacceptable conduct for a judicial office holder â
the sackings came less than two months after the lord chief justice told mps of the seriousness with which he regards â extreme â pornography
lord lord thomas told the commons justice committee he believed a recent murder case illustrated â that the peddling of pornography on the internet had had a dramatic effect on an individual â and that is what is available now to download and to see â¦ is simply horrific â

â the third judge sacked for viewing porn on his work computer said he had been suffering from â severe and undiagnosed depression â at the time
