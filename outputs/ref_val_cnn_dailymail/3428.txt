japan 's navy today took delivery of its biggest warship since the second world war as it continues expanding its military capability in an attempt to shed its post-war pacifism
today the izumo , a helicopter carrier as big as the imperial navy aircraft carriers that battled the u.s. in the pacific , was delivered to the navy in a crowning achievement for the nation 's military forces
with a crew of 470 sailors , it is a highly visible example of how japan is expanding the capability of its military to operate overseas as prime minister abe seeks lawmaker approval to loosen the restraints of japan 's pacifist post-war constitution
the huge warship is considered symbolic of japan 's growing military capabilities the 248metre ( 813ft ) long warship resembles u.s. marine corp amphibious assault carriers in size and design but it is designated as a helicopter destroyer - a label that allows japan to keep within the bounds of a constitutional ban on owning the means to wage war
' japan is also adding longer - range patrol aircraft and military cargo planes to its defence capability , and buying f-35 fighter jets , amphibious assault vehicles and boeing 's osprey troop carrier , which can operate from the izumo
president abe 's attempts to ease japan 's pacifist constitution and its build up in defence capabilities is unnerving neighbour china
soldiers march and salute on the deck of the massive warship , which is capable of holding a maximum of 28 aircraft however , japan classes it as a helicopter destroyer , a label that allows it to keep within the bounds of a constitutional ban on owning the means to wage war general nakatani , japan 's defense minister , speaks to naval soldiers during the commissioning ceremony of the izumo warship soldiers untangle a rope on board the aircraft carrier , which measures 250m in length japan 's constitution , known as the peace constitution , is most famous for the renunciation of the right to wage war
it was drawn up under the allied occupation which followed the second world war and was intended to replace japan 's previous militaristic and absolute monarchy system with liberal democracy
