budi , an adorable baby orangutan , is on the road to recovery after an animal shelter in indonesia rescued him
the 15 - month - old was on the brink of death after he was kept in a chicken cage and fed nothing but condensed milk for the first year of his life
now budi is well enough to eat on his own , walk and climb
when budi arrived at international animal rescue 's orangutan rescue center in ketapang , his condition was extremely critical
budi 's " eyes fill with tears ever time he 's moved by the doctors and he screams in pain , " said dr. karmele llano sanchez , international animal rescue 's program director in indonesia
the owner said that she was afraid to give the animal any fruit and believed that giving budi only condensed milk was enough , handayani said
