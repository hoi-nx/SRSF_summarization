labour rounded on more than 100 of britain 's top business leaders today after they backed the tory ' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a ' change of course '
but ed miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the tories were on the side of ' a few big firms and individuals at the top '
shadow business secretary umunna , meanwhile , dismissed the signatories as a ' cosy little club ' , while labour peer john precott went further criticising them as ' tax dodgers , tory voters and non-doms '
the business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as primark , iceland , ladbrokes and costa coffee
however , mr ed miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election
' mr umunna went further dismissed it as a ' letter organised by the tory in a conservative - supporting newspaper ' after it was first published in the daily telegraph
but mr david cameron , touring marston 's brewery 's brewery in the wolverhampton today , said the letter from business leaders was ' very powerful '
david cameron and george osborne visited marston 's brewery in wolverhampton today on the second full day of the general election campaign mr david cameron said the letter from business leaders was ' very powerful ' while the chancellor claimed it was ' unprecedented ' tory officials said the number of signatories to the open letter ( above ) made it ' unprecedented ' in the history of britain general elections he said : ' today it is an unprecedented intervention by some of the business leaders in the best - known business , large and small , in our country saying the tory long - term plan is working , generating jobs
' deputy pm nick clegg said the letter was a tribute to the work of the coalition government , and claimed an outright tory win would â pose a very real threat â to britain âs stability
' however , the lib dem business secretary vince cable said the signatories were ' not exactly representative ' of the business community and should ' be careful what they wish for ' , accusing some of signing up ' naively ' to a tory stunt
the business leaders were particularly positive about mr george osborne 's strategy of seeking to encourage investment by slashing corporation tax , which fell to 20 per cent this week , having stood at 28 per cent when the government came to power in 2010
' david cameron and george osborne 's flagship policy of progressively lowering corporation tax to 20 per cent has been very important in showing the britain is open for business
