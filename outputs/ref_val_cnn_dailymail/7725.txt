she was the barefooted sixties singer who secured uk âs first ever eurovision title , so it would be fair to expect her to take centre stage at the contest âs 60th anniversary celebrations
but sandie shaw yesterday claimed she had been snubbed
the 68 - year - old said she was bemused as to why the bbc had not invited her to take part in the eurovision âs greatest hits concert and urged her fans to email the tv show âs executive producer guy to ask why
since then just four other uk entrants have taken first place in the contest
but despite her special place in eurovision history , the singer was not invited to perform and also claimed her offer to help with hosting â did not receive a positive response â
the star took to her facebook page late on monday to post : â hi guy âs i have had a few messages asking why i am not doing the eurovision 60 years celebration i ca nât answer the question so why not ask the man organising it here
â miss sandie shaw âs fans deluged the show âs executive producer with angry emails insisting she be included , until miss sandie shaw was forced to remove his contact details from her post
miss sandie shaw was the barefooted sixties singer who secured uk âs first ever title at the eurovision in vienna in april 1967 ( pictured ) she took europe by storm with her song puppet on a string , which won the coveted eurovision title by 47 votes miss sandie shaw said : â i have not offered to sing on it
â miss sandie shaw âs clash with the bbc and the decision not to include her comes at a time when the broadcaster has faced repeated criticism for failing to properly represent older women in their programming
but despite her special place in eurovision history , the singer was not invited to perform and also claimed her offer to help with hosting â did not receive a positive response â in 2012 mark thompson , the then director general of the bbc , admitted there were not enough older women broadcasting on the corporation , especially in â iconic roles and on iconic topical programmes
â eurovision âs greatest hits will be presented by graham norton and sweden comedian and presenter petra mede and will be broadcast on bbc and throughout europe this easter
the eurovision final will take place after the concert on may 23rd and will be hosted in vienna for the first time since miss sandie shaw won there in 1969 , making her absence from the concert all the more significant
brotherhood of man were the first uk band to win with save your kisses for me in 1976 , bucks fizz , who formed specifically for eurovision , sang their way to first place with making your mind up in 1981 and in 1997 katrina & the waves became the first uk winner in 16 years with love shine a light
a spokesman for the bbc said : â eurovision âs greatest hits is a special event co-produced by the bbc and ebu kick - starting the 60th anniversary of the world âs favourite song contest
