new york mueller , kassig , henning , haines -- just a few of the aid workers who have been abducted and killed by isis in the past year
the exact number of aid workers currently being held is unknown ; a level of secrecy tends to surround details of those currently captive
what we do know is isis holds at least one female aid worker , and possibly more
the international federation of the red cross confirmed three aid workers who disappeared in october 2013 remain missing , but would not comment on their identities or who kidnapped them
abductions and killings of aid workers are , unfortunately , nothing new , but the numbers are
according to aidworkersecurity.org , at least 155 aid workers were killed in 2013 , a 121 % increase on 70 recorded killings the year before
not all were victims of isis , a relatively new phenomenon given life by the chaos in embattled syria
in fact , according to the same report , it is the taliban who have historically kidnapped in the greatest numbers , in large part in afghanistan
here 's the difference : isis is changing the game
the need for aid in a specific region and the level of the acceptance by the community matters , or mattered
abducted aid workers are usually either a source of considerable income ( isis demanded at least $ 6 million for mueller , and reportedly $ 200 million for two japanese hostages ) or , failing that , their killings provide a lurid display of brutality for the world to witness
" the response in large part from aid agencies has not been to pull out of syria and its environs altogether , but to rely almost exclusively on local staffers
still , outside workers like mueller , kassig , henning and haines were inside syria when they were taken , and the regional directors of aid agencies continue to travel there frequently in order to oversee operations
not only that , but simply by virtue of working for a large aid agency , local staffers become bait
isis does n't just target aid workers
but in the wild west that is syria and its borders , few of these remain , save for aid workers
in a space devoid of government , refugee camps and aid agencies are frequently seen as the only authorities , the new front line in the war on terror , a sometimes unwelcome association
and as isis spreads beyond syria 's borders , the risks grow further afield
yet despite these risks , thousands of aid workers continue to work in a region where the u.n. high commissioner for refugees ( u.n. ) estimates the number of refugees from conflict at more than 8 million
while some aid agencies rely on security personnel for protection , many are completely unarmed and are particularly vulnerable when in transit
when cnn approached a number of reputable aid agencies asking to speak to those who work or travel in the region about their experiences , and what drives them to remain despite an unprecedented threat level , many declined , in large part due to security concerns
there 's not going to be another organization that 's going to come and do more humanitarian aid and cover the gap that iocc may create , that 's not going to happen
you feel that there are populations and people that need aid and require assistance , and know it 's a choice that one makes and dedicate your life service
it 's hard ; there are some areas where the family and friends do n't understand why you 're going there , and you re-articulate , " if not you , then who ? " and you ask , " would you want this in your neighborhood next door where no one comes to help you if something bad happened ?
