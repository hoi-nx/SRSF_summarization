israeli 's ruling likud pulled off a victory in tuesday 's election -- and it was a stunning one
during the campaign , incumbent prime minister netanyahu had come in for heavy criticism from across the political spectrum , for reasons ranging from concerns over his frosty relationship with the white house , to his fixation on the iran nuclear issue , to allegations over netanyahu 's household expenses
overall , the election results seemed to reflect the rightward shift of the electorate , with even voters who self - identify as centrists consistently expressing conservative positions on both the palestinian issue and broader questions of national security
meanwhile , the numbers for the left in tuesday 's election -- a four seats for meretz , 24 for the zionist union and 14 for the arab list suggests the bloc is some 20 seats short of a viable coalition
that raises the question over what direction the government will take over national security , and on this , the government can probably be expected to pursue the status quo
this is despite the fact that growing instability and the proliferation of non-state hostile actors suggests that israeli should instead move beyond a short - term approach and toward building a long - term , comprehensive national security strategy that could make it an integrated regional power
and that suggests that he will find it easier to focus on issues tied to the economy than making any real steps forward on building a comprehensive long - tern national security strategy
those hoping that the prime minister might rethink his national security policies are likely to be disappointed again .
