the scientists behind the ' pee - power ' toilet hope it can be used by aid agencies in disaster zones to supply much - needed electricity to refugee camps
the technology uses microbial fuel stacks in the toilets , which feed on urine , creating biochemical energy that can be turned into electricity
the scientists behind the ' pee - power ' toilet hope it can be used by aid agencies in disaster zones to supply much - needed electricity to refugee camps the urinal is the result of a partnership between researchers at the university of the west of england in bristol and oxfam
' the microbial fuel cells ( mfc ) work by employing live microbes which feed on urine for their own growth and maintenance , ' explained professor ieropoulos
students and staff are being asked to use the urinal to donate pee to fuel the microbial fuel cell stacks that generate electricity to power indoor lighting
the research team is led by professor ieropoulos , of the bristol robotics laboratory at bristol , who is an expert at harnessing power from unusual sources using microbial fuel cells
' work by the bristol bioenergy centre hit the headlines in 2013 when the team demonstrated that electricity generated by microbial fuel cell stacks could power a mobile phone
' the microbial fuel cell is in effect a system which taps a portion of that biochemical energy used for microbial growth , and converts that directly into electricity - what we are calling urine - tricity or pee power
the toilet is located near the students ' union at bristol university 's frenchay campus and researchers will be hoping for brisk business at closing time.students and staff are being asked to use the urinal to donate pee to fuel the microbial fuel cell stacks that generate electricity to power indoor lighting andy bastable , head of water and sanitation at oxfam , said : ' oxfam is an expert at providing sanitation in disaster zones , and it is always a challenge to light inaccessible areas far from a power supply
prof ieropoulos added : ' one microbial fuel cell costs about Â£ 1 ( $ 1.5 ) to make , and we think that a small unit like the demo we have mocked up for this experiment could cost as little as Â£ 600 ( $ 900 ) to set up , which is a significant bonus as this technology is in theory everlasting
