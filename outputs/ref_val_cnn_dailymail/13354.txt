the fbi is asking detectives across the country to dust off their cold case murder files and see whether millionaire heir robert durst could be connected to any other unsolved crimes
robert durst , the focus of hbo 's true crime documentary series " the jinx , " was charged with first - degree murder last week in the 2000 killing of his longtime confidante , berman
now the fbi is putting out a call to local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where robert durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said
unsolved cases in vermont , new york , the san francisco bay area and southern california are among those getting a new look , the official said
robert durst 's attorney , deguerin , said it 's a sign that authorities are desperate
" robert durst , who authorities believe has a net worth of $ 100 million , has lived in numerous places and owned property in at least four states , according to court documents and public records
in " the jinx , " robert durst describes the time he spent living in vermont with his first wife , kathleen , running a health food store in the 1970s
her family members say they believe she 's dead and that robert durst is the one to blame
last week , police searched condos robert durst owns in houston as part of the investigation into berman 's death
investigators know robert durst was in southern california the week berman died
it 's a detail robert durst shrugs off in the hbo documentary , in which he denied he had anything to do with berman 's death and said , " southern california 's a big state
" authorities investigating a decades - old cold case in vermont said monday that there 's a connection between robert durst and the case of lynne schulze , a college student who disappeared from middlebury college in 1971
" hanley elaborated tuesday on the nature of the connection , saying robert durst owned a health food store where schulze shopped the day she disappeared
deguerin 's attorney brushed off the accusation monday
" the name of the health food store , " all good things , " was also the title of a 2010 film starring ryan gosling and kirsten dunst that was a thinly veiled fictional take on the robert durst case
" robert durst says in the documentary that he had traveled during the week of berman 's death to trinidad , southern california , a small coastal city in northern southern california
and it was a place , robert durst says , where he lived " off and on
the police chief said investigators were interested in learning what robert durst has to say about that case now that he 's behind bars
" we are certainly interested in any information that may or may not come out of interviews with mr. robert durst , " police chief andy mills said
" according to local news reports at the time of mitchell 's disappearance , she was last seen leaning into a light blue car that she might have gotten into
a witness gave police a description of the man behind the wheel , which resulted in a sketch of a gray - haired man with glasses -- a drawing that journalist birkbeck says looks remarkably like robert durst
he was wearing those glasses back in the day and it 's also in the composite , " said birkbeck , whose book , " a deadly secret , " chronicles robert durst 's life and run - ins with the law
