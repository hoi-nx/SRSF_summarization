the 21 - year - old midfielder was part of the newcastle who moved to glasgow on loan at the end of the transfer window â but has not kicked a ball for the ibrox club
rangers are believed to be paying a total of Â£ 5,000 - per - week for the loan deals of kevin mbabu , shane ferguson , remie street and haris vuckic
bigirimana has not played for rangers since his loan move from newcastle but along with bigirimana , kevin mbabu and shane ferguson have not been fit enough to play , while remie street has played less than 45minutes
bigirimana says he knew he was ill before he moved to rangers â it âs obviously disappointing but my disappointment can not change what has happened and what is happening
