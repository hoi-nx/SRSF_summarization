a stunning mountain lake , a stretch of rocky shoreline and several sites of ancient woodland , home to red deer and red squirrels , are among eight sites being sold by the lakeland
but the sale has provoked anger among locals who say it would have lakeland poet william wordsworth â turning in his grave â
the possible sale of beautiful countryside in the lakeland such as blea brows , an area of shoreline alongside coniston water on the market for Â£ 90,000 , has angered locals stickle tarn , a glacial lake popular with swimmers in great langdale , is up for sale with a guide price of Â£ 20,000 to Â£ 30,000 they are angry that they were not consulted about the decision to sell the picturesque sites â worth a total of up to Â£ 665,000 â and at the â sheer speed â of the sale , which is being rushed through in five weeks
perhaps the most impressive site is stickle tarn , a â majestic â 24 - acre glacial lake in great langdale , high above coniston water and windermere , which is popular with wild swimmers
the lakeland , the government - funded body responsible for managing the park , insists strict covenants on the land ensure the sites will be protected for the public and rights of way will not be affected
but some locals fear access could be restricted , woodland and historic dry stone walls may not be properly managed and that wealthy buyers may apply for planning permission to build on the land
