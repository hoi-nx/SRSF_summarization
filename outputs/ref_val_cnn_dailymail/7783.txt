a mother has helped her own son become a father - by carrying his child as a surrogate
in a procedure believed to be a world first , a fertility clinic arranged the woman âs pregnancy using a donor egg and her son âs sperm
she offered to have the baby â with her husband âs consent â after plans by their son to have an ivf child with another female relative collapsed
the high court ( pictured ) heard how a fertility clinic arranged the woman âs pregnancy using a donor egg and her son âs sperm the extraordinary arrangement emerged when a high court judge ruled that the son can now adopt the baby boy and become his legal father â even though in the eyes of the law he is also the infant âs brother
however , the move was met with howls of protest by critics , who described the procedure as â dubious â and called for urgent reforms to prevent abuses of fertility law
mrs justice theis ( pictured ) did not identify the family , the clinic or the local authority in the area where they live the judge said he discussed the issue openly with family and close friends and arranged for another relative to act as surrogate mother , but the woman dropped out because of a medical condition
mrs justice theis said that under the 2008 human fertilisation and embryology act , which governs surrogacy arrangements , the woman who carried the child is the legal mother
her husband is the legal father because he consented to the pregnancy
rules stipulate that a surrogate mother must hand over a child to two parents â usually a couple â in an enduring family relationship â
a report described how the baby â clearly has formulated a secure attachment to the father â , adding : â the father understands that the child will need to know about how he was conceived and feels that he will utilise the security of the family structure to support his son in understanding that he is a very much wanted child
the woman offered to have the baby â with her husband âs consent â after plans by their son to have an ivf child with another female relative collapsed ( file picture ) â the strength of these familial relationships , and the consequent support they provide now and in the future , will ensure the child âs lifelong needs are met , â she added
if the hfea considers this to be a legal procedure , there is an urgent need to look at the law again
