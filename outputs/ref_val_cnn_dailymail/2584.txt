the man who invented the coffee pods used by millions of americans in their k-cup instant brewing machines has admitted he regrets ever coming up with the design
in an interview with the atlantic , sylvan , who came up with the idea for the coffee pods and the machine in the early 1990s , revealed that he ' feels bad ' about the negative impact that the pods are having on the environment
' mr sylvan , who co-founded the company with peter dragone , added that the unique plastic used in the k-cup - known as plastic # 7 - is only recyclable in a small number of cities in canada , and can not as yet be processed yet in the americans
adverts for k-cup featuring the slogan ' brew the love ' , enticed americans audiences
and in england thousands of customers have been lured into buying nespresso machines following similar adverts featuring george clooney
mr sylvan also confessed that despite his earlier dedication to the brand , he no longer drinks coffee made using the capsules
in 1995 he had to go to hospital with heart palpitations after testing up to 40 cups of his coffee a day
he now no longer even owns a k-cup machine and only drinks filter coffee
george clooney has helped popularise the nespresso brand in the uk , a similar version of the k-cup damaging : k-cup has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of k-cup sold in 2014 alone would circle the earth 12 times if they were laid down end - to - end k-cup has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of k-cup sold in 2014 alone , and subsequently put into landfills , would circle the earth a staggering 12 times if they were laid down end - to - end
but despite the continued criticism , keurig green mountain , the brewing system 's parent company , has yet to come up with a viable solution to the problem , despite insisting that they have been trying to find an environmentally - friendly alternative since 2006
' alternative option : mr sylvan insists that he has managed to create a new design for the k-cup which would be far more environmentally - friendly than the ones currently being used not according to mr sylvan
but while mr sylvan is convinced that he holds the answer to k-cup 's ongoing environmental concerns , he added that the company have thus far refused to trial his new design
