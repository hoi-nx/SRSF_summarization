a 3,000 - year - old armenian settlement believed they could predict the future by using sheep and cow bones - and what they revealed on one occasion caused them to suddenly flee their homes
in a series of three bronze age shrines , archaeologists have found knucklebones of animals with certain sides blackened - like the markings on dice - as well as stamp seals printed onto pieces of dough

dice - like knucklebones used for osteomancy and coloured stones used for lithomancy were found deep within the ruins of the fallen citadel of gegharot
aleuromancy is a likely explanation for grinding implements found in another of three shrines
