cameron kicked off the tory election campaign yesterday with an intensely personal attack on ed and his â hopeless , sneering socialists â
mr cameron âs withering reference to the north london borough associated with â champagne socialists â comes after mr ed was ridiculed last year for claiming in his party conference speech to have met ordinary voters on hampstead heath , a short walk from his Â£ 2.6million home
he told supporters at his party âs spring forum in manchester that the tory were â the real party of aspiration , of working people â the party that is with you , not against you is not that bunch of hypocritical , holier - than - thou , hopeless , sneering socialists â
speaking at the itv studios where coronation street was filmed , mr cameron also compared mr ed unfavourably to his predecessors , saying labour was â not the party of clement attlee , who built the nhs ... not the party of wilson and his â white heat of technology â ... not even the party of john smith , who believed so passionately in the dignity of work
