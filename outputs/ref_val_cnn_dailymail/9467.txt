miliband yesterday took the ' hello - isation ' of general election coverage to a whole new level
he invited itv 's breakfast telly to accompany him on the school run with his little sons
boo-boo and hee-hee were in fact fictional beings of mr miliband 's creation and they lived on a place called faraway planet
' nobody visits them because they are far away , ' explained mr miliband with a logic so faultless you could almost call it marxist
he and his wide - eyed sons were walking down a north london street , accompanied by no one â except , that is , an itv film crew
can anyone remind me of mr miliband 's position about press intrusion into private lives ? any idea that it was normal for mr miliband to take the little ones to school was soon dashed
miliband 's ' functional kitchenette ' was slammed as dingy and unhomely when it featured on the bbc the rest of itv 's interview was conducted at the milibands ' house , the children by now having been parked
miliband was asked about his brother david â the one he stiffed for the labour crown
he mentioned mr miliband 's lovely wife justine , noted how busy their lives were , and asked our would - be prime minister : ' how do you keep the romance going ? ' strewth
how much detail were we after here ? even mr miliband looked a bit staggered at this descent into bedroom territory
enough , enough ! the interview was the last in itv 's breakfast tv one - to - ones with the party leaders
