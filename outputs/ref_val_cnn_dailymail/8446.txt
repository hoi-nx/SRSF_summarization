a former waitress was awarded $ 1million eight years after her nightclub owner boss was convicted for sexually abusing and forcibly touching her in a storage closet at work
slama , 30 , was working at the now - shuttered new york club quo in december 2007 when her employer , malhotra , told her he wanted to talk to her about a job opportunity at a new venue
that 's when malhotra pushed slama into the closet , blocking the door with his body , and offered the waitress cocaine before asking if he could snort a line off her body , salma 's lawsuit claimed
malhotra then grabbed her backside and chest and , according to the suit , told slama he would sniff cocaine off her breast as she cried out for him to stop
malhorta was convicted of sexual abuse , harassment and forcible touching in 2009
in 2010 slama filed a $ 3.5million civil suit against her former boss , suing him for sexual harassment and mental anguish
but malhorta delayed slama 's case for years because he claimed he was going to appeal the criminal conviction
