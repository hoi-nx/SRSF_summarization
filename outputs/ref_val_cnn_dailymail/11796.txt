animal behaviour experts had warned that this morning âs eclipse could make owls more alert , sheep feel sleepy and change the flight of moths
and while some animal lovers have taken to twitter to describe how their cat â went nuts â or dog looked confused , some say pets and farm animals did nât react at all to the astronomical phenomenon
the partial eclipse saw skies across the uk darken at around 9.30am as the moon travelled in front of the sun , casting a shadow over earth
this image shows the partial eclipse in penzance , cornwall before the event , dave clarke , head of invertebrates at london told mailonline : â a solar eclipse , especially a full eclipse , could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies - who use the light for navigation
â while the zoo had prepared by amending the lighting slightly in butterfly paradise , it said that in the end , it was â pretty underwheming â with no strange behaviour seen
an expert from london told mailonline that the eclipse could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies ( an owl butterfly is shown ) this may be because the skies of london were grey and cloudy
the royal zoological society scotland said there was also no unusual activity at edinburgh either
however , many people took to twitter to say it was eerily quiet during the eclipse , with birds falling silent , as predicted
brilliant # eclipse â , while robert thompson said : â eclipse is weird even though cloudy the sky has almost a lilac haze , the birds have gone and the wind has stopped eerie out there
â kitty gallannaugh in london said : ' it 's just kind of dusky flat light here and all the birds have gone silent
' broom , emeritus professor of animal welfare at the university of cambridge , told mailonline earlier this week that the most people would notice that many of the common birds stop singing and some may move to higher perches or more secluded spots to feel safer
' farm animals out in the fields might stop grazing and move to a more sheltered place as they do at night , ' he said , before adding that because all animals have 24 hour body clocks , they know it is not night time but that something unusual is going on , â he added

' he predicted that dogs would probably be more alert and pay more attention to what 's going on around them more than usual because they will be ' slightly surprised '
there were reports of pet dogs howling and running around on twitter , although battersea dogs and cats home in london â saw absolutely no changes in behaviour in our animals â
kat williams tweeted : â did anyone else 's animals get proper weird over the eclipse ? rachel [ a dog ] was chewing the armchair & generally acting like a little weirdo , to which jason a leaman replied : â our hens went to bed ! â zoos in london , chester and edinburgh said that animals did not behave particularly strangely during the eclipse , but these lemurs at chester zoo , seem to be admiring the strange sight professor broom also said that pet dogs and cats would probably be ' slightly disturbed ' by the eclipse and some twitter users seem to have confirmed his theory , however , this dog waiting for the event with its eclipse glasses on , looks quite relaxed the eclipse saw up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in london and around 94 per cent in glasgow , aberdeen and edinburgh
she said : ' diurnal animals - those that are awake during the day - do what they usually do at night : sleep ! â dragonflies hide under a leaf , ants return to their nest , sheep walk back to their sleeping place , cattle egrets ( heron - like birds ) return to their nocturnal roost , diurnal grasshoppers chirp more slowly and then stop
â â nocturnal animals become active : owls hoot , bats fly , blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning , cocks crow , nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping , and so on
â it was also predicted that bees may become more active during the partial eclipse , based on a study conducted in india
