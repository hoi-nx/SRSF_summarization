a double murderer and two other convicted killers have been granted clemency by indonesia president joko widodo , while two of the bali nine ringleaders remain on death row and could be executed within weeks
soon after andrew chan and myuran sukumaran were denied clemency , trisna firmansyah had his death sentence reduced to life
the 28 - year - old was one of three killers involved in the robbery and planned murder of a shop owner and his son in april 2012 , the jakarta post reported
this week , a senior source from the indonesia presidential palace told abc an additional two murderers had had their death sentences overturned by mr joko widodo
the three men were sentenced to death in september 2012 , but on friday firmansyah 's lawyer asep ruhiat was notified of mr joko widodo 's decision to grant him clemency
their appeal to the supreme court earlier this year failed , but firmansyah was then shown mercy amid the indonesia president 's tirade against convicted drug smugglers
president joko widodo ( left ) has adopted a hardline approach to drug smugglers but has spared murderer firmansyah mercy , reducing his death sentence to life behind bars this comes after it was revealed andrew chan and myuran sukumaran could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals
it has been revealed by the indonesia attorney - general prasetyo that the execution of the bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row
this could delay the pair 's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out
the indonesia governor - general has said the death row inmates will be executed ' simultaneously ' myuran sukumaran , left , and andrew chan , right , will be put through an ' assimilation ' process as they prepare to face the firing squad this means andrew chan and myuran sukumaran may have months to wait before they face the firing squad
prison authorities claim there 's been no order to move mr andrew chan and mr myuran sukumaran from ' death island ' even though the appeals process may be lengthy
although the appeals process may be lengthy there have been no orders to transfer mr myuran sukumaran and mr andrew chan from the prison referred to as ' death island ' president joko widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores the pair 's lawyers will return to jakarta court on thursday to challenge president joko widodo 's decision to deny clemency to all drug offenders
two weeks earlier , the administrative court dismissed their argument that president joko widodo failed to consider their rehabilitation
the australian government , alongside several notable public figures , have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of mr andrew chan and mr myuran sukumaran
