after spending much of her 2008 campaign seemingly running away from the fact that she is a woman , hillary clinton is showing signs that 2016 is going to be a different story
it seems that hillary clinton has found her outer woman , which is to say , she 's found the person that she wants to present on the campaign trail , and that person is resolutely female
of course , hillary clinton has n't officially announced that she will be running for president -- and universal studios has not officially announced that there will be a sequel to the blockbuster " 50 shades of grey
hillary clinton recently spoke at a silicon valley conference for women in the tech field with the theme of " lead on
" that lent itself nicely to the professional goals of the members of the audience as well as to hillary clinton 's own leadership goals
left unsaid in her speech was any reference to the complete lack of a female occupant of the oval office thus far , but the thought could not have been far from anyone 's mind , let alone hillary clinton 's
clinton was comfortable talking at length about her own experiences being pregnant and giving birth while working as a partner in a law firm , and using that as a launching pad to discuss the importance of women in the workforce both here and around the world
and all of that dovetailed perfectly into closing remarks about the future that revolved naturally around the birth in september of clinton 's first grandchild , charlotte clinton mezvinsky
the silicon valley address could serve as a template for how clinton intends to approach her career goals from the vantage point of being a woman seeking her own place in the workforce
all of which stands in stark contrast to hillary clinton 's last presidential campaign
in 2008 , she seemed to think that she had to reassure voters that a woman could be president , primarily by not accentuating the fact that she was a woman
in that previous campaign , hillary clinton ran as the most experienced candidate , primarily to draw a distinction between herself and her relatively less experienced challenger , obama
but now , almost eight years later , clinton can let her experience speak for itself
hillary clinton 's stressing of the importance of women 's workplace issues both to the family and to the struggles of the middle - class puts the republicans on the defensive as they try to co-opt middle - class economic issues
among topics that are sometimes seen as more traditional women 's issues such as family planning , access to birth control and the right to choose , hillary clinton has the advantage in that she can make her stance clear , based on her life experiences as a woman
if hillary clinton seems more comfortable running as a woman , it 's partly because society at large seems more comfortable with a populist - tinged feminism than it was in 2008
women have been steadily making strides in the years since hillary clinton 's 2008 campaign , and as they did , they smoothed the way for one of their own to run for the highest office in the land without having to play down her gender
hillary clinton is now wisely embracing her gender as a way of capturing the same " hope and change " historical quality of obama 's presidency
