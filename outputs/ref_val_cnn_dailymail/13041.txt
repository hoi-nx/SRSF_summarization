is philae still alive ? the answer to this particular cosmic cliff - hanger was left unresolved towards the end of last year
but now the comet - chasing mother ship rosetta -- in orbit around 67p -- is to begin listening for signs that the lander has survived the cold and dark
lander system engineer o'rourke told cnn interactive that philae needs 5.5 watts of power to reboot itself , nine watts to switch on the receiver to accept communications and 19 watts to activate its transmitter and allow two - way communication with the orbiter
on tuesday , @ esa_rosetta tweeted : " excited ! i have some opportunities to listen for @ philae2014 to find out if he 's awake ! " rosetta and philae 's love affair on twitter on the rosetta mission blog , lander project manager stephan ulamec says : " it will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up , but it is worth trying
" the mission website adds that philae could already have woken up but does not yet have sufficient power to communicate with rosetta
it says rosetta will transmit to philae between march 12 and march 20 , listening for a response
problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor philae to the surface failed
o'rourke explained that as the comet nears the sun , philae 's original landing spot would have exposed it to temperatures that would have burned out its electronics
from lander pictures , mission controllers think philae , which is about the size of a washing machine , is tucked up underneath a cliff face , affording it some shade
beginning thursday , mission controllers will send what o'rourke described as " blind commands " to philae in the hope that the lander has enough power to receive instructions even if it ca n't respond
if philae revives it could be witness to an amazing show as the comet makes its closest approach to the sun in august
the mission has detected organic chemicals on the comet surface , though full details of that discovery have yet to be revealed
" the rosetta mission is not just about the lander
