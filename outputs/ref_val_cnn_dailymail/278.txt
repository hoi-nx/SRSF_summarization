hillary clinton , attempting to quiet concerns about the security of her private email system , said tuesday she never discussed classified information over email
and if hackers tried to obtain copies of her communications , they could n't have , clinton said , because she had ' numerous safeguards ' in place to protect her home - brewed server
' it was on property guarded by the secret service , and there were no security breaches , ' clinton said at a press conference
security experts remain doubtful , however , that clinton 's emails contained only unclassified information and warn that her email or server could have been hacked without her knowledge - possibly exposing sensitive communications between the former secretary of state and the president
the white house acknowledged on monday that clinton and obama did email each other from time to time
the national security administration technician who was in charge of the team that built president obama âs specialized blackberry , george , said it 's unlikely the president ever said anything to clinton over email that could be seen as damaging if exposed
a q and a document sent to reporters by clinton 's staff after the former state department official 's tuesday afternoon briefing with the press asserted that ' robust protections were put in place ' by the secretary and updated as needed
' it was on property guarded by the secret service , and there were no security breaches , ' clinton said at a press conference south carolina republicans gowdy , head of the task force that ' s investigating the 2012 benghazi terrorist attack to determine what knowledge the state department possessed - if any - that could have prevented the assault , said tuesday afternoon that clinton should be required to turn over the server for inspection
she also needs to answer lingering , ' serious questions ' about the security of the system she employed , ' he said in a statement , and ' who had access to the server from the time secretary clinton left office until the time â almost two years later â the state department asked for these public records back
clinton says gave the state department copies of all her work - related emails , yet ' without access to secretary clinton 's personal server , there is no way for the state department to know it has acquired all documents that should be made public , ' gowdy said
' reporters flooded the united nation 's headquarters on tuesday to listen to former secretary of state hillary clinton answer questions about her use of a private email system while serving in president obama 's cabinet
a q and a document sent to reporters after the briefing asserted that ' robust protections were put in place ' by clinton and updated as needed another concern of government officials is that clinton deliberated classified information via her personal email address , which is against the law
' classified information was viewed in hard copy by the secretary while in the office , ' the statement from her office distributed on tuesday said
' even if clinton did confer with her colleagues about classified topics over email , ' there âs zero chance that she âll be charged with unauthorized retention of classified information , because she decides what âs classified , ' steven aftergood , director of the project on government secrecy at the federation of american scientists , told the times
