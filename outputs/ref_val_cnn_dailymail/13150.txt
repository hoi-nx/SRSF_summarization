fifty years after its premiere , " the sound of music " is still among millions of fans ' favorite things
the julie andrews film , about the von trapp family and its " problem " governess , maria , is beloved enough to have spawned audience singalongs
the film even prompted a live nbc musical , which -- though it was roasted by critics -- still managed stupendous ratings
the movie , which premiered on march 2 , 1965 , went on to earn five oscars -- including best picture -- and grossed more than $ 110 million in its initial run , equal to about $ 800 million in today 's money
that made it one of the most successful movies of all time at the box office , up there with " gone with the wind , " and it was n't truly surpassed until " the godfather " came out in 1972
