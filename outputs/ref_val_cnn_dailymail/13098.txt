kano , nigerian more than 50 people were killed and scores wounded in a series of suicide bombings in northern nigerian on saturday , witnesses and authorities told cnn
four suicide bombers -- three women and a man -- carried out the attacks , according to witnesses
but the islamist extremist group boko haram has been behind many similar attacks in northern nigerian and beyond , killing hundreds in recent months as part of its terrorist campaign to bring its twisted version of sharia law to the region
clement adoda , a borno state state police spokesman , said at least 54 people were killed and another 139 wounded in the suicide attacks
the next attack took place about an hour later outside monday market , the main one in the city , where people were lined up to go through security
those measures -- in which people are checked for explosives and guns -- were set up because of the spate of boko haram attacks in the city and region
such attacks , sadly , are nothing new for borno state , one of those hit hardest by boko haram and the nigerian military 's campaign to stop them
