the bizarre protest featured several women and men clutching dolls to their chests in an apparent reference to the ukip leader âs comments that nursing mothers should â sit in the corner â
he claimed his two youngest children were so scared by the protesters that they ran away and hid mr farage said his daughters , victoria , 15 , and ten - year - old isabelle were missing for a short time yesterday afternoon before the police returned them to the family home
after hounding him out of the queen 's head in downe , kent , protesters surrounded his car , kicking it and jumping on his bonnet as his wife , kirsten , tried to drive him away
the ukip leader later told the mail : â we were having a pleasant sunday and then suddenly the mob descended
they also attacked my car as my wife drove me off
â the protest âs organisers denied mr farage âs children were scared and ran away
pictures posted on twitter as mrs farage tried to drive off showed a woman lying on the car bonnet as others banged the roof and windows
