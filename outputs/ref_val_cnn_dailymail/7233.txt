the family of murdered colorado student claire has said if littleton public schools make all details regarding the incident public , they will agree to never sue the school district
davis , the father of the arapahoe high school senior who was shot at point - blank range by student pierson in 2013 , put forward the proposal on monday
if the district accepts the terms , claire 's family would sign a binding agreement to never seek damages against it or its staff in exchange for learning everything the school knows about the murder
pierson had intended to target debate coach tracy murphy ( right ) this comes following criticism last year that the district did not act on warnings that they received indicating that pierson was dangerous
and police later revealed that pierson had intended to target his debate coach tracy murphy - months after he had already shouted a death threat against the coach in a school hallway

she would not have had time to get out of the way as pierson entered the school and started shooting just after 12.30pm that day police said the incident had been extremely brief , lasting one minute and 17 seconds from the time pierson entered the building armed with the shotgun , several rounds of ammunition , and three petrol bombs , to the point where he shot himself ( above students comfort each other following the shooting two years ago ) a friend who was with claire at the time dragged her to safety in a nearby yoga class , according to the denver post
sheriff robinson said that pierson legally purchased the shotgun on december 6 , a full week before the incident ( above students meet with their relieved parents at a fast food restaurant across from the high school following the incident in 2013 ) if the district agrees to accept mr davis ' proposal , it would join an arbitration proceeding waiving forms of governmental immunity and make all records concerning the incident available to the public , but some allowances would be made for protecting personal privacy ( above students gathered for a candlelight vigil after the shooting ) if the district agrees to accept mr davis ' proposal , it would join an arbitration proceeding waiving forms of governmental immunity and make all records concerning the incident available to the public , but some allowances would be made for protecting personal privacy
