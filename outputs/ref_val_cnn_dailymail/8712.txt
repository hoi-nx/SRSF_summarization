a paramedic who abandoned patients in an ambulance while he went shopping and had a hair cut has been found guilty of misconduct at a health tribunal
colella , who has resigned from the london ambulance service , twice ' held his colleagues to ransom ' by forcing them to wait until his return before they could be driven to hospital
the health and care professions council ( hcpc ) sitting at a hearing in kennington , south london , today ruled he was guilty of misconduct relating to two incidents in march 2013 and he was struck off the medical register
colella , who was not present at the hearing , was found guilty of two counts of misconduct while working with the london ambulance service in the first incident , an 85 - year - old man who collapsed in the queue in a marks and spencer store from severe blood poisoning was forced to wait for 20 minutes in the back of an ambulance
colella , who failed to turn up at the hearing , had returned to the store and came back with two full bags of shopping before driving him to hospital on march 9 , 2013
i waited 20 minutes for colella while alone in the ambulance
' the panel heard how colella left a patient in an ambulance with a colleague for 20 minutes while he did some shopping in a marks and spencer ( file picture ) just two weeks later , while responding to another potentially life - threatening 999 call , he delayed a 40 - year - old patient with a head injury from being taken to hospital and left him in the care of a more junior practitioner so he could have his hair cut
chairman of the panel , gillian fleming , said members of the public would be ' shocked ' to know a paramedic could show such disregard for his patients saying his ' fitness to practise was impaired '
' ms gillian fleming said colella would be struck off the hcpc register with immediate effect , adding : ' the registrant has shown little in the way of insight or remorse
