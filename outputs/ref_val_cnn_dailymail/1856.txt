yet new research has now challenged the conventional idea that belief in a powerful and judgmental god is necessary to form large , complex civilisations
anthropologists have found that belief in supreme deities often emerged after complex societies had already formed
the stone heads on easter island ( shown above ) are thought by some to represent ancestors of people living there and could be an example of where the belief system helped drive the emergence of complex society the scientists studied the development of religion and cultures on pacific islands that make up austronesia
they examined 96 ancient austronesian cultures - including those on fiji , tonga , hawaii and samoa - that had not had contact with abrahamic religions like christianity and islam
researchers at north carolina state university found that belief in all - powerful and moralising gods tended to appear at times of hardship in human history
dr watts , an expert in cultural evolution at the university of auckland in new zealand , said : ' we found 22 instances of high political complexity through out historically and geographically distant regions of austronesia
' instead the researchers found that belief in systems of supernatural punishment - such as vengeful spirits - tended to precede the emergence of complex societies and civilisations on the islands
the researchers found that 37 of the cultures sampled had beliefs of this type while just six believed in supreme deities
those that believed in a single all - powerful god tended to be clustered in southeast asia including the bontok and tagbanwa cultures in the philippines , the batak toba people of north sumatra , the manggarai tribes of flores in indonesia
islam is often seen as having been a civilising influence on arab culture in the past and millions now make the pilgrimage to mecca , shown above , every year
but the new research suggests that ancient religions like this that believe in an all powerful god may have emerged after complex cultures had already begun to grow native hawaiians evolved a politically complex society but without belief in a supreme deity
' we suggest that the concept of moralising high gods diffused as part of a suite of traits arising from cultural exchange between complex societies
