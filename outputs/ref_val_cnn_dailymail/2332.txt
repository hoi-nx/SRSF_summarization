a new robot that moves just like a salamander has been created by engineers
the robot , called pleurobot , walks and swims in a life - like way that mimics the shy amphibious creatures
it was developed by recording 3d x-ray videos of short - ribbed salamanders - europe 's largest salamander - allowing researchers to track 64 points on the animal skeleton

they say as it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces , the robot could also be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones
' its engineers say that because it is able to cope with a range of different terrain and squeeze through relatively small spaces , the robot ( pictured ) could be used to help search for people trapped in disaster zones salamanders are remarkable creatures capable of regenerating limbs and researchers at ucl ( ucl ) recently identified the biological pathway involved
