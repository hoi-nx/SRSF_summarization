david lammy , an ex-government minister and barrister , said the likes of luxury goods shop fortnum & mason and mason could more easily absorb the loss
the london mayoral candidate wants the law to be changed so the seriousness of shoplifting is decided by the impact on the victim â rather than the monetary value of the item stolen
but tory london mayor boris johnson today condemned the ' absurd ' idea , insisting it was wrong to ' minimise shoplifting from swish , posh shops '
london mayoral hopeful david lammy says thieves who target wealthy department stores should get lighter sentences than if they steal from a corner shop experts also warned it would make shoplifters more likely to target supermarkets
â mr boris johnson branded mr david lammy 's comments â absurd â
' currently , the law decides what constitutes a â serious â shoplifting offence on the basis of an item âs value
in a pamphlet for the policy exchange think - tank , tottenham mp mr david lammy says : â the impact of a Â£ 150 theft , for example , would be far greater on an independent corner shop than on fortnum & mason , yet this is not reflected under the current act
â it is self - evident that the impact of a Â£ 200 theft to a large retailer is much smaller that it would be to a small , independent retailer
' many rightly argue that the seriousness of shoplifting should not be based on the value , but on the impact to the victim
â less impact : the london mayoral candidate believes thieves should receive more lenient punishments for stealing from stores such as fortnum & mason than from corner shops tory london mayor boris johnson today condemned the ' absurd ' idea , insisting it was wrong to ' minimise shoplifting from swish , posh shops '
but mr david lammy , whose constituency was hit by rioting in 2011 , insists : â as with most types of property crime , the social costs of shoplifting are regressive â they hit poorest communities hardest
mr david lammy 's idea will prove hugely controversial as , for the first time , it would make the wealth of the victim a factor in deciding sentencing â small local businesses in more deprived areas , operating on small profit / loss margins , are least able to absorb the costs of theft and are obliged to pass these costs on to their customers through increased prices
â mr david lammy âs policy exchange report , which will be launched at a speech in london today , warns the police and the courts are turning a blind eye to property crime
