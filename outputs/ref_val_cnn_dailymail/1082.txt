for italy manager conte , tuesday 's friendly against england in turin should have represented a triumphant homecoming to the stadium where he led juventus to three serie a titles before leaving last summer
after all , he remains unbeaten in charge of the italy and saturday night 's 2 - 2 draw in bulgaria keeps them firmly on course to qualify for euro 2016
but instead of being guaranteed a hero 's reception , conte returns ' home ' beset by the same kind of problems that england manager hodgson and fa chief dyke will recognise all too well from the perspective of another struggling superpower
italy manager conte led juventus to a trio of serie a titles before leaving last summer a bitter club vs country row over an injury to juventus midfielder marchisio on international duty has made hodgson 's spat with liverpool boss brendan rodgers over raheem sterling ' tiredgate ' and daniel sturridge look like a vicar 's tea party
john elkann , an influential figure at juventus , said marchisio 's knee sprain on friday - originally diagnosed by the italians fa medical staff as ligament damage - was due to being over-worked and said : ' perhaps conte would like to be remembered as the cherry - picker with the highest number of injuries
in addition , there has been criticism of conte 's decision to include two south american - born players eder and vazquez in his squad due to italy 's declining homegrown talent pool
conte has come under fire following an injury to juventus star marchisio ( right ) against such a malignant backdrop , the italian football federation will be relieved sensible ticket pricing means more families and less embittered juventus supporters will turn up on tuesday to watch two nations who failed together to qualify from the same group at last summer 's world cup
the italy players are certainly behind conte
conte has also been criticised for including south american - born player eder in his italy squad southampton striker graziano pelle has kept his place despite a run of one goal in 16 matches for his club and should be involved on tuesday night where he could face club - mate nathaniel clyne
however , conte supporters point out italy 's world cup - winning teams of 1934 , 1938 and 2006 all included players born overseas , the most recent example being mauro camoranese from argentina
italy needed eder , named after the 1982 brazilian world cup star , in bulgaria having surrendered an early 1 - 0 lead to trail 2 - 1
on sunday , conte called up newcastle united defender davide santon , currently on loan at inter milan , and ignazio abate to the squad to face england
