during an interview with barclays premier league world to be shown this week , barkley announces that his best position is striker
' i can have my greatest impact there , ' he claims
' this season , the year when people were convinced barkley would come of age in the colours of everton , he has scored twice and created just two more
barkley ( right ) gets away from italy 's roberto soriano during england 's 1 - 1 draw in turin the everton midfielder loses the ball after a challenge from italy defender giorgio chiellini barkley replaced theo walcott in the second half and looked bright as the england earned a draw the problem with barkley , who showed flashes of his talent after coming on as a 55th - minute substitute during england 's 1 - 1 draw with italy in turin , is that nobody is quite sure what his best position is
ask everybody involved with him at everton or with england and they will come up with a different answer
this season alone he has played in five different roles ( six if his appearances as a substitute are included ) for everton : 10 in his favoured role off the main forward , six starts on the left , once in front of the back four , once in the centre of midfield and one start at right wing
at 21 there has to be an element of confusion , struggling to work out why his manager roberto martinez is playing him in so many different positions at goodison
barkley has been compared with alan ball - pictured on the left celebrating england 's 1966 world cup win paul gacoigne - an england hero at the 1990 world cup - is another former star barkley has been likened to 2011 - 12 appearances 9 goals 0 2012 - 13 appearances 0 goals 0 sheff wed ( loan ) appearances 13 goals 4 leeds ( loan ) appearances 4 goals 0 2013 - 14 appearances 38 goals 7 2014 - 15 appearances 28 goals 2 barkley made his england debut in 2013 - he has 12 caps and no goals
barkley featured against scotland last year but was on the receiving end of a roy hodgson blast at parkhead like barkley , everton 's john stones ( left ) can also get caught in possession in dangerous areas of the pitch there is certainly a demand for more goals , something he aspired to with those two shots that hit the woodwork during everton 's damaging 5 - 2 defeat by dynamo kiev in the europa league
last summer , when barkley was in miami preparing for the world cup with england , roberto martinez told sportsmail that his young midfielder needed room to breathe
rooney has taken a pastoral role in barkley 's welfare , offering him advice when he was named among england 's substitutes for the 4 - 0 victory over lithuania at wembley last friday
barkley accepts that his form has dipped , well aware that he has yet to mature in to a role that suits club and country
barkley , keeping an eye on manchester city playmaker david silva , was expected to shine this season the midfielder , pictured trying his luck against leicester , has just two goals this season one of his goals came in the 3 - 0 win over newcastle at goodison in the middle of march
