it is a common problem for airlines , ferries and cruise ships - how do you make passengers pay attention to the safety briefing ? condor believes it has found the solution , producing a video complete with a rapping captain and dancing staff that certainly attracts attention
doing away with the monotone yet informative messages usually portrayed in safety briefings , the portsmouth - based company said it wanted to inject some ' fun ' into this year 's offering
the captain introduces the rap for a very different safety demonstration condor ferries have produced the safety rap as part of their ' good times ' branding slightly out of sync and with some incredibly cringeworthy dance moves , the video seems to have done the trick and has already been viewed nearly 20,000 times since it was posted on youtube several days ago
the video begins with a captain sporting blue sunglasses and some questionable moves as he announces : ' to ensure you have good times on board , please listen up to the following safety message from condor
' the star of the show then comes back , the captain , as he sings : ' so who would have thought that the condor could bust out such good rhymes ? ' the video is being broadcast on all sailings between poole and the channel islands
he 's back ! the captain then makes a somewhat unnerving re-appearance as he warns ladies not use heels down the emergency slides the idea was conceived and produced by bournemouth - based walker agency , working closely with the condor safety , marine operations and marketing teams
alicia andrews , executive director â commercial at condor , said : ' we 're really proud of the new safety video , it 's been a very fun project to work on , and we 're delighted with the results
the stewardess demonstrates how passengers would use the emergency slide ... not too difficult ' ferry travel is very family - friendly , there are no restrictions on the amount of luggage you can bring â you can pack everything in to your car , and off you go
the staff are there to help with passengers ' every need , according to the safety video liam gilheany wrote : ' i want to pour lava into my ears , ' while james lund added : ' i 'd want to jump into the harbour if this is for real
' condor are believed to be the first ferry operator to produce an onboard safety video to feature a rap
' the video has been met with pleasure by senior executives at condor
