mothers are now as likely to go out to work as women without children , figures showed yesterday
the historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children
figures from the ons showed 74.1 per cent of mothers with children under 16 , or between 16 and 18 if they are still at school , are regarded as â participating in the labour market â
mothers are now as likely to go out to work as women without children , figures showed yesterday in the mid- 1990s , only two thirds of mothers had jobs , while then , as now , three in four childless women were working
there are also 200,000 more women with children aged between five and ten in the labour market
mothers were briefly more likely to have jobs than women without families in 2013 , the ons report revealed , but last year more than 350,000 childless women entered the growing labour market
but critics of the government âs drive for more mothers to go out to work say many are reluctant to do so and would prefer to stay at home to bring up their children
the historic landmark reached last year means just one mother in four stays at home to raise children ( picture posed by models ) author and family commentator jill kirby said the figures were a result of government efforts to persuade mothers that â children are better off in childcare â , adding : â children are losing out â a string of different childcare workers is no substitute for the love of a mother
â imogen thompson , of the pressure group mothers at home matter , said : â we question whether this is what all women want , or whether many are forced into returning to the labour market before they feel they , or their children , are ready
