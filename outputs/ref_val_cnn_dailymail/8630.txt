but when actor turner took to twitter for a bbc # askpoldark q&a last night , polite questions were the last thing on fans ' minds
instead , the 31 - year - old irish actor was deluged with queries that ranged from the bizarre to the thoroughly indecent
' how do you ever stop looking in the mirror ? ' asked a twitter user called sammypie
another , named sarah hook , asked : ' # askpoldark why was i never offered the position of painting semi nude actors when i had my careers talk at school ? ! ' turner , although slow to respond to marriage proposals , gamely attempted to answer many of the more sensible questions offered up by fans , including one about his new - found fame
swooning : a fan named jane williams spoke for many when she shared her appreciation of shirtless scenes compliments : many of the questions offered up by fans focused on turner 's looks nice work ! another wished that her careers ' advice had included tips on becoming a make - up artist asked whether he knew that a twitter account dedicated to his hair existed , the irishman answered : ' i am aware , yeah ! it âs pretty hilarious ! ' not everyone was happy with his answers , however , with one fan complaining that turner took longer to answer than his character did to find copper - a reference to the ongoing plot line about poldark 's mining activities
gardening : another popular topic with fans was gardening - in particular the scything of lawns left field : others offered up some more unusual questions about the election and norwich city centre too slow : others complained about the actor 's slowness to answer questions among the more amusing was a question from a twitter user named linda who asked the actor whether he might be interested in a spot of gardening
