the chief white house spokesman denied having any knowledge of the criminal charges that are reportedly being brought against new jersey lawmaker menendez on monday and used the lack of awareness as proof positive that the alleged investigation is a form of political payback
' i cant speak to the accuracy of those claims , ' the president 's spokesman , earnest , said when asked about a news report claiming that federal prosecutors are preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against the democratic senator
' i do n't know if there 's a menendez investigation
' ' if there is a criminal investigation on the way , it is one that had been done wholly separate and apart from any sort of political interference , ' he stated
the senator : sen. menendez , a new jersey democrat , may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption politics : ( l - r ) menendez , donor melgen , white house minority leader nancy pelosi , and her husband paul , posed in february 2012 at a national association of latino elected and appointed officials gala cnn reported on friday that a grand jury probe that has lasted two years was reaching a crescendo , and prosecutors , under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out , would soon bring charges against menendez that stem from his relationship with florida eye doctor melgen , a wealthy and prolific donor
menendez has also repaid melgen $ 58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor 's private jet , mostly to the posh dominican resot casa de campo
the senator has fiercely denied he has done anything illegal , and one of his conservative colleagues in the senate , ted cruz , has suggested the investigation is politically motivated
' the senator has counted dr. melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades , ' enright said
' coy : asked monday about the alleged probe , white house spokesman earnest said , ' i do n't know if there 's a menendez investigation ' the same week israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu ' came to washington , spoke in congress about the enormous threat of president obama 's misguided deal with iranians , ' he said , and ' the very week when menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out president obama for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security , ' is the same week reports that he 'll be charged came out
' attorney general eric holder , according to the network , has already given his approval
but he insisted ' i ca n't comment on that ' when a reporter asked him about the report friday afternoon after obama gave a speech in south carolina
' ' the other reason i 'm loathe to comment on this is that there is a principle this administration takes very seriously , ' and that is ' ensuring that prosecutions are kept separate and apart from political interference or even the appearance of political interference
' ' that undermines the claims of a lot of people , including apparently sen. ted cruz , ' he stated
menendez 's first high - level meeting at hhs related to melgen 's medicare troubles occurred on june 7 , 2012 , according to court documents seen by the new jersey law journal
court papers also indicate menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call , and then took nevada sen. reid , who was then the senate majority leader , to an august 2 , 2012 meeting with the hhs 's then - secretary , sebelius
cnn reported that melgen was one of the medicare system 's most - reimbursed doctors nationwide , during the years when he was also a major donor to menendez and to the majority pac
that political action committee , run by former reid staffers , collected more than $ 700,000 from melgen and made sure $ 600,000 of it benefited menendez âs re-election campaign
' the senator , now the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee and its chairman until two months ago , has become a thorn in the white house 's side by taking positions that grate on president obama
last week two of his senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case , arguing that the senator 's actions , and theirs , are protected by the u.s. constitution 's ' speech or debate ' clause
the doctor : melgen , a wealthy florida ophthalmologist and a major menendez donor , was ordered to pay back medicare for $ 8.9 million in overbillings , and menendez intervened with hhs for him search warrant : a january 30 raid of melgen 's medical practice yielded van - loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files according to the new jersey law journal , aide michael barnard refused to answer 50 questions about menendez 's conversations with sebelius and tavenner , and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator 's office and melgen 's lawyer - lobbyist about those conversations
another more senior aide , former menendez chief counsel talbot , reportedly refused to testify about a separate matter
menendez allegedly helped ensure the u.s. would n't provide the machines for free in 2013 fbi agents and investigators from hhs raided melgen 's west palm beach , florida medical office , vitreo-retinal consultants
the washington post reported at the time that hhs auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments melgen 's practice billed to medicare
