this time it 's over a " saturday night live " commercial parody that aired over the weekend
the subject ( take a deep breath and prepare to be shocked ) : isis
in the " saturday night live " parody , the daughter is played by johnson , star of the hugely successful s&m film " 50 shades of grey
) as the parody commercial ends , however , it 's revealed that the daughter is not joining the army , but isis
we then see a pickup filled with isis fighters drive up as a worried dad comments to his daughter : " you be careful , ok ? " johnson replies reassuringly : " dad ! it 's just isis
" the father then turns to an isis fighter and says , with emotion , " take care of her
" and ... cue the outrage ! ! twitter lit up instantly
twitter user @ ematrudo called nbc and " snl " " tasteless scum ! " and steve bucci of conservative think tank the heritage foundation even went as far as to tweet : " isis skit also draws a moral equivalence between isis murderers and the u.s. military ( based on the spoofed commercial ) , that is wrong
the sketch mocked isis and on some level those who would fall for its sales pitch , like , perhaps , the three young british girls who reportedly headed to join them
comically skewering isis is exactly the right thing to do -- it should be done even more
in fact , in lebanon , the united arab emirates and even in iraq , where isis is slaughtering people , brave muslim comedians are ridiculing isis on tv , in youtube videos and in cartoons
and i can assure you that if isis were to catch these comedians , it would n't just tweet about its outrage , it would kill them
so why do these comedians take the chance ? because , they say , it undermines isis , and also , for many , it is cathartic to laugh at the terrorists , as opposed to shivering in fear about them
