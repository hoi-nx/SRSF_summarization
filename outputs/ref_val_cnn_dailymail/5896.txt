rosetta has captured a selfie of its shadow on comet 67p in what is the highest - resolution image to be taken by the probe
the image was taken during a valentine 's day flyby when rosetta passed within just four miles ( 6 km ) from the surface of the icy comet

if the sun were farther away , the shadow would be sharp and almost exactly the same size as rosetta , which is around 2 x 32 metres
this is about 2.3 times smaller than on earth - resulting in a fuzzy ' penumbra ' around the spacecraft 's shadow
with rosetta just four miles ( 6km ) above the surface , the penumbra effect adds roughly 65ft ( 20 metres ) to the spacecraft 's dimensions , which this graphic shows the difference between how a sharp shadow is generated by a point source ( left ) and a fuzzy shadow by a diffuse source ( right ) the view , which shows the detail in features down to 11cm , is of a region on the bottom of the comet
the osiris narrow - angle camera image from the close flyby shown here in context with a navcam image if you were standing on the surface with rosetta high above you , there would be no place in the shadow where the entire sun would be blocked from view
other images reveal boulders on the comet 's surface , as well as ' stunning details of the contrasting terrain , ' the esa said
the boulders in these images range in size from a few metres to a few tens of metres , and lay scattered across the comet 's surface
' esa 's rosetta spacecraft launched on 2 march 2004 aboard an ariane 5 rocket , on a mission to visit comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko
rosetta , meanwhile , is continuing its mission around the comet
this osiris shape model is marked with the position of the narrow - angle camera field of view taken during the 14 february flyby a four - image montage of comet 67p/churyumov â gerasimenko comprising images taken on 14 february 2015 during the first dedicated close flyby
rosetta 's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet 's small lobe at the top of the image , with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set
as well as providing the opportunity to take close - up high - resolution images of the comet surface , flybys like this also allow rosetta 's instruments to sample the innermost parts of the comet 's atmosphere , or coma
rosetta is now moving out for a far view of the comet â it will reach a distance of about 160 miles ( 255km ) from the comet centre tomorrow
rosetta 's parting shot following the close flyby features the comet 's small lobe at the top of the image , with the larger lobe in the lower portion of the image set ' a comet is like deep fried ice cream , ' said dr murthy gudipati of nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , corresponding author of a recent study appearing in the journal of physical chemistry
