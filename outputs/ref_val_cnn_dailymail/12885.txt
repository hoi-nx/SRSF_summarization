many years ago i performed at the surf ballroom , in clear lake , iowa , which was the last stop on buddy holly 's final tour
he was killed in a plane crash in 1959 that also took the lives of singers j.p. " the big bopper " richardson and ritchie valens
by this time , buddy holly and i had had a pretty long history together
the picks were there -- they sang background vocals on buddy holly 's records -- as well as singer tommy allsup , who claimed that years later he got his wallet back from the crash site
i think the prospect of the ntsb delving into the crash again , which might mean exhuming bodies and all the rest , would be in similarly bad taste
i think there 's a reason we say , " rest in peace
as a paperboy , i cut open the stack of papers on february 3 , 1959 , and saw that buddy holly had been killed in the plane crash
rock ' n roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and buddy holly had n't had a big hit on the charts since ' 57 , nor had the others in the plane crash
since then we have embarked on what i would call the " american death trip
fortunately , buddy holly 's music is forever young and all any young person has to do is listen to it and his life will be changed forever .
