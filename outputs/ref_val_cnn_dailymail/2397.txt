while interstellar space travel is still in the realm of science fiction , scientists say that if an alien ship came within range of earth at near light speed , we would be able to detect it
this is according to a pair of defence engineers who say that any spacecraft travelling that fast would leave distinct light signatures in its wake
but their study also reveals the tricky physics of travelling at near light speeds , calculating that a collision with single dust grain would release energy equal to 5291lbs ( 2,400kg ) of exploding tnt
a pair of defence engineers say that any spacecraft travelling close to the speed of light would leave light signatures in its wake because it would interact with the cosmic microwave background ( pictured )
the panels show how scientists predict the cmb signature would change as the spacecraft increases speed california - based raytheon engineers yurtsever and wilkinson claim that spaceships travelling at near light speeds would interact with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )
a fast - moving spacecraft would collide with cosmic microwave photons , say the engineers , creating highly gamma rays , according to a report inmit technology review
raytheon engineers suggest that spaceships travelling at near light speeds would interact with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )
pictured is a narn spacecraft from babylon 5 the researchers have estimated that each cubic centimetre of space contains over 400 microwave photons
this means a spaceship would collide with thousands of billions of photons every second creating something known as electron - positron pairs
as well as drag , a single cosmic dust grain with a mass of 10 ^ - ( 14 ) grams would release about 10,000 megajoules worth of energy if it the spacecraft
the engineers explain that is the same amount of energy released by 2,400 kilograms of exploding tnt
