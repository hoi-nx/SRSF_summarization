forgive the gross presumption in offering career advice to hamilton , but he has given his father âs management the flick and told simon fuller âs xix entertainment their services are no longer needed
we are told by mercedes that a new contract to replace the one that expires at the end of the season is a formality
hamilton has said he wants to sign it
mercedes driver hamilton celebrates his win at the season - opening race in melbourne , australian - but is yet to sign a new deal with the team hamilton 's current mercedes contract runs out at the end of this season and no new deal has been agreed yet yet four months after he won the world championship in abu dhabi , there is only one important fact : no deal has been concluded
so why the delay ? it may be that hamilton is holding out for the salary he wants
but , as one of my mentors advised me about the chicanery of the paddock , there is a reason behind everything in formula one
mercedes say a new contract is a formality while hamilton says he wants ti sign , so why the delay ? hamilton celebrates his australian gp win in front of second - placed nico rosberg and sebastian vettel i hope that the delay is because hamilton is seeking a move to ferrari
madness ? no. by the end of the season , he hopes to have emulated his hero senna in winning three world titles â the number that most clearly defines a driver âs status in the pantheon
before his fatal accident at the grand prix , senna , as has since become common knowledge , talked to ferrari about racing for them
i suspect scratching the itch that senna could not - namely , competing for the sport âs most evocative marque - would mean more to hamilton than the possibility of clocking up win after win , title after title
that kind of thing is for sebastian vettel and the birds
sebastian vettel joined ferrari ahead of the new season after six seasons driving for red bull the german finished third in his first race for the ferrari in melbourne eight days ago however , there is no reason why ferrari , with their vast resources , could not deliver title - winning cars for him
then , he would have won championships with three teams , mclaren , mercedes and ferrari
another tantalising , legend - making prospect is a straight fight in identical machinery between hamilton and sebastian vettel
hamilton , like fernando alonso , thinks himself a better racer than sebastian vettel , who , so the theory goes , was flattered by his red bull car in winning four world titles
by replacing kimi raikkonen , whose contract runs out at the end of the season , hamilton could prove what he has always believed
mercedes are a super-team ; ferrari are in upheaval and struggling for form
ferrari are fabulously well - resourced
and who knows whether the team that ross brawn built at mercedes will thrive so dominantly in the long run ? will toto wolff and paddy lowe work harmoniously if the wheels fall off ? how will niki lauda âs scattergun style of chairmanship play out ? if hamilton wants to be bold and take the plunge , he has a big ally at ferrari
i hear from unimpeachable sources that the ferrari âs president , sergio marchionne , rates hamilton top of the drivers available to him
sebastian vettel won four consecutive world championships as red bull dominated formula one it seems journalism is not a crime , max mosley i hope it wo nât spoil our next very agreeable lunch if i point out to max mosley that it has emerged from the old bailey that journalism is not a criminal offence , after all
for , in a blow to the former fia president 's censorship - seeking pressure group hacked off , four sun journalists were cleared last week of paying public officials for stories in a case that delved far into the ethics of the tabloid press
there was also the pakistani - supporting taxi driver in melbourne , who dissected english âs failings , brought me up to date with imran khan âs latest political plans and was about to fly next morning to adelaide to watch his pakistan team lose , as it predictably turned out , to australian
but could either german venue , the nurburgring or hockenheim , claim that they offered a world - class experience for punters or the travelling formula one family ? hamilton drives his mercedes to third in last season 's german grand prix at hockenheim formula one is missing the voice of murray walker australian television sport is said to be a tough and jealous business
