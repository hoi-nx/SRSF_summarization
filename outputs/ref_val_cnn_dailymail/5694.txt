the sterling pictured above attended a l.a. clippers game in march 2005 claims : sterling also mentioned his former girlfriend stiviano in the latest filings , claiming the recordings she taped of his racist rant was edited but provided no evidence
' adam silver , who is also named as a defendant in the suit , banned sterling from the nba for life last year and hit him with a $ 2.5 million fine after tapes were released of sterling speaking racist slurs
