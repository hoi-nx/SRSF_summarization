there seemed to be a medal on every uniform â be it military or school
three vc , four george crosses , 1,650 gallantry decorations and tens of thousands of campaign medals were awarded during britain âs 13 - year action in afghanistan
yesterday , as the country gathered to honour that campaign at st paul 's cathedral , several children were wearing the medals of fathers who never returned from the war against the taliban
in pride of place behind her were the holders of another decoration
the elizabeth cross is the medal no one wants
yet no decoration , surely , is worn with greater pride
devised by the sovereign at the height of the afghanistan conflict in 2009 , it is a silver brooch presented to the next of kin of every member of the forces killed in the line of duty â and there were 453 of those in afghanistan
yesterday , the families of every single one had been invited to join the queen at st paul 's cathedral âs
historians and politicians will still be debating the merits of the afghanistan project years from now
all the senior members of the royal family â including afghanistan veteran prince harry â and all the service chiefs were present , along with the three main party leaders plus representatives of our nato allies and all the main faiths
for dad : charlton taylor , five , son of royal marines michael taylor who was killed in afghanistan in june 2010 remembered : charlton ( left ) wore the medals awarded to his father ( right ) who was just 30 when he died past prime ministers tony blair and gordon brown were also present
they had front row seats in the south transept , flanked by senior forces personnel rather than grieving families
in the run - up to this service some had questioned the presence of the leaders who took britain into this conflict
there were some desperately poignant sights ; a schoolboy with dad âs medals sitting alongside mum , in black , with her elizabeth cross on her lapel and tissues clasped tightly in her hand ; a middle - aged couple blinking back tears ; a young mother , dressed in black , dashing for the door with a small , screaming boy in her arms during the opening prayers
presumably , the little chap was there to honour a gallant father or uncle
touching moment : prince charles with forces families at the reception at the guildhall after the service i hope they were both allowed back in
among half a dozen worshippers chosen to read the prayers of intercession were a senior raf officer , former corporal sarah bushbye mc , who won her military cross dashing through a maelstrom of gunfire to treat four wounded soldiers , and ashworth , mother of lance corporal james ashworth of the grenadier guards
seats were left empty at the service as family members of the 453 who died chose not to attend
relatives travelled to london to watch the service on a screen outside st paul 's cathedral â even though more than 40 seats were left unoccupied inside
â around 20 bereaved family members and veterans were either unwell or unable to travel at the last minute and did not attend the service
another 15 to 20 bereaved family members and veterans unexpectedly did not turn up
â i âm told that each wounded person was supported by up to 80 others by the time they got home
â departing to bach âs prelude and fugue in b minor , the queen was introduced to another cross-section of those whose lives were turned upside down by this conflict
sally thorneloe lost her husband , lieutenant - colonel rupert thorneloe of the welsh guards , the most senior officer killed in the conflict
yesterday , she was accompanied by her daughters , hannah , nine , and sophie , seven , who presented flowers to the queen
respects : the queen receives flowers from sisters sophie ( right ) and hannah thorneloe ( second right ) , whose father lieutenant colonel rupert thorneloe was the most senior officer to be killed in afghanistan in front of the cathedral , the parade was forming up
detachments from all the services marched the short distance to a guildhall reception while an raf flypast â including that great afghanistan warhorse , the chinook â flew overhead
parents - to - be : prince william and the duchess of cambridge also attended the moving service at guildhall i met brenda and her daughter rachel stanley , 27
as peek-a-boo ed nods off ... his two predecessors sneak out the back door tony blair and gordon brown attended the service but left out of a back entrance of st paul 's cathedral âs to avoid coming face to face with the families of those who died in afghanistan
out of line : miliband seems to duck down as he stands with prime minister david cameron and nick clegg feeling tired ? mr miliband rubs his eyes , cups his head in his hand and then appears to drop off quick exit : former prime ministers gordon brown ( left ) and tony blair at friday 's commemoration
