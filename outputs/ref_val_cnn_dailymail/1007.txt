new pictures of killer co-pilot lubitz as a smiling schoolboy have emerged - on the day lufthansa admitted they knew six years ago that he suffered from a ' serious depressive episode '
the airline said that as part of its internal research it found emails lubitz sent to the lufthansa flight school in bremen when he resumed his training there after an interruption of several months
in them he informed the school that he had suffered a ' serious depressive episode ' which had since subsided
( he is pictured with curtain style haircut and squared patterned top ) the airline said lubitz subsequently passed all medical checks and that it has provided the documents to prosecutors
questions have been raised about what the airline knew about lubitz 's condition before last week 's fatal crash
authorities say the 27 - year - old , who in the past had been treated for suicidal tendencies , locked his captain out of the cockpit before deliberately crashing the airbus 320 into a mountain in the alps
mons-tabor gymnasium high school in montabaur , germany , which lubitz attended as a child all 150 people aboard flight 9525 from barcelona to dusseldorf were killed that day
earlier today lufthansa said it had set aside Â£ 203million to deal with possible costs from the march 24 crash
meanwhile pictures of lubitz at various ages while a pupil at mons-tabor gymnasium high school in montabaur , germany , were released today - the same day it emerged lubitz 's girlfriend knew he had psychological issues
the girlfriend of killer pilot lubitz ( above ) knew he had psychological issues but the couple ' were optimistic ' they could work through them , according to a source close to the investigation investigators are now increasingly certain this was the prime motive for his act of suicide and mass murder
a european government official close to the probe told cnn that miss goldbach knew he had seen two doctors - an eye consultant and a neuropsychologist - who both deemed him unfit for work
he was given sick notes - found torn up at his home in dusseldorf - and ordered by doctors to take time off work
military vehicles arrive ahead of operations at the site of the germanwings plane crash in seyne - les - alpes calling for change : tiirik with her boyfriend bramley , who died in the alps plane disaster the grief - stricken girlfriend of a uk student killed in the alps plane disaster today called for tougher controls to weed out psychopathic pilots
' it is one thing to be suicidal or obsessive , but feeling no remorse or even nervousness when killing other human beings is a whole new level - a zone only real psychopaths can fully understand
german law meant it was left entirely up to lubitz to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer , something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash
bild newspaper , quoting a source close to the investigation , reported the official as saying : ' a main motive seems to be the fear that lubitz had of losing his ability to fly because of medical problems
strict german privacy laws which prevented doctors treating lubitz from telling his airline about his ' suicidal tendencies ' were introduced as a consequence of the nazis
this extends far beyond confidential medical data , however , to stringent protection of someone 's identity , meaning many german publications only referred to lubitz as andreas l , even after his death
