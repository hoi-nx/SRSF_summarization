the sight of birds pecking at seed or nuts from a garden feeder fills many people with joy
now , a device called the crow box could enable bird watchers to make money from their hobby , as well as watch birds develop new skills
the training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts , or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids
the crow box training aid can be used to teach crows to collect coins in return for peanuts , or simply test the intelligence of wild corvids
people who want to train crows can follow the open - source instructions to make their own box ( pictured left ) which includes a perch and funnel to dispense tasty peanuts ( right ) research has shown that crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven - year - old , and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes
the box is similar to a vending machine for birds , but crows have to use their brains to earn treats
so far , the brooklyn - based maker of the box has managed to train captive crows to retrieve coins in return for peanuts and hopes that wild crows will learn the same tricks
the sealed wooden and plastic box comprises food dispensers , a 12 volt power supply , two motors , cables and sensors
research has shown that crows ( stock image ) have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven - year - old , and the birds can solve tasks previously only thought solvable by people and apes an experiment by the university of cambridge has proved that members of the crow family , known as corvids , are nât just among the cleverest birds , they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four - year - old children have difficulty with
other experiments involving the same family of birds found that caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food , which the university of oxford âs behavioural ecology research group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans
the device has a perch , a food tray and a funnel , designed to test a crow âs cognitive abilities and incentivise them to learn new tricks
there are four steps ( illustrated ) to training crows to find coins , involving peanut rewards to begin training , the device pushes a few peanuts and two coins into the feeder tray whenever a crow leaves the machine , which ensures food is always on offer and the sound of the machine is linked to the reward so the crow learns to accept it
but the contraption is designed so that if a bird pecks or sweeps coins off the tray â which is fitted with sensors â and into a funnel , peanuts are revealed and the bird 's ingenuity is rewarded
this stage is designed to strengthen the relationship between the coins going down the funnel and food
the training is complete when crows bring coins of their own volition to unlock food
they may collect coins scattered nearby by the owners of the machine to encourage their behaviour , or travel further afield to collect bonus treasure
the open source experiment is designed to look further into the brains of corvids
â the more people trying different things the faster we 'll all figure out how to work cooperatively with crows , â hacker and writer joshua klein writes on the crow box website
â the box is similar to a vending machine for birds , but crows have to use their brains to earn treats
the wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat
