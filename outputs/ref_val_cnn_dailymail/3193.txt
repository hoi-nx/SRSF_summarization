facebook and google have been involved in an algorithm war to come up with the perfect facial detection system
now google has claimed the latest victory , saying its new facenet system is practically perfect - getting the right person 99.96 % of the time
google 's new facenet system is practically perfect - getting the right person 99.96 % of the time - here , it shows the variety of lighting condition it can overcome google researchers call their system the most - accurate technology available for recognizing human faces
in the paper , titled ' facenet : a unified embedding for face recognition and clustering ' , google claims the system achieved nearly 100 - percent accuracy rate on the facial recognition dataset labeled faces
however , google researchers went beyond simply verifying whether two faces are identical by also attaching a name to a face
google 's system first clusters photos into a collection of similar faces taking a classic facial recognition approach , the researchers went as far as organizing the images into groups of faces that look the most similar or the most distinct
when google 's facenet and facebook 's ' deepface ' are eventually integrated into their company 's web platforms , it is believed they will automate the process of tagging photos and searching for people and will also make it easier for web companies to analyze their users ' social networks and to assess global trends
facebook 's technology - called deepface - was first showcased last march , but the site has now started rolling out the automatic tagging tool to select users
deepface uses technology designed by an israeli startup called face.com
facebook bought the startup in 2013 and developed the facial recognition tool with support from face.com 's yaniv taigman at its artificial intelligence lab. the researchers used the software to build a 3d model of a face from a photo that can be rotated into the best position for an algorithm to begin searching for a match
its creators said deepface finds a match with 97.25 per cent accuracy
facebook 's deepface technology uses a 3d model to virtually rotate faces so that are facing the camera
