a disabled woman has been stuck in her armchair for three years because she ca n't climb the stairs and her wheelchair wo n't get through the front door

the mother - of - two suffers from chronic lymphoedema - an abnormal collection of high - protein fluid just beneath the skin , usually in the arm or leg - which she was diagnosed with at the age of 25
she is confined to her armchair after being diagnosed with chronic lymphoedema - an abnormal collection of high - protein fluid before then she lived an active life , going to the beach and regularly seeing friends , but the crippling condition has left her confined to her living room
her two - bedroom council home does n't have a ramp and is too small for her wheelchair - and the last time she went upstairs was seven years ago
' i 'm frightened of dying here in the chair
' mrs walker , who lives with her carer husband stephen , 51 , and her sons aged 30 and 28 , spends her days on facebook , reading , watching tv , talking to friends and petting her dog chalkie
when i do have to go to the hospital when i get outside in their chair or bed and the fresh air or sun hits me and i think " oh my god , what 's that ? " it 's really weird

' following the birth of her first son , she began suffering symptoms and was diagnosed with the condition
' mrs walker also has weeping blisters on her legs and is in ' agonising ' pain with lumps in her stomach and legs
the 50 - year - old lives , sleeps and eats in the seat and her mobility is so bad she ca n't even go up the stairs in her two - bedroom council home the council adapted a shower upstairs but she can not get there so instead she has to be washed using a bowl and flannels in her armchair
last year eight paramedics spent three hours helping mrs walker after she fell at her home
the pair , who have been married for 32 years , claim the council would not re-house them because they have made adaptations to their home even though they are no longer suitable
clare pelham , chief executive for leonard cheshire disability 's , said : ' for many of us , our homes are a haven - places where we look forward to relaxing with our friends and family
the house in southampton where walker has been confined to her armchair for the last three years ' with our ageing population and an increase in the number of disabled people , these homes are needed now

lymphoedema is a chronic condition that causes swelling in the body 's tissues
there is no cure for lymphoedema , but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build - up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system
the build - up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection
