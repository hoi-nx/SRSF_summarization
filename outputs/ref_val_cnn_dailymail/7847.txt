a crystal with a â forbidden symmetry â that was once thought to be impossible to form naturally has been found
the so - called quasicrystal was discovered in a 4.5 billion - year - old meteorite in a remote region of northeastern russia
and studying it could help scientists find out how mysterious materials like this formed in the universe
scientists at princeton university , new jersey studied an ancient meteorite ( shown ) and found a quasicrystal with a structure that it was once dubbed ' impossible '
it was thought such material could not naturally occur in nature because the crystal has a symmetry in which atoms should n't form the discovery was made by a team from princeton university , and is the second natural quasicrystal ever found - both in this meteorite
â the finding of a second naturally occurring quasicrystal confirms that these materials can form in nature and are stable over cosmic time scales , â said dr steinhardt from princeton university
as a result , a quasicrystal âs atoms can be arranged in ways that are not commonly found in crystals , such as the shape of a 20 - sided icosahedron with the symmetry of a soccer ball
this type of structure is impossible in ordinary crystals , in which atoms are packed closely together in a repeated and orderly fashion , earning it the â forbidden symmetry â moniker
crystals with these â forbidden symmetries â had been created in the laboratory , but it was n't until 2009 that dr steinhardt and his team reported the first natural quasicrystal , now known as icosahedrite , in a rock that had been collected years before in chukotka , russia
right is the ordered yet non-standard pattern of the quasicrystal revealed by an electron beam crystals with these â forbidden symmetries â had been created in the laboratory , but it was n't until 2009 that dr steinhardt and his team reported the first natural quasicrystal , now known as icosahedrite , in a rock that had been collected years before in chukotka , russia ( shown ) the researchers confirmed that the quasicrystal originated in an extraterrestrial body that formed about 4.57 billion years ago - around the time our solar system formed
this new quasicrystal was found in a different grain of the same meteorite and has 10-fold , or decagonal , symmetry
â what we find out could answer basic questions about the materials found in our universe
