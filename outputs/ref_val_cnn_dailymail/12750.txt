want to take a self - portrait using your snazzy new selfie stick in front of london 's national gallery ? that 's fine
the national gallery has become the latest museum to ban the handy ( or irritating , depending on your point of view ) device
selfies turn museums into playgrounds for a day the british museum joins the smithsonian , new york 's museum of modern art and a host of institutions around the world banning what the new york museum calls " camera extension poles
" before you pout that the ban is going to ruin your selfie for # museumselfie day next year , know that dixon , the day 's creator , supports the ban
