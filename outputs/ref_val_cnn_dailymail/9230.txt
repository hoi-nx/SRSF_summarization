they 've been pumped up as tv 's toughest cops , with endless promotions running on network ten âs website and on television
but now the gold coast cops show appears destined for the television scrapheap after a decision to dump the stars known as the â rapid action â ( rap ) , after they were labelled â a bunch of show boaters â , and who some internal critics say are not really responsible for proper policing
season two is set to air tonight but a political power play , along with anger and jealousy which has gripped the rank and file about the so - called ' elite squad ' , has all but sounded its death knell
samuel johnson returns as narrator for the second season in gold coast cops on the beat
the team has been criticised for ' showboating ' by some queensland police colleagues but their boss , keogh , says the results speak for themselves network ten says it expects the second season to run its full course
we are concentrating on producing season two of gold coast cops which airs tonight on ten at 7.30pm , ' the network ten said in a statement
ten 's website continues to promote the series , saying : ' the elite taskforce is responsible for policing everything from bikie gangs and street violence to drug heists and organised crime
' ' led by superintendent keogh , the unit offers the community a permanent police presence on the gold coast
since it was first formed in september of 2013 , keogh has overseen the task - force , growing from a team of 50 to double that size with the majority of whom were hand - picked by him

privately , premier annastacia palaszczuk is also believed to have concerns about the team and the vision made available by the crack police squad on the gold coast
what is abundantly clear though , is the displeasure of rank and file , who have labelled their colleagues ' show - boaters '
it 's believed the squad members will now be absorbed back into the general police population and the 3 - year lease on the high - tech set - up at varsity lakes allowed to run out
the rap crew is not particularly well liked in their home state because of the hype and publicity they have been receiving , since the show first went to air
she moved from bondi to the gold coast and is now a team leader ' what 's worse is they are not the sole reason things are getting cleaned up on the coast , it 's the rank and file , to be honest
' the crew , hand - picked by supt keogh , has been run out of a new technology hub on the gold coast
almost 4500 arrests have been made since its inception in 2013 , on the back of more than 400 raids

' the palaszczuk government supports gold coast police 100 per cent in their effort to keep the community safe , ' she said
