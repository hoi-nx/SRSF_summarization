republican presidential candidate cruz laid down a marker tuesday on global warming , saying that denying human activity is heating the planet makes him a renegade truth - teller in the mold of the renaissance astronomer galileo
' today the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat - earthers , ' he told the texas tribune
' it used to be : " it is accepted scientific wisdom the earth is flat
" and this heretic named galileo was branded a denier , ' cruz said
' americans , according to a gallup poll released wednesday , ranked climate change at the bottom of a list of six environmental concerns , with those saying they care a ' great deal ' falling by 2 percentage points since last year
' even as global warming has received greater attention as an environmental problem from politicians and the media in recent years , ' pollsters wrote , ' americans ' worry about it is no higher now than when gallup first asked about it in 1989
' cruz 's ' flat - earther ' epithet is likely misplaced , since galileo never staked his career on a claim that the earth itself was round
cruz 's wide - ranging interview touched on obamacare , gay marriage , marijuana policy and his disdain for ' one - size - fits - all ' legislative approaches often crafted in washington , d.c. but it 's his position on carbon emissions and the fate of the planet that will likely raise the temperature of his opponents on the left
' and the global warming alarmists , anyone who actually points to the evidence that disproves their apocalyptical claims , they do n't engage in reasoned debate
' climate tycoon : ' al gore has made millions of dollars off of global warming , ' cruz said global cooling ? bostonians would be hard pressed to fret about rising temperatures following one of the snowiest winters on record this year as evidence , he pointed to data from heat - sensing weather satellites
' the satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years , ' he emphasized
because all those computer models on which this whole issue is based predicted significant warming , and yet the satellite data show it ai n't happening
' ' scientists that studied the satellite data to which cruz refers , ' washington post writer bump wrote , ' reject the idea that it somehow disproves the idea that human activity is making the world warmer
' ' cruz 's comments , from start to finish , are simply not correct , ' bump claimed
' that followed a sunday interview on the nbc program ' meet the press ' where california democratic gov. jerry brown said cruz 's position on global warming makes him ' absolutely unfit to be running for office
' eppur si muove ' : galileo was forced under pain of death to recant his claim that the earth revolved around the sun , but when he was let out of prison he still insisted : ' and yet it still moves ' ' i read this morning a newsweek article from the 1970s talking about " global cooling " , ' he told the texas tribune
' then , he recalled , ' advocates of global cooling suddenly shifted to global warming
cruz 's home state of texas is famed for its oil and gas wells , and for its gulf coast refineries
