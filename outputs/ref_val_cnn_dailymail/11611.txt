magic from juan mata at times i âve felt like a bit of an apologist for juan mata
when he gets in the right place at the right time , he can cut open any team
juan mata scored twice as man united beat liverpool at anfield - he showed his class throughout juan mata has a fantastic footballing brain his decision - making is so quick that he does nât need to be fast juan mata has made 91 passes in his last two games , more than any other man united midfielder sunday âs performance was a nod to all those who have written him off
the acid test for any player is how well you perform in big games and they do nât get any bigger than liverpool against man united
it was a game for cool heads and that âs what juan mata had
steven gerrard will have been fired up after coming off the bench but there is no excuse for what he did it 's perfect for pardew alan pardew was delighted after crystal palace came back to win at stoke
when he left newcastle for crystal palace , even he could nât have seen things going this well
six wins and a draw means crystal palace have overtaken newcastle , so all credit to him
he gets called up for england duty and responds with a first premier league hat - trick
only one player could take it off harry kane now , and that âs eden hazard , but with three more goals , harry kane âs done nothing to make me change my mind
harry kane scored his first premier league hat - trick against leicester and is still my player of the season bristol booming bristol has always been a big rugby area , but it âs got a great football tradition as well and steve cotterill added his own chapter of history at wembley on sunday
bristol city controlled the game in the johnstone âs paint trophy final and deserved their success
with excellent fans and committed backers , it âs time for bristol city to dream big
steve cotterill 's bristol city deserve their success and should go on and win league one this season chelsea close in when i saw the score at the kc stadium go to 2 - 2 , i started to look at the league table
would this bring bristol city back into the title race ? would it give arsenal a sniff ? were man united even in with a chance ? then loic remy scores a late goal and chelsea keep their lead at the top
chelsea 's win against hull on sunday could prove to be the result that wins them the title what more can big sam do ? the last time west ham had 42 points at this stage of a premier league season was in 2007 - 08
that year they finished 10th with 49 points in total it may not have been a pretty watch at upton park on saturday , but it was a significant win for west ham and big sam
and i do nât care what anybody says , big sam has done a good job at west ham
big sam has done a good job at west ham despite what people say - some of their football is fantastic meeting the maestro it was a privilege to be at the nou camp last week to see lionel messi put in a magical performance in the champions league
