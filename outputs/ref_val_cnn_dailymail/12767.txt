a crowd of tens of thousands filled yitzhak rabin square in tel aviv on saturday evening , calling for a change in israeli leadership amid growing discontent with the current administration
on both of these topics , founder dror ben-ami says , prime minister netanyahu has failed
organizers are not promoting any specific candidate or pushing voters toward any political party in the march 17 balloting
headlining the rally was dagan , the former head of mossad , israeli 's spy agency , and a vocal critic of netanyahu
in recent weeks , dagan criticized netanyahu 's decision to speak before the congress , and he continued his criticism at the rally , saying that he has never seen such stagnation in israeli politics
netanyahu still has broad support in israeli , and his likud party is doing well in the polls
because of the nature of israeli politics , netanyahu 's likud party could lose the election while netanyahu still becomes prime minister
hundreds of thousands of protesters packed the streets of tel aviv , demanding improvements in the cost of housing , education , and health care
