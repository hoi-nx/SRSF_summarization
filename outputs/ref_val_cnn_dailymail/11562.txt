a win is always a win and england will go into next week âs game against france with a fighting chance of winning the six nations but they will be annoyed with themselves for leaving so many points out there on the field
it âs all going to come down to points difference , and its nip and tuck with ireland , but those points england left out there at twickenham could cost them dear
the biggest positive i would draw out of the game is that there was plenty of creativity â george ford and ben youngs led the way â and at least england were making try - scoring opportunities
george ford breaks away to score england 's second try on a nerve - wracking afternoon ben youngs gave england options with a display of much - needed creativity against an obdurate scotland ford in particular was composed and was confident enough to slow the game down on occasions to allow play to come to him
he âs got time on the ball and some of england âs other exciting young backs must look to emulate that the first half was extraordinary in many ways and spelt out the absolute necessity of taking your chances in test rugby because it almost invariably comes back to haunt you
england started at a good tempo - which they definitely needed to after going behind early on in their last three six nations games - but they failed to take full advantage and put away three or four gilt - edge chances
almost predictably scotland hit back an scored with their very first serious attack to level the scores and in many ways england were possibly lucky to only trail 13 - 10 at half - time
that was definitely a yellow card when dan cole stepped into play the ball earlier at a ruck when scotland were camped on england âs line ! mike brown looked to have broken free but was hauled back by the pacy stuart hogg tom youngs leads an england breakaway with team - mates sprinting to joining in with his foray forward half - time will have been interesting in the england changing room and england looked a different beast for most of the second half and regained control of the match with ford 's try but then again we saw that lack of composure
scotland attempt to clear their lines with lawes ( right ) trying to block during the edgy encounter england back - row billy vunipola evades the tackles of two scottish opponents good show : england will have to taken heart from the attacking intent if not the finishing
youngs and ford were really lively at half - back , lawes added physicality up front bad show : england have to recapture the coolness under pressure and ruthless streak they showed in the second half against wales in cardiff
