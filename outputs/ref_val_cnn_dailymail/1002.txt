a labour mp launched an attack on the natural history museum and m&s last night over a range of dinosaur clothes for boys
the shadow cabinet office minister said the natural history museum was guilty of â gender - specific marketing â , and that she plans to join a protest outside the building next week
the range of clothes produced by m&s in partnership with the museum â which is famous for its dinosaur exhibition â includes pyjamas and t - shirts with images of dinosaurs on them
miss onwurah said the t - shirts was excluding girls from science she also tabled a series of questions in parliament accusing the museum of â gender specific marketing of toys â and failing to â target boys and girls equally â
â how have these two national institutions , m&s and the natural history museum , managed to get through the entire product development cycle , from the initial idea to the product on the shelf , without anyone thinking that perhaps dinosaurs and natural science do nât just appeal to boys ? â a marks&spencer spokesman said : â this is a brand new partnership and , as with any new range , we have listened carefully to feedback from our customers on how they would like to see it evolve
â a spokesman for the natural history museum said : â we are currently working with the m&s design team to expand the range to include products for girls
