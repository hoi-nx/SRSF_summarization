london tunisia 's ultra-radical fringe has come back to bite a government born out of the most successful experiment in constitutional reform to emerge from the 2011 arab spring revolutions
wednesday 's attack on the bardo museum in tunis was grimly predictable , coming from what the tunisian interior ministry calls a violent ultra-radical islamist fringe forced underground -- but not crushed -- by security services
jihadist firebrands representing thousands of active militants at home and abroad have been threatening retribution on tunisia 's outward - looking , investment - friendly majority
it may torpedo efforts to revive tunisia 's employment - generating tourism industry and may discourage other big - spending visitors
it will probably lead tunisia -- who have shown a sage propensity to unite in the face of greatest adversity despite a marked appetite for political bickering -- to support a robust response by elected president essebsi
tunisia is the sole country to have emerged from an arab spring revolution with its political process intact -- current president , essebsi , who was elected in november 2014 , and his ruling coalition , are the products of a long constitutional process
local salafist groups ( of whom the best known is ansar al-sharia ) as well as multinational units including isis have been most effective in recruiting disaffected young tunisia in the capital 's poorer quarters and in dusty towns of the south and interior , where the original revolution that removed ben ali in february 2011 surged up
it will remind tunisia 's many friends that the country 's transition is brittle , and that tunis needs commitments of support to become reality , with more military and wider financial assistance , and , above all , investment that can kickstart an economy in the doldrums since 2011
it is a ghastly way to remind the world that tunisia 's experiment in democratic reform needs all the help it can get .
