a survivor of the boston marathon bombing has posted an open letter to bomber tsarnaev on her facebook page , just hours after testifying on the first day of the 21 - year - old 's trial
rebekah gregory , 27 , from houston , texas , lost half of her left leg after 18 surgeries following the april 15 , 2013 blast
' today ... i looked at you right in the face ...
and realized i was n't afraid anymore , ' gregory wrote
' and today i realized that sitting across from you was somehow the crazy kind of step forward that i needed all along
earlier ms rebekah gregory had told the court that the last thing she remembered before the explosion was entertaining noah who was bored watching the runners
she said that the force of the blast had thrown her backwards and immediately she began looking for her son - but realized she had bones sticking out of her legs and arms and flesh hanging from her body
' my bones were lying next to me on the sidewalk , ' gregory recalled during her testimony in federal court in boston
' i felt that was the day i would die
' ms rebekah gregory 's boyfriend dimartino , 30 , was also present at the bombing and suffered a shattered ankle , a ruptured eardrum , and lost his right achilles tendon in the blast she told the court that she could hear noah screaming ' mommy ' and asked god to take her but not her son
ms rebekah gregory began to weep as she said that as she scanned for noah , she saw the body of krystle campbell lying behind her
she recalled that an emergency responder told her she was going to be ok then yelled : ' we have an amputee ! ' several jurors were close to tears as ms rebekah gregory told the court that she still has shrapnel in her body and each time a piece works its way to the surface , she will have an operation
her son noah suffered a shrapnel injury to his leg and head
ms rebekah gregory was shown a photo in court in which she was able to identify herself and her family with bomber , tamerlan tsarnaev , standing directly behind
ms rebekah gregory 's boyfriend dimartino , 30 , was also present and suffered a shattered ankle , a ruptured eardrum , and lost his right achilles tendon in the blast
gregory and dimartino announced last month that they have separated after just 10 months of marriage , left , while tsarnaev is on trail for his role in the marathon blast on april 15 , 2013 despite getting married and staying together as gregory had her leg amputated , the couple have decided to part ways citing irreparable strain , the people reported
gregory , who struggled her way down the aisle after learning to walk again following the amputation , told the people : ' after the decision was made to amputate my leg in november , i found myself having to make an even more painful choice â to separate from my husband pete
' over the last several months i 've come to realize that going through such a horrific event together put a fast - forward on our relationship that we each handled differently
' while my heart is beyond broken , i have a certain peace knowing from day one , i truly gave it my all , and have been fully invested in keeping this marriage , and my commitment before god
they wed in asheville , north carolina , in april last year then moved to houston , texas
seeing tsarnaev in court had helped her realize she is n't afraid of him anymore , wrote rebekah gregory dear tsarnaev , my name is rebekah gregory
because you have undoubtedly been my source of fear since april 15th , 2013
and realized i was n't afraid anymore
and today i realized that sitting across from you was somehow the crazy kind of step forward that i needed all along
