just a few weeks ago , real madrid were the most dazzling side in europe as they chased champions league and la liga glory
now , they find themselves in a crisis with boss ancelotti under fire , record signing gareth bale booed by his own fans and cristiano ronaldo taking a vow of silence
here , spain - based reporter rik sharma runs through just what has gone wrong at the bernabeu after tuesday night 's 4 - 3 defeat at home by schalke
gareth bale was subjected to boos from real madrid fans as they were beaten at home by schalke cristiano ronaldo celebrates after scoring , but he could n't prevent his side slumping to a 4 - 3 defeat ancelotti , pictured hugging schalke boss roberto di matteo , is under growing pressure at the bernabeu it seems that all is not well at the santiago bernabeu ... you could say that
' the odds of being eliminated by schalke were comparable to those of being killed by a piano , ' said as , after real madrid scraped into the champions league quarter finals
' a pitiful real madrid ! ' spat the front page of sport , while mundo deportivo labelled ancelotti 's side ' ridiculous '
so , what 's the problem ? where do you start ? ancelotti 's expensive cruise liner is full of holes and the water is flooding in , just at the wrong time
goalkeeper casillas , for one , was at fault for three of the four goals real madrid conceded
by the way , the last time they shipped four at the bernabeu in the champions league was 15 years ago , against bayern munich
virtually the only thing casillas stopped on tuesday night was players like cristiano ronaldo from leaving the pitch without applauding the fans
casillas failed to keep hold of max meyer 's shot which led to klass - jan huntelaar giving schalke the lead gareth bale , alvaro arbeloa and cristiano ronaldo look frustrated as real madrid were booed off the field surely it is time to play keylor navas then ? it 's not that simple
ancelotti reinstated him and the tension at the club has since simmered down
casillas has been below his best for some time , but replacing him is not as simple as it sounds casillas called on his real madrid team - mates acknowledge the home supporters following the surprise defeat a group of real madrid fans waved a white handkerchief after the final whistle following a disappointing result why did casillas have to force cristiano ronaldo to stay on the pitch ? cristiano ronaldo is not having a happy time right now
ever since he was berated for celebrating his 30th birthday on the evening of real madrid 's embarrassing 4 - 0 defeat by rivals atletico madrid , he 's been in a strop
despite leading lionel messi in the pichichi ( golden boot ) by 13 goals during mid-december , the pair are now level on 30 goals each in la liga
cristiano ronaldo netted twice against schalke , and both times he celebrated with fury , rather than joy , as if he was proving a point
cristiano ronaldo scored a double against schalke , but his relationship with the real madrid supporters is strained the world player of the year has grown frustrated at the lack of support from the real madrid supporters what âs got cristiano ronaldo âs goat ? a recent poll in as suggested 30 per cent of real madrid fans wanted to see him dropped - he probably does n't think he has anything to thank them for
the spain media were deeply critical of real madrid in wednesday morning 's newspapers marca and as both opted for striking headlines following real madrid 's defeat at the hands of schalke gareth bale looked tired against schalke what about his partner in crime , gareth bale ? the past few weeks have been terrible for the welshman
after last season 's heroics in the copa del rey and champions league finals , gareth bale was expected to continue his development and become a bernabeu hero
he 's played every minute of those eight games , and only in real madrid 's 2 - 0 win over deportivo de la coruna on february 14 , could he say that he put in a good performance
if gareth bale , cristiano ronaldo and benzema will start every game , regardless of performance , it 's not going to motivate them or their underlings to produce good displays
ancelotti 's future at real madrid is the subject of discussion despite delivering the club their 10th champions league so , is this all ancelotti 's fault ? well , he 's the one that 's under pressure now
he 's being asked about his future at real madrid , which seems a little unfair given he finally landed them la decima - the club 's 10th champions league - last season
so barcelona will beat real madrid in el clasico and win la liga ? it âs not that simple
