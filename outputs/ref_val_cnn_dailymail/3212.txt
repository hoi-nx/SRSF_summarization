this was not the case recently in sri lankan , when a drunk man in a national park decided to antagonize an elephant as horrified onlookers stood by
video of the encounter shows members of the crowd shouting at the man to leave the elephant alone as it had killed a person only days earlier
the man lies down on the grass before the elephant as onlookers warn it has recently killed someone after getting up and continuing to antagonize the creature , it suddenly runs out of patience in a matter of seconds , the angry elephant rushes towards him as he tries to escape but the elephant is too quick and the drunk man falls underneath it as it runs over the top of him but ignoring their pleas , he begins taunting the angry creature by first lying down on a bank directly in front of it
the drunk man is then pulled up the grassy bank and it appears as though part of his ear has been torn off and his once - muddy shirt is left covered in blood
