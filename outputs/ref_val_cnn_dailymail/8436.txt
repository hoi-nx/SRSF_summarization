artist sarah honan , 19 , from waterford , ireland , has now painted the portraits of several of these females alongside the limited details of their deaths , and any other information that is known about them in a project called blink
an ireland artist has painted a series of portraits of some of the 2,000 - plus ' janes does ' in morgues and graveyards across us who were n't identified after their deaths

while some of the women portrayed died in apparently violent circumstances , others , such as this elderly woman found unresponsive outside 145 west 55th street in new york , in 2010 , are shrouded in mystery and speculation sarah honan was so touched by the stories of these women that she wanted to create a lasting memory for them on this earth , as they had been forgotten by those who knew them when they were alive
she said : ' i think that everyone deserves some form of legacy and in a way when these women died and went unidentified it was as if their slates had been wiped clean
sarah honan painted the women from their morgue photographs , which she found on the unidentified persons database
