' would n't this place be brilliant if we had it all to ourselves ? ' one way to avoid crowds on the slopes , is to hire out the whole resort exclusively - something one utah ski village offers for $ 10,000
eagle point , in utah , can host 200 people at its resort and while its slopes are open to the public from thursday to sunday , from monday to wednesday , skiers will have the lifts and the runs to themselves
eagle point in utah can be hired out completely for almost $ 10,000 ( Â£ 6,500 ) and can cater for 200 people and while it sounds like the sort of thing that would only be exclusively accessed by the rich , royal or uber - famous , it 's not
in theory , the whole place including accommodation and slopes with five lifts to access 600 acres of skiable powder , can be all yours for $ 50 ( Â£ 32.50 )
owner shane gadbaw , a former banker , rents out the whole resort privately for $ 10,000 ( Â£ 6,486 ) , which if split between 200 people works out at just $ 50 ( Â£ 32.50 ) each
and because it 's called the ' as you wish package ' , and the resort is run privately and not by some big , faceless corporation , it 's all tailored to your group 's needs
speaking to mailonline travel , mr shane gadbaw says that three key virtues of an authentic ski and snowboard experience , affordable first class food service and a terrain for all levels make the resort what it is
the american resort offers stunning views out over utah , while this luxury continues to the facilities and food on offer executive chef jimmie mcdowell ensures his food and his staff are of the highest standard for all the guests ' eagle point resembles a ski resort of the classic era before high speed detachable lifts , luxury shopping villages and amusement park - like crowds and lines
as a private , family - run operation , the culture of eagle point and its staff is set from the top
' imagine you and your friends , family , social or corporate group , enjoying exclusive access to 600 skiable acres , five lifts , the terrain park - and of course no lift lines ! ' stay in comfortable accommodations , with superb dining options and plenty of apres ski fun for everyone - all tailored to your group 's priorities and interests
the accommodation is a step back in time to what we 'd consider a classic ski resort , with a village feel and an array of suites , condos , cottages and holiday homes , along with lodgings in beaver city , a mormon - settled town of about 2,500 people
the resort will cater for skiers as well as snowboarders and can provide all the equipment to make your stay memorable mr shane gadbaw added : ' while not as large as the mega resorts of colorado and utah , eagle point has 600 acres of terrain that will suit all levels
