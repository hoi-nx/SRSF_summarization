rating : the pub - with - rooms phenomena continues apace in london - and this is a classic of the genre , executed with style and panache by a couple of twentysomethings who met at leeds university
this is their third artist residence ( brighton and penzance are up and running ) , in what used to be a traditional boozer in pimlico , a short walk from victoria station
if the bones of a building are important , here they 're as good as they get
a bright splash of colour on the canvas : artist residence has brought a dash of flair to an old pub built by thomas cubitt in 1852 , the grand , stuccoed house is on four floors - five if you count the basement , where there 's a dimly lit bar and sitting room for hotel guests
i feel good the moment i walk in
there is no fuss at reception and , unlike the orange nearby , there is a separate entrance for those staying the night , so you do n't have to shout your name at the bar or get handed a packet of crisps rather than your room key
i 've booked a small plus room , but am upgraded to the loft because not many of the ten rooms are occupied
there are no side dishes of any description - and no carbs as far as i can see
