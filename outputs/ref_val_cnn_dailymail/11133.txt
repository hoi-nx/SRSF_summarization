google unveiled plans earlier this year for a cancer - detecting wristband that it was testing using moulds of human skin
now the firm has been awarded a patent for the technology that will ' automatically modify or destroy targets in the blood that have an adverse health effect '
according to the files , the wearable could target these cells using an ' external energy source ' such as ultrasound or radio frequencies
google 's patent explained its wearable ( illustrated ) could target any substances or objects that , when present in the blood , may affect the health of a wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels
this could include infrared signals , a radio - frequency or acoustic pulse , or a magnetic field ' a number of scientific methods have been developed to examine physiological conditions of a person by detecting and measuring one or more analytes [ chemicals ] in a person 's blood , ' explained the nanoparticle phoresis patent
' google continued that its wearable would target any substances or objects that , when present in the blood , may affect the health of wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels
he has already ploughed money into genetics firms and cancer diagnostic startups and said : ' we have the tools in the life sciences to achieve anything that you have the audacity to envision
this could include infrared signals , a radio - frequency or acoustic pulse , or a magnetic field
' as a further example , the target could be cancer cells ; by selectively targeting and then modifying or destroying the cancer cells , the spread of cancer may be diminished
the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up , for example , allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body
it would scan the blood for so - called analytes , or chemicals , in the blood such as the presence of ' enzymes , hormones , proteins , cells or other substances
' google said it could target certain proteins that have been implicated as a partial cause of parkinson , for example , or cancer cells in january , google 's life sciences lab unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells
to assist with their research , the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors ( pictured ) to assist with their research , the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors
the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up , for example , allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body ' it 's way weirder to have cancer cells floating through your body that are constantly trying to kill you , ' mr conrad continued
