as israelis prime minister netanyahu heads to the u.s. , some former security leaders from israelis have come out against his speech to congress , set for tuesday
speaking at a tel aviv press conference , retired maj. gen. reshef , one of the founders of commanders for israel 's security , said the speech -- expected to take a hard line on iran 's nuclear ambitions -- is " a terrible mistake " that will further damage the relationship between the u.s. and israelis
he also said the speech could harm israelis 's security by damaging israelis 's relationship with other countries
on friday , dagan , the former head of israelis 's intelligence agency , mossad , told one of the leading israelis newspapers , yedioth ahronoth : " the person who has caused the greatest strategic damage to israelis on the iran issue is the prime minister
" recent polling by cnn affiliate channel 10 israelis shows israelis split on the speech , with 38 % supporting it and the same percentage opposing it
but another poll from panels politics , an israelis polling institute , indicates 53 % of israelis believe the speech will have no effect on the negotiations between six world powers and iran over tehran 's nuclear program
it is committed to a regional political - security initiative to resolve the israelis - palestinian conflict
