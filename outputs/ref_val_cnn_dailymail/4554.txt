the small foam pieces used to protect fragile goods in boxes could soon power your phone thanks to a battery breakthrough
the researchers began by baking the packing peanuts at around 600 Â° c ( 1,100 â° f ) to create blocks of black carbon
typically researchers make similar microsheets using temperatures as high as 2,200 â° c ( 4,100 Â° f ) , meaning dr pol 's method uses less energy and is more environmentally friendly
dr pol got the idea to turn these peanuts into nanoparticles and microsheets when he was taking delivery of new equipment for his lab. ' i looked at the packing peanuts and thought that while we are exploring " green " technologies , we should not be harming the environment by throwing them away , ' he said

' and although the higher temperatures used to create other sheets create a more layered arrangement of carbon atoms to maximise performance , dr pol 's less - ordered materials are said to have a 15 per cent higher electrical storage capacity
by comparison , the ' disordered crystal structure ' of purdue university 's sheets ( shown ) lets them store more lithium ions than the theoretical limit - making them more powerful dr pol hopes his group 's new , scalable process could have carbon microsheets and nanoparticles ready for commercial use in batteries ( pictured ) within two years ' [ the batteries ] have disordered , porous structures , ' said dr etacheri
