an official source told ap that the secret service will conduct drone flights between 1am and 4am over the coming weeks in restricted airspace over washington d.c. during missions , agents will look at how to interfere with rogue consumer - level drones , which commonly carry video cameras but are powerful enough to carry small amounts of explosives
the challenge for the secret service is quickly detecting a rogue drone flying near the white house or the president 's location , then within moments either hacking it to seize control over its flight or jamming its signal to send it off course or make it crash
growing trend : a new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases , it has emerged the secret service has said only that it will openly test drones over washington d.c. , but it declined to provide details such as when it will fly , how many drones , over what parts of the city , for how long and for what purposes
jamming by the secret service - depending on how powerfully or precisely it works - could disrupt nearby internet networks or phone conversations until it 's turned off
testing in the real - world environment around the white house would reveal unexpected effects on jamming efforts from nearby buildings , monuments or tall trees
signals emanating from an inbound drone - such as coming from a video stream back to its pilot - could allow the secret service to detect and track it
found : the recreational drone that landed on the white house south lawn is seen in this secret service handout that agency declined to tell the ap whether the secret service sought permission because it said such requests are not routinely made public
the federal aviation administration has confirmed it formally authorized the secret service to fly the drones and granted it a special waiver to fly them over washington d.c.
in january , a wayward quadcopter drone , piloted by an off - duty u.s. intelligence employee , landed on the white house lawn
at the time , the secret service said the errant landing appeared to be accidental and was not considered a security threat
the agency had been looking at security issues surrounding drones before the january crash , but the crash of that drone led the agency to focus more attention on security issues surrounding small , unmanned aircraft that can be hard to detect
previously published reports have disclosed that the secret service already uses jammers in presidential and vice presidential motorcades to disrupt signals that might detonate hidden remotely triggered improvised explosive devices
the secret service , in conjunction with other inter-agency partners , will conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems , in the coming days and weeks
