experts say this type of sexism is harder to spot than the ' hostile sexism ' we are more familiar with â because it often masquerades as gallantry
sexist ? boston researchers carried out a study into types of sexism in men
they say there are two types of sexists , identifiable by their smile ( stock image shown ) ' hostile sexist men ' were less approachable and less friendly while those who displayed ' benevolent sexism ' were nicer and smiled more us researchers argue that while women may enjoy being showered with attention , benevolent sexism is ' insidious ' and men who are guilty of it see women as incompetent beings who require their ' cherished protection '
professor hall , of northeastern university in boston , said : ' benevolent sexism is like a wolf in sheep 's clothing that perpetuates support for gender inequality among women
examples of hostile sexism included agreeing that women tend to exaggerate problems at work , while someone who is benevolently sexist will believe women should be rescued before men from a sinking ship
they found men whose answers led to them being classed as benevolently sexist smiled more while playing the quiz game and chatting
men who are guilty of benevolent sexism see women as ' warm and pure , yet helpless and incompetent beings '
study co-author jin goh said : ' benevolent sexist men hold women in high regard and are willing to sacrifice themselves to save and protect women
however , benevolent sexist men perceive women as the weaker gender at the same time
more than 1,000 women and men were marching for gender equality in new york city today - pictured here - as millions of people across the world rallied to demand change ' unless sexism is understood as having both hostile and benevolent properties , the insidious nature of benevolent sexism will continue to be one of the driving forces behind gender inequality in our society
