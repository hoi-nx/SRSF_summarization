families of iraqi shot dead on the battlefield by uk soldiers could sue the ministry of defence for human rights violations after a high court ruling
a judgment stated that cases in which an iraqi was either shot dead or wounded fall within the jurisdiction of the european court of human rights act
the landmark ruling could lead to over 1,200 claims , represented by phil shiner âs controversial pil ( pil ) , being investigated in uk courts
the families of iraqi soldiers killed by uk troops could sue the ministry of defence for human rights violations after a high court ruling last night the ministry of defence said they were â concerned â the court had taken such â an expansive view of the echr jurisdiction â and would take the case to the appeals court
colonel richard kemp , former commander of uk forces in afghanistan , said the judgment was â absurd â
â colonel tim collins , whose eve - of - battle speech inspired the nation before the iraq war , added : â i believe that these very lawyers have serious questions to answer about the abuse of the uk âs willingness to investigate such claims for personal gain and to that effect their credibility and motivation must be questioned
â colonel tim collins , former commanding officer of the 1st battalion , royal irish regiment , ( centre ) said the lawyers that have put forward the ruling have ' serious questions to answer ' under the echr , the state has a duty to investigate allegations of wrongdoing
colonel richard kemp ( pictured ) , former commander of uk forces in afghanistan , said the judgment was â absurd â claimants however argued article 1 of the echr , the obligation to respect human rights , should also be applied to those shot on the battlefield
but the ministry of defence refused to accept that individuals who were killed during security operations carried out by uk forces in iraqi were â within the uk âs jurisdiction â
on monday , mr justice leggatt , who is the judge designated to deal with the cases on behalf of the iraqi , ruled article 1 applied to â those test cases where the individual was shot by a uk soldier â
â a judgment stated that cases in which an iraqi was either shot dead or wounded fall within the jurisdiction of the european court of human rights act ( pictured the echr building in strasbourg , france ) an ministry of defence spokesman said : â while the court has rejected all but one of pil â attempts to expand our investigative obligations , we are concerned that it has taken such an expansive view of echr jurisdiction
â a pil spokesman said : â this is a very important judgment clarifying the application of the echr not just to iraqi personnel in iraqi but for future international peacekeeping operations and situations of armed conflict involving the uk
