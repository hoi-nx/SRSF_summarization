three weeks before echo huntley died , aged just 36 , she and her twin brother , hollywood star noah , went for a walk in the sussex village where they grew up
â it was a beautiful day , â remembers the actor , who shot to fame in the 1990s playing long - haired hunk luke mcallister in itv âs emmerdale , and recently appeared in the box office hit dracula untold
â as early summer sunlight dappled through the trees on to the ancient graves , noah idly asked echo where she âd like to be buried
â noah asked echo if she would nât want somewhere more picturesque to rest but , having made her choice , she seemed adamant
echo was a lifelong sufferer from the neurological condition epilepsy , but , before she died , appeared to have turned a corner in her treatment
noah and his sister came from a large family of eight children including , remarkably , three sets of twins
â she turned blue just after birth , â explains noah
soap star : noah , who is now 40 , played heart - throb luke mcallister in emmerdale from 1993 to 1995 people with epilepsy have a tendency to recurrent seizures and the type and severity depends on the part of the brain damaged
noah says : â as a family we are unconvinced by mainstream medicine for the most part , and relied predominantly on nurturing her ourselves
â dr john jacob , consultant neurologist at milton keynes and oxford university , and bmi saxon clinic in milton keynes , says : â anti convulsants have long been the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy no matter what form it takes
this is in part because of the very small risk of death when the seizure is prolonged or sudden unexpected death in epilepsy
noah says : â doctors felt being at home was the best thing for her , with a twin growing at the same chronological rate and able to support her
there were differences between us academically which became more pronounced as we grew up , â noah continues
â noah joined the cast of emmerdale aged 19 and then , as his film career took off in his 20s , divided his time between los angeles and london
red carpet : noah ( right ) with dracula untold co-stars luke evans and sarah gadon at the premiere last year in her 20s , unable to drive because of her seizures ( the dvla requires patients to be seizure free for a year to hold a licence ) , echo began taking medication and for a decade , this worked
seizures typically last just a few moments but in severe cases , they can occur in quick succession , or continuously â and any episode that lasts for more than five minutes requires urgent treatment as there is a risk of brain damage
â in echo âs case , no one will ever know why , on a hot may day at shoreham beach near brighton with her husband , she suffered a two - hour seizure
throughout our conversation noah is introspective , speaking about the idea that when one twin dies and the other survives there is a â connection between heaven and earth â , and that seeing a bird trapped in the eaves of a church â felt like a symbol â
