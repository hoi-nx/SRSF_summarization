rhodes in action during his last scotland call - up which was back in november 2013 â we had someone like that before in kris
he âs proven that at blackburn , where he has found it difficult this season
â i know he âs elated to be back in the scotland squad for the northern ireland and gibraltar games and he âll be looking to start
since poland and northern ireland have both taken seven off gibraltar , i â ve a feeling this group is going to come down to goal difference â and jordan can certainly score goals

but if he keeps working hard it âs natural he will be compared with colin because they are both scotland and blackburn defenders
