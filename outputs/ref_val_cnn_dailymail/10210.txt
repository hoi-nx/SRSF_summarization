this is causing an imbalance between the supply of metals and metalloids and their demand from consumers - a concept referred to as ' criticality
' researchers have now assessed the criticality of all 62 metallic - based elements on the periodic table to reveal which are most at risk and what that means for our gadgets in the long - term
researchers from yale university assessed the ' criticality ' of 62 metals on the periodic table
they discovered at at least 33 of these ( shown ) are used for circuit boards
criticality looks at which materials will become harder to find , which will have the highest environmental costs and which are irreplaceable metal criticality is analysed in three ways - supply risk , vulnerability to supply restriction ( vsr ) and environmental implications
metal criticality is analysed in three ways - supply risk , vulnerability to supply restriction ( vsr ) and environmental implications
and in terms of the environment , researchers assess what costs mining certain materials , as well as the materials themselves , have on the environment and then the likelihood that this may also lead to restrictions
and in terms of the environment , researchers assess what costs mining certain materials , as well as the materials themselves , have on the environment and then the likelihood that this may also lead to restrictions
using these three categories , researchers from yale university led by professor graedel were able to see which metals and metalloids are most at risk within each group
many of the metals traditionally used in manufacturing , including zinc , copper , and aluminum , are not at risk , explained professor graedel
however , the newer or less - common metals used in smartphones , infrared optics , and medical imaging , are vulnerable
the team 's results show that the limitations for many important metals used in smartphones and other gadgets are largely those related to supply risk
these include gallium used in processor chips and selenium in transistors on these chips
platinum group metals including gold and mercury have the highest environmental implications
while steel alloying elements , such as chromium and niobium , as well as elements used in high - temperature alloys including tungsten and molybdenum , scored higher in the vulnerability to supply restriction category

gold and mercury have some of the highest environmental implications ( b )
' the researchers listed these as indium , arsenic , thallium , antimony , silver , and selenium
