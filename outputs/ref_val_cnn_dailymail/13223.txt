cnn : how did you get involved in women 's rights along the kenya - somalia border ? aa : i started working with frontier indigenous network in 2006 -- [ back then ] we were just two staff and 10 volunteers and [ now ] there are four staff with 20 volunteers
when i first began , i was just doing it in our village and now i move around all over the place up to the somalia border
on the border , there are many issues women are facing ; small girls are raped or beaten , rival clans fight , maybe because of land or because of outsiders
they come to the border and physically stop people from crossing over into kenya
but they stop people from crossing the border by beating them
when [ refugees ] are coming , if they want to cross into kenya , they have big , big problems
