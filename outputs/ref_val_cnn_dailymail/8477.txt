they found that humans unconsciously use the touch from a handshake as a way to sample smelly chemicals from each other
those that grasped hands upon meeting then touched their faces and around their nose far more often afterwards compared to a greeting where there was no physical contact
for the study , two aberystwyth university researchers donned thick rubber gloves and one dipped his hand in a bacterial soup before shaking the other âs hand
the scientists believe that the face touching is a way of subtly sniffing the hand used in the handshake and it was particularly prevalent when greeting people of the same sex
professor noam sobel , chair of neurobiology at the weizmann institute , who led the research , said : ' it is well - known that we emit odours that influence the behaviour and perception of others but , unlike other mammals , we do n't sample those odours from each other overtly
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal elife , believe their findings may provide some hints at why handshakes first evolved to become a greeting and cementing a friendship
' the scientists secretly filmed 271 people as they greeted one of 20 members of the research team in a hospital setting
they found that subjects who shook hands with people of the same sex sniffed their right hand twice as much than if they had not shaken hands
when members of the opposite sex greeted , participants sniffed their right hand far less than before a handshake but tended to sniff their left ' non-shaking ' hand more often
the participants in the study were filmed in a hospital , shown above ) greeting researchers and were found to sniff their fingers and hands considerably more after shaking hands with the person they were meeting touching the nose after physical contact ( like above ) may be a way of smelling chemical signals on others the researchers believe this may be due to participants unconsciously comparing their own scent to that of the opposite sex
in general the participants placed their hand close to their nose 22 per cent of the time after shaking hands for up to around 17 seconds at a time
they found that increased airflow through a sample of participants nostrils also accompanied the face touching , indicating that they were sniffing
when the scientists added strong artificial odours to wrists of those greeting the participants using scents associated with male or female body odour , the length of time they spent sniffing decreased
however , when they added perfume to the wrists of those greeting , the amount of sniffing , they found the amount of time participants touched their face for doubled
the researchers claim that his may be because artificial odours may mask the chemical signals from a handshake and so it requires more sniffing to detect them
