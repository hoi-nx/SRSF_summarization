a big debate researchers have been having about how small life on earth can get may be over

scientists from the us department of energy 's lawrence berkeley national laboratory and the berkeley , captured photos of ' ultra-small bacteria ' ( pictured ) scientists say that the ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns which means that almost 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an escherichia coli cell the comprehensive electron microscopy images and dna - based description of the microbes researchers were able to obtain seem to indicate the bacteria are very small - but very real
ultra-small bacteria cells have an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns [ one micron is one millionth of a meter ] , according to lawrence berkeley national laboratory close to 150 of the miniscule bacteria could fit inside an escherichia coli cell
the bacteria were found in groundwater and are believed to be rather common
