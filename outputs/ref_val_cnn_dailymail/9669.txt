half of the terror attacks carried out or plotted in britain involve members of just one extremist network , a new report reveals
al-muhajiroun , a banned organisation once fronted by hate preacher anjem choudary , has been linked to a series of atrocities and plots dating back to 1997
a new book by terrorism expert pantucci has now found that since its formation in the 1980s , the group has been central to islam extremism in the britain
more than 20 terror attacks plotted or carried out in the britain - including the 7/7 bombings which killed 52 people - have been linked to extremist network al-muhajiroun in a new report it is thought the first known violence directly linked to the group took place in 1997 , when a member of the organisation attacked a police officer
at least one of the bombers who carried out london 's 7/7 bombings had met a key supporter of al-muhajiroun , omar khyam , before the attacks which killed 52 people on underground trains and a bus in 2005
michael adebolajo and michael adebowale , who murdered fusilier lee rigby in a street in woolwich , south - east london in 2013 , had both attended events organised by the group
despite having been banned in 2005 , the group has morphed to take on a series of other names , and its influence continues to be felt , with brustholm ziamani , who was sentenced last week for plotting an attack inspired by that on lee rigby , also having been inspired by al-muhajiroun
research shows that out of 51 attacks and plots carried out or foiled in britain , al-muhajiroun had influence in at least 23
mr pantucci , who studies extremism for defence forum the royal united services institute , said the group sold its followers a radical interpretation of islam which often inspired them to commit violence

' al-muhajiroun was set up by bakri mohammed , a syria - born islam extremist who lived in britain from 1986 until he was banned from returning in 2005 after going to lebanon
