the murder earlier this month of 27 - year - old farkhunda at the hands of a mob that beat her to death , burned her body and tossed her into a river shocked afghanistan , a country in which unspeakable things often hit the headlines
soon after the incident , the images of her brutal slaying went viral on social media , noted afghanistan 's tolo news
and this time , the outrage led afghan to the streets , with assistance from facebook and other social media
" indeed , technology and connectedness have played a role in changing the old narratives in afghanistan , as farkhunda 's killing shows
not only was her murder captured and shared online , but some of those men arrested for her killing were found to have confessed via social media posts
some afghan civil society leaders see the protests that have resulted as yet another sign of an evolving afghanistan -- a nation whose recently elected leaders , now sharing a unity government , visited washington , d.c. , in an effort to turn the page on the past
" she was speaking last tuesday at a roundtable at georgetown 's institute for women , peace and security , organized around the visit by afghan president ashraf ghani and chief executive abdullah abdullah
" if this was the afghanistan of a decade before and this would have happened , a small group of afghan women would have come to the streets to be seeking justice
" but at the same time , we have conservatives who have been power - holders for many decades in afghanistan and they do n't want to see that
what they found was an online community sustaining the strong sense of injustice over farkhunda 's killing that prompted the afghan president to announce , even before he left for the united states , a fact - finding commission to investigate her murder
yet some afghan leaders worried that the brutality of this murder marked another troubling turning point in a country wrestling with a great many transitions -- economic , security and political -- all at once
women have gained a great deal in the roughly 13 years since the taliban was ousted from power
indeed , samar and other human rights advocates and civil society leaders who have played a role in afghanistan say they are determined that farkhunda 's death will not be in vain
their commitment to seeking public justice for a public horror may well be one of the most powerful signals yet of an afghanistan that is indeed a very different nation than it was only a decade ago .
