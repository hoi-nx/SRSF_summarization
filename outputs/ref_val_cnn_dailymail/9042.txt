fellaini has endured a lot since swapping merseyside for manchester
derided as a symbol of the david moyes regime , ridiculed by his own fans and , lately , held responsible for louis van gaal âs occasional lurch towards route - one football , the big belgian has had more weighing on his shoulders than that trademark mass of curly hair
fellaini fires manchester united into the lead against tottenham , a reminder of his footballing ability the belgian trains ahead of manchester united 's crucial clash with liverpool on sunday , where he is sure to be involved fellaini has grown from a bit - part player last season to become a vital member of louis van gaal 's squad a well - taken opening goal with his left foot served as a reminder that fellaini âs attributes are not just sandwiched between his chest and his head
but as he prepares to make his first appearance on merseyside since moving from everton when van gaal âs side take on liverpool on sunday , the 6ft 4in midfielder has every right to feel that things are looking up
the advanced role that van gaal has given to fellaini led sam allardyce , of all people , to label his opponents â long ball united â after the 27 - year - old âs introduction off the bench helped salvage a 1 - 1 draw at west ham last month
fellaini starred in the 3 - 0 win over liverpool at old trafford in december , and offers van gaal an alternative wayne rooney celebrates with the big belgian , who has scored five times for manchester united this season fellaini was tainted , somewhat unfairly , by being the only signing made during david moyes ' summer in charge van gaal does nât care
the transition from defensive midfielder , who first impressed david moyes playing for standard liege against liverpool in the champions league in 2008 , to target man worked particularly well for everton
but , unlike van gaal , david moyes did not feel comfortable deploying fellaini in a similar role at old trafford , having drawn enough criticism merely for signing him when cesc fabregas was his priority in the summer of 2013
disastrously , fellaini ended up as manchester united âs only signing and david moyes knew that he risked being accused of turning the premier league champions into a poor imitation of everton
since the arrival of van gaal , the midfielder has been used as an outlet and a way of breaking teams down the belgian was given a rousing applause when he was replaced after a good performance against tottenham fellaini was said to be devastated by it all , and even more so when david moyes was sacked later that month
the message had not reached manchester united fans , some of whom sarcastically applauded fellaini âs every touch in van gaal âs first home game against valencia right up until the moment he scored a last - minute winner
while david moyes seemed loathe to play fellaini off the striker , van gaal has returned him to his best role fellaini may suit slightly more ' long ball ' football , but has shown he can be mighty effective for manchester united now fellaini is set to face them again on sunday having won over at least some of his critics , much to the admiration of neville , his former everton team - mate and manchester united âs first - team coach under david moyes
