moscow russian 's president shares " political responsibility " for the assassination of opposition leader nemtsov , the late politician 's daughter said friday in her first tv interview since his death in central moscow last week
zhanna nemtsova , who said she has no faith in the russian investigation into the killing , said she believes his death will only deter other opposition voices , rather than embolden them
" i can not blame him ( putin ) directly , ( but ) i would say that our authorities , including the president of russian , have political responsibility as the head of state , " zhanna nemtsova told cnn 's matthew chance
zhanna nemtsova says she has no evidence about who ordered the murder , but that " it 's evident that it 's politically motivated
" nemtsov , 55 , was shot dead last friday night as he walked near the kremlin with his girlfriend
no one has been arrested , though russian 's federal security service chief has said there are suspects
the kremlin has suggested nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of russian intent on creating political discord , but many nemtsov supporters suspect putin 's administration of involvement
how nemtsov 's murder serves notice to putin 's enemies putin this week called the killing a " disgrace " and a tragedy , and he promised to bring those responsible to justice
" i know that some russian officials kept saying that he was not dangerous , but ... in an authoritarian regime , any person who does not agree with politics -- who criticizes the official standpoint -- is dangerous , " zhanna nemtsova said
" i think that now , russian has crossed the line after this murder , and people will be frightened to express their ideas which contradict ... the official standpoint , " zhanna nemtsova said
