a prosecutor who sent an innocent man to death row for 30 years has apologized to him and admitted he was more interested in winning the case than achieving justice
attorney a.m. ' stroud , from shreveport , louisiana , admitted that he was to blame for putting father - of - four ford behind bars in 1984 for the fatal shooting of a jeweler
' ford , now 65 , was released from the prison in angola in march 2014 but last month , he learned he has stage four lung cancer and just four to eight months left to live
in his letter , stroud , 63 , slammed the decision
' ford should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life , ' stroud said
' the audacity of the state 's effort to deny mr. ford any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of louisiana justice is appalling
' ford was accused of shooting rozeman , a shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom mr ford had done occasional yard work , in 1983 and was convicted the following year
' that 's sick , ' he said in his letter
' from behind bars , ford continued to protest his innocence
ford , now 65 , was convicted of an 1983 murder but was released a year ago after evidence showed he was not at the scene
he has since been diagnosed with cancer and has four to eight months to live then in 2013 , state district judge ramona emanuel voided the conviction and sentence based on the new information that corroborated his claim he was not present or involved in rozeman 's death
' had i been more inquisitive , perhaps the evidence would have come to light years ago ... wrongly accused : ford , a father - of - four ( pictured in a booking photo ) , was sent to death row in 1984 ' i did not hide evidence , i simply did not seriously consider that sufficient information may have been out there that could have led to a different conclusion
' stroud said he still does not know the extent of the new information that led to ford 's release
but he added that the odds were stacked against ford , whose attorneys were inexperienced in criminal law
' i apologize to ford for all the misery i have caused him and his family
' in a separate interview with the shreveport times , stroud again called for ford to be compensated and for the ' barbaric ' death penalty to be abolished
' freed : ford is pictured in march 2014 as he was freed from the state prison following 30 years behind bars
his lawyers set up an amazon wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so ford could start to re-build his life
after he left prison , he learned he had stage 3 lung cancer , which has now progressed to stage 4
he is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer , which is now terminal ' i 'm trying to make every day count , ' he told the shreveport times from his home in new orleans after learning he had just months to live
