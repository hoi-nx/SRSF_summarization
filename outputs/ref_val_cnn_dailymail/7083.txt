when kim unveiled those platinum blonde locks yesterday , her new style was met with mixed reviews
hailed as the beauty idol of the 2010s , it âs no wonder kim decided to re-join the ranks of famous blonde stars
a study last year by hair - care brand schwarzkopf showed that blondes make up 30 per cent of the retail hair dye market and contribute to 60 per cent of salon business - those numbers are surely set to rise with kim âs look sparking a wave of women going over to the lighter side
hairdressers may say a drastic hair change like kim âs is a sign of something dramatic going on in a person âs life , but that was nât the case for me when i decided to take the plunge from brunette to blonde last november
while i âve been known to reach for reach for the hair dye immediately after a break up , going blonde was nât a spur of the moment decision but more a reflection of my realisation that life âs too short not to have fun
extreme new look : rosy had her hair dyed at the bleach london salon in dalston by hairstylist naoya rosy , pictured before , left , and after , right , said was as if someone had finally lifted my invisibility cloak rosy said she now gets lots more attention from men after going platinum my hair was bleached at the bleach london salon in dalston by hairstylist naoya
as i had previously coloured my hair , it was treated as a colour correction rather than a virgin bleach
naoya first applied a pre-lightener mixed with peroxide to the ends of my hair to lift the colour out , then after applied the mixture to my roots ( as they process faster ) to ensure it was all an even colour
as a brunette i often felt mousey , invisible and way older than my 25 years
sometimes i could even feel myself slowly blending into the background in social situations and no change of outfit or make - up seemed to make a difference
an extreme colour change takes a lot of guts and i applaud women like kim for taking risks and not sticking to the same look
i do nât agree that she âs lost her signature style , if anything she stands out from the crowd even more
rosy says the most noticeable difference after her new look was how she was treated by men rosy said she went from ' mousey ' ( left ) to being served first at a bar after going blonde ( right ) kim unveiled her new look with husband kanye west at paris fashion week yesterday if you fancy having light locks , get ready for a lot of stares from strangers - bright hair is more uncommon so people tend to unconsciously let their gaze linger
rosy said she met her current partner - and found herself inundated with offers - after changing her hair colour rosy said there are downsides to being a blonde , left , but says she would never go back to being brunette 1
when i speak as a platinum blonde , people pay attention
why ? it âs more than my hair colour , it âs because i finally feel confident
like the memes of kim circulating the internet , people have stopped me to ask if i âm wearing daenerys â wig from game of thrones or tell me i remind them of legolas
