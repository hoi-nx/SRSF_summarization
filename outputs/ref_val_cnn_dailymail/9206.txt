the satellite image shows a zoomed in section of valles marineris , a 2,500 - mile ( 4,000km ) long canyon on mars , which was captured by the indian space research organisation
alien forums say the image is ' evidence ' that a civilisation may have been wiped off the mars surface as a result of nuclear war french youtube channel ufovni disclosure has created a short film showing the ' cloud of smoke ' which it claims could be either a nuclear explosion or extra-terrestrial methane
' the image shows a huge mushroom cloud and we may wonder whether it is an enormous rare dust wind cloud , or caused due to a nuclear or methane explosion
pictured is a zoomed in version of what some believe is the alien mushroom cloud , showing the crater rim , stem explosion and cloud shadow
the image was taken around the same time as the siding spring comet passed mars on october 19 last year ' at the moment of the close passage of ( the comet ) to the planet nasa cut off the live feed , ' said ufovni disclosure
' he said looking images of the ' cloud ' were an optical illusion caused by the angle of the crater with the trench
last year , plasma physicist dr john brandenburg said he believed ancient martians known as cydonians and utopians were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today
' at the moment of the close passage of ( the comet ) to the planet nasa cut off the live feed , ' said ufovni disclosure
dr john brandenburg is giving a talk on his research tomorrow in illinois at the american physical society
dr john brandenburg says evidence for the explosions exists near two sites that apparently had life in the past , including cydonians , the location of the famous ' face on mars ' spotted from orbit ( left )
however , later images showed it was just a chance alignment of shifting dust dunes ( right ) aside from this outlandish theory , dr john brandenburg has led a rather more normal , and prestigious , career
dr john brandenburg has authored a number of books with his latest , death on mars : the discovery of a planetary nuclear massacre , to be published in february 2015
but dr john brandenburg is adamant they are the remnants of two nuclear explosions on the surface
this , according to dr john brandenburg , is an artefact from the ancient alien race
' dr john brandenburg says his theory could explain the fermi paradox - namely why , if the universe is abundant with life , we have n't heard anything from anyone else yet
dr john brandenburg says mars once had an earth - like climate home to animal and plant life , and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient egyptians on earth
