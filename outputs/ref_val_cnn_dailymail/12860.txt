boston she knew something awful had happened
it was smoky and all she could hear were muffled screams
her foot was turned sideways and her legs would n't work right
and her good friend , campbell , was just lying there on the ground
karen rand -- she 's mcwatters now -- dragged herself across the pavement
she wanted to get closer to campbell so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos
" i got close to her , " she recalled
" for some reason , i got close to her head and we put our faces together
" campbell said that her legs hurt
they were the last words she 'd speak
the two women held hands until campbell 's went limp
mcwatters was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused boston marathon bomber tsarnaev , who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the united states for policies they believe inflict suffering on muslims
three people were killed in the blasts : campbell , a 29 - year - old manager for a restaurant chain ; martin richard , an 8 - year - old boy ; and lingzi lu , a 23 - year - old grad student
more than 250 others were injured
and the first day of the trial -- after opening statements -- revolved around a number of survivors of the attack , who recounted in detail the chaos of that day
prosecutors called them to the stand to paint a picture of the havoc and pain the bombings inflicted
tsarnaev 's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors
mcwatters fought her emotions as she looked at a photograph that showed her and her friend of eight years lying amid a heap of dazed and broken people
their two faces , side by side , stand out among the jumble of limbs
campbell 's mouth is open , but she is very pale
" i was really scared , " mcwatters testified , " and i remember screaming for someone to help us
everybody was screaming , everybody was screaming for help
it seemed like a long time before help got to us , but it probably was n't
" by the time first responders reached campbell , it was too late
" they were doing cpr on campbell and i started to think she did n't make it , " mcwatters said
campbell 's death was the first to be described in detail at tsarnaev 's trial
" at that point i thought that was the day i would die , " she said
boston marathon bombing timeline the day 's testimony was dramatic and emotional , most likely as the prosecutors wanted it
anyone who follows the news has seen footage of the bombings and read accounts of what happened
the power of the survivors ' testimonies in the courtroom was in the details that made what some would call an unimaginable crime into something very real
" another survivor , sydney corcoran , testified that after the blasts -- which left her ears ringing " just like leaving a concert " -- she was hurt but did n't know that she was severely injured
" i remember a man putting his forehead to my head and telling me i 'd be all right , " she said
doctors saved the teen , but her life was not spared the pain of the attack
