mayfair on the monopoly board may be worth only Â£ 400 , but with soaring house prices the reality today is eye - wateringly different
a four - storey townhouse in the exclusive london area now sells for Â£ 40million , while even a flat in the cheapest monopoly area of whitechapel has gone for nearly Â£ 5million
in light of such ludicrous prices , one estate agent has now re-imagined the classic board game â set in desirable english market towns
upmarket estate agent savills has also reinvented bond street , regent street and oxford street as harpenden , berkhamsted , and bushey , all in hertfordshire , where family homes routinely sell for more than Â£ 500,000
