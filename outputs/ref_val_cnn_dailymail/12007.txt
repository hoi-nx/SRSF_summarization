the spirit of murdered british aid worker haines is to live on an uplifting children 's tale written by two frenchmen journalists held captive alongside him by islamic state
hã©nin and torres are publishing hã©risson rentrera-t-il ã  la maison ? â ' will daddy hedgehog ever come home ? ' , on march 11
the pair , aged 39 and 30 , were kidnapped in raqqa , syrian in june 2013 and released 10 months later
an idea of the british aid worker 's was the inspiration behind the children 's book hã©risson rentrera-t-il ã  la maison ? â ' will daddy hedgehog ever come home ? ' ( right ) they spent time in captivity with mr haines , 44 , a former raf aircraft engineer who was kidnapped in march 2013 while working for an aid agency in syrian
the book 's writer mr hã©nin - who has a four - year - old daughter and a one - year - old son - and illustrator mr torres , have now paid tribute to mr haines as the inspiration behind the sweet tale
frenchmen journalists nicholas hã©nin ( left ) and torres ( right ) spent time with mr haines as isis captives ' even if he did n't write this book , his spirit is in this work
' though mr hã©nin and mr torres both made it back to their families - the frenchmen government has denied paying a Â£ 12 million ransom for their release - mr haines did not as he was savagely beheaded
mr haines ' name does not appear in mr hã©nin and mr torres ' book - written on scraps of paper and card they managed to hide from their captors - but the idea for it came from a game of turning people into animals which started with the former raf aircraft engineer
mr hã©nin has a five - year old daughter almost exactly the same age the frenchmen chose the prickly hedgehog for their book because they are known for finding their way home even if displaced
