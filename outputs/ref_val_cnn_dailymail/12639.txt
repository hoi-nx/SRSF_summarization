the gift of an inquiring mind can be both exhilarating and torturous
my job is to ask tough questions , but when it comes to faith , god , and religion , the more questions i ask in my quest for truth and understanding , the more complex the answers become
i was a bit of a rebellious child
my mom might tell you differently , but i never saw that as a bad trait
i felt that if i questioned authority , fought for the underdog , battled for the things that people told me were impossible , i would be different
that same rebellious spirit also led to things that definitely were not good for me , like hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into the type of trouble that i would rather not put in print
that 's when i " found god
" i became a " born - again " christian when i attended a young life camp in high school
i loved the christian notion of community , giving back , praying for others and making friends that cared more about doing good than getting drunk , smoking pot and having sex
i opened my arms to jesus and fully embraced christian morals and principles
i started off at westmont , a beautiful christian college nestled in the heart of santa barbara , california
the professors dedicated bountiful amounts of time to our individual spiritual development , and regularly prayed with us
as glorious and fulfilling as all that appeared , two years into college , the world became much larger to me
i left westmont after my sophomore year and transferred to usc 's school of journalism
my stepfather , who grew up in -- but later left -- the mormon church has a perspective on religion that i find intriguing
but while he may not embrace " god - liness , " he does believe in " good - liness
" god , he told me in one of our many colorful spiritual discussions , is the " good " in humankind
after years of spiritual reflection and inquiry , i am at a place where i do n't want to feel guilty , hypocritical , judgmental , closed - minded or arrogant
so , where do i stand now -- 30 years after " finding god , " questioning my faith , committing sins , seeking hazardous adventure and trying to love life and people to the best of my ability ? i am a " seeker
" a constant seeker within this world , among people and , of course , for spiritual enlightenment of all kind
