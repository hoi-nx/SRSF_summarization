health officials say people should eat less sugar
the world health organization finalized guidelines wednesday saying people should keep intake of added sugars to just five to ten per cent of overall calories , which translates to about 25 to 50 grams of sugar a day for most people
but research indicates that many people are n't aware of how much sugar they 're eating every day
salad dressings , soups , yogurts and cereals have all been named as some of the worst offenders when it comes to sugar content ; the popular deluxe french salad dressing from wish-bone , for example , has four grams of sugar per serving - meaning it has around one teaspoon of sugar for every two tablespoons of dressing
similarly , progresso 's rich and hearty beef pot roast contains four grams of sugar per serving which means there are approximately two teaspoons of sugar in every can
