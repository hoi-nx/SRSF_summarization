early humans living in africa almost two million years ago came in a range of shapes and sizes , just as people do today , a new study claims
the study is the first in 20 years to compare the body size of humans who lived between 1.5 million and 2.5 million years ago
early humans living in africa almost two million years ago came in a range of shapes and sizes , just as people do today , a new study claims
the main increase in body size occurred tens of thousands of years after the small , primitive human homo erectus migrated out of africa
fossils show that homo erectus , which averaged less than five foot in height and weighed less than eight stone , was living in georgia 1.77 million years ago
the scientists , whose findings are reported in the journal of human evolution , developed a method of calculating the height and body mass of individuals from small fossil fragments , some no bigger than toes
' before 1.7 million years ago our ancestors were seldom over five foot tall or particularly heavy in body mass. ' when this significant size shift to much heavier , taller individuals happened , it occurred primarily in one particular place - in a region called koobi fora in northern kenya around 1.7 million years ago
' that means we can now start thinking about what regional conditions drove the emergence of this diversity , rather than seeing body size as a fixed and fundamental characteristic of a species
suggesting that migrations into eurasia were not contingent on larger body sizes , â the study says body size has been implicated as a factor contributing to both brain evolution and the first hominin dispersals into eurasia one argument suggests that as lower limbs lengthened and hominins assumed limb proportions more similar to modern humans , they became more mobile and changed their foraging behaviour and diet
but fossil evidence for body size now suggests the marked increase of body size variables in early homo took place after 1.8 million years in eastern africa
interestingly , the study says that there was an increase in body size at the start and end of the period studied , which suggests that factors other than chronology also influenced the body size of early humans .
