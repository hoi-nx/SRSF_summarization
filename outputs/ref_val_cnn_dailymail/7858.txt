mi5 has been condemned over its handling of the case of bloodthirsty jihadi john no organisation is more important in the fight against terrorism within our society than mi5
much of this condemnation has focused on the revelation that , before he left to join the is jihad in syria , emwazi was known to mi5 as an extremist and may even have had links to the 2005 london bombers
but there have also been noisy complaints , widely relayed across the media , that it was mi5 âs supposedly heavy - handed surveillance which drove emwazi down the path to radicalism
like the left - wing guardian newspaper , the bbc has been giving copious airtime to the nauseating pressure group cage , which has a long record of providing support for islamist terror suspects
given an undeserved platform by the bbc , cage âs spokesman asim qureshi peddled the revolting propaganda line that emwazi had been a â gentle â and â beautiful â man until apparently forced to become a sadistic executioner because of mi5 âs cruel harassment
according to asim qureshi âs grotesque theory , this harassment by mi5 began after emwazi had attempted to go on â safari â to africa with a couple of other muslim extremists â he was arrested on landing in tanzania en route to somalia â following his graduation
spooking people like emwazi is absolutely necessary
there have also been noisy complaints that it was mi5 âs supposedly heavy - handed surveillance which drove emwazi down the path to radicalism - an attack which is both ' unfair and counter-productive ' the drivel about jihadi john was then reinforced by senior tory mp david davis on yesterday âs jeremy vine programme on radio two
he rejected the theory that emwazi had merely gone to africa on â safari â
but he repeated accusations he had already made in the guardian ( a paper which has already done deep damage to our national security by publishing intelligence documents leaked by us national security agency traitor edward snowden ) , that mi5 were guilty of â confusion of aims and ineffective tactics that leave known terrorists to carry out evil deeds and recruit more conspirators â
asim qureshi , spokesman for pressure group cage , said emwazi had been â gentle â until he was apparently harassed by mi5 all this criticism of mi5 is both unfair and counter-productive
the only people who gain from it are the terrorists and their supporters
the problem with mi5 is not that it is too interventionist , as cage and many of the chattering classes pretend , but that , because of its lack of resources and powers , it is insufficiently interventionist
