it took a full and frank exchange of views to rejuvenate bitton âs celtic career
the israeli midfielder has emerged as one of ronny deila âs key players this season
omitted from the celtic manager âs early first - team squads , a conversation between the pair became unavoidable
israeli midfielder bitton has become a key player for celtic after struggling to adapt at first the norwegian talked
crucially , he also learned what it would take to salvage his celtic career
â i prefer the conversation between me and the gaffer to stay between me and him , â said bitton
â but at the beginning of the season there were a couple of things i did nât understand in terms of what he expected from me
â bitton needed a conversation with manager ronny deila before the penny finally dropped for him the temptation for any player out of the team is to blame the coach but ronny deila told bitton to look a little closer to home
speaking in recent weeks , the celtic boss said : â if you put everything on the coach then you are lost , you are finished
â you have to show in training that you are good enough and then you get your chance , and bitton has done that
â pushed on the issue , bitton will plead guilty on all counts
â but after you go home you think honestly : â ok , what am i doing wrong ? â â i understood that i needed to change myself , that i needed to improve
but if you want success you must change to do things the way the gaffer wants
â i said to myself , if i do nât change i will find myself out of this club
â it âs not easy when you are not playing so you need to have a good attitude and a strong mentality â you need to show the gaffer you want to change

then you come to scotland and ... it âs not quite the same
â his wife is in glasgow now and , with regular games , he has adapted to scotland football to a point where charlie mulgrew faces a battle to resume his midfield partnership with scott brown
â the midfielder has had some swelling on his ankle , after suffering an injury against dundee united last week with the inhospitable climate and culture the israeli admits he could have returned home
â the easiest thing would be to not care and just go back to israeli and not want to be here any more , â he added
bitton suffered ankle swelling against dundee united in the scottish cup last weekend and is fighting to prove his fitness for hampden
â bitton has admitted that it took some time to adapt to life - and the weather - in scotland the opportunity to win his first domestic trophy at the national stadium as a celtic player beckons
the norm is to talk down domestic clean sweeps to lessen expectations , yet bitton accepts that â whatever people say in the public domain â the onus is on celtic to win everything
