if morgan really believes what he said after england 's miserable world cup ended with an anti-climactic win over afghanistan at a near - empty sydney cricket ground , then they are in even more trouble than we thought
the england one - day captain was either protecting his players or is in total denial after an early world cup exit caused by england 's extreme limitations in the 50 - over format being repeatedly , brutally and embarrassingly exposed
it is the only explanation for morgan insisting he had ' no regrets ' and , even more bizarrely , saying that he felt all the england players who have under - performed so spectacularly here should carry on in the one - day blue clothing
england captain morgan insists he and his side have ' no regrets ' over their early world cup exit morgan ( second left ) walks off the field with ian bell ( third left ) as rain delays play on friday this was another deflating day for england even if they did win their final , meaningless group match with ease on a soggy day in sydney cricket ground against a willing but mediocre team of minnows in afghanistan
england batsman taylor plays a shot as afghanistan wicket - keeper afsar zazai watches on ian bell shakes hands with afghanistan players following england 's hollow consolation win at the world cup ' there are no regrets , absolutely not
we gave it everything , ' morgan insisted after england had managed to equal statistically their worst ever world cup by defeating a second minnow in afghanistan as well as scotland
when morgan was asked if england should make changes as they play catch - up in one - day cricket , he said : ' no , absolutely not
' ian bell plays a shot during england 's match against afghanistan at the sydney cricket ground taylor ( left ) and morgan celebrate the wicket of afghanistan 's samiullah shinwari during friday 's win england batsman alex hales plays a shot during the final match of england 's poor world cup campaign that may be so but if the time is not ripe for change now , then we may as well all give up on the 50 - over format and go home
yet morgan is not hungry enough , it seems , to lead england in their next one - day international , against ireland in dublin in may
and if morgan truly believes that no changes need to be made now , then he is the wrong man to take england forward after this disaster of a world cup
england 's win over afghanistan attracted only a handful of supporters to conclude a dismal world cup despite their early exit the world cup , morgan suggests england should stick with the current squad
