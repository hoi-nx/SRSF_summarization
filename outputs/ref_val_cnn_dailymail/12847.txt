london emwazi , the britain - isis fighter the world knows as " jihadi john , " was fuming with righteous indignation when he met with a representative of cage prisoners -- a muslim advocacy group now known as cage -- shortly after being deported from tanzania in august 2009
emwazi said that during the questioning he denied any connection to extremism and stated that innocent people had been killed in the 2005 london transport system terrorist attacks and that the 9/11 terror attacks in the american were wrong
father : no proof my son is ' jihadi john ' but more than a dozen britain administrative court documents obtained by cnn paint a very different picture of emwazi and explain why he was on britain security services ' radar before he made the trip
the documents reveal britain security services believed emwazi was part of a radical london recruitment network for terrorist groups in east africa
one figure in the group -- a 30 - year - old british-iranian identified only as " ce " who was allegedly trained by al qaeda terrorists in somalia in 2006 -- was later placed under a " control order , " a britain administrative measure to restrict the freedom of movement of terror suspects
a december 2011 court document pertaining to ce 's case named emwazi as part of his extremist network
according to the document , britain home secretary theresa may " maintained she has reasonable grounds for suspicion that since his return to the britain in february 2007 , ce has continued to associate regularly with members of a network of britain and east africa - based islamist extremists which is involved in the provision of funds and equipment to somalia for terrorism - related purposes and the facilitation of individuals ' travel from the britain to somalia to undertake terrorism - related activity
ce told britain officials that mekki and emwazi often stopped by his wife 's apartment
according to the court documents , security services believe five members of the group -- ce , berjawi , bx , ezzouek , miah and chentouf -- attended an al qaeda training camp in somalia in 2006 in which they may have been instructed in the use of explosives
the author proposed two months ' training in somalia for britain and western recruits selected for the attack , including target reconnaissance , hostage - taking , weapons and counter-surveillance
according to the court documents , at least one member of emwazi 's circle -- j1 , a 36 - year - old ethiopian asylum seeker to the britain -- had links to the al qaeda cell that attempted to bomb the london transport system on july 21 , 2005 , two weeks after bomb blasts on london underground trains and buses killed 52 people and wounded 770
in october 2009 , two months after emwazi 's alleged aborted attempt to wage jihad possibly in somalia , three members of his west london network -- berjawi , sakr and walla eldin rahman -- traveled to join the terrorist group al-shabaab in somalia , according to the documents
according to the britain court documents , berjawi remained in contact with the radical network he and emwazi belonged to in the britain while in somalia
by 2013 , emwazi 's london radical network had a new cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre : the jihad against the assad regime in syria
two members of emwazi 's network managed to leave britain despite being under " terrorism prevention and investigation measures " ( tpims ) , which means the monitoring of terror suspects who ca n't be charged
magag -- a britain - somalia man previously identified as " bx " under the control order regime -- fled in december 2012 after using scissors to cut through the strap of his gps location monitoring device
britain authorities believe he hailed a london taxi , and disappeared
he had previously attended the training camp run by the senior al qaeda operatives nabhan and fazul mohammed in somalia in 2006 and was involved in fund - raising for al qaeda in east africa , according to the court documents
in 2010 , prior to the introduction of tpims , a britain judge had ruled he was " too dangerous to allow him to be in london for even a short period
" nevertheless , the britain secretary of state wrote in court documents that " magag is not considered to represent a direct threat to the britain public
mohamed -- a somalia - born radical previously identified as " cc " -- went on the run in november 2013 after entering a west london mosque and removing his gps monitoring device
according to the court documents , he was involved in facilitating travel for others to somalia and fund - raising for al-shabaab , and was planning attacks potentially against western interests in somaliland before his arrest
