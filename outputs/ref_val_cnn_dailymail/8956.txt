ian paterson was suspended after he performed hundreds of unnecessary partial mastectomies hundreds of victims of a breast surgeon who carried out botched operations may never receive compensation because of a loophole in his insurance policy
ian paterson was suspended after he performed hundreds of unnecessary partial mastectomies on at least 250 healthy women over a 15 - year period
an independent review revealed the 57 - year - old also carried out ' cleavage sparing ' mastectomies on at least 450 other women , in which breast tissue was left
ian paterson pioneered the operations on women , leaving part of their breast behind solely for cosmetic reasons - dramatically increasing the risk of their cancer returning
more than 700 patients were recalled by the hospitals where ian paterson worked , as part of the review overseen by sir ian kennedy
the surgeon worked at both nhs and private hospitals across the midlands from 1994 , until he was suspended in 2012
while ian paterson 's nhs patients are able to pursue compensation claims through the health service 's channels , it is the surgeon 's private patients that are facing being left with nowhere to turn
surgeons who work in private hospitals have to take out their own insurance to cover themselves against medical negligence claims
however ian paterson 's insurance company , the medical defence union ( mdu ) , is disputing the compensation claims
it is doing so on the basis that some of the operations carried out may have been illegal and are not included in ian paterson 's cover
louise , a medical negligence lawyer at irwin mitchell solicitors , is representing patients treated by ian paterson at the spire
former patients of ian paterson 's , jade , 24 , left , and julie robinson , right , face missing out on compensation despite having had unnecessary operations at the hands of the breast surgeon ian paterson told her it was a ' stitch granuloma ' - harmless cells around the wound site - but he removed it anyway
shockingly , because the operations were carried out a private hospital , miss jade is unlikely to receive any compensation , despite lawyers advising she could expect up to Â£ 50,000
' it seems shocking that there is n't the same rules of cover for private patients as nhs patients
' ' this is a unique situation , where a private surgeon 's practices fall outside of their insurance cover , and there is no safety net for patients
' many clients started out in the nhs and paid privately to see mr ian paterson to expedite their treatment , ' she said
' a cleavage sparing mastectomy involved leaving behind some breast tissue to provide an improved cleavage for the patient
but it breached national guidelines , which state that leaving tissue after a mastectomy increases the chances of cancer recurring - especially if the remaining breast tissue does not receive radiotherapy
this is because a significant proportion of breast tissue is deliberately left by the surgeon in the inner aspect of the breast in order to give the patient breast cleavage - even in women not undergoing immediate reconstruction
the technique is different to the widely - used skin sparing mastectomy , where the surgeon leaves behind an envelope of skin to improve the appearance of breast reconstruction
she added : ' this is a deeply unfair set of circumstances whereby mr ian paterson 's patients who received treatment in the nhs are rightly receiving the compensation which they are due , but the patients who opted to pay privately may be left out of pocket for the treatment itself and without any compensation for negligent injuries identical to those suffered by mr ian paterson 's patients in the nhs
' it is distressing both to mr ian paterson 's private patients , and professionally as a medical negligence lawyer , that it is legitimate and accepted for insurance cover to be suspended and / or withdrawn on a discretionary basis , affording no obvious recourse to private patients
' ian paterson worked at nhs and private hospitals across the midlands from 1994 until he was suspended last year
ian paterson was told to stop cleavage - sparing operations but continued until as late as 2011
spire , which runs private hospitals at little aston and solihull , has already issued ' an unreserved apology ' to ian paterson 's patients
