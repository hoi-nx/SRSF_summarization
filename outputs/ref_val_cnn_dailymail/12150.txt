alas , both -- along with a huge swathe of other vital services -- are under attack by the administration of rauner , the new republicans governor of illinois
unwilling to think about new revenue , all he can do is cut programs
second , rauner 's cuts are taking place against the backdrop of a bigger attack on disability
too many right - wing politicians and pundits see disability as a wedge issue with which they can divide interest groups , pit people who need help against each other and rip apart the core social safety net
meanwhile , they reassure their base , which is filled with individuals who also need help from the state , that only they really deserve benefits
like rauner , other governors are cutting services in the name of austerity
kansas , under sam brownback , has pushed disabled people off medicaid , making services less effective and efficient
scott walker , in wisconsin , has proposed cutting long - term care services in such a way as to limit individual choice of caregivers and service providers , empowering the healthcare industry and not disabled americans
florida has gutted benefits to severely disabled individuals in workers ' compensation cases and eliminated countless positions in the department of health
the rauner budget slashes state spending by over $ 4 billion , much of the savings gleaned by eliminating or reducing eligibility for programs based in the dhs ( dhs )
each cut will come with costs to families and individuals who need the state 's help most
moreover , many of the cut programs actually save the state money over time
take , for example , early intervention , which provides services to children with developmental delays from birth to age 3 at little cost to the parents ( there are means - tested co-pays )
the plan is to take every child who is 30 - 49 % delayed ( about 10,000 children ) , re-test them , and remove eligibility from thousands of those deemed the least deserving until the arbitrary dollar amount is reached
over the long term , this is not only bad for children , but is bad for illinois ' budget
for each dollar spent on programs like early intervention , according to studies by people such as the nobel laureate james heckman and the rand corporation , the state saves at least $ 7 in future services
at a recent state senate budget hearing , which i attended , bassi kept saying that the program was too expensive and seemed unable to address the long - term costs of short - term savings
respite programs , which the rauner budget eliminates entirely , provide qualified assistance to people who care for people with disabilities
the programs also provide emergency backup should the caregiver have a medical problem or some other issue
in such cases , the person with a disability is likely to end up in a state - run facility
throughout , the governor and his administration have found ways to re-write definitions of disability in order to save money
not only that , but many of these programs bring in matching funds from the federal government or other sources , and the state is surrendering those dollars as well
so why make these cuts , given their likely long - term costs ? it may be that the rauner administration just does n't care about long - term fiscal health so long as next year 's budget looks good
but i see the rauner attacks on disability - related services as just the latest example of lawmakers trying to re-define disability in a way that saves them money
questions about the fundamental necessity of disability benefits infuse right - wing speech on the issue
