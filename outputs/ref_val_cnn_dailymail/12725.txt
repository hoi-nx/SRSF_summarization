football is the most widely played sport among french youths
how can football serve as a tool of socialization when it remains the domain of young boys and men ? algeria coach gourcuff , who has a coached a number of ligue 1 clubs , notes that for a long time , women 's football " was a sport totally marginalized
" stereotypes abounded that the sport was too rough , too masculine for girls to play
" over the past 10 years , there has been a considerable development of the women 's game , " said gourcuff
" the sport 's increased television presence helps significantly , especially broadcasts of the women 's world cup
" that has changed a bit the image of women 's football , " gourcuff said , " notably among young girls
" el alagui , who now plays for scottish club hibernian , noticed a dramatic difference in how women 's football is perceived back home
" les bleues are presently third in fifa 's world ranking and hopes are high for their success at the women 's world cup in canada between june 6 and july 5
the professional women 's league is also responsible for encouraging more girls to play
at asvcm only seven out of 345 players in the club 's football school are girls , and two more play with the club 's youth teams in competitions
during the 2013 - 14 season , there were 50,516 licensed girls in the under - 6 to under - 20 demographic , as compared to 997,511 for boys of the same age
more is needed , but the continued success of the women 's league and national team will perhaps inspire more girls to take up the sport .
