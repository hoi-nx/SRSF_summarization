paddy mcnair admits he will fulfil his boyhood dream if he earns his first northern ireland cap against scotland on wednesday night
the manchester united defender has been given his first taste of top - team action at old trafford by new boss louis van gaal this season
now he is set to follow that up by making his international debut in glasgow when o'neill 's side take on the scots at hampden park
paddy mcnair has made an impressive breakthrough for manchester united this season at the back the 19 - year - old was forced to pull out of his first involvement with the national team last october due to injury , while he was an unused substitute a month later as the irish lost 2 - 0 away to romania
but he is expected to finally pull on the green jersey in the midweek friendly clash that will serve as a warm - up ahead of sunday 's crucial euro 2016 qualifier with finland at windsor park
' it would be a dream come true if that happens , ' said the teenage centre - half
' as a young boy it is a dream to play for your country
while northern ireland are just a point off the summit of group f after taking nine points from the first 12 available , gordon strachan 's side are very much in the hunt themselves
the 19 - year - old has seen his game time limited in recent weeks but has done enough to earn a call - up ' it 's a game we can definitely win , though
' paddy mcnair can also expect to come up against another familiar face clad in dark blue , with former manchester united midfielder darren likely to line - up for the hosts
the 31 - year - old - who quit the red devils in january after 12 years to sign for west brom - played an influential dressing - room role while paddy mcnair was making his way through the old trafford ranks
darren ( right ) was influential in helping paddy mcnair settle into the manchester united dressing room before he left and the youngster happily admits he owes the four - time premier league winner a huge debt of gratitude
' louis van gaal took a risk on paddy mcnair when he had a shortage of defenders and was rewarded for his trust in the 13 games paddy mcnair has racked for van gaal 's side this term , he has done enough to leave the dutchman so impressed that he reckons the ballyclare youth could be a mainstay of the manchester united line - up for the next decade
