it is probably one of the most peculiar aspects of human biology - that females of a certain age lose the ability to reproduce
now scientists have discovered that killer whales - a species separated from humans by almost 94 million years of evolution - also suffer from the menopause and it could provide clues as to why it evolved in the first place
there is just one other species in the wild known to undergo the menopause - short - finned pilot whales - although it has been observed in a handful of captive primates and animals
older female killer whales tend to take the lead ( like the one above ) when families are foraging for food the evolution of a trait that reduces the reproductive capability of a species has long baffled biologists and there are a number of theories for why it emerged in humans
now a team of researchers from the university of exeter and the university of york may have unraveled the reason for the menopause - in killer whales at least
a few species of primate , like rhesus monkeys , orangutans and chimpanzees are also known to experience menopause while it has also been reported in elephants and short - finned pilot whales
however , the short - finned pilot whale and the killer whale are the only animals that been been seen to live long past the age that they lose the ability to reproduce
female killer whales can continue having calves , like above , until around the age of 35 years old say scientists in total they observed 102 whales - 58 of which were female - and studied which of the whales occupied the lead position as the whales hunted for the salmon
on average female killer whales older than 35 years old were found to have gone through the menopause
the researchers found that the older post-reproductive females tended to lead groups of the whales when they were foraging for salmon
killer whale are one of just two species that are known to undergo the menopause in the wild other than humans they were also more likely to take the lead in years when the salmon abundance was low - meaning the killer whales were struggling to find food
