starbucks has announced that its baristas will start pro-actively talking to customers about racism , in an attempt to ' create a more empathetic and inclusive society - one conversation at a time '
starting on monday , staff at the 4,700 cafÃ©s across america will have the option to write ' racetogether ' on cardboard cups , which is the slogan of a starbucks anti-racism campaign
it is hoped that customers who encounter the slogan on their coffee cup will be inspired to discuss the deeper issues affecting america
last year , schultz travelled to starbucks branches in the cities most affected by racial tension , including los angeles , st louis , chicago , new york , oakland and seattle
mr schulz met about 2,000 starbucks staff on the tour , and made contact with the rest of his 200,000 employees - 40 per cent of whom are from ethnic minority backgrounds - via a video address
' last week , the company ran full - page advertisements in the new york times and usa today , highlighting race tensions in the country
the campaign will continue on friday , when every copy of usa today will carry an insert about racism , which will also be stocked at branches of starbucks
' indeed , despite the raw emotion around the events and their underlying racial issues , we at starbucks should be willing to talk about them
