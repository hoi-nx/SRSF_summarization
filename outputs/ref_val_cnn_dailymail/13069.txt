" just any excuse to put on a wig and a cape , " i 'd tell friends
see , this halloween was different : i 'd been diagnosed with a brain tumor just weeks before , and donning this costume was a lighthearted way to feel empowered ahead of the biggest fight of my life
but this year , i would n't be able to party on the same day as everyone else
i was organizing one last massive celebration to honor my life and the people i love before my brain surgery two days later
it all started early one morning in september while i was wrapping up my work as a digital producer for cnn 's " new day
i started to feel strange and went to the nurse 's office in my building to ask for help
my speech began to slur , my hands were tingling , and my head was pounding
within an hour , i went from thinking i might have a migraine because i needed new glasses to being rushed to the hospital
i was 28 years old
when i looked at the scan of my brain , sitting there , big as an orange , in the left hemisphere was a large black spot
my speech came back fully after a few hours , but a terrible headache lingered all day , and i was kept in the hospital overnight without discussing with the medical staff the full details of what was found on the scan
my family and i were scheduled to meet with a brain surgeon the next morning
" ms. moskowitz , we suspect you have a meningioma
" we see you have a brain tumor , and you 'll have to have surgery to have it removed , " he said in a calm , even tone
it was the most afraid i 've ever been in my life
he suspected that the tumor was slowly growing deep in the left ventricle of my brain for years
and the incident at work ? perhaps a miniseizure related to the tumor , but they could n't be sure
i was told the mass was n't life - threatening at that point and probably was not cancer , but the location was very deep and unique
the tumor was growing in an open tunnel in my brain and would eventually grow big enough to block the flow of spinal fluid
first person : caught in grief 's riptide after my terrible experience earlier in the day with the resident who loved to share bad news and disappear , i knew i did n't want to have my surgery at this hospital
it was time to shop around for a brain surgeon
two weeks after the incident at work , i saw a doctor at nyu who talked about the surgery in dire terms
there was a 10 % chance i would need a shunt to help drain excess fluid from my brain for the rest of my life
dr. bruce is a tall , commanding man with the confidence and swagger you 'd hope for in a brain surgeon
first person : the only cuba i 've ever known what if they took the tumor out and it was cancer after all ? what if they could n't get the whole thing during the operation and had to do radiation later ? what about that shunt ? what if anything went wrong and i would never be myself again ? at the hospital , my family bickered about who got a chair in the waiting room as i sat silently , waiting to be whisked through the double doors and into the rest of my life
i woke up one brain tumor lighter and surrounded by the people i love
that fact was solidified when just a month after my surgery , my best friend 's sister died from a brain aneurysm
i returned to work part - time , working one day a week starting in february
