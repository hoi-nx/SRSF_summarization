freddy describes himself as â 50 - 50 â british and australian , though the soft queensland accent seems a giveaway
it is nât quite as simple as that , because freddy is the son of steve , 1980 olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of british sport , whose rivalry with sebastian coe captivated a global audience
three decades on , freddy is forging his own path â but as a cyclist , not a runner , having switched sports 18 months ago and made such rapid progress that he has trained with chris froome , the 2013 tour de france winner , and recently signed with french âs top development team
cyclist freddy is all smiles as poses for a picture with his former athlete father steve ovett ovett jnr spent his first seven years in dumfriesshire , where his parents moved after steve âs retirement , and where his father competed in the odd cycle race until he collided with a car in 1994 â by coincidence , the year freddy was born
freddy knows little about his father âs brief cycling career , and laughs as he says : â i can imagine him rocking up , thinking he was stronger than anyone
â freddy and his father steve hit the running track , somewhere steve is very familiar with father and son are cut from the same cloth
that augurs well for freddy and badly for opponents , since the older freddy , now 59 , was famously competitive
had social media existed in the 1980s , it âs difficult to imagine steve asking a journalist to publish his twitter handle ( it âs @ freddyovett , since you ask )
freddy recently signed with french âs top development team after swapping running trainers for a bike freddy was a promising middle - distance runner , just like his dad , and in 2012 won a scholarship to the university of oregon
â i think i was meant to be a cyclist all along , â freddy says
â medals : 800m olympic gold , 1500m bronze ( 1980 ) ; 1500m europe gold ( 1978 ) ; 800m europe silver ( 1974 , 1978 ) ; 5,000m commonwealth gold ( 1986 )
world records ran a 3:48.8 mile in 1980 to beat sebastian coe âs record battled with sebastian coe for the mile record in 1981 â it changed hands three times in nine days set three 1500m records between 1980 and 1983 set a two mile record in 1978 that lasted nine years freddy was also bbc sports personality of the year in 1978 what did his father make of him turning his back on running ? â when i started cycling , we were nât speaking , â says freddy
â when i went to europe last year , my dad and i got back in contact , â freddy continues
â freddy has a lot to live up to if he wants similar levels of success as his father steve one of the challenges in athletics , says ovett jnr , is dealing with doping , which â surprisingly â he thinks is worse in his original sport than in his new one
â freddy , 21 , is based in chambery in the alps , in an apartment owned by his new team , ag2r
they are as french as cycling teams come , but manager , vincent lavenu , a top rider in the 1980s , was interested in a rider called freddy
steve cram and freddy during the heats of the men 's 1500 metres event at the summer olympics in 1984 he shares an apartment with a french rider and a chef comes in to cook lunch and dinner
the team is paying for french classes â he goes to school for three hours a day
steve was a 1980 olympic 800 metres gold medallist and a legend of british sport â i need to learn in under 23 racing before trying to be a hero , â he says
â last year , during his first racing trip to europe , freddy stayed with his agent , baden cooke , in monaco , which is also where chris froome and his sky team - mate richie live
freddy , 21 , is based in chambery in the alps , in an apartment owned by his new team , ag2r â it was fantastic , â says freddy
