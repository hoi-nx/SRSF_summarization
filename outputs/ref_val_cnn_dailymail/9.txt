the missing philae space probe that bumped down onto the surface of a comet 284 million miles from earth could wake up from today
scientists at the european space agency have restarted efforts to listen for a signal from the stricken lander on comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko
they lost contact with the washing - machine sized spacecraft in november last year after it bounced several times before landing in a hollow below a cliff
european space agency scientists have renewed efforts to contact the philae lander on comet 67p , shown in the illustration above however , as the comet has travelled closer to the sun in its journey through the solar system , researchers hope philae will get enough light to come back to life
the rosetta probe , which was carrying philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre ( 40 inches ) per second relative to the comet
the european space agency has now turned on the communication unit on the rosetta spacecraft that is orbiting the comet
ulamec , lander project manager at the dlr ( dlr ) , said : ' philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in november last year
' comet 67p is now 186 million miles ( 300 million km ) from the sun. scientists hope that as the comet rotates and gets closer to the sun , philae 's solar panels will move out of the shade of the cliff it is resting under
the rosetta orbiter took a number of images of philae as it bounced , with its final suspected resting place in the top right
however , further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe the duck - shaped comet 67p/churyumove-geraismenko is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does this image sent back by the philae lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the mothership rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe
philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an overhanging cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander
but there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander 's solar panels
the image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the rosetta probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the philea lander comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in august this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander
once awake , philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the rosetta orbiter
koen guerts , part of the philae lander team at the dlr control centre , said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home
' ' at this time , we do not yet know that the lander is awake.to send us an answer , philae must also turn its transmitter â and that requires additional power
' this blurry image captures the moment philae bounced from the comet 's surface after failing to anchor itself rosetta captured a mothership 's view of philae as it descended to the surface of comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko on 12 november 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two - way communication
