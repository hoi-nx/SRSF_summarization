thousands of cases of diabetes and cancer could be avoided , saving the nhs Â£ 300million , by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks , it is claimed
academics have calculated the likely reduction in consumption caused by putting up the price of full sugar drinks like coca-cola and pepsi and the resulting health benefits
however , the drinks industry have challenged the figures , insisting a sugary drinks tax will only hit the poorest in society with higher living costs while doing nothing to improve their health
the liverpool team calculates that a tax of 20p per litre â 12p per can â would reduce the number of cases of diabetes by just under 50,000 over 20 years
they estimate there would be a fall of 33,000 in cases of stroke and heart disease and some 9,000 fewer victims of bowel cancer
malcolm clark , co-ordinator of the children âs food campaign , said a 20p per litre sugary drinks duty would save lives and money across england these figures relate to england alone and the researchers estimate it would lead to savings of Â£ 300m in the cost of treating these people over the 20 years , releasing money for other patients
the campaign for a sugary drinks duty is supported by over 60 organisations , including public health and medical professional bodies , dentists , children âs charities , action on sugar and school food experts
â public health directors in north west england and in cardiff , as well as the london health commission , have publicly backed a sugary drinks duty
professor damien walmsley , the british dental association âs scientific adviser , said : â a tax on sugary drinks and food is a no brainer
â health campaigners and doctors have controversially likened sugar and its contribution to obesity and ill - health as the â new tobacco â the research looking the impact of the levy was led by brendan collins , research fellow in health economics , university of liverpool , who has created a model showing the effect by local authority area across england
since there is no spare money in the nhs , we are calling for a duty on sugary drinks , which will itself reduce diabetes and obesity
