nick gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom , telling councils and headteachers to do ' what 's in the best interests of the child '
it follows warnings from campaigners that some local authorities made it difficult for families who want to put off joining reception classes , raising the prospect of 250,000 children having to start in year 1
education minister nick gibb backed parents who have called for their children to delay entering classroom , telling councils and headteachers to do ' what 's in the best interests of the child ' the department for education issued guidance to schools and councils in july 2013 and last december making it clear that there is no rule stating that a child has to be in the right school cohort for their age group
and it suggests delaying the start of school by 12 months should be ' no barrier ' to the child then starting in reception class
in one high profile case , mother dutton is fighting for her daughter to be allowed into reception class at school a year later after she decided to delay her education because she only turned four a few weeks before school started
battle : dutton , 30 , is demanding her daughter olivia is allowed into reception class after she chose to exercise her right to hold her back a year because she would have started just after turning four department for education guidance allows parents to delay their child 's schooling until the september after their fifth birthday
' there are no statutory barriers to admitting a child of five to a reception class '
but some campaigners say years of unclear and conflicting government advice on the policy has allowed schools and councils to use a loophole to push these children into year 1 to ease pressure on places in reception
bracknell forest council says : â if you choose for your child not to start until their statutory school age ... starting in a reception class following a child âs fifth birthday is only possible in exceptional circumstances
now she is fighting to allow olivia to start in the reception class , and will hear if she has been successful in april
mr nick gibb told mps that there had to be ' flexibility ' from schools and councils when agreeing the start date for children who turn four just weeks before the start of the school year
