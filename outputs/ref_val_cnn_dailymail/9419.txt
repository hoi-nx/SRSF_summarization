both players have been charged with spitting by the fa accepted the charge and will serve a seven - match ban , while evans has until 6pm on friday to respond
evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored newcastle striker evans 's former man united team - mate scholes has defended the player scholes also defended evans will working as a pundit on the match for bt sport on wednesday having leapt to the defence of evans while working as a pundit during bt sport 's coverage of the match , scholes has again backed the northern ireland defender
scholes writes in his independent column : ' i have watched the footage of evans and cisse 's spitting incident and i come to the same conclusion that was my instinct the first time i saw the replay : i do n't think evans ever intended to spit at fa
but my instinct is that evans is spitting to the floor
on this occasion , i believes it was a reflex action from evans
cisse subsequently retaliates , and appears to aim spit of his own back at the man united man evans ( left ) and cisse clash near the half - way line at st james ' park following the unpleasant exchange everton ( a ) , march 15 arsenal ( h ) , march 21 sunderland ( a ) , april 5 liverpool ( a ) , april 13 spurs ( h ) , april 19 swansea ( h ) , april 25 leicester ( a ) , may 2 both cisse and evans released statements on thursday in which they disagreed on the intent behind the disgusting scenes
cisse responded by apologising but said he was provoked when evans spat at him
and cisse will inform fa disciplinary chiefs that evans intentionally spat at him when questioned about the incident
cisse has been banned for seven games after accepting the charge from the fa on thursday this season , fa guidelines dictate that the punishment for spitting should be in line with fifa 's six game ban for the offence
having conceded he was wrong to react by spitting in evans âs face , cisse will be fined a week âs wages of around Â£ 40,000 by newcastle , who will now be without their 11 - goal top scorer until may
however , cisse has already served a three - match ban for violent conduct this season after elbowing everton âs seamus coleman and as a result will be hit with an additional one - game suspension
evans , meanwhile , could miss crucial premier league fixtures against spurs , liverpool , manchester city and chelsea should he be found guilty
but the 27 - year - old will contest the charge , to which he must respond by 6pm on friday evening
the senegalese striker points the finger at man united defender evans after the ugly incident newcastle managing director lee charnley said : ' both ourselves and cisse agree that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable
' evans âs statement read : â having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night âs match
â i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor
â during the game cisse and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting
â tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from newcastle and man united gather on the pitch cisse was banned for an extra man after beinf sent off for elbowing everton 's seamus coleman in december the fa were waiting for referee anthony taylor 's report
