most children can be prone to temper tantrums if they do n't get their own way but sapphire bubb , nine , has become so aggressive , even her own mother is terrified of her
single mother , pauline , 47 , from southampton , says her daughter 's behaviour can be so unpredictable she dreads outings and special occasions like birthday parties , and she feels like a victim of domestic abuse because of the daily barrage of abuse she gets at home
very few people have seen her that way as it 's behind doors , ' pauline told channel 5 show my violent child
pauline bubb , pictured on channel 5 show my violent child , has suffered physical abuse from both her son and daughter and wonders if her parenting skills are to blame spencer , now 11 , pictured as a young boy with twin sisters sapphire and jorja , now nine
spencer could be aggressive at this age as it was before he was diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder and adhd ' she can be a complete jekyll and hyde - one minute she 's a loving child and the next she can turn , biting , pulling hair , trying to pull my earrings out , punching , kicking , trying to break things
' the channel 5 show goes into their home to reveal how sapphire can be aggressive - both physically and verbally - over the smallest of things if she does n't get her own way
during one outburst , she is seen shouting at her mother : ' it 's not f * * * ing working , do n't f * * * ing talk to me ' over a toy and when her mild - mannered twin sister , jorja , tells her to ' stop being silly ' she retorts : ' shut up you b * * * * ! ' pauline is at the end of her tether as after spencer was diagnosed , sapphire then started acting violently
' i do n't understand why i get angry , i hurt people and i kick them , ' sapphire said
as previously reported by mailonline , pauline found raising her son , spencer , now 11 , a real challenge as he was prone to regular violent outbursts and he once stabbed her with some scissors
at the age of five , he was diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder and adhd ( adhd ) and put on anti-psychotic medication
' before the diagnosis he could be really violent , he stabbed me with scissors , he tried to strangle me , he could be violent punching , kicking and swearing , ' pauline recalled
sapphire hugs her mother after regretting biting her in the face during one violent outburst filmed by the channel 5 documentary spencer has calmed down thanks to his diagnosis but pauline now faces another violent battleground with sapphire
after the problems she experienced with spencer when he was younger and now sapphire , pauline said : ' it feels like i am in domestic violence with my kids
the single mother - of - three often retreats to her room to hide from her aggressive children islay , a parenting practitioner who helped pauline when she struggled with spencer , returns to help the family again now sapphire is causing problems
she said pauline needs to establish a routine , set more ground rules and be more assertive
islay said : ' sapphire has learnt a pattern of behaviour that if she wants attention , this ( being violent and aggressive ) is the way to get it
a weekend away with her twin girls proves a revelation as pauline finally starts being the boss the activities all work towards pauline reestablishing control instead of letting sapphire take charge
