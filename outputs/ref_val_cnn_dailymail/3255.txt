if you find your hour in the gym leaves you exhausted , spare a thought for four determined british women about to embark on an epic adventure that will test them to their limits
the women are attempting to be the first female 4 's team to row unsupported across the pacific from america to australia
throughout the 8,446 - mile journey , the women will have to spend two hours on the oars and two hours off for six months solid
' the main muscle groups we train by doing dead lifts , bench press , leg press , seated row , single arm row and core strengthening , ' explains natalia the women are attempting to be the first female 4 's team to row unsupported across the pacific from america to australia , which will involve spending two hours on the oars and two hours off for six months apart from issues like sleep deprivation , adverse weather conditions , injury , salt sores , sun exposure and potential equipment malfunction , the coxless crew also need to train themselves to deal with psychological challenges of monotony , confined living quarters and limited contact with the outside world
that 's on top of the fitness and strength training needed to take on the momentous rowing feat. yet , the formidable foursome set to embark on this exceptional journey - in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called doris - describe themselves as ' ordinary '
taking on the challenge of a lifetime : isabel burnham , laura penhaul , emma mitchell and natalia cohen will row the pacific in a 29ft long and 7ft wide pink boat called doris laura said : ' we say that this row is 85 per cent psychological in how we cope and 15 per cent physical , but our psychological state will be affected by being dehydrated , calorie deficient , sleep deprived and hormone imbalanced
i believe that we all have our own pacific to cross , in whatever form that comes
' so how are the brave four ensuring they are in peak mental and physical health ? we look at their intense preparation for the dangerous journey of a lifetime

they need to increase their body weight by ten to 15 per cent in lean muscle and fat for reserve energy stores
the cabin where the team will spend most of their time is the size of a small - to - medium two - man tent ' it 's not quite as fun as it sounds , ' she added
' the weight has to go on in a controlled way , alongside a tailor - made exercise and weight training regime
' we need lots of protein shakes along with high volumes of red meat , chicken , fish , eggs and nuts , while still maintaining balance with fruit and vegetables - not to mention the massive intakes of carbohydrates required to power us through the physical work
saying goodbye to sleep during the row the women will enter a polyphasic sleep pattern by taking short frequent naps as opposed to the normal monophasic pattern , which is a seven or eight hour block
' we 've done a 48 - hour row where we practiced the two - hour on and two - hour off sleep pattern we will be rowing out on the ocean , ' says natalia
' as long as we can manage to get one full sleep cycle ( on average between 45 to 90 minutes ) into each shift , we believe the body will have enough time to rest , repair and allow hormonal release as necessary
' and are they testing their exhaustion limits by limiting sleep before the big adventure ? ' there 's no point , ' natalia said
' the coxless crew ( left to right ) : isabel burnham , 30 , emma mitchell , 29 , laura penhaul , 31 and natalia cohen , 40 all have day jobs and describe themselves as ' ordinary ' dealing with stress ' it âs all about recognising what stress feels like for each of us , ' natalia explained
' what happens to our bodies on a physical and emotional level and how do we behave ? ' we will each react differently and while some may be more open , for some of the team we have had to learn how to read each other âs body language to know how they are feeling if they are not vocal about it
natalia cohen , one of the coxless four team at gsk 's human performance lab , where the team simulated part of their expedition to assess how many litres is optimal for each of them to drink the coxless four team rowers , isabel burnham ( far left ) and emma mitchell ( second left ) with team - mates natalia cohen and laura penhaul ( top and bottom on rowing machines ) staying positive ' our minds are the most powerful tool we have to tap into and again and we will need to draw upon our coping strategies and techniques to keep us upbeat and in the moment , ' says natalia
' when we start rowing , we will need to take it stroke by stroke , ' she says of getting back on the oars after a two - hour sleep
