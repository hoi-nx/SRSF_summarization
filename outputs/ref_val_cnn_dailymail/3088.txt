irish 's prime minister has reacted angrily to a st patrick 's day video message from prime minister abbott who he accused of promoting a ' stage irish perception ' of the country
mr abbott came in for criticism last week for the video message where he awkwardly described st patrick 's day as the one day of the year when ' it 's good to be green '
the irish prime minister , known in gaelic as the taoiseach , said he had heard mr abbott 's comments and was n't happy with them
' i 've heard the prime minister 's comments
' mr abbott apologised that ' i ca n't be there to share a guinness or two or maybe even three ' ' i would have hoped for a more business - focussed message in a video that was designed for business functions , ' an irish businessman told the irish times is this what i think it is ? defence minister kevin andrews gets ready to celebrate st patrick 's day the sydney morning herald reported that defence minister kevin andrews also drew a link between st patrick 's day and alcohol consumption , tweeting a picture of himself holding a can of guinness
foreign minister bishop was asked about mr enda kenny 's comments and whether australia had received a complaint from the irish ambassador on the video message
' last week mr abbott came under fire from irish leaders who dubbed his st patrick 's day video message ' patrionising '
mr abbott said st patrick 's day is a ' great day for the irish ... and anyone else who wants to come to a party ' , and that it is the ' one day of the year when it 's good to be green , ' in the video posted to the liberal 's youtube page
the video was supplied to both the irish australian chamber of commerce and the lansdowne club to be played during st patrick 's day celebrations , but reportedly neither party will show it ' there are so many good stories of irish people in business in australia , mr abbott 's lack of awareness of any of that is astonishing
