a spokesperson for clinton has said that the former secretary of state completely complied with the requirement but gop have continued to question the veracity of that statement
a house tasked with investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in libya issued a new round of subpoenas last week for messages sent through clinton 's personal account , which was recently revealed to be the only email address she used while at the state department , mixing business correspondence with pleasure , all at a domain outside the immediate scope of the government
the controversy has bled into a separate review of the clinton foundation 's fundraising practices during hillary 's tenure in barack obama 's administration after the washington post discovered that her family 's charity accepted money from foreign governments that were also lobbying the state department
the email saga was a topic of discussion on multiple agenda - setting talk shows on sunday morning , and the clinton foundation 's fundraising again grabbed headlines
' the emails are a related but secondary scandal , ' a so - called clinton ' loyalist ' told the national journal

in a dueling appearance on cnn with democratic congressman schiff of california , gop congressman darrell issa , also of california , said on the network 's state of the union program that ' voluntary cooperation ' with a house 's investigation into the benghazi attack ' does not guarantee that it 's a crime not to deliver all
' ' a subpoena which trey gowdy issued is so that in fact it will be a crime if she knowingly withholds documents pursuant to subpoena , ' darrell issa , a recent chairman of the house oversight committee said
' south carolina congressman trey gowdy called into question on sunday a photo of clinton on her phone that inspired the texts from hillary meme

several house committees have already looked into the assault extensively , but as darrell issa articulated sunday , gop lawmakers believe investigators were not provided with all of clinton 's benghazi associated emails and an additional review of her actions is warranted
' and we may never get many of them because we do n't know what we do n't know when it 's on a server where a click of the button can delete records forever , ' he said , referring to reports that clinton housed her email on a home - brewed server that only she and aides had access to
' ' that 's what happened this week , ' he said of committee head trey gowdy 's response to the clinton email brouhaha
' trey gowdy said on cbs ' face the nation that ' there are gaps of months and months and months ' between the email records that the house was provided trey gowdy said sunday morning on another program , cbs ' face the nation , that ' there are gaps of months and months and months ' between the email records that the house was provided , however

a former colleague of clinton 's in the senate , california democrat dianne feinstein , implored the former new york lawmaker on sunday to make additional public remarks on the email drama
' from this point on , the silence is going to hurt her , ' dianne feinstein said on nbc 's meet the press
