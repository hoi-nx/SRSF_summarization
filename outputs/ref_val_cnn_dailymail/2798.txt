but the dance party for eliza , 5 , was arranged by her dad , glenn , 42 , at their south carolina home because she has the aav9 virus and the family are under a self - imposed quarantine
the five - year - old suffers from a rare and ultimately fatal genetic condition called sanfilippo syndrome and has to avoid interacting with people 's germs or it could kill her
her family have put themselves under a voluntary quarantine for the past nine months in a bid to avoid interacting with other people
the family get their groceries delivered and on the rare occasion they do have to interact with people , they wear masks and gloves
since eliza was diagnosed with the illness in july 2013 , the family have raised $ 2.2 million with a gofundme page and other traditional fundraising efforts in the hope to help her survive
her father glenn told people : ' we heard that there was a clinical trial that might cure eliza of this disease
and even when the medicine is ready , they do n't know if eliza will be picked for the trial
' not only for eliza , but other children with sanfilippo syndrome
' support : cara , right , dances with her husband , glenn as their daughter eliza , left , reads a book quarantine : little eliza 's daddy / daughter dance came after she missed a frozen - themed dance at her school isolated : her mom , cara , left , quit her job as a pediatrician while dad glenn works remotely as a consultant at symantec little eliza 's daddy / daughter dance came after she missed a frozen - themed dance at her school
it took a lot of planning because the family needed to make sure that eliza did not catch any incoming diseases
the family are choosing to stay under quarantine because other parents who have children with sanfilippo syndrome warn that if children get sick it could accelerate their sanfilippo syndrome symptoms
