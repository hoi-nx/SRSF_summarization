indiana is set to declare a public health emergency to county an alarming increase in the rate of hiv infections
governor pence said wednesday he 's mulling a needle exchange and other programs aimed at curbing the rise in infection rates that has been tied to intravenous drug use in southern indiana
hiv cases have ballooned in the state recently , with 72 cases confirmed and 7 others that preliminary tests say are positive , all coming out of scott county
a centers for disease control and prevention report in 2005 on syringe exchange programs found those types of interventions were cost - effective ways of preventing blood - borne infections like hiv
' the cost [ of preventing one ] hiv infection by seps has been calculated at $ 4,000 to $ 12,000 , considerably less than the estimated $ 190,000 medical costs of treating a person infected with hiv , ' the report stated , with dollars calculated in their 1997 values
needle - exchange programs allow intravenous drug users to bring in used needles in exchange for clean syringes , which is believed to suppress transmission of diseases such as hiv and hepatitis
dr cooke , who runs a clinic in austin , says his town has borne the brunt of growing intravenous drug use , seeing hepatitis-c cases be replaced by bigger issues
' we 've identified that most of our iv drug users are hepatitis-c positive
in the last month , indiana has gone from 26 confirmed hiv cases , when officials first announced the outbreak , to 72 now
intravenous drug led to infection in almost all cases , according to state epidemiologist pontones
still , the number of hiv cases is estimated to rise in the coming weeks
' with the amount of drug use that 's happening and the intravenous needle - sharing that 's going on , if someone who 's highly infectious becomes part of that sharing network , that infection can transmit very rapidly , ' pontones said
she said the vast majority of the people who 've become infected during the outbreak shared a syringe with someone else while injecting a liquid form of the prescription painkiller opana
