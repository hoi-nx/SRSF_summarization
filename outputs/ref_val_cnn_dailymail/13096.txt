lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state , gov. herbert said in a statement
a firing squad would only be used in the event the necessary drugs can not be obtained
" we regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued
