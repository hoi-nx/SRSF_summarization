former american presidents cost taxpayers more than $ 879,000 per year in pensions , personnel , benefits , travel and office expenses , and bill clinton 's cumulative near - $ 16 million total is bringing him new scrutiny as his wife makes the case for a white house run of her own
daily mail online reported bill clinton 's take in 2014 , amounting to slightly less than $ 1.14 million per year , based on a paper from the nonpartisan congressional research service ( congressional research service )
that amount is still less than george w. bush 's $ 1.18 million annual haul
but since bill clinton has had an eight - year head start , his overall benefits are the highest by far , totalling $ 15,938,000 since he left the white house in january 2001
the foundation also insisted the bill clinton 's personal funds , not taxpayer dollars , paid for the now - infamous private email server that his wife hillary used exclusively while secretary of state
mrs. hillary said tuesday during a contentious press conference in new york city that the former president set up the server for his own staff 's use , and she began using it later
while bill clinton has received more post-white white house cash overall than any other living former president , george w. bush âs annual numbers are the highest the clinton foundation is now hillary 's principal political messenger in the public sphere
sources also told politico that staffers whose compensation straddles bill clinton 's foundation purse and his government benefits include former white house aide doug band and senior clinton foundation staffer laura graham
the paper also speculated that flournoy , a former union official who is now bill clinton 's chief of staff and advised hillary 's 2008 campaign , has followed suit
today the law provides payments to bill clinton , george w. bush , his father george w. bush , and jimmy carter
which way to the gravy train ? barack obama is set to reap an annual windfall beginning in 2017 that will dwarf his current $ 400,000 salary former american presidents receive millions of dollars over the course of their post-office years , including living examples bill clinton , jimmy carter , george w. bush and his father george h.w. bush the clintons ' burgeoning personal wealth , including a mammoth $ 15 million advance for hillary 's memoir ' hard choices ' and a string of six - figure speaking fees for her and bill , have raised questions about whether 21st - century former presidents still need to be on the government dole
the legislation , which never received a positive committee vote , would have capped the government 's total annual spending on former presidents to $ 400,000 each
