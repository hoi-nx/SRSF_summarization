george osborne announced fuel duty had been frozen for the fifth year in a row fuel duty has been frozen for a fifth year in succession , allowing the chancellor to boast that motorists have had â Â£ 10 off a tank with the tories â
yesterday âs move means a 0.54p - per - litre duty rise planned for september 1 will not go ahead
and the freezing of duty over the five years of the coalition means the average driver spends Â£ 10 less per fill - up than if the controversial â fuel - price escalator â had been implemented in full
between 2011 and 2016 , a typical motorist will have saved Â£ 675 , the treasury calculated
the planned fuel duty rise by the rpi rate of inflation on september 2015 would have increased the current duty rate by 0.54p per litre â from the current 57.95p to 58.49p
for an average family car fill - up of 55 litres , this would have increased the cost by 30p
mr george osborne said he had cancelled the fuel duty rise because â i want to help families with the cost of filling up a car â
it saves a family around Â£ 10 every time they fill up their car
the rac foundation said the above - inflation fuel duty â escalator â that operated between 1993 and 1999 â is the primary reason that we now pay nearly 70 per cent in tax on every litre of fuel we buy at the pumps â
aa president edmund king said : â the coalition has done its â fuel duty â by shielding drivers from some of the impact of volatile fuel prices over the past four years by freezing fuel duty , and we welcome the further freeze and cancellation of the scheduled fuel duty rise for september 2015
â with petrol and diesel prices surging and falling by more than 35p a litre since 2010 , the continued four - year fuel duty freeze allows the coalition to dodge the fuel - protest bullet
the move means a 0.54p - per - litre duty rise planned for september 1 will not go ahead , which for an average family car fill - up of 55 litres , would have increased the cost by 30p he added : â we give mr george osborne six out of ten for endeavour and will continue to campaign that duty should be frozen for the lifetime of the next parliament
â rac foundation director professor stephen glaister said : â with fuel duty revenue making up about 5 per cent of the treasury âs tax income there was never going to be a huge giveaway as the chancellor still desperately needs motorists â money

yesterday george osborne delayed an increase in fuel duty once again â meaning drivers are nearly Â£ 10 better off every time they fill up their car than they would have been had labour âs â fuel - price escalator â still been operating
the rate for environmentally - friendly vehicles will also rise â but at a â slower rate â
george osborne told mps : â to encourage a new generation of low - emission vehicles we will increase their company car tax more slowly than previously planned
â many employees with company cars will be locked into long term deals and will have no choice but to bear the ever - increasing cost of company car tax
â â having previously introduced an annual two - percentage - point increase in the rate of company car benefit in kind to 2018/19 , today george osborne announced a further annual hike of three percentage points from 2019/20
â the changes mean a driver paying the 40p tax rate with a Â£ 28,000 1.6 - litre nissan qashqai provided by their employer will be Â£ 1,008 worse off after five years , with a â benefit in kind â tax bill of Â£ 3,360
an executive with a Â£ 38,000 bmw 5 series will pay Â£ 1,368 more , taking their annual bill to Â£ 4,712 , while anyone with an Â£ 81,000 three - litre range rover sport as their company car will be nearly Â£ 2,600 worse off , with an annual bill of Â£ 11,998
