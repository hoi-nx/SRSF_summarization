a science graduate from china 's elite tsinghua university , he had been taught to mistrust superstition and religion , but in the culture and devotion of the buddhists he met he found something worth knowing
while buddhism has a long history in china , entering via missionaries from india during the han dynasty , it was repressed during the maoist era -- many monasteries and temples were destroyed during the cultural revolution and monks actively punished for believing in " superstition
" but now , a growing number of china are rediscovering the country 's dormant buddhist traditions
however , it 's not always easy to combine buddhist beliefs with the demands of modern life
yang , the director of the center on religion and chinese society at purdue university , indiana , says it 's difficult to explain exactly why so many young people are turning to buddhism
some discover it at university , where buddhist groups are active and famous monks and lamas give lectures
he also says that the chinese communist party policy has " moved toward treating buddhism more favorably than other religions
in particular , it 's the tibetan strain of buddhism , rather than the zen ( also called zen ) tradition once popular in china , that is attracting new converts , particularly students , young professionals and businesspeople , he says
" it appears that both the chanting and the physical , spiritual practices of buddhism are appealing to some people , " yang added
to what extent these new converts are committed to buddhism as a religion , with its strictures and rituals , is an open question
a former leader of a university buddhism group , who did n't want to give his name , told cnn he thought its members were more interested in the religion as a lifestyle choice
activities that his group organized focusing on relaxation and stress relief were always more popular than reading groups and lectures that examined buddhist scriptures , he added
yang at purdue university says that for most people in china , buddhism is treated more as culture than a religion
growing up , her family had raised her buddhist although she says she never really " felt it
geng says buddhism has given her a fresh outlook on life and past difficulties
( buddhism ) keeps me away from the negative thoughts , like a reminder that 's always there , which has helped me a lot
