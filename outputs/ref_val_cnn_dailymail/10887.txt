' with the new museum opening in 2016 and the country marking the centenary of the first world war , there 's a renewed interest in heath robinson 's work and we felt that it was important to keep this collection together for the nation to rediscover and enjoy
' following heath robinson 's death in 1944 , his collection was split in two , with the larger part stored in the national magazine company warehouse until the 1970s when it was bought by family friend mr simon heneage , publisher and founder of the cartoon museum
although many pieces were sold or donated by mr simon heneage , he kept the best of the collection for display in his private gallery and they will now be reunited with the other part of the artist 's collection which is in the hands of the william heath robinson trust .
