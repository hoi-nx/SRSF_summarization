the family of michael brown , the teen killed last year by ferguson police officer darren wilson , will file a civil wrongful death lawsuit in the case " very shortly , " attorney gray said thursday
neither he nor attorney parks would say exactly when the suit would be filed , but they said that they disagreed with the grand jury 's and the justice department 's decisions not to charge darren wilson in the shooting
word of the lawsuit comes a day after the justice department determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge darren wilson in michael brown 's death but found in a separate investigation that the ferguson police department showed a pattern of racial bias
" in november , a grand jury cleared darren wilson and , in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings , the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered
gray said the civil lawsuit will rely on " pretty much the same evidence , " but it will be cast differently
the jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence , rather than beyond a reasonable doubt , parks said
