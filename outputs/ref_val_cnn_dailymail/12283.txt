if it were easy , any company or government could do it
but flying an ebola patient halfway around the world -- while keeping that person alive , and everyone safe -- is complicated
probably no one knows that better than phoenix air , a georgia - based company that is the go - to for transporting ebola victims by air
he described the system that goes inside the company 's modified gulfstream g-iii aircraft
the aircraft then flies to a high - security hanger in cartersville , georgia , where it undergoes a complete decontamination process , which can take up to 24 hours
phoenix air began developing its system way before the current ebola outbreak
it worked with the department of defense and the centers for disease control and prevention to build a system that could safety transport patients with contagious diseases
then , the main concerns were sars , swine and bird flu
by august , the company had completed its first ebola flight , safely delivering dr. kent brantly to emory university hospital in atlanta
more than 10,000 people have died in the ebola outbreak , mostly in the countries of guinea , liberia and sierra leone .
