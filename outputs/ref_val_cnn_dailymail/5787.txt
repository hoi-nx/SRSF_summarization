he is passionate about conservation and was in china 's yunnan province to highlight the plight of the region 's wild elephants and to call for an end to the ivory trade
but as prince william was feeding treats to rescue elephant ran ran , just a few miles away , other animals were living in conditions that campaigners describe as ' dingy ' and with their legs encased in chains
later , he did speak about the plight of china 's elephants , although he once again steered clear of discussing the circus , which is on the same site as the sanctuary he was visiting
performance : the elephants were filmed being made to perform circus tricks for crowds of tourists chained : campaigners say the elephants live in dingy pens between performances there , say campaigners , the wretched performing elephants , many of which have had their tusks filed down , are trained to give rides and kick footballs around an arena
between their â performances â they are chained by their legs in dingy pens
kensington palace , however , said that while it was aware of the issues , the focus of the visit was for prince william to learn more about the region âs conservation efforts and engage with the positive work being done
' dressed up : the animals are also made to wear bizarre versions of human clothing such as glasses exposed : the performance was filmed by a camera crew from sky news aware : kensington palace said they knew of the circus before the visit took place the prince , who began the day at the xishuangbanna natural nature reserve , had been hopeful of seeing some of the animals in their natural habit - the last tropical rainforest in china which hosts some 250 wild asian elephants - 90 per cent of its wild elephant population
sadly for william , there were none to be seen , although it was a different story when he arrived at the sanctuary to meet ran ran
the visit was designed to highlight the prince 's conservation work - and raise awareness of the need to end the illegal trade in ivory
a royal source has said that during william 's talks with china 's president xi jinping earlier this week wildlife protection and the illegal trade in ivory were raised and that he was pleased by china leader âs pledges to clamp down on the industry
criticism : his visit was overshadowed by controversy about a nearby elephant circus saved : ran ran was discovered in a river in 2005 with terrible injuries caused by a poacher 's trap performing : according to campaigners , other elephants nearby live in chains and are made to perform tricks in a speech before he flew back to britain , william described the greatest threat to elephants worldwide today as the â ruthless and organised poaching and trafficking â industry
' aware : kensington palace said they were aware of the proximity of the circus before the trip not talking : the prince did not take questions on the circus but later emphasised the need for conservation ivory : china 's elephants have been decimated by the ivory trade - something william hopes to change getting the locals on side : he also met local villagers , who sometimes come into conflict with elephants
