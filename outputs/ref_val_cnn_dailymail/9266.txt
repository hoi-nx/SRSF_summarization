' the arizona woman known anonymously as juror 17 says she sought to be as objective as possible in deciding arias ' fate and concluded ' because of her genetic makeup , she did n't have the capability of coping with her tumultuous relationship ' with travis alexander

' speaking out : the juror who single - handedly saved the life of travis alexander this month is speaking out in her own defense after receiving continued threats and ridicule mentally ill ? juror 17 17 has revealed she based her decision to save travis alexander 's life on what she perceived to be the killer 's lapses in mental clarity and her emotional instability in this case , juror 17 said the punishment was not warranted because arias was not emotionally sound -- despite the ruthless way she slashed alexander 's throat so deeply he was nearly beheaded
' she was n't insane , but there were months spent on showing her mental deterioration , ' juror 17 said of the arias defense
' juror 17 's decision has won her a barrage of social media lashings , ridicule and even death threats , she revealed yesterday

she will live : the latest arias trial became the second to end in a jury deadlock
this one means the killer may not be handed the death penalty juror 17 17 also addressed her past encounters with arias prosecutor juan martinez , facts that would not be revealed until after the march 5 deadlock announcement
however , her detractors point to her previous connection to juan martinez as proof juror 17 wanted to be in the arias trial and wanted juan martinez to lose
however , her critics accuse the 33 - year - old of having it out for prosecutor juan martinez ( center ) for his having put her then - husband away for robbery 15 years ago meanwhile , it was revealed march 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout 's objectivity because she had previously watched a lifetime movie about the arias case , and prosecutors were upset at the juror 's social media activity as she went on facebook and liked several local tv stations and nancy grace of the hln network
the juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend travis alexander nearly seven years ago
the holdout 's identity was leaked through a twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about alexander , while a pro-arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence arias to death for the 2008 killing
outrage : social media critics have lashed out at juror 17 with claims she was a ' stealth juror ' out to save arias , that she had it in for the prosecutor and with threats to her and her family reaction : tanisha sorenson , sister of travis alexander , sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the travis alexander sentencing phase retrial ' not recognizing juan martinez is like saying you do n't recognize mickey at disney , ' tweeted @ kristyannasmom
dwane cates , a criminal defense attorney in phoenix who is n't involved in the arias case , said the leaks wo n't change the outcome of the case , noting that mistrial decisions ca n't be appealed
arias was convicted of murder in alexander 's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated
her fellow jurors would later use this to try to get her removed from the jury a mistrial was declared after five days of deliberations , removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for arias
most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty
stephens said the holdout had disclosed , before being picked as a juror , that she had seen the lifetime movie about the arias case , but never watched it all the way through
