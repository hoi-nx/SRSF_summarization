bigger is better when it comes to selling bras because according to new market research , women are more likely to buy lingerie if it 's modeled by a plus - size woman over a thin blonde
adore me , a rapidly growing lingerie start - up based in new york , has revealed that its television ad featuring a plus size model quadrupled online sales when compared to the brand 's commercial starring a group of blondes
when adore me debuted its first national television campaign last january , the company used the testing method for its three different commercials , which aired on channels such as bravo , lifetime and mtv
one television ad featured a cast of all blonde models , another showcased all brunette models and the third starred one plus - size brunette
after the company monitored online traffic and sales throughout the month , they came to the - perhaps surprising conclusion - that the 30 - second commercial featuring the dark - haired plus - size model generated four times as many sales than the one featuring the blondes
adore me did n't do any digital retouching to the ad featuring multiple brunette models - and that commercial was the one that was favorited by consumers
