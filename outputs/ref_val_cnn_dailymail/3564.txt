this mother of five has never been in labour for more than two hours - and she remarkably manages to beat her delivery record every time she gives birth
mary , who has never been given much warning before she goes into labour , has continued her stretch of speedy deliveries giving birth to her latest child in just two minutes
even though the 35 - year - old from sydney has earned herself a reputation of rapid - fire births , nothing could have prepared her for the latest delivery on january 30
mary , 35 , was given just two minutes warning before she gave birth to her son brody on the floor of her sydney bedroom on january 30 rapid fire births : mary and simon gorgens have had five children ( ava , mila , brody , max and sienna ) and all births have been quicker than the last ms mary went to the toilet in the early hours of the morning after feeling a slight twinge but had to quickly ' waddle ' back to the bedroom when she felt her son 's head starting to come out
she woke her husband simon who stumbled to the bathroom thinking he had some time
he was two days early , i really was n't expecting it that day , ' ms mary told daily mail australia
when she gave birth to their first child max in december 2008 , ms mary made it to the hospital with just 12 minutes to spare
it took just two hours from the time mary felt the first twinge and they made it to the hospital with just 12 minutes to spare it took 90 minutes for baby ava to arrive in august 2010 when she was born on the way to the hospital
she was still in her amniotic sack and the midwife found her inside her mother 's pants ' i was n't even sure i was in labour
i called my husband and then the pain came really quickly
' it took two hours for max to be born from the time ms mary felt the first twinge
' i have n't had any pain relief in any birth because there has n't been enough time
' the couple 's second child ava was born in 90 minutes in august 2010
mary was 50 minutes into labour when ava arrived mary and simon did n't even make it to the car when mila was born in march 2013
the couple were given 10 minutes warning before the baby popped out on the bedroom floor mary went to the toilet after feeling a slight twinge but had to quickly ' waddle ' back to the bedroom when she felt her son 's head starting to come out
her son brody was born just two minutes later in her bedroom ' my hubby got home again and i already felt like i needed to push
' the midwife who met them at the hospital pulled ms mary ' pants down in the car and she found baby ava
' she was perfectly okay - simon cut the cord when we were still in the car
' when it came to sienna 's birth in december 2011 , the couple attempted the hospital dash again
' simon managed to stop on the median strip , he ran to my side and her head was already coming out , ' ms mary said
' mary has n't had pain relief in any of her five births because there has n't been enough time simon has delivered the three youngest children because they could n't make it to the hospital in time mila , ava , brody , max and sienna ( l-r ) were all born healthy despite only the eldest being born in the hospital but the couple 's fourth child was considerably quicker and they did n't even made it to the car
' mila was born on our bedroom floor in 10 minutes , ' ms mary said
' mary has never been given much warning when she goes into labour but even she could n't be prepared for brody 's rapid - fire birth in january the couple are n't looking to have more children right now and they do n't think they could beat the record ms mary has n't had pain relief in any of her five births because there has n't been enough time
