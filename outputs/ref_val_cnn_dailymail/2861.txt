across the globe there are millions of ' letters ' and ' numbers ' hiding among buildings and in the landscape of the earth
the shapes can be spotted in satellite images and include buildings shaped like the letter ' a ' , trees planted in the shape of an ' e ' and circular marks in the landscape that resemble ' os ' or zeros
a pair of designers has created a tool to help seek out these natural and manmade shapes and is hoping to use the findings to develop software as well as a new font
the aerial bold project was set up by german designer benedikt groã and geographer joey lee
their tool lets people scour mapbox images to find letters , numbers and characters in the landscape ( pictured ) the project began as a kickstarter campaign , set up by german designer and computer scientist benedikt groã and californian geographer joey lee
they raised $ 11,492 ( Â£ 7,630 ) and have since set up the aerial bold crowdsourcing tool
â aerial bold is as much about developing new methods of mapping features on the earth âs surface , as it is about generating the first map and typeface of the planet
german researchers recently developed a computer system that can scan google earth satellite images looking for faces
human eyes can spot faces , letters and numbers easily and this helps them recognise friends and see patterns
â in order to develop the smartest and robust letterform detection and classification algorithm , we need to find dozens of real world " training data " for each letter , number , or character that we are interested in including in aerial bold
â once trained , this algorithm could be used to automatically find words and letters on images
one example could be to find business addresses using visual search - such as all shops on a street view map where people can buy lottery tickets
the tool lets people scan through mapbox satellite images and catalogue all the letters , numbers and characters they find
the software will suggest letters , numbers or characters in each rectangle and this will be displayed with a corresponding number
the software will suggest letters , numbers or characters in each rectangle and this will be displayed by a number
once update geometry is clicked , the letters are added to a database it is hoped this database will help researchers at the institute for artificial intelligence at hs weingarten to automate what the designers call â the planetary search for letterforms
â a selection of letters that have been found using the tool are pictured with their respective locations and co-ordinates once a grid has been explored the â submit task â button in the bottom left - hand corner becomes active and the user is taken to another location
people can search for letters either anonymously or by adding a credit name to the discoveries
the top â hunter â is currently marco berends with 365 , and more than 500 letters , numbers and characters in total have been spotted
