brown believes rfu chief executive ritchie was ' spot on ' to describe england 's rbs 6 nations performance as unacceptable - but the red rose and harlequins full back still thinks stuart lancaster 's side are genuine world cup contenders
england were only narrowly pipped to the championship on points difference by ireland after a dramatic final day and have had praise lavished on them from all quarters for their attacking brand of rugby , which saw them score 18 tries in five matches
but for brown , like ritchie , second place is simply not good enough
brown is adamant that second place is not good enough despite england 's impressive performances the harlequins full back was in fine form for england throughout the rbs 6 nations ' we 're not in there to be second so he 's spot on really , ' he said
' brown has been forced to sit out harlequins ' trip to wembley to face saracens in the aviva on saturday with concussion
with no game next week though , brown is hoping an extended break and a holiday in the sun will have him fit and raring to go for the season finale
brown said : ' it 's disappointing but first and foremost it 's about my health and with a big year coming up that 's the most important thing for me and england
' i was off next week anyway , the england guys have a week off and there is n't a game so that was always the plan
' brown lies motionless after being knocked out against italy
he was taken off and missed the ireland game with just six months to go until the world cup it is a nervous time for any england hopeful but , typical of the man , brown is adamant the only way to approach the next two months of club rugby is to go hell for leather
' it can be difficult because it 's always in your mind , such a big goal , ' brown said of balancing club and country ambitions
' with five matches to go , harlequins are down in eighth place in the table , nine points off an automatic champions cup spot and four off a play - off place
but with brown , england captain chris robshaw , club captain joe marler and veteran no 8 nick easter all back in their ranks from international duty for the final push , they have more than a fighting chance of salvaging it
brown trudges off the twickenham pitch after england were pipped to the championship by ireland attention switches to club rugby now for brown as harlequins look to finish in the top six brown says : ' we want to be playing at the top level of european rugby , we want to have those great nights at the stoop , so we 're desperate to try and get that top six spot and we know we can do it
