the premier league has never been richer , with the most recent combined annual income for the current 20 clubs soaring past Â£ 3billion for the first time
but a review of the books by the mail on sunday also shows club debts standing at more than Â£ 2.5 billion
chelsea âs parent company owes roman abramovich Â£ 958million , for example , and he is showing no sign of demanding it back any time soon
roman abramovich is owed an astonishing Â£ 958million by chelsea 's parent company west brom , on the other hand , are nearly debt - free after being sensibly run over a long period but a group of clubs including aston villa , hull , leicester , newcastle , qpr and west ham have each racked up debt of around Â£ 100m , much of which is owed to their owners
the â boom - and - bust culture â of unsustainable spending in an attempt to buy success underpins the phenomenon , according to the chief executive of one of the clubs most sensibly run over a long period , west brom
â the easiest thing to do when you reach the premier league is over-reach , â says west brom âs mark jenkins , whose club have just posted their latest set of profitable accounts and are close to being debt - free
manchester united have debts of Â£ 342m as a result of the leveraged takeover almost 10 years ago west brom played harry redknapp 's portsmouth in the 2008 fa cup - a team guilty of ' boom and bust ' â everyone puts you under enormous pressure to just chuck endless money at it , â he adds
â you can get sucked into a boom - and - bust culture
but it is another example , portsmouth , that most irks west brom , who lost to a â financially doped â portsmouth in the 2008 fa cup semi-finals
portsmouth were flying high and eventually won the fa cup , but are now mid-table in the fourth division west brom say they are still frustrated at losing to a team portsmouth ' basically could n't afford ' â it still pinches us at west brom that we lost our last fa cup semi-final to a team the opposition basically could nât afford , â said mark jenkins
