longer than a soccer pitch and filled to the brim with helium , at 302 feet long , the airlander will be the world 's biggest aircraft
part blimp , part plane , part helicopter , it was originally created by uk design company hav ( hav ) for military surveillance by the u.s. army
but budget cuts doomed the project and hav bought the airship back across the pond , where it seemed set to remain on solid ground until the company received a Â£ 3.4 million ( $ 5.1 million ) grant from the uk government
while an airship might seem like a craft from a time long passed , it has been given a 21st century design overhaul and hav hopes to have airships back in the skies over the uk by 2016
we solved all those problems with a new concept -- a hybrid aircraft
" the airlander 10 -- named because it can carry 10 tons -- is made of a bespoke fabric of carbon fiber , kevlar and mylar , while the pressure of the helium inside maintains the aircraft 's shape
diesel fuel helps the airlander take off and land and powers the propellers
meanwhile swedish firm oceansky , in conjunction with the government , wants to use the airlander as an air transport system for wind turbines
robinson , editor - in - chief of aerospace magazine , said : " the airlander does have one big benefit over uavs
" robinson also highlighted commercial possibilities for the airlander , such as long - range cargo airships and humanitarian missions
while helicopters can also land anywhere , they are limited in payload and range -- plus the airlander is much more efficient thanks to its hybrid ' lifting body ' design
he said there had been several " false dawns " in bringing about the return of the airship in previous years , including two military surveillance airship projects from the u.s. pentagon which were ultimately sidelined " because they were n't confident in the technology
" while robinson calls it " the most promising lighter - than - air vehicle project we have seen in a long time , " only successful first flight tests at the end of the year and further demos and trials will show off the airlander 10 's true capabilities
