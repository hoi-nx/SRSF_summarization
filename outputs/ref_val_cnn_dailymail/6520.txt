as more places legalise marijuana , scientists are warning of the potential health risks of eating cannabis - infused snacks
with smoking , the peak blood levels happen within 3 - 10 minutes , and with eating , it 's 1 - 3 hours , making it easier to overdose on food - related cannabis products
now experts are warning that legalised marijuana needs to have strong restrictions on the drug 's edible products , which are often packaged to appeal to children
' as legalisation of marijuana spreads , new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked , ' wrote maccoun and mello of stanford
marijuana use for adults over 21 is fully legal in colorado , washington and alaska
a notable feature of state - legalised retail sales of marijuana has been the popularity of edibles
the problem is that marijuana edibles â which often look like candy or cookies and are frequently potent â increase the chances that children will overdose , they say
' as legalisation of marijuana spreads , new adopters should ensure that their regulatory scheme for marijuana edibles is fully baked , ' the stanford experts warned professor maccoun explained that the original marijuana laws ' were not rigorous and detailed in their approach to issues like edibles , colorado and washington put extremely modest rules on edibles , therefore making it easy to sell and market edible products , he said
' both states require child - resistant packaging , a warning to ' keep out of the reach of children , ' and labelling describing a standard serving size , ' wrote maccoun and mello ' neither requires warnings that ingested marijuana can have different effects from smoked marijuana
' some of the edibles look like hershey or kitkat bars , and the drinks resemble the major brands of non-marijuana colas
but the scientific record is clear on the documented risk of edibles , especially for children
a recent study showed that the proportion of ingestion - related emergency department visits by children in colorado associated with marijuana ingestion increased after legal restrictions were eased
