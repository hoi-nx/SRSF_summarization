all he wanted to do was talk about how nice his hair was - but in doing so , jackie chan has created a word which has taken chinese by storm : duang
pronounced ' dwong ' , the actor was being filmed discussing a shampoo commercial he appeared in when he used the sound in a similar way to how westerners would present something special and exclaim : ' ta-da ! ' in the footage he says : ' i did n't want the commercial to have lots of special effects and my hair look " duang ! " - suddenly blacker and shinier
hair today , duang tomorrow : jackie chan is seen discussing how he did not want to use special effects to make his hair look duang although many people are using the word to mock the actor , who is seen as a pro-beijing political figure by many in chinese , jackie chan has been a good sport about it all
there is even a new - unofficial - chinese character for the sound , which has been made by overlaying the two characters of jackie chan 's name
