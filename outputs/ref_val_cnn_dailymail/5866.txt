a former jihadi who fought for isis in syria and iraq has revealed that he left the depraved terror group after being ordered to execute his friends and take part in the rape of yazidi sex slaves
the 33 - year - old ex-militant , who comes from the isis - held city of fallujah , spoke of becoming disillusioned with jihad after seeing his commanders turn into bloodthirsty , sex - mad savages
but for hamza , who recently managed to escape his isis commanders in iraq , the final straw was his shock at the terror group 's unquenchable thirst for brutal executions and his disgust at the militants ' treatment of young yazidi women who are bought , sold and viciously raped as sex slaves
militants : hamza revealed that islamic state terrorists brainwash fighters ( pictured ) into spending all their spare time reading the koran by offering cash prizes to those with the greatest religious knowledge horror : a young yazidi girl who narrowly avoided being captured by isis and forced in to sex slavery is pictured holding a baby
hamza said he was invited to rape several such young women by his commanders speaking of his time with the terror group , hamza told the independent 's patrick cockburn that he was paid 400,000 yazidi dinars a month ( equivalent to Â£ 231 ) - but was also rewarded with free food , fuel and access to the internet
recognising a number of the men as his former friends , hamza refused to carry out the atrocity
brutal : hamza said he was shocked at the terror group 's unquenchable thirst for executions an eight strong volunteer unit of former british servicemen are preparing to travel to syria to fight against militants from the islamic state terrorist organisation , it has been claimed
shortly after avoiding beheading his former friends , hamza realised his future life as an isis executioner was not something he wanted
those feelings were compounded when last december 13 kidnapped yazidi girls were brought to the property where he was staying and he was invited to rape them
using the instant messaging service viber , hamza contacted friends outside isis ' self - declared caliphate before being granted permission to call his family on a mobile as a reward for his perceived ' loyalty and courage '
