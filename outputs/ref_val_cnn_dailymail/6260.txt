according to some accounts , the wealth of the ancient roman empire was reflected in the very fabric of the city - with buildings of sparkling white marble at its centre
even the founder of the roman , augustus claimed that he had ' found rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble '
scroll down to explore ancient rome in 3d this reconstruction by historians at the university of california los angeles shows how rome would have looked under the rule of augustus and reveals that many of the buildings were made from brick ( shown in grey ) while only a few temples were constructed from marble ( pink ) using architectural computer modelling software they have been able to reconstruct the entire city to reveal how it would have looked during the rule of augustus between 44bc and 14ad
they found that in fact only a small proportion of the buildings in rome at the time were converted from brick into marble
indeed , the few buildings that were built from marble were hidden from view within the city landscape , meaning many historical discriptions of the city 's beauty were perhaps exaggerated
' dr favro used information from archaeological and historical records to produce the computer model that can show how the city evolved during augustus ' rule
buildings constructed from marble were shaded with pink while those that were made from brick were shaded brown
when the researchers examined the model , they found just a few buildings were clad with marble , including the temple of venus and the basilica julia
shortly before augustus came to power , the carrara marble quarries on the northwest coast of italy were opened , and this was thought to have made marble a popular building material
marble - paved public spaces , which used to only be found in sacred temples and houses of the elite , were also added throughout the city
the 3d model ( above ) allows researchers to explore the city down to the street level and see how it changed between 44bc and 14ad the basilica julia in the roman forum was one of the few buildings to be constructed from marble in rome under augustus dr favro said this may be why rome earned its reputation as a city of marble
' many artworks , like the painting above , and historical accounts depict rome under augustus as being dominated by marble buildings
