a schoolgirl spent six months with four inflated balloons lodged under her scalp to grow new skin to allow doctors to cover her birthmark
jessica was born with a mole covering half her head
specialists warned her parents if it was left untreated , it could ultimately turn cancerous
medics did not want to leave the nine - year - old with a bald patch , by using a skin graft from elsewhere on her body
jessica , nine , from lincoln was born with a huge mole covering a large part of her head
doctors warned her parents if left untreated , it could become cancerous
and so , they inserted four balloons under her scalp , inflating them to grow excess skin to cover the mole they then spent six months gently inflating the balloons with more than a pint and a half of saline solution , to stretch jessica 's skin
then , the team were able to stretch the new skin over the gap , creating a normal scalp
they then removed the mole , and used the new scalp to cover the birthmark jessica coped with her unusual ' hairstyle ' by drawing inspiration from her short - haired hero jessie j and did n't complain once throughout the tough ordeal , her mother said ' it 's nice now to think that it 's all over for her
' in june 2013 , three balloons were inserted underneath jessica 's scalp by plastic surgeon rauf at leicester royal infirmary
as the balloons gently expanded they stretched jessica 's scalp
using the excess skin created by the balloons , they were able to cover almost all of jessica 's birthmark
her parents inflated the balloon at home until it was big enough to create enough new skin to cover the last 10 per cent of jessica 's mole
jessica , from lincoln , was born with the birthmark - a pigmented melanocytic nevus - which was partially visible under her hair on the left hand side
' if it turned cancerous they would n't be able to remove it quickly enough because it 's such a large area and it takes such a long process , ' said mrs jessica , who runs a data cabling company with husband james , 37
three months later - when the ' lumps ' contained almost one and a half pints - surgeons removed the skin with a mole on , and the balloons , and used her newly stretched scalp to cover it up
but the skin was n't quite big enough , and she had to have her head shaved again and a final balloon inserted in october last year , with her parents inflating it at home
a first operation to use the excess skin created by three balloons , did n't quite cover the entire mole , and so doctors inserted a fourth balloon in october last year in january after her final operation jessica was left with a full head of hair once more
it is thought the procedure has never been carried out in the uk , and has only once been used in the america the final 10 per cent of the mole - along with the balloon on the side of her head - was removed in january , and now jessica has a perfect head of growing hair
