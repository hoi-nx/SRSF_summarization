just a few months ago , coquelin was on the verge of being allowed to leave arsenal , having made little more than a fringe impact on the club 's first team
coquelin has become a key member of the arsenal first team after almost being allowed to leave statistically the frenchman is the leading defensive player in the premier league since his return to arsenal coquelin 's stint in the first team has earned him a new long - term contract with the gunners but an injury to mathieu flamini has handed the 23 - year - old frenchman his chance , and coquelin has emerged as a real talent , and a crucial part of arsenal 's recent good form
coquelin has also brought a degree of steel to the famously lightweight arsenal midfield , topping the charts for duels won
arsene wenger admitted he had expected to release coquelin at the end of the season coquelin has gone from being a reserve to a player that may be encouraged to play even though he 's injured coquelin almost went on loan to qpr at the beginning of the season but the deal collapsed late on in fact , the frenchman midfielder has dominated the premier league in personal battles , his 97 duels won an astonishing 21 more than any other player
the frenchman midfielder has propelled himself above compatriot mathieu flamini in the pecking order arsenal have been linked with christoph kramer ( left ) and lars bender but might feel coquelin is enough coquelin played five games on loan at charlton this season but has returned to be a first team regular but arsene wenger , so long linked with a string of defensive midfielders - the most recent lists including lars bender , christoph kramer ad morgan schneiderlin - seems to think that coquelin has a future at the club , offering him a new long - term contract last month
