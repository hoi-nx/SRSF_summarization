but who have been the best signings of the season so far ? sportsmail takes a look ... 10 - ander herrera athletic bilbao to manchester united well , he finally became a hit after being allowed to play consistently
ander herrera has finally begun to show his class at old trafford after a slow start under louis van gaal the spaniard has become a key part of manchester united 's midfield , allowing the likes of juan mata to flourish 9 - janmaat feyenoord to newcastle mr dependable , which is a name you do not normally associate with newcastle defenders
cheap and pleased for the opportunity in the premier league , alan pardew and graham carr did their homework on this signing and it âs helped no end at the back for the magpies
janmaat has proved excellent value for newcastle , becoming a regular at right back in his first season janmaat is a dutch international star , and newcastle did well to pick him up for such a small fee last summer 8 - toby alderweireld atletico madrid to southampton ( loan ) nine clean sheets for southampton with the belgian defender in the team and - despite him making noises that he probably wo nât be around next season - they have easily coped with the loss od dejan lovren to liverpool
quick enough for the premier league , he âs kept up with the best and added a touch of class at the back for southampton
toby alderweireld has shown the pace and class needed in the premier league since joining southampton on loan 7 - ryan bertrand chelsea to southampton ( loan and then permanent ) luke shaw âs boots may be small in a literal sense , but figuratively ryan bertrand had a job on
southampton were smarting at losing their teenage sensation who careered down the left last season , but it âs as if he was never really there as the former chelsea man carries equal threat going forward and has actually appeared more comfortable defensively
ryan bertrand and nathaniel clyne have been inspirational at full backs for southampton this season after signing him on loan in the summer , securing ryan bertrand permanently looks like a masterstroke 6 - graziano pelle feyenoord to southampton a fairly unknown quantity on signing from feyenoord for Â£ 8m , graziano pelle âs physical presence and deftness of touch has made him a huge hit on the south coast
diafra sakho 's goals were a big part of west ham 's brilliant start to this season , after signing from metz the senegalese striker has shown he can score with his head as well as his feet , and has proved great value 3 - diego costa atletico madrid to chelsea that blistering start to the season means diego costa will be in every list similar to this from now until may
his 19 premier league goals are one of the chief reasons why chelsea look like winning the title
diego costa has endeared himself to chelsea fans with his nasty side , showing aggression as well as quality diego costa 's 19 premier league goals already have fired chelsea to the brink of the title 2 - cesc fabregas barcelona to chelsea where would diego costa have been without fabregas ? back in the capital , albeit over the other side , his campaign got off to a similarly stunning start , assisting almost at will as chelsea battered all those put in front of them
providing more assists than any other player by far , cesc fabregas ' premier league return has been superb his form may have dropped off since the turn of the year , but cesc fabregas has still been a stand - out star offering more defensively than at previous clubs , cesc fabregas has become the complete midfielder this season 1 - alexis sanchez barcelona to arsenal a game - changer
not happy playing second fiddle to neymar and lionel messi at barcelona , alexis sanchez has proven this term that he is one of the premier forwards in world football and shown to arsene wenger why it âs probably wise to shell out on quality every now and again
alexis sanchez 's pace and skill have proved to be a match - winning combination since he joined arsenal the chilean forward has provided superb goals and stunning displays since leaving barcelona this summer no signing has had as great an impact on their new side this season as arsenal 's chilean superstar
