loncar , 55 , won a long legal battle against being returned to croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder a man who shot his dying wife 14 times as she was hanging from a noose can continue to live freely in uk â after judges refused to extradite him
loncar , 55 , has won a long legal battle against being returned to croatia to serve four years in prison for attempted murder , despite committing further crimes , including an assault , while living in london
he earlier won asylum after complaining he had to flee croatia because of anti-serb discrimination â and his lawyers argued locals would persecute him over the shooting
loncar , who has been on benefits and had a drink problem since arriving in uk with his two sons in 1999 , made the extraordinary defence that he was not aiming at his wife when he fired repeatedly from a few yards away
a croatia court which heard the case in his absence rejected his defence , sentenced him to four years in prison , and ten years ago the country formally issued an international arrest warrant and requested his extradition from uk
his lawyers first successfully fought against the extradition on human rights grounds , arguing that he had a new serbian â partner â in uk â who actually lives a hundred miles away â and that he now had grandchildren in london
and last week uk judges finished off the extradition bid for ever , giving loncar the right to remain free here , after ruling it â oppressive â to send him back to prison in croatia after so long
speaking in broken england to the daily mail last night at his housing association flat close to fashionable camden in london , loncar said he had every right to remain in uk , adding : â croatia is dangerous â they still want me there
last week , uk judges finished off the extradition bid for ever , giving loncar the right to remain free in the uk , by ruling in the high court ( pictured ) that it would be â oppressive â to send him back to prison in croatia he told the court â that when he saw that his wife had jumped off the ladder , he took the gun and ammunition out of the holster he had under his arm and fired the gun from three to four metres away , but did not know in which direction
while he began a life on benefits here , croatia âs supreme court in 2000 ordered a retrial , with loncar âs village now a part of croatia , and the following year he was convicted in his absence of attempted murder
croatia , a member of the european union , some years later sought loncar âs extradition , and in 2006 uk police arrested him
and in reference to the human rights act âs â right to a family life â clause , judges said loncar had â been in a relationship with the same partner since prior to 2006 , although they do not live together â
far from living together , the daily mail has discovered that â partner â helping provide him with a â family life â to maintain here is an ethnic serbian born in uk and living 100 miles from him in leicester .
