unless man city can produce the greatest result in their european history - arguably their entire history - and overturn a 2 - 1 first - leg deficit against barcelona on wednesday night , england faces an embarrassing total wipeout from this season 's champions league
with psg dumping chelsea out last week and monaco resisting arsenal 's spirited fightback on tuesday night , we face the prospect of having no premier league representatives in the quarter - finals
arsenal 's santi cazorla is commiserated as monaco celebrate knocking out the england side on tuesday dejected chelsea players walk off the field at stamford bridge after their champions league exit to psg joe hart roars his frustration during man city 's first - leg defeat to barcelona at the etihad this graphic showing the england clubs that have reached the champions league quarter - finals since 2004 you do n't have to flick too far back through the record books to find a time when england ruled in europe 's foremost club competition
the last halcyon days were the three seasons from 2006 - 07 until the end of 2008 - 09 , when the premier league supplied 11 of the 24 quarter - finalists
in the 2006 - 07 season , liverpool , chelsea and united all made it to the semi-finals
in 2008 - 09 , united knocked out arsenal in the last four , while barcelona squeezed past chelsea
while united were runners - up again in 2011 and chelsea lifted the trophy in 2012 , as well as reaching the semi-finals last season , the england dominance seen during that golden three - year period has n't been replicated
chelsea and united contested the 2008 champions league final in a golden period for england united met arsenal in the champions league semi-finals in the 2008 - 09 campaign chelsea and liverpool met in the 2008 champions league semi-finals , with the london club advancing the mantle has been passed to spain , who will expect to see barcelona , real madrid and atletico madrid in the last four unless paired in the next round
though chelsea reached the last four a year ago , united exited at the quarter - final stage , while man city and arsenal departed in the last 16
the season 2012 - 13 was even worse , with united and arsenal crashing out in the last 16 and chelsea and man city failing to get out of their groups
there is n't one single reason to explain this slump in premier league performance , but a growing school of thought is that the lack of a winter break is beginning to hold our teams back
wayne rooney and united were beaten by bayern munich in last season 's quarter - finals lionel messi scores for barcelona in their win over man city this time last season tomas rosicky and arsenal were eliminated by bayern munich at the last - 16 stage last season city boss manuel pellegrini joined the chorus in an interview with sportsmail this week , saying : ' december and january are very tough months because of the number of games
man city manager manuel pellegrini has joined the chorus of managers favouring a winter break psg did n't play a competitive match between december 21 and january 4 chelsea played five times during that period , including a 5 - 3 defeat at tottenham on new year 's day in explaining chelsea 's exit , you might consider that psg did n't play a single competitive match between december 21 and january 4
after cruising into the winter break with an 8 - 1 rout of huesca and a 5 - 0 win over cordoba , when they resumed , lionel messi and co - after a shock defeat by real sociedad - recorded thrashings of elche ( 5 - 0 , 4 - 0 and 6 - 0 ) and deportivo la coruna ( 4 - 0 )
barcelona had not only a winter break but a reasonably straightforward run of games in january while football over the christmas period should be kept sacred , a couple of weeks off in january would not go amiss and would boost england chances of getting through the last - 16 stage
of course , there was no winter break in england between 2006 and 2009 , but england clubs still prospered
' should man city exit , as expected , against barcelona , the debate as to why england clubs no longer reach the latter stages of the champions league en masse will intensify
