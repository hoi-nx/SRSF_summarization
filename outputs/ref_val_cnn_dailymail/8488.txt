rosberg must reinvent himself in order to challenge hamilton for this year 's formula one championship , according to damon hill
rosberg lost out to hamilton at last season 's title decider in abu dhabi , with the briton storming to the chequered flag as his mercedes team - mate encountered technical gremlins
it marked hamilton 's 11th victory of the campaign , six more than rosberg
rosberg needs a reinvention if he is to challenge mercedes team - mate hamilton , says damon hill hamilton roared to championship victory in 2014 with 11 race victories to his rival team - mate 's six hamilton ( left ) and rosberg come together following their final race of a tumultuous season last year rosberg has a more subtle skill set than his formidable team - mate hamilton , says damon hill and damon hill , the 1996 world champion , believes rosberg has to improve on his displays of last season to stand any chance of stopping hamilton from claiming back - to - back titles
' rosberg has talents that are slightly more subtle and less obvious than hamilton , but i think he is going to have to invent a new rosberg to counter his team - mate , ' said damon hill
' if you look at the strike - rate of hamilton 's wins in comparison to rosberg , that was pretty formidable really
does it change that much and can it change that much over the winter ? ' it can , but politically now rosberg had an opportunity last year to establish himself as the guy that the team wants to invest in , but hamilton really captured that with the biggest prize going
