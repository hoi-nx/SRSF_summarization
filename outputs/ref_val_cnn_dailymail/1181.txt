brown has been in the wars in recent weeks and he has the scars to prove it
but he insists he is ready to battle for his rugby world cup starting place and is also determined to inject some much - needed confidence into club - side harlequins ' stuttering season
twelve months ago brown concluded a six nations campaign that ended with an identical result , a second place in the table behind joe schmidt 's ireland
brown in action against france in the final six nations game of the tournament this time around , there were no personal accolades to dull the disappointment of a fourth consecutive runners - up place
however , brown believes the manner of england 's memorable 55 - 35 victory over france is a reason to be optimistic ahead of this autumn 's rugby world cup
' i have n't done too much reflecting but it 's massively disappointing to end the way that we did , ' said brown , speaking at the rosslyn park hsbc - the world 's largest schools rugby tournament
brown was disappointed with how the six nations ended , but says there were positives to take ' we 'll keep going as a squad , keep using things like this to develop us
brown is an admitted fan of the 13 - man code and harlequins famously released a statement titled ' brown stays with rugby ' when he briefly flirted with a switch
however , brown believes he has done enough in recent weeks to cement his place as stuart lancaster 's first choice full - back , ahead of rival goode , who deputised when he missed the defeat in dublin after picking up a head injury early in the win over italy
when i actually played , i thought i did well , ' added brown , who was casting his eye over the next generation of stars at rosslyn park â an event that has previously produced the likes of gareth edwards , lawrence dallaglio , will carling , and ugo monye
brown will not be in action for harlequins when they face saracens at wembley on saturday ' it 's just a shame that i did take a knock and missed one a three quarter games , including the big one in ireland
' brown and goode should be going head - to - head at wembley this weekend when the two sides clash in front of what is expected to be a world record crowd for a club rugby match
' it 's not been a good campaign for harlequins and this game could hopefully spark our season
