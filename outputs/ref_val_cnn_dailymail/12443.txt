irbil , iraq iraq forces are doubling down efforts to retake the city of tikrit from isis , even uniting sunni and shiite fighters in the mission
the iraq army , along with sunni and shiite militiamen , attacked isis strongholds in the area monday , the state - run iraqiya tv reported
iraq warplanes and helicopters are also striking targets in and around tikrit
tikrit fell to isis in june of 2014 , after the group 's capture of iraq 's second - largest city , mosul
tikrit is best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraq dictator saddam hussein
isis , the radical sunni militant group , has been on a murderous campaign to establish a caliphate across swaths of iraq and syria
iraq forces approached tikrit from several fronts , iraqiya tv reported , engaging with isis north of the city at al-alam and south of the city at al-dour
the element of surprise probably was not a factor , as reports of iraq troops amassing near tikrit were widely shared
tikrit is a big city , and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from isis
while iraq forces have gained some territory in the area , it has generally been under isis control for the last eight months or so
the joint iraq forces fighting to retake tikrit include iraq troops , members of the shia al-hashed al-shaabi militia , members of the sunni sons of salahuddin brigades , and other sunni tribal fighters
al-abadi , who is also commander in chief of the armed forces , said on twitter that he will " oversee the operation to liberate tikrit " from isis
last june , tikrit was the scene of the bloodiest massacre ever perpetrated by isis militants
the u.n. 's envoy to iraq , nickolay mladenov , urged all armed forces in tikrit to do their utmost to spare civilians
