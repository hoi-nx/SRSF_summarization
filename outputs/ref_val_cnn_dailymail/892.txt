director of public prosecutions alison saunders has announced a review of all forthcoming trials or retrials regarding the prosecution of journalists the prosecution of journalists accused of paying public officials for leaks was in turmoil last night after law chiefs announced a review of all forthcoming trials or retrials
alison saunders , the director of public prosecutions , made the decision as anger grew that a â witch - hunt â had been conducted to pursue reporters who exposed stories kept secret because they embarrassed those in power
last week , lord thomas , the lord chief justice , expressed misgivings that the obscure 13th century law of misconduct in public office was being used to haul journalists before the courts
scotland yard and the cps have brought to trial 24 journalists as part of the investigation , launched in the wake of phone - hacking allegations
but on friday , lord thomas overturned her conviction after finding judge charles wide , who presided over the trial , â misdirected â the jury over the â level of seriousness â required to have committed an offence
mrs alison saunders made the decision after holding emergency talks about the future of the prosecutions of the press with senior barristers and the metropolitan police
a cps spokesman said : â the court of appeal judgment from last week does not call into question the prosecution of the appellants concerned but considered that the jury needed greater direction on how serious offending must be to amount to an abuse of the public âs trust
â this ruling has been very carefully considered in relation to the cases against these three individuals and we have informed the court of appeal this afternoon of our decisions concerning retrials in each of those cases
â the spokesman said the cps would â consider the wider implications of last week âs judgment on this case and others within operation elveden â
legal sources said mrs alison saunders had been forced to consider an â exit strategy â after the so - called media crime investigations descended into chaos , with juries showing a reluctance to convict journalists who paid money for stories that were clearly in the public interest
critics have described the investigation as a â waste of public money â and accused police and prosecutors of pursuing a â vendetta â against journalists
