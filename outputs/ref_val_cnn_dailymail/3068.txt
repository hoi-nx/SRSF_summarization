russian secret services may have executed the troops suspected of shooting down malaysian airlines flight mh17 , say sources involved in the investigation of the crash over eastern ukraine
the holland - led probe is leaning towards a conclusion that a buk missile fired from rebel - held territory downed the boeing 777 , killing all 298 on board
and it is highly likely the aircraft was shot out of the sky by russian military personnel , according to a report by the holland ' state broadcaster nos , citing anonymous sources in the police and the group of investigators working on the probe into the plane 's loss
sources close to the investigation also complain they are under siege from persistent attempts by russian secret services to hack their computer system and plant spyware software on their smartphones , reported nos phones and laptops used by investigators in ukraine had to be ' destroyed ' subsequently because they were infected with spyware , it was claimed
denial : russian president vladimir putin ( pictured ) blamed ukraine for obstructing investigators from the crash site - and moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in the plane 's destruction damage : russian media has said th holes in the plane 's fuselage are not consistent with the damage caused by a buk missile , which investigators believe could be the reason for its demise yet the evidence ' points in one direction ' , namely a ground - based attack by a buk missile , it was claimed in holland
doomed : according to ukraine intelligence chief vitaliy naidahis , this was a picture of a missile being fired from snizhne in ukraine towards the mh17 flight aftermath : sources investigating the root of mh17 's destruction ( pictured ) complain the russian secret service is ' persistently ' trying to hack their computers a suspected ' executioner ' - a ukraine air force pilot - was even named
