baghdad about 75 % of the besieged iraqi city of tikrit is now back in government control , the head of a key paramilitary force taking part in the attack told cnn on thursday
the other 25 % is in the hands of about 150 isis fighters who continue to hold out , said main al-kadhimi , commander of the hashd al-shaabi militia
there has been no independent confirmation of such a significant advance by the iraqi forces
isis ' spokesman , abu mohammed al adnani , called reports of coalition - member victories " delusional and fake
it 's part of their ongoing quest to wrest control from isis , which captured the city last year
tikrit , best known to westerners as the birthplace of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein , fell in june to isis , which has captured large areas of iraqi and syrian for what it says is its islamic caliphate
the sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near tikrit , preventing the joint iraqi forces from using it to cross the tigris river to approach the city from the east
nevertheless , forces have made progress , forcing isis fighters to retreat toward the city center from front - line positions , hashd al-shaabi 's media office said
if iraqi regains control of the city , it could mean that retaking mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible
in a possible sign of the problems to come , a number of posts on social media appear to show iraqi soldiers in extremely graphic " selfies " with the heads of alleged isis militants , or striking odd poses with bodies behind them
most of the photos are thought to have been taken during the iraqi military offensive to retake tikrit and other areas in salaheddin province , which started 10 days ago
two senior security officials in samarra told cnn , on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to media , that they are looking into these claims and they are also investigating similar incidents
" if there are reprisals in tikrit and it becomes a " shiite - on - sunni struggle , " cordesman said , then not only will iran 's influence increase " but you can see the country divide and islamic state ( isis ) be replaced by a conflict between iraqi shiite and sunni
while iraqi forces piled the pressure on isis in tikrit , the sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in iraqi 's western anbar province , where it is finding a support base among the predominantly sunni population
more than 40 iraqi soldiers were killed when isis blew up the iraqi army headquarters just outside ramadi , an anbar provincial leader told cnn on thursday
isis launched a new offensive on ramadi , west of baghdad , on wednesday morning , al-issawi , the deputy head of the council , said in a statement
the city is being attacked " from all directions , " with isis firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets , he said , and explosives - laden vehicles used to attack security checkpoints and a bridge
officials believe " this is an isis response to the tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north , " al-issawi said
elsewhere in anbar province , iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of karma , near falluja , from isis , said al-karhout , the head of the anbar provincial council , on wednesday
hundreds of isis militants launched a large - scale offensive wednesday in the town , the group said
