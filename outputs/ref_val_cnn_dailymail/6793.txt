israel coach guttman has claimed bale cares more about wales than real madrid ahead of his side 's crunch euro 2016 qualifier against the dragons
the european champions suffered their fifth defeat of 2015 when they lost 4 - 3 at home to german side schalke on tuesday night , and although that was enough for real madrid to progress to the quarter - finals of the champions league 5 - 4 on aggregate , it did not spare the players from the wrath of angry madridistas
bale endured a frustrating evening on tuesday night but real madrid still qualified for the quarter - finals fans waved white handerkerchiefs - the traditional symbol of disgust at a bad performance - with bale once again made the scapegoat for real madrid 's problems
and now guttman has added fuel to the fire by insisting bale is saving his best for wales ' visit to israel on march 28 , when the top two sides in group b meet in haifa
