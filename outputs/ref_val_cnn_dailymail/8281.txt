a woman who was given just five years to live with an aggressive cancer claims she has beaten the disease - by eating pineapples
candice - marie fox , 31 , found out she had thyroid cancer and reluctantly went under the knife to remove more than 20 lumps three years ago
but when the disease spread and doctors said she had a maximum of five years to live , candice rejected life - lengthening chemotherapy which she claims had ' killed ' friends
candice - marie fox , 31 , found out she had thyroid cancer three years ago and decided to battle the disease by eating healthily she gave her life an overhaul to try and banish the disease , eating up to three pineapples a day - as well as dozens of grapefruits , lemons , apples , kiwis and bananas
the fruits are high in a cancer - zapping proteins - called bromelain - which some scientists claim ' eat away ' at tumours
the former model also ditched other ' toxins ' in her life - including alcohol , meat and even her husband - and within just six months she says that her grade four cancer was almost gone
candice , from houghton regis , hertfordshire , said : ' i changed my whole outlook on life
candice reluctantly went under the knife to remove more than 20 lumps ' instead of living for parties and weekends and working and doing the same stuff i did day in , day out , i changed my whole view
' like pineapple , kiwi and papaya - i found out that the bromelain eats away at a particular protein layer of the cancer
i 'm so grateful for the cancer now in hindsight because it turned me into the person that i was meant to be
' candice found a lump above her left collarbone in 2011 and an ultrasound revealed around 20 papillary thyroid carcinomas
candice now runs a website encouraging others to take control of their health
but she was horrified when it revealed the cancer had spread to her liver and the back of her neck - with pre-cancerous cells also in her lung - and she had a maximum of five years to live
doctors told her to come back in six months for chemotherapy to reduce the incurable cancer but candice refused
she had lost both her best friend jamie brownsmead , 31 , and cousin frankie gerathy , 13 , to cancer in 2009 , and blames body - weakening chemo for their demise

candice , who runs a modelling agency said : ' i 'm living life on my terms now
he said : ' at this point in time , we can say that there is ned - ' no evidence of disease ' in candice
' her tumor markers which reflect the number of cancerous cells has been well within the normal range for over two years , so we can confidently say that her stage four thyroid cancer is under effective management
' he continued : ' candice possesses a level of faith , self - love and purpose that i am sure is a factor in her remarkable healing journey
' i can tell you that most thyroid cancer patients with similar circumstances to candice who follow the conventional path do not survive or experience a very poor quality of life
' candice ate up to three pineapples a day to try and get rid of cancer when asked about whether pineapples and other fruit could have helped to beat candice 's cancer , oncologist professor karol sikora said : ' the truth is we just do n't know
