a note written by durst , scion of one of new york 's largest real estate empires , may hold the key to the murder of his neighbor
durst , a billionaire , was questioned but not charged in the mysterious death of his first wife kathleen mccormack in 1982
the 71 - year - old was then questioned in 2000 after the death of his longtime friend and elderly neighbor berman , shortly before she was to be questioned if she knew about kathleen mccormack 's disappearance
the note read ' beverley hills police-1527 benedict canyon cadaver ' - it has distinctive block capital lettering and the word beverly hills is misspelled
now a documentary producer has been shown a letter durst wrote in 1999 to berman
the handwriting appears to be similar to the note sent to police and again beverly hills is misspelled on both notes
the new evidence was shown publicly for the first time sunday night in the six - part hbo documentary , ' the jinx : the life and deaths of durst
police have long suspected that durst was the author of an anonymous note ( pictured ) sent to the beverly hills police department alerting them to a body at berman 's home - it has distinctive block capital lettering and the word beverly hills is misspelled now berman 's stepson showed a documentary producer a 1999 letter ( pictured ) from durst to berman that he said he just discovered
the handwriting appears to be similar to the note sent to police and again beverly hills is misspelled on both notes durst , a well - connected socialite , worked for his father 's durst organization for years as a developer
ten years earlier , durst had gained infamy in new yorkdue to the mysterious disappearance of his wife , kathie , and many believed the real estate scion had something to do with it
durst , whose sometimes bizarre life inspired the hollywood movie all good things , was questioned in her murder - and in the murder of her friend when the case was re-opened in 2000 - but was never charged
then in september 2001 , remnants of the body of morris black , durst 's next - door neighbor in the boarding house where he was living , were found floating in the bay in galveston , texas
a trail of blood led police back to an apartment being rented by a mute woman , dorothy ciner - who was actually durst in a dress
