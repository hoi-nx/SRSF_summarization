her boyfriend âs dreary taste in furnishings is said to be the spark that first set chrissie rucker off in pursuit of all things white
she did nât know it at the time , of course , but that day in 1993 marked the moment chrissie rucker began to dream of setting up a shop selling everything in white
her business sells everything from Â£ 20 scented candles to Â£ 200 cashmere jumpers , and while she has branched out to shades such as â biscuit marl â and â cloud grey â , chrissie rucker remains obsessed with all things pale
aside from the money pouring into company coffers , chrissie rucker owns three stunning properties , all decorated from roof to floor in her trademark sweeping white interiors
there âs a Â£ 12.5 million 17th - century manor house in buckinghamshire , set in 51 acres of parkland , a Â£ 4 million townhouse in west london âs fashionable holland park and what is widely regarded to be the finest property in the swiss alps , haus alpina , a luxury chalet with full - time staff which chrissie rucker rents out for a staggering Â£ 26,000 a week
chrissie rucker , pictured at her buckinghamshire home , realised she had found a gap in the market when she was looking to decorate her future husband 's house all in white even at chrissie rucker âs main residence , the country mansion , the only flashes of colour you âll see are the bright pony rosettes awarded to her horse - mad daughters
however , it was not long before chrissie rucker decided she wanted to do something more interesting with her life than flutter her eyelashes at eligible young bachelors on the west london social circuit

â my mother was really only interested in her horses , â she said , â so the stables were immaculate , the house a tip. â chrissie rucker 's husband , nick wheeler ( pictured ) , set up his shirt company , charles tyrwhitt , in 1986 while a geography student at bristol university it was all a far cry from the vision chrissie rucker would later create of domestic interiors as a haven of white and light
but as a teenager in west london in the late eighties , chrissie rucker seemed intent on immersing herself in a â sloane ranger â lifestyle
even at chrissie rucker and nick 's home in buckinghamshire ( pictured ) you will see only flashes of colour , mainly in the bright pony rosettes awarded to their horse - mad daughters wedding dress designer anneliese sharpe , who was also on the judging panel , recalls that even among the â incredibly beautiful , leggy â girls who paraded in front of her , desperate to be picked , 18 - year - old chrissie rucker stood out
â chrissie rucker used to come every day , â says sharp
â however , chrissie rucker decided that life as a designer was not what she wanted after all
â by the time she met her future husband , chrissie rucker was still struggling to work out exactly what she wanted to do with her life

but i just found it impossible to buy plain white sheets on the high street
â â while chrissie rucker believed she had spotted a hole in the market , her husband - to - be was perfectly placed to advise her when it came to launching her own business
