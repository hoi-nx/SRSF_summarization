do you ever have trouble telling right from left ? for example you 're taking a driving lesson and the instructor asks you to take a left turn and you pause , struggling to think of which way is left
if so , you 're not on your own â a significant proportion of our population has difficulty in telling right from left
many people , even adults , say that they confuse right and left
dr gerard gormley , of queen 's university , says almost a fifth of college professors and more than a quarter of college students have difficulty quickly identifying right from left for example , 19.5 per cent of college professors and 26.2 per cent of college students said that they occasionally , frequently or all of the time had difficulty when they had to quickly identify right from left
discriminating between left and right is a complex neuro - psychological process involving several higher brain functions
one further problem facing the health profession is that when a doctor or nurse faces a patient , their right - side is on the patient 's left - side
so correctly distinguishing right from left in a patient also involves mentally rotating images
wrong turns to avoidable errors it 's hardly the end of the world if you take the wrong direction on a journey , but there are many situations where confusing right from left can have devastating consequences
it 's not the end of the world if a person takes the wrong direction on a journey , but doctors confusing right from left have taken out the wrong kidney in the past do n't ever confuse sides error is an inherent characteristic of human behaviour â sometimes we just get things wrong â but left - right ones may be more than a one - off accident
evidence would suggest that right - left confusion is more common in women
the literature would appear to suggest that men demonstrate a greater degree of visuo - spatial function , the ability to visualise objects and spaces , which allows people to do things such as navigate around a city
hospitals and other health settings are busy and complex places to work in
dr gerard gormley says tests should be carried out so people affected are aware of the problem coping techniques those who have difficulty in telling right from left often develop their own techniques â for example placing their left thumb at right angles to their index finger to make an ' l ' representation for their ' left ' side
as the people at risk often do n't think they have a problem , testing of the ability to discriminate against right - left discrimination â for example through online psychometric tests â could be offered to students to measure their ability
