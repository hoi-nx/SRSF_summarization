jailed : marks stole Â£ 4,200 from vulnerable groucher while pretending to care for her a carer stole thousands of pounds from the 90 - year - old dementia victim she was supposed to be looking after finding her pin written in her diary
marks left her frail victim groucher ' heartbroken ' by abusing her trust to plunder Â£ 4,200 from her bank account over a seven - month period
the victim was so upset by the crime that she has had to leave her home in croydon , south london and move into sheltered accommodation
marks , 59 , visited mrs groucher twice a week and stole her bank card so she could withdraw large amounts of cash , using the code written in the elderly woman 's diary
sentencing marks to 12 months in jail , reid told her : ' the victim was in her nineties , had problems with dementia , and , effectively , you inveigled your way into her family
' mrs groucher , who has four children and eight grand - children , had lived at the same house for around 30 years , but she was so distressed by the crime that her dementia deteriorated and she had to move into care
in a victim impact statement read to the court , mrs groucher said : ' i know marks does not have a mother , but that is no reason to do what she did
' fairley , prosecuting , told the court that mrs groucher paid marks Â£ 10 every time she visited
the thief 's deception was found out when mrs groucher 's daughter baldwin , 70 , saw that there was money missing from her bank account in july last year
hearing : croydon crown court ( above ) heard marks even stole money while mrs groucher was ill in hospital ' she noticed there was Â£ 2,000 , or Â£ 3,000 less than what there should have been , ' mr fairley said
