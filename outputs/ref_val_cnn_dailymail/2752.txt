residents can now nominate a neighbour to receive their parcels so they never miss a delivery , royal mail announced yesterday
the move could reduce the number of â red cards â which land on doormats to tell householders a package has been returned to the delivery office
postmen already attempt to deliver parcels to people âs neighbours if they are out
but the new service means they can now deliver to a specific friend who lives nearby , in the recipient âs absence
residents can now nominate a neighbour to receive their parcels so they never miss a delivery , royal mail announced yesterday ( file picture ) it means people can choose a neighbour who they know well , or who is often in during the day , to sign for a parcel or receive a delivery which will not fit through the letter box
â royal mail said the â nominate a neighbour â scheme would be more convenient for householders and â improve first - time delivery â
â for our postmen and women it means that they are even more likely to deliver parcels and letters first time rather than having to take items back to the office
first - time delivery of parcels and signed - for items is high in royal mail and in the trial delivery offices this improved further
â since 2012 royal mail has left parcels with neighbours if the recipient is not in
