wickham made a disastrous decision to move to sunderland when his career was flying in the championship , he impressed and looked like one of the most technically gifted players on the pitch two weeks after that he scored a hat - trick
in the summer of 2011 he made what has proved to be a catastrophic career move
to those who did n't follow wickham 's career before he went to the north-east , all they will know of him is that he is highly - paid , and not exactly outstanding
sure , there was a flurry of goals to help sunderland stay up at the back end of last season , but that has been it
these underachieving sunderland players do n't mind showing off their wealth , do they ? stories have emerged of wickham 's extravagant spending - Â£ 17,500 on a bottle of champagne , for example in a loan spell at sheffield wednesday , he also impressed - there is no mistaking his ability as a footballer is it something about the club that means these players have no self - awareness whatsoever ? is nobody at the club telling them that all the time they 're so truly terrible on the pitch , it might be a good idea to keep things on the down low off the pitch ? one of wickham 's managers called him ' a playboy model , ' and said he needed a ' slap in the face ' to help him realise his talent
and make no mistake , wickham is a very talented footballer
since wickham joined sunderland he has had 10 different managers at club level , including his loan spells
wickham should be spearheading england under 21s ' euros campaign but he has not been selected the 21 - year - old has been stuck out on the left for sunderland when he is clearly a centre - forward at a more stable club , the chances are that wickham might have a better environment to succeed
off the pitch , has the so - called ' playboy model ' been guided properly ? evidence suggests not : gus poyet even admitted he ignored wickham when he first arrived at the stadium of light as manager
sunderland signed wickham but their duty does n't stop there
sunderland need to provide their players with a chance to succeed but wickham has not been guided sunderland are a basket case of a club and wickham made the wrong decision when he joined them five years on from scoring a wonderful goal to win the european championship for england i am disappointed wickham is nowhere near the senior squad as we prepare for a euro 2016 qualifier this week
the fact that he has n't is down to sunderland being a complete basket case of a club
let 's hope for wickham 's sake â and england 's â the next chapter for sunderland will help him become the player he should be .
