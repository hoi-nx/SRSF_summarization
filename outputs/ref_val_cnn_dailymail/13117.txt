within days , almost 1 million people sign a petition for him not to lose his job , while the suspension of the tv program he presents loses the bbc 4 million viewers
why is this man so popular that he can be accused of abusing his staff ( not to mention members of other ethnic groups and nationalities ) and seemingly get away with it ? a serial offender , clarkson seems to enjoy a charmed life
but , with the bbc now deliberating over his future , has his luck finally run out ? not a chance
clarkson , like so many celebrities , sees his stock grow with every controversy
" on this latest occasion , was it the beleaguered producer lodging a complaint , or , like any normal person who 's been punched in the face by a thug , pressing charges with the local constabulary ? no , it was none other than clarkson who willingly gave himself up to the corporation
former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and chelsea manager jose mourinho are , like clarkson , seasoned experts in rebranding themselves ( or their team ) as the victims , even when they seem to have everything going for them bar the position of the stars
while waiting for the bbc to deliver its verdict , clarkson penned an article for the sun in which he likened himself to a " dinosaur " whose time is about to run out , knowing full well that his followers will protest : no , of course you 're not washed up and irrelevant , clarkson
britain needs you to stand up to johnny foreigner ! it is almost tempting to wonder whether there might be a political role ahead of him should the bbc decide to give him the push for once and for all ( i use the word " political " advisedly here )
clarkson is already assured of immortality , if only through youtube or its futuristic equivalent , but while waiting to shuffle off this mortal coil he -- like all celebrities -- acts as a conduit of divinity
bruises , actual and emotional , are worn with pride , whether delivered by the kalasis cane , cowell 's tongue , or clarkson 's fist ( allegedly )
so how about oisin tymon , clarkson 's hapless producer , who , according to the daily telegraph , had to seek hospital treatment for a cut lip following the " fracas ? " had he presented poor , weary jeremy with a nice succulent steak on his arrival that evening , he would still be languishing in the realms of the unknown
