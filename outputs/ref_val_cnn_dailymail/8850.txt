the number of seriously overweight children has soared in recent years as ministers have failed to tackle the problem , said professor paul gately
official statistics suggest childhood obesity rates have plateaued in recent years â although one in three 11 - year - olds is still overweight or obese
but prof paul gately , who treats obese patients , said the figures disguised the fact that the country âs fat youngsters were now â getting fatter â
â he continued : â we have 140,000 children in the uk who are so obese that if they were adults they would be immediately eligible for surgery
uk now has 140,000 â super-fat â children who will need gastric bands as adults if they do not slim down teenagers rarely have fat - loss surgery , with only 60 such operations taking place last year
however , as the mail on sunday revealed last month , patients are getting younger , with a 12 - year - old boy recently going under the knife
rofessor paul gately ( pictured ) says the number of seriously overweight children has soared in recent years as ministers have failed to tackle the problem and he accused local councils of spending only minuscule amounts on obesity prevention or on helping those affected , even though the problems â dwarfed â other public health issues that had money lavished on them , such as sexually transmitted infections
â mr fry said he believed more teenagers should undergo fat - loss surgery , adding that gastric bands were proven to help patients lose weight and keep it off
