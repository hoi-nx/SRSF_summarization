kim and rita ora have been making headlines for rocking latex this year but they 're not the first - and the wo n't be the last - to show off the risque look
once the sartorial statement of choice in sex clubs , latex , pvc and wet - look leather has been treated to a high fashion makeover but can real women pull off the skin - tight look ? or do you need the body - and the confidence - of an a-lister to wear it ? femail called on the designer behind kim and rita ora 's famous looks to custom design a latex dress from scratch for one of our writers - who says she 's never felt more confident
hanna , who is a size 12 , visited atsuko 's studio in islington , north london , for a fitting - as while her designs can be bought off the rack ( something rita ora does ) , atsuko recommends that she fits all of her clients either in person or online
' hanna and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch and had to use lubricant to slip into the dress for the final shoot hanna said that maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket , she could reduce the focus of her top half for a night out on the town hanna and the team decided the black suited her skin tone and hair colour so she had one made from scratch
explaining the experience , hanna said : ' at the fitting , atsuko and the team brought out a few options for me to try , but at first they did nât take my measurements rather took a look at me and gauged which size would fit
i do have some lumps and bumps but the dress really streamlined it and i really get why kim is such a fan
hats off to ella eyre who rocked an atsuko latex dress for her energetic concert recently ! '
atsuko takes hanna 's measurements in her islington boutique is that kim ? writer hanna is proof that you do n't have to be a reality star or celebrity to look sensational - and super stylish - in skintight latex and a few days later , hanna received her bespoke design
' finally putting on the custom - made dress was amazing , ' said hanna , of the final shoot
' kim probably has more confidence to wear such a cleavage - enhancing dress on the town than me , but maybe with a strategically placed blouse or jacket i could reduce the focus of my top half for a night out
' while hanna opted for a copy kim look , atsuko emphasises that you do n't necessarily have to wear head - to - toe latex
hanna , 26 , tries out a skintight latex cocktail dress with cap sleeves and plunging v - neck in atsuko 's shop hanna is measured for her bespoke , strappy , cleavage - enhancing latex dress , which is just like kim 's after moving to london , she started brand her eponymous brand in 2000 and was credited with being the first designer to offer a feminine take on latex
' other stars were quickly recognising the brand and atsuko was dressing lady gaga non-stop from 2008
kim and rita ora showed up to a party earlier this year in near - identical latex dresses by atsuko ... and they 're just two of the stars jumping on the bandwagon hanna tried on rita ora and kim 's favourite blush - coloured latex shade too at the shop before finally settling on the black option , which better suited her skin tone and hair colour another major moment came when for the brand when lady gaga asked atsuko to dress her for her meeting with the queen , who the designer cites as her ' dream client '
' i would love to dress the queen in a latex suit , a colourful one - with a hat
' on a standard week day , kate moss and rita ora may ' rock up ' at the brand 's shop in islington , and kim may well be unveiling more looks in the coming months
