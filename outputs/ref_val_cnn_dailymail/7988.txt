christians are frightened to reveal their religious beliefs to colleagues at work , equality chiefs admit
christians also think their faith is being pushed out of its role as a cornerstone of life in uk , according to a major study by the commission
and ironically , many feel they are being persecuted by the same anti-discrimination and equality laws supported by the equality watchdog
persecuted : the study of 2,500 people found many of the christians who took part felt they needed to hide their faith at work or at school , for fear of being called bigots or being mocked nearly 2,500 people of all faiths were quizzed about religion at work for the nationwide study
it follows years of conflict over christians â right to act in accordance with their religious beliefs
the commission âs report said : â a recurring theme among some employees was the pressure they felt they were under to keep their religion hidden at work and feeling discriminated against when it came to wearing religious symbols or expressing their beliefs
this was particularly felt by christians
â people reported being mocked for their beliefs , including christians , who said their colleagues assumed they were bigoted
commission chief executive mark hammond said of the survey : â what came out strongly was the widespread confusion about the law , leading to some resentment and tensions between groups , and anxiety for employers who fear falling foul of what they see as complicated equality and human rights legislation
it is going to have to do an awful lot of work to rebuild confidence among christians and persuade them that it does not regard secularism as the solution to all problems
