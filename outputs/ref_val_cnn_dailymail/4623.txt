i 'm in valencia , spain 's third largest city
not for the las fallas festival ( a huge affair every march when giant papier - mache figures of politicians are burned amid lively street celebrations ) , but for its other claim to fame - it is the home of paella
luis is a top chef who leads paella - making classes
dinner is served : paella originated in valencia , using ingredients which could be sourced cheaply and locally the central market is in a glorious art nouveau building in the old quarter , with more than 500 stalls selling every spain food imaginable
paella valenciana was created from what was easily available to local farmers
originally from bromley , he moved to valencia 23 years ago when he fell in love with a local , julia espin
a real mixed bag : true paella can contain seafood and rabbit - but should never feature peas they run the paella project , taking in all aspects of buying fresh produce at the market , cooking classes , wine tastings and a visit to xativa in the hills with lessons and meal preparation outdoors
you can also explore the famous rice fields of the albufera national park , just 15 minutes outside valencia
you can take a boat trip on the vast lagoon or enjoy the pine - fringed , wild beaches and restaurants of nearby el saler village
valencia has fantastic white beaches , too , just five minutes from the city centre
balconies of intricate metal designs and specialist cafes called horchaterias , with marble - topped tables serving a traditional valencian drink made from tiger nuts and sugar , remind me this is the real spain
