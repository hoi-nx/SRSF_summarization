the terror that came to tunisia on wednesday -- the deadliest attack on tourists in the arab world since the 1997 massacre in luxor , egypt -- was a long time coming
tunisia has been widely seen as the only success story of the arab spring with a new progressive constitution , a freely elected secular president and prime minister , and a moderate islamist opposition so far committed to democratic principles
but economic progress has lagged well behind
political opening in tunisia has given radicals more breathing room , their numbers swollen by the release hardened islamist militants during the 2011 tunisia revolution that swept away decades of autocratic rule
one of those who was freed from jail was seifallah ben hassine -- also known as abu iyyad -- a veteran tunisia jihadi who worked with osama bin laden in afghanistan in the 1990s and founded the tunisian combatant group
soon after he was released he founded ansar al shariah in tunisia , a pro-jihadi movement which has up to 40,000 followers
three days after the beghazi attack , ansar al shariah in tunisia organized a mob attack outside the u.s. embassy in tunisia which put united states lives at risk
according to the united states government , the group has also been responsible for several other attacks , including attempted suicide bombings at tunisia tourist destinations
in october 2013 , a tunisia suicide bomber blew himself up outside a beach hotel in sousse , killing only himself
in 2013 two secular tunisia politicians were assassinated by islamist extremists
in the last two years , tunisia security forces have increasingly cracked down on ansar al shariah , but the movement still has a significant following
the jihad has been the single biggest factor in the worsening security situation in tunisia
over 3000 tunisia have flocked to fight jihad in syria and iraq , many of them joining isis
in december 2014 isis released a video calling on tunisia to pledge allegiance to isis and carry out attacks , including assassinations
the tunisia jihadi who posted the message sunday claimed to belong to " jund al-khilafah in tunisia
an isis fighter in raqqah , recently appeared in a video questioning why jihadis in tunisia had not pledged fealty
the uqba ibn nafi brigade has been responsible for a string of attacks on tunisia security services in mountainous djebel chaambi region along the algerian border
it is likely to significantly impact tunisia 's tourism industry , worsening the economic outlook and increasing the sense of frustration on which extremists thrive
