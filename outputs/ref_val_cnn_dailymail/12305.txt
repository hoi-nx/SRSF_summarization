even the 3 - year - old playing with your ipad could tell you that
but what would the digital world look like through a different sort of frame ? say ... a circular one ? monohm , a startup based in berkeley , californian , was founded around this very idea
for the last year , the three - person team has been working a circular , palm - sized device dubbed runcible
they cheekily refer to it as the " anti-smartphone , " a description that goes for both its form factor and its value system
the round device is meant to be the antidote to our feed - obsessed , notification - saturated digital existence
it 's a challenge to the rectangular status quo and everything it represents
that 's a quixotic dream , but an interesting one
display technologies have a long and rectangular history
before smartphones there were movie screens , tvs , and computers , not to mention paintings and pages of print
and then of course there are windows â in some ways the original glass rectangles
in each case , the rectangle 's prominence can be attributed in large part to practicality
whether you 're talking about film or glass or stone , rectangles are easy to make
they do n't leave much wasted material
as frames for shaping the world , however , different types of rectangles can produce vastly different effects
14 of the best architecture photos from the past year in her book the virtual window , which traces the rectangular frame from renaissance painting up through microsoft windows , media theorist anne friedberg offers an example from the history of architecture , centering on a public feud between french builder perret and the preeminent modernist architect le corbusier
perret was a strong advocate of the traditional french casement window , which was oriented vertically
its main function , he said , was to let light into a room
runcible is n't meant to be a smartphone replacement so much as an alternative
" if miniaturizing the computer is what got us the smartphone , runcible asks what a gizmo might look like if you started by souping up a pocket watch
a circular frame , after all , is no good for browsing a twitter feed
at this point , runcible as much a provocation as an actual product
but they 're more enthusiastic about the philosophy behind it all : they want to see applications that distill information and streamline interaction , software that constrains the smartphone experience as it exists today
still , even as a hint of a possible device , runcible is compelling
a circular device would sever the link to the printed page , the tv and the computer , and invite developers to look elsewhere for metaphor and inspiration
dials , buttons , and other circular controls
15 incredible photos that 'll remind you to be awed by planet earth if nothing else , the concept could be valuable simply for helping us identify some of the assumptions and habits that underlie our existing devices
runcible is just one scrappy , literal attempt to abandon the rectangle
android wear , google 's smartwatch operating system , reconsiders what apps should look like on a tiny circular display
( note how its home screen ditches iphone 's grid of icons for a blob of circular ones
also note the recent rise of circular avatars over the traditional square ones in apps and interfaces of all kinds )
