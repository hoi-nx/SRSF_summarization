louis van gaal has insisted the main priority for united this season must be to qualify for the champions league despite monday night 's fa cup quarter - final against arsenal offering their best chance of a trophy this season
van gaal is under strict orders from his bosses to restore united to european football 's elite after last season 's seventh - place finish under david moyes saw them miss out
united have n't won the fa cup since 2004 and landed any silverware since sir alex ferugson left but the dutchman says the competition must still be treated as a welcome bonus rather than the primary objective of the campaign
louis van gaal feels it is more important that manchester uited get back into europe than win the fa cup van gaal agrees with arsenal manager arsene wenger that a top four finish is akin to winning a trophy ashley young scored a late winner as united beat newcastle in the premier league on wednesday ' i always want to get the goals what we have set
' arsenal manager arsene wenger has said that finishing in the top four was effectively winning a trophy and van gaal agrees
' van gaal is still expected to put a strong team out against arsenal
the united boss , who has had to endure heavy criticism for the team 's style of play despite a run of only two defeats in 22 matches , believes the result of the cup tie could also have a pyschological effect on the run - in for the all - important top four
' van gaal has been tetchy mood in the build - up to monday night 's game , feeling he has been misrepresented over claims that he has the best team in the premier league , lacks a 20 - goal - a - season striker and has a bad relationship with assistant ryan giggs , who sat stony - faced when united scored their last - minute winner at newcastle on wednesday night

so far , he has received little warmth from the fans whose cries of ' attack , attack , attack ' are a sign of frustration against louis van gaal 's possession - based game
