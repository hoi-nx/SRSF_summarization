stephanie berman , a reproductive health expert from boston , came up with the clever concept , which she named the semenette , after examining the other available methods of at - home fertilization open to her and her wife
' the only options other than going to a doctor 's office would be with a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe , ' ms stephanie berman told refinery29 about her creation , which retails for $ 139.99
' there is nothing romantic or sexy and fun about trying to impregnate your wife with a turkey baster
' moving on up : ms stephanie berman is hoping to release a second version of the unique sex toy later this year the mother - of - one began looking into alternative designs , which would use the same pump - based technology as a turkey baster - one of the more traditional at - home means of artificial insemination - but also enable the user , and their partner , to enjoy the process of impregnation
' i started thinking , what if i could recreate the technology that a turkey baster would provide , but in the form of a sex toy ? ' that would be the perfect scenario - it would not only allow both partners to be really involved in the process , but it would allow for privacy and authenticity and intimacy
' ms stephanie berman and her wife kiersten marie , who used the semenette when conceiving their one - year - old baby daughter isabella , have received an outpouring of support and praise from a variety of people from different communities
tradition : a turkey baster ( pictured ) can be used as a means of at - home insemination while some women choose to use a traditional turkey baster , a needle-less syringe will also serve the same purpose
the method involves women using semen from their boyfriend or husband , or from a willing donor , which they then inject into themselves using a turkey baster or a needle-less syringe
while the success rate of the turkey baster method is thought to be reasonably high , some women , like the semenette 's creator stephanie berman , have complained that it causes discomfort , and it is not known to be particularly enjoyable for the user
