new zealand coach steve hansen flew out of dublin three weeks ago bemoaning boring european rugby
the three teams who entered denouement day on six points apiece â england with a +37 points difference , ireland +33 and wales +12 â all wound up on eight points each but with one crucial photo finish difference â ireland âs calculus was revised upwards to +63 , six better than england âs +57 and 10 clear of wales â +53
mere numbers , though , ca nât properly tell the tale of this nerve - shredding afternoon where credit must go to wales for transforming a slender 14 - 13 interval lead in rome into the 61 - 20 thrashing and igniting the subsequent thirst for points at murrayfield and twickenham
sexton ( left ) and paul o'connell ( right ) arrive at dublin airport with the trophy fully in their grasp ireland 's fans got a chance to touch the coveted six nations trophy outside dublin airport when it all ended , with england a metre short of the french line in forlorn search of the title - clinching converted try , steve hansen âs eyes should have been watering with the wonder of it all
with eight - try wales 48 points clear of azzurri , a margin that would have set ireland the target of a 28 - point win in edinburgh , a vital late twist had the air of 2007 revisited ( azzurri scored a late try eight years ago to cut ireland âs margin and france won the title by a points difference of +4 )
it set england the chase of a 26 - point victory and they fell short , referee nigel owens penalising them on 80:12 at a ruck for sealing off
with ireland 20 points ahead and needing another score to jump ahead of wales on the table , sexton inexplicably missed two penalty kicks in quick succession
unlike wales , who needed a last - second penalty to secure a one - point stadio olimpico half - time lead , and unlike england , 15 - 10 in arrears until the 27th minute in london , ireland hit the front early and resolutely stayed there against the winless scots , their only defensive aberration being rob kearney âs error which left robbie henshaw defending a three - on - one overlap down the blindside of the ruck for finn russell âs converted try on the half hour
ireland were crowned six nations winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge england and wales other than this repeated weakness in shackling breakdown ball quickly shifted from right to left ( france and wales scored against them in the same corner and england came within a whisker of doing the same ) , ireland fixed the issues that betrayed them in wales
ireland powered to a 40 - 10 victory over scotland at murrayfield that won them the six nations title england beat france 55 - 35 at twickenham but it was n't enough to overhaul ireland â you could see them starting to bounce back on thursday
ireland were back - to - back champions for the first time in 66 years and their spontaneous celebrations , just like the calibre of their rugby , were anything but boring and anything but one dimensional .
