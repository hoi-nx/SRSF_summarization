cahill wants to prove a point to his critics after coming under fire for some poor performances at the heart of chelsea 's defence
england centre back cahill was widely praised for his water - tight partnership with terry last season , and in the early stages of the current campaign , but his ability has been called into question with a few poor performances of late
cahill was poor for chelsea in the new year 's day 5 - 3 defeat by tottenham at white hart lane and he allowed raheem sterling to run unchecked for liverpool 's goal in the capital one cup semi-final first leg at anfield
cahill wants to prove his doubters wrong by finding his best form again in chelsea 's defence cahill started and helped chelsea keep a clean sheet in sunday 's capital one cup final win over tottenham but having contributed to keeping harry kane quiet and ensuring chelsea kept a clean sheet to win the cup at wembley on sunday , cahill wants to show his worth all over again
i was told " you ca n't play for england , you 're at bolton " , ' cahill said
i came to chelsea and it was " oh , you ca n't play champions league , you ca n't do this , you ca n't do that " and i proved them wrong
