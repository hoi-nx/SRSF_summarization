human rights campaigners have presented police with a ' dossier ' of new evidence against a bahrain prince accused of torture after he revealed on social media he was staying in london
prince nasser , 27 , accidentally let slip he was back in uk on thursday when he posted a video of himself running in hyde park
the prince posted the video on instagram alongside a squadron of the life guards of the household cavalry with the caption : ' that 's how it feels and sounds when you run in hyde park , london
' prince nasser posted this video of himself running in hyde park on thursday the video was captioned : ' that 's how it feels and sounds when you run in hyde park , london ' he now faces fresh calls for his arrest following a high court ruling last year which stripped him of diplomatic immunity
a bahrain refugee in uk , referred to only as ff , alleged prince nasser was involved in the torture of detained prisoners during 2011 arab spring protests
today the independent reported human rights lawyers acting for ff have delivered a ' dossier ' of new evidence to scotland yard in a bid to have him charged following the revelation he is visiting the capital
no charges were brought against him due to a lack of evidence and both he and the government of bahrain strongly deny the accusations
the presentation of the " dossier " to the police appears to be a politically - motivated and opportunistic attempt to use the uk justice system once again to ventilate damaging allegations about prince nasser
the timing of the actions of the campaigners suggests this is nothing more than a publicity stunt designed to coincide with prince nasser 's visit to the uk and ff 's lawyers ' threatening earlier this week to bring judicial review proceedings in respect of the uk - bahrain naval agreement
' the police have previously declined to investigate prince nasser on the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence against him
' prince nasser , born in may 1987 , is the fourth son of the king hamad bin isa al khalifa and his second wife , sheia bint hasan al-khrayyesh al-ajmi of kuwait
a man identified only as ff was later granted refugee status in the uk , and from there , set about trying to bring charges against prince nasser
