the hose was hanging over the edge of a dock in miami beach when the ' sea cow ' approached and ' grabbed ' onto it with its flippers
it then shoves the end of the hose into its mouth to get its refreshing fill of fresh water , which it requires to survive
even though manatees are found in salt water , they do not consume it
the large ' sea cow ' swims over to the long blue hose in order to get its much - needed fresh water intake filmed from the end of the dock , the manatee can be seen in the water below holding onto a long blue hose with its flippers
this means that on average they must return to fresh water every one to two weeks to get their fill
