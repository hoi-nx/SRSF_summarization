the number of mortgages being approved to home buyers is increasing as borrowers take advantage of the ultra-low rates on offer , according to a high street banking report
some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in february with a collective value of Â£ 6.2billion , marking a 2 per cent increase on the previous month , the bankers ' association ( bankers ' association ) said
while the number of house purchase approvals is still 20 per cent lower than a year ago , early 2015 is seeing a higher demand for mortgages than the levels seen towards the end of last year , the bankers ' association said
some 37,305 mortgages were approved for house purchase in february with a collective value of Â£ 6.2billion meanwhile , in further signs of growing consumer confidence , the annual growth in people 's borrowing on personal loans , overdrafts and credit cards is continuing to increase at its fastest rate since 2008 , at 4.4 per cent
the bankers ' association also said that deposit levels with high street banks saw slow growth in february , which could be partly due to the popularity of the government 's recently - launched , market - beating ' pensioner bonds '
richard woolhouse , chief economist at the bankers ' association , said : ' the increase in mortgage approvals is welcome news and a sign that the housing market is beginning to improve
the bankers ' association ( bba ) have said the increase is ' welcome news ' ' personal deposits grew very slowly as alternative savings vehicles remain attractive , particularly the new pensioner bond
' howard archer , chief british and european economist at ihs global insight , said the bankers ' association 's mortgage figures reinforce his belief ' that the housing market is now gradually turning around after weakening during much of 2014 '
