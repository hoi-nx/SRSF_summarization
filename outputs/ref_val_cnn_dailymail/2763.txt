marnock 's father , stefan marnock , 41 , described his anguish as he tried in vain to get to the boy after the tree destroyed the home at the patch , in the dandenong ranges east of melbourne , just after 9pm
' the extent of the damage meant mr marnock and rescue workers could n't access marnock 's bedroom until after midnight
mr marnock said it was a nap in the car that saved the life of marnock 's five - year - old sister nicola â who was n't tired and was on the couch watching tv instead of sleeping in the bedroom she shared with her little brother

father stefan marnock , 41 , sister nicola , five , and marnock emergency services minister jane garrett said it was the council 's responsibility to make sure trees located near houses were safe , amid reports neighbours had complained about the size of the tree ' we were able to get across over the debris to where nicola was pinned , fortunately the angle of how things had gone down it did n't crush her upper chest or head , ' she said
' mr marnock said nicola was a ' little trooper ' throughout the terrifying ordeal
' she got stressed out at times and she was a little bit concerned as to where marnock was - she knew she could n't see their bedroom door
mr marnock 's 13 - year - old son jesse , who was in a hallway when the tree came down and was not injured , ran up the street to get help from neighbours before the emergency services arrived
ms surridge said marnock 's death was going to hit his brothers and sisters hard , and she was struggling to come to terms with the tragedy ms surridge 's parents john and sue surridge were at the rear of the property , where they lived in the back part of the dual dwelling
mr surridge was trapped in a room for two hours before rescue workers got him out ' he was absolutely amazing - he was able to go up into the back section of house where grandma sue was and was able to vocally communicate with john because we had no visual , ' mr marnock said
mr marnock 's 11 - year - old son blake was staying at his mother 's house
' mr marnock said he was devastated by the loss of his ' cheeky ' little boy
' he was my little dude , he was the definition of a little boy , ' he said
