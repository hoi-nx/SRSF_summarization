latest developments : full story : saudi arabia has launched military operations in neighboring yemen , where for months houthi rebels have intensified their violent campaign against the government , the saudi arabia ambassador to the u.s. told reporters in washington on wednesday
yemen , a longtime stronghold for one of al qaeda 's most dangerous branches , has been plunged into chaos since the houthi rebels began seizing control of the capital and other areas of the country in recent months
the unrest has led to the withdrawal of u.s. special forces from yemen , seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts there
" having yemen fail can not be option for us or for our coalition partners
" the saudi arabia move will unite all the people of yemen against the saudi arabia and the kingdom will pay the price
a senior arab diplomat told cnn that the gcc soon will issue a statement that the yemen have asked for military assistance and the gcc is prepared to step in
arab and senior administration officials from the u.s. told cnn that an interagency u.s. coordination team is in saudi arabia
the sources said the saudi arabia have not specified what they want yet , but will likely ask for u.s. air support , satellite imagery , and other intelligence
yemen , which has been in turmoil for months , shares a border with southern saudi arabia
" we hope that the wisdom will prevail among the houthi and they will become part of the political process rather than continue radical approach to try to take over yemen and destroy it , " al-jubeir said
the rebels late wednesday morning captured al-anad air base , an installation that the last yemen - based contingent of u.s. special operations forces evacuated over the weekend because of the deteriorating security situation in the country , said abdulsalam , a spokesman for the houthi rebels
the rebel forces -- houthi and some allies in the yemen military -- then advanced on aden , the nearby port city where president hadi had taken refuge for weeks
but one houthi spokesman , albukhaiti , said hadi left aden on a boat with a saudi arabia diplomatic team as the rebels approached the port city
albukhaiti told cnn that hadi went to riyadh , saudi arabia
but a saudi arabia source told cnn 's nic robertson that the president was still in yemen in the early hours thursday
the rebels ' advance illustrated the growing power the houthi have enjoyed since taking over sanaa in january , and illustrated a further collapse of a government that had been a key u.s. ally in the fight against then yemen - based aqap
for years , yemen had allowed u.s. drones and special operations forces to stalk aqap in the country
underscoring rebels ' increasing strength , houthi - commanded yemen air force jets on wednesday dropped bombs on or fired missiles at the presidential palace in aden for the third time in a week , causing minimal damage and injuring no one , two hadi aides said
some of the forces aligned with the houthi also are loyal to hadi 's predecessor , former president ali abdullah saleh , who resigned in 2012 after months of " arab spring " protests inspired in part by a 2011 revolution in egypt
by last week , opposing yemen military forces -- those loyal to the houthi , and those answering to hadi -- battled in aden , with hadi 's forces temporarily pushing out the rebels on march 19 after at least 13 people were killed
