gunmen killed 19 people and sent tourists scrambling for cover in a siege at a museum in tunisia 's capital on wednesday
the north africa nation 's prime minister called it a cowardly terrorist attack and warned that three suspects were still on the loose
tunisia security forces killed two attackers as they ended the hostage siege at the bardo museum in tunis , prime minister essid said
but the death toll , which included 17 tourists and at least one tunisia security officer , could climb
polish , italian , german and spanish tourists were among those killed , essid said , with another 20 foreign tourists and two tunisia wounded in the attack
" it 's a cowardly attack mainly targeting the economy of tunisia , " the prime minister said
" the scene played out at a popular tourist destination in the heart of tunisia 's capital in a building linked to where the nation 's parliament meets
interior ministry spokesman mohamed ali aroui called them islamists in remarks on national radio
the museum , housed in a 19th century palace , bills itself as " a jewel of tunisia heritage
" its exhibits showcase tunisia art , culture and history , and it boasts a collection of mosaics , including one of the poet virgil , as well as marble sculptures , furniture , jewels and other items
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack
but it happened just days after a tunisia jihadist tweeted that a pledge of allegiance to isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was coming soon , according to the site intelligence group
in his message , the jihadi claimed to belong to jund al-khilafah in tunisia , a group that in december pledged allegiance to isis , even though that vow did n't seem to have fully registered with the islamist extremist group
his post comes after an isis fighter in raqqa , syria , recently appeared in a video questioning why jihadis in tunisia had not pledged fealty
" this raises the possibility that the museum attack could be isis ' debut on the tunisia stage , timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from tunisia jihadis for maximum impact , " cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank said
tunisia has seen far less militant violence than other nations in the region that were part of the arab spring uprisings , like neighboring libya
and in february , the country 's interior ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists and published a video allegedly showing that the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi
" ... its economy is struggling and its polity is fragile ; but tunisia 's pragmatism and moderation have nurtured hope in a wretched region and a troubled world
but analysts say wednesday 's attack could have been carried out by people who care more about fomenting terror or establishing a strict islamists caliphate -- isis ' aim -- than tunisia politics
