how do gop try to breathe new life into an old scandal ? we 've seen it time and time again
here 's how it works : step one : republicans , with nothing in their arsenal to use against hillary clinton , selectively leak to reporters a " scandalous " tidbit -- often one that has been previously reported
this is exactly how the latest media hype , this time over hillary clinton 's use of emails at the state department , has played out
the new york times story about hillary clinton 's use of a private email account at the state department is a perfect example of " gotcha " journalism , where reporters will take any bait the gop give them without proper vetting
( whitewater , anyone ? ) the new york times story suggests secretary hillary clinton broke federal rules in relation to her email
but the new york times ' main source for this allegation says hillary clinton violated no laws
yes , hillary clinton used a private email account to communicate while she was secretary of state
hillary clinton asks state department to release emails : what you need to know in october 2014 , 18 months after hillary clinton left , the state department was engaged in the process of updating its records preservation policies
hillary clinton responded to the state department 's request for emails , providing the department with over 55,000 pages of emails
hillary clinton has been fully transparent and has asked the state department for these emails to be made public
