biden made yet another of his trademark gaffes today as he met northern ireland 's prime minister to mark st patrick 's day - then suggested one side of its sectarian divide was unwelcome in washington
sporting a green tie and noticing that everyone else was also wearing one , or clad in green , he suddenly blurted : ' anyone wearing orange is not welcome in here
' the purported joke was a reference to irish 's religious and political divide which was at the heart of the troubles , the violence which killed 3,000 from the late 1960s until the start of the millennium
orange is the color associated with the protestant majority in northern ireland , and overcoming sectarian tensions has been a major part of the effort to bring peace to the once - deeply troubled province
enda kenny , the irish prime minister â whose official title is taoiseach â and his wife enda kenny , the guests of honour , both laughed nervously
the vice president made a joke about sectarianism and got her name wrong i 'm with ... : vice president biden points at shamrock worn in his breast pocket to mark st patrick 's day after a brief pause , mr biden declared : ' only joking
the vice pesident made no further reference to his blurted - out bad joke , but at one point in his breakfast remarks appeared to refer to the taoiseach 's wife as ' fiona ' , although he subsequently corrected it to fionnuala
' when northern ireland is making such an effort to make st patrick 's day an inclusive celebration , biden 's comments were disgraceful and careless , ' he added
biden 's mother , finnegan , was of irish origin
the vice president made another minor blunder later when he read a quote from a yeats poem he described as ' easter sunday ' , when the word sunday is not in the title
' laughing : despite the gaffe , irish prime minister enda kenny laughed with mr biden mr biden also revealed that he had a stammer as a child
' mr biden has a long list of previous gaffes â he once asked a wheelchair - bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge the crowd 's applause , and after being chosen as vice president he even suggested that hillary clinton would have been a better choice
five years ago , biden incorrectly suggested at a st patrick 's day reception that the mother of then irish prime minister brian cowen was dead , saying ' god rest her soul ' , before correcting himself to say ' god bless her soul '
at today 's washington event the taoiseach presented the vice president with a book of yeats ' poetry , but told him he should not open it for at least another 25 years , ' when you are old and grey and nodding by the fire
