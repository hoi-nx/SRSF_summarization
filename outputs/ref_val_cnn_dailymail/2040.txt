lurking off the coast of scotland are swarms of stunning jellyfish - from the common moon to the rare purple striped stinger and the tiny neoturris pileata
and divers matt doggett and richard shucksmith have captured these floating beauties in exquisite detail
the images include a number of bright and colourful jellyfish that are rarely spotted so close to the uk , as well as so - called sea squirts which have been seen in abundance in recent years
the colourful mauve stingers ( pictured ) have tentacles that can grow around 13ft - long ( four metre ) and these eight tentacles are dangerous for unprotected divers.the species is also known as pelagia noctiluca which means ' open ocean night light ' in latin the images are from a collection called earth in focus and were captured off the coast of scotland around the outlying islands of north rona and sula sgeir , some 85 miles ( 136km ) west of stromness , as well as in loch duich
the divers said the further they headed offshore , the more bizarre and rare these lifeforms became and mr matt doggett , 36 from southampton , said a particular highlight was the mauve stinger

they can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges , like a lion 's mane , which gives the species its name
they are typically found in the waters of the arctic , atlantic and northern pacific the images were taken by divers matt doggett and richard shucksmith off the coast of scotland around the outlying islands of north rona and sula sgeir , some 85 miles ( 136km ) west of stromness , and in loch duich
the divers captured various species of jellyfish including so - called mild stingers that grow around 4 inches ( 10cm ) in diameter
' it was interesting to see young fish taking shelter in the tentacles of the lion 's mane and mauve stinger jellies which they use to stay safe from predators

they can vary in colour depending on their size - larger jellies are typically bright red to dark purple while smaller ones are lighter yellows and oranges , like a lion 's mane , which gives the species its name
like other jellies , the lion 's mane jellyfish reproduces asexually until it reaches full maturity at which point it reproduces sexually
while diving in loch duich mr matt doggett spotted a swarm of harmless moon jellyfish ( shown )
moon jellyfish are also known as aurelia aurita and grow up to 40cm ( 15.7 inches ) in diameter

moon jellyfish are also known as aurelia aurita or saucer jellies and grow up to 40cm ( 15.7 inches ) in diameter
if the weather gods are on your side and the opportunity exists , these sites will have any diver in awe of the beauty within our seas ' mr matt doggett said : ' the million moon jellies in loch duich were incredible and we returned the following day to photograph them and swim amongst them
' the photographers also captured images of sea squirts , a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor
in addition to the common bell - shaped jellies , smaller species include what 's known as comb jellies or ctenophores ( pictured )
there are eight rows of combs that act like oars to help them swim the photographers also captured images of sea squirts ( pictured ) , a type of filter feeder that lives on the ocean floor
