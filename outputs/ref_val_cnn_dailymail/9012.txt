now a new gadget will allow homeowners to flip their lights on and off using their mobile phone , without having to change all their current light fittings and switches
engineers have developed a device that attaches on top of traditional light switches to enable them to be turned on and off from anywhere in the home
switchmate can be controlled using a mobile phone app over bluetooth and uses a physical toggle inside the device to move the light switch
this information is then beamed via bluetooth to the user âs mobile phone or computer , where it is â translated â into an image of a summer âs day in the country
according to peng , co-founder of california - based switchmate , the device works like a robotic finger for the lights in your home
the app can be used to set timers so the lights come on at prearranged times or proximity so lights turn on when you walk into a room with your phone
mr peng said : ' switchmate allows you to remotely control your lights via your smart phone , but you can still press the button on the switchmate face plate to manually flip the switch
this means that should their mobile phone run out of batteries or they are unable to connect to the device , they can still turn their lights on and off
the battery powered switchmate uses a physical toggle inside the device to flip traditional wall mounted light switches ( shown above ) - working like a robotic finger than can be controlled using a mobile phone app this means residents can turn their lights on and often while even while they are abroad on holiday
it also can not currently be used to control lights that use dimmer switches
switchmate can be used with two different switch types - toggle switches ( left ) and rocker switches ( right ) the developers say switchmate will be available in three different colours - gold , silver and white ( all above ) the device ( shown above ) can still be used like a traditional light switch by pressing the button in the middle mr peng said they are hoping to develop new features in the coming months
he said : ' we designed switchmate to make your lights smart in seconds - it snaps onto your existing light switch with magnets , connects to your phone , and allows you to automate your lights just like that
