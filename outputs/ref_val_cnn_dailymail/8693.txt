reverend giles goddard , vicar of st john âs in london , held an ' inclusive mosque ' event during which a full muslims service was hosted inside his church ( pictured , painting a cross on the church for ash wednesday ) it is thought to be the first time an entire islamic service has been held by the church of england and has sparked criticism from evangelical clerics
orthodox clergyman said the event was against canon law , which prohibits any divergence from the official liturgy
mr giles goddard said he was simply offering the muslims a place to pray , adding that the religions share ' the same god ' ( pictured , st john 's ) he added : â it is very much about st john âs being a place of welcome
we understand god as a generous god , a god who celebrates love and celebrates life
â at the end of the service , the vicar read a section of psalm 139 and said : â this is from the hebrew scripture â we all share these great traditions , so let us celebrate our shared traditions , by giving thanks to the god that we love , allah
â rev stephen kuhrt , vicar of christ church , new malden , said : â i am appalled by islamophobia and when people whip up anti-muslim frenzy , but the vicar of waterloo has done something that is completely illegal , which is to allow an islamic service to be held in his church , and then he has participated as well
rev robin weekes , the minister of wimbledon âs emmanuel church , said : â the issue is not primarily that canon law has been broken , which it has , but that it is offensive to christians who believe that there is only one god
