two ' petite ' firearms officers who won a sex discrimination case over the size of their big guns have spoken out against the ' malicious ' police force amid claims they are being ' starved ' back to work
victoria wheatley and rachael giles won their sex discrimination case against the civil nuclear constabulary on the grounds they could not reach the trigger at a hearing in february last year
but now both women believe their careers are over , a remedy hearing at central london employment tribunal heard today
ms victoria wheatley branded the organisation 's attitude towards her as ' disgraceful ' while ms giles claimed the case had brought her ' a great deal of stress and anxiety ' , adding : ' they are making me choose between my mental health and paying the bills
' bullied : firearms officer rachael giles , who sued the british civil nuclear constabulary ( cnc ) after claiming her firearm was too big for her small hand , says she has been bullied by the ' malicious ' force both women , in their 30s , are still employed by the constabulary but are on sick leave due to stress on pensionable pay - resulting in them not getting full pay
they had returned to work after winning their case last year but miss victoria wheatley complained they only did ' menial ' jobs which was ' completely belittling and humiliating
in going though the series of complaints made by the women today , john cavanagh qc , representing the cnc , noted that miss giles felt the force 's treatment of her has been ' malicious and unpleasant '
miss rachael giles , who was diagnosed with depression in february 2014 , claimed : ' i believe that my career with the constabulary is at an end
