drivers are to get ten minutes extra time after a parking ticket runs out before they can be hit with a fine
under a change in the law to take effect within weeks , they will have the right to a â grace period â in all on - street or off - street council parking places
for decades , drivers have complained of returning to their cars moments after a ticket expires to find a prowling warden has already hit them with a penalty
the new rules will apply to cars parked in a pay - and - display bays or other spaces with time limits
cctv camera cars that automatically issue parking fines are to be made illegal , except near schools , in bus lanes and on red routes
writing for mailonline , government and communities secretary eric pickles and transport secretary patrick mcloughlin said â war on the motorist must end â
â very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from ten minute â grace periods â for council - controlled parking , whether it âs on or off - street , paid or free
we âre also ending the industrial use of cctv spy cars to enforce on - street parking
â local government and communities secretary eric pickles ( left ) and transport secretary patrick mcloughlin ( right ) have vowed to end the ' war on the motorist ' with their new ' common sense ' approach a new deregulation bill , due to pass through the house of lords next week and come into force next month , will enforce the ban on cctv being used to issue automated fines , except in high - risk areas
the new rules are aimed at curbing draconian parking fines used by town halls to raise extra cash from motorists
without reform , the amount of money collected in parking charges and fines will soon hit Â£ 650million a year
critics say concerns about parking fines are prompting many motorists to shun high streets for out - of - town complexes
the government is also promising new restrictions against heavy - handed action by bailiffs chasing fines , and clearer rules to prevent penalties being issued at out - of - order parking meters when there is no alternative way to pay
mr eric pickles added : â we are ending the war on drivers who simply want to go about their daily business
for too long parking rules have made law - abiding motorists feel like criminals , and caused enormous damage to shops and businesses
the new rules will apply to cars parked in a pay - and - display bays or free spaces with time limits ( file picture ) ' over-zealous parking enforcement undermines our town centres and costs councils more in the long term
mr eric pickles and mr patrick mcloughlin claimed the last labour government had made life â unbearable for those behind the wheel as town halls failed to recognise the countless benefits that cars bring â
by eric pickles and patrick mcloughlin controversial cctv camera cars that automatically issue fines are to be made illegal too , the minister have said in the history of human invention , there âs nothing that matches the car
but years of crazy parking rules have made many law - abiding shoppers and drivers feel like criminals , and caused enormous damage to local shops and businesses
in 2010 we said this war on the motorist must end
and all these parking rules were changed without proper debate by parliament
very soon shoppers and drivers will also benefit from 10 minute â grace periods â for council - controlled parking , whether it âs on or off - street , paid or free
we âre also ending the industrial use of cctv â spy cars â to enforce on - street parking
the new rules will end the plague of parking tickets in the post , but ensure public safety as cctv will still be used to protect schools , bus lanes and red routes
and in another victory for common sense parking at an out - of - order meter will not result in a fine if there is no other way to pay
