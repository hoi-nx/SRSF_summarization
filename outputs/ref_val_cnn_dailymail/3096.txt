an abandoned three - year - old girl from india who was refused by many couples seeking to adopt because she did n't have a nose has finally found a new home
kristen , 44 , from cincinnati , adopted little durga after a number of couples refused her because insects had eaten away her nose when she was abandoned at birth
but durga has now started a new life in ohio , with her eight - year - old sister munni , who kristen also adopted from india in 2012
kristen , a teacher from ohio , adopted little durga who was abandoned at work causing her nose to be eaten by insects kristen said : â i look at my girls and i âm so happy
â kristen , who is still single having never met the right man , started her adoption journey in nepal , in 2010
so kristen was introduced to india and very quickly came across little munni who had been in an orphanage since 2009
â durga was abandoned at birth , since then many parents have rejected her because of her deformity kristen says that she has taken some time off work so that she can help both durga and munni settle in to their new homes over the next two years kristen was put through paper work and court processes in order to adopt munni , but she never gave up
â i knew i wanted munni in my life so i did everything in my power to make it happen , â she added
â eventually in december 2012 kristen met munni for the first time
kristen came to know that munni had a scar on her forehead in the shape of a horseshoe but no one could tell her how it got there
munni was quiet and withdrawn but kristen felt nothing but love for her
and on 14 february , 2013 , kristen finally became munni âs adopted mother
and i knew i wanted to adopt a little sister or brother for munni
â kristen , who works as a secondary school teacher in loveland , told her adoption agency as soon as she arrived that that she wanted to adopt again
kristen proudly shows off her girls munni and durga having adopted both of the little girls from india the adoption process relies heavily on agencies and its caseworkers matching prospective parents with children
and it was kristen âs caseworker that told her about durga
she had been abandoned in a bush at birth and insects or animals had eaten away her nose
she said yes immediately and knew that durga would be happy with her and munni , â i remember that munni and i were driving home from the part one day and my case worker called saying : " we have a little girl for you and you âd be a perfect family for her " , and i told her to send her information over immediately , â kristen remembered
as soon as kristen and munni walked through the door they logged on to the computer and durga âs face smiled back at them
â munni is a proud big sister to durga , both little girls were adopted from india but now live in ohio with their mother , kristen the adoption process meant durga was then locked to kristen and no other prospective parent could meet her
we tried our best to take good care of her and we used to feed her with cotton balls soaked in milk
â there have been only six children at the centre and more than 25 families are waiting to adopt a baby but none of them wanted to adopt durga
kristen has assured us durga will be happy and she said she will bring her back to meet us when she âs older
â kristen has now taken eight months off work to spend time helping durga settle into her new home
she said her parents , her older sister who has four children , and brother in law , have been a big support and having embraced both munni and durga as members of the family
kristen has also been to see surgeons in ohio to discuss durga âs nose and when she âs older - at around seven - she will be able to start the process of having a new nose
â munni is over the moon with her little sister , â kristen added
