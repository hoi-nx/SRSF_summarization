beijing chinese has linked violence in its far - western muslim region of xinjiang to isis and says chinese nationals have fought for the extremist group
the communist party chief of xinjiang -- the region 's top official -- told reporters tuesday to view mounting violence there in the context of a global jihadist movement , especially with the rise of isis -- also known as the islamic state or is
" some extremists in xinjiang have participated in the is and i think this further proves that intentional extremist forces can not be ignored , " said zhang on the sidelines of the annual session of chinese 's rubber - stamp parliament
" a spate of violent attacks in xinjiang -- a resource - rich area long inhabited by the turkic - speaking uyghurs -- has killed hundreds of people in the past two years
chinese 's state media had earlier reported on muslim uyghur militants trying to flee the country and join isis training camps in preparation for attacks back home
" exiled uyghur activists have long disputed the chinese government 's assertions , pointing to the lack of evidence and accusing the authorities of using the alleged isis connection to justify their increasingly harsh rule in the region
