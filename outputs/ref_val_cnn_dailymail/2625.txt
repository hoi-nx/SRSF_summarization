the biggest impression elliott had made on world cricket came when he was barged by ryan sidebottom during a one - day international at the oval seven years ago and was unwittingly caught in the middle of a major row between england and new zealand
elliott , a little known all - rounder born in south africa but a naturalised kiwi , played one of the great one - day innings on tuesday for his adopted country against the nation of his birth to take new zealand to their first world cup final
elliott celebrates hitting a six against south africa to put new zealand through to the world cup final daniel vettori embraces elliott while bowler steyn lays on the ground after the crucial blow elliott , 36 , powered his way to what would be a match - winning unbeaten 84 in the new zealand chase what a day for new zealand and what a day for 36 - year - old elliott , who had not played international cricket for 14 months when he became one of coach mike hesson âs inspired choices for this world cup
elliott beams as he meets the press after the match elliott will surely never play another innings like his unbeaten 84 which earned new zealand the most nerve - racking of victories with just a ball to spare against a south african team who fell short when it most mattered yet again
then elliott talked of how much this means for a country who will now take on either australia or india in the final on sunday after falling short in no fewer than six previous world cup semi-finals
â this was glorious vindication for the attacking , modern brand of one - day cricket that new zealand have been producing under their impressive captain brendon mccullum with players who have not always been regarded as dynamic
elliott goes for broke on the penultimate ball of the match and his sweet strike soars into the stands steyn , for many the world 's best fast bowler , stands with his hands on his knees as elliott celebrates elliott shakes hands and consoles steyn as the conclusion of the match at auckland 's eden park the batsman sparked memories of andrew flintoff 's sportsmanship with brett lee in the 2007 ashes elliott has never been seen as the epitome of modern 50 - over power and nor has martin guptill , who came of age as a limited - overs batsman with his double century in the quarter - final against west indies
before his semi-final heroics , elliott was best known for his collision with ryan sidebottom in 2008 then captain paul collingwood apologised for upholding the appeal that saw elliott run out after the clash this was heartbreaking for south africa , who did little to shake off their reputation as perennial chokers on the big occasion
