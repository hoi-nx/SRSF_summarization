ikea has banned people from playing hide and seek in its stores after several facebook - organised games amassed tens of thousands of participants
the bizarrely popular events were inspired by the success of a game held in a belgium store last year in which 500 adults participated and were discovered hiding in fridges , cupboards and underneath piles of soft toys
more than 32,000 people were planning to play a game of hide and seek at an ikea store in eindhoven next month , forcing management to ban the game
the idea of using an ikea store for an adult game of hide and seek has been mooted for years , given the furniture stores ' abundance of adult - sized hiding places
