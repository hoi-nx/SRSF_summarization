iraqis forces and shiite militias are taking part in clearing operations
iraqis forces reached the center of tikrit and hoisted the nation 's flag on top of the governorate building , al-abadi said
tikrit had been under isis control since june
the push into tikrit comes days after a series of u.s. - led airstrikes targeted isis targets around the city
" the success of the tikrit experiment will be repeated in other areas because of the results it has achieved on the battlefield , on a humanitarian level , protecting civilians as much as possible , in addition to the low casualties amongst our security forces , " he said
iraqis forces have tried multiple times to win back tikrit since isis conquered the city as part of its campaign to amass an expansive islamic caliphate but failed until now
" we managed to take ( isis ) by surprise , " the prime minister said
" and our air force ... in addition to coalition air force , helping iraqis forces , managed to deal severe blows to isis and the enemies of iraqis
the victory in tikrit sets the stage for iraqis forces to take back an even bigger prize : mosul
