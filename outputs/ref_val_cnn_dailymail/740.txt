it is one of cambodia 's most popular tourist cities , where visitors flock to visit the nearby ruined temples of the angkor region
but while foreign visitors stay in luxury hotels and splash out of escorted trips to discover the delights of 12th - century temple angkor wat , families work in a rubbish dump just 18.6 miles away for a meager Â£ 1 a day
she has worked at the site for a year and has seen many tour groups passing through the landfill site to photograph what they see a japanese tourist covers her mouth with her hands due to the strong smell caused by the mountains of toxic waste and decaying food the desperate photos showing the hard life of adults and children living and working at the site were taken by spanish filmmaker david rengel , who visited the area to document child labour conditions in the country
but the director was further shocked when he saw groups of tourists visiting the rubbish site to see the locals at work , take photos of the children and hand out sweets
anlong pi is a huge wasteland , just outside the popular tourist hub of siem reap
workers are the extensive rubbish dump breathe toxic fumes on a daily basis as they work and live at the site
he does not understand why tourists visit the garbage dump where he works , but he likes the sweets that tourists give him in recent years , the huge increase in siem reap 's population - in part to deal with the influx of tourists - has caused an exponential increase in the amount of rubbish taken to the dump site - causing even worse conditions for workers
local organisations have also noticed an increase in the number of tourists visiting to site out of curiosity , to photograph the poverty - stricken locals working to sort the rubbish
david rengel explained : ' i went to siem reap , where my colleague and friend omar havana , a freelance photographer for getty images , had been developing a project over various years
' while i was taking photos to demonstrate the realities of child labour , i realised tourists were arriving to visit , sometimes in buses and other times in tuk - tuks , cambodia taxis , i thought it was horrible , and it should be reported
' in that moment , i changed my point of view and instead decided to report on the practice of tourism as one of the causes of slave labour , including child labour
the landfill is located a few kilometers from siem reap , the most famous tourist destination in cambodia kon mai is 15 years old and has worked at the dump since he was 12
her mother was who took her to the garbage dump to earn money when her father abandoned them while spending time talking to the 200 or so people living at the site , more of 50 of whom are children , david rengel realised the rubbish dump was being offered as an alternative kind of tour to the usual temple visits
most children begin work in the landfill at 10 or 12 years old a truckload of waste , organic and inorganic , some toxic , reaches the dump of anlong pi , just outside siem reap sau srey neang is 11 years old
she wants to continue with her studies so she can become a teacher of the 200 or so who work at the site , there are some families that also live there , building houses just beyond the dump and the toxic fumes of the site
david rengel explained : ' the houses and hammocks you see in teh pictures are areas that have been constructed so the workers can rest during their long days at the site
' children and their parents are all landfill workers and spend 10 hours a day scavenging for rubbish and recyclable materials every day tons of organic and inorganic waste arrive in large trucks forming mountains of toxic compounds , between those mountains the inhabitants of the landfill seek recyclable materials such as glass , paper and metal with which earn money in recent years the garbage generated in siem reap has doubled and the landfill capacity has been exceeded he added : ' i spoke to the locals about whether tourist visits were a rare occurrence
