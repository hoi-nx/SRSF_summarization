if you 're a facebook user , chances your news feed is full of people 's ' timehop ' posts that show their previous photos and statuses
each day the social network will highlight posts made on the same date years before either by that user , or posts that the user was tagged in
facebook has launched ' on this day ' - a tool that highlight posts made on the same date years previously
these posts only appear on a user 's on this day page , and this page can only be viewed by that user
they then have the option to edit , delete or share these posts with their friends these posts only appear on a user 's on this day page , and this page can only be viewed by that user
the new official tool ( pictured ) is rolling out to users in stages , so not everyone will be able to see it yet on this day is similar to the timehop app that can be installed to facebook 's web and mobile site ( examples shown )
a major difference between the timehop app and facebook 's tool , though , is that timehop also collates posts made on twitter , instagram , flickr and foursquare in addition to facebook one in five instagram users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. to capitalise on this , the californian firm has launched its latest standalone app called layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations
however , once it 's available they can click on the on this day , search for ' on this day , ' or visit facebook 's dedicated on this day page
