it may sound like the plot of a disney movie - but todd the fox really does think he 's a dog
the animal was tamed after being rescued as a four - month - old cub and was raised as a domestic pet by owner emma d'sylva
he also sleeps in a kennel in his enclosure in the garden , plays energetically with the other dogs and even wags his tail when it 's feeding time
emma d'sylva , 25 , from stanfield , stoke-on-trent , staffordshire , said : ' todd has been captive - bred so he has never been in the wild
canine customs : todd enjoys going on walks , playing with dog toys and even wags his tail when he 's happy sleeps in a kennel : the 11 - month - old domesticated animal spends his nights in a plastic kennel with blankets ' i get people coming over to me asking if he is a fox and if they can stroke him
playful : the fox , pictured in the park with ms emma d'sylva , can not be let off the lead because he is deaf school visits : ms emma d'sylva has 40 pets and takes some of them , including todd , into schools and care homes so that children and the elderly can interact with them ' he tries to do what the dogs do but i ca n't let him off the lead because he 's deaf so i ca n't shout him to come back
' todd also lives with emma d'sylva 's menagerie of other creatures at her three - bedroomed house including a skunk , a raccoon , lizards and snakes
emma d'sylva , who lives with her partner steve johnson , 34 , added : ' todd went out on his first school visit the other week and the children really enjoyed stroking him while he was in my arms
walking companions : todd is pictured in the woods with ms emma d'sylva 's two labradors sky and oakley ' he 's really getting used to things now and i 'm looking forward to letting more and more people meet him
