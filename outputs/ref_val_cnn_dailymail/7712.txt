lawwell called it the â le guen hump â and for certain celtic players the chief executive âs words might be tweaked to read â taking the hump â
it âs to his credit that , with typical candour , commons admits he had teething problems with the regime change that saw deila walk into celtic intent on wholesale reform
after a difficult start , commons has now build a strong relationship with celtic manager deila the frenchman lasted barely six months at ibrox and departed in the wake of a dressing - room revolt
yet , while the likes of kris boyd and barry ferguson actively railed against le guen âs methods , the resistance to deila âs changes was more subtle
having clinched the major player of the year honours and scored 32 times last season , commons more than most was perhaps entitled to feel his game had little need for refinement
he readily admits to feeling unsettled by the changes that saw the former stromsgodset chief place a greater emphasis on fitness as he attempted to realise a high - tempo pressing game
as with most human squabbles , communication has proved the key to a solution
deila âs policy of regularly sitting down to speak individually with his players has given commons a right of reply and he has used it , returning to first - team prominence and signing a new contract last month
commons has adapted well to the manager 's demands of his players to be physically fitter than before commons is likely to start the league cup and has declared himself all in as deila bids to win his first trophy as celtic manager
â bright , articulate and possessed with a healthy sense of his own ability , commons is one of the bigger characters in the dressing room and it was always crucial that deila found a way to bring the mansfield - born attacking midfielder on side
even lennon had a rocky spell with commons during the player âs first full season at the club but the pair went on to forge a productive working relationship to the extent that the northern irishman admitted he would happily take commons off deila âs hands as he settled into his new job at bolton
commons talks with captain scott brown in training ahead of the scottish league cup final on sunday a return to the championship , where the 31 - year - old had performed comfortably and without the incessant pressure to win inherent at celtic , would have been an easier and possibly more lucrative option
â i was nât looking just to plod away through these next two or three years
i want to win a treble and play in the champions league these next couple of years
â commons admits he is â three to four kilos â lighter thanks to deila âs demands that his players cut their body fat and admits he feels fitter as a result
where lennon would borrow from the likes of martin oâneill in allowing his players to freewheel on the proviso that they delivered on matchdays , deila demands that , in his own words , his players are 24 - hour athletes
commons is desperate to win the competition , which has eluded him in his four years in scotland he may never boast a physique to rival ronaldo or gareth bale , but he has bought into the new manager âs philosophy â and regards the november win at pittodrie as a pivotal moment for the new boss
â hampden and the league cup provided commons with a glorious celtic debut yet , four years later , he is still waiting to get his hands on the trophy in celebration
commons is battling a hamstring injury but hopes to be fit in time to face dundee united on sunday having completed his Â£ 300,000 move from derby county a day earlier , commons took just eight minutes to rifle home his first celtic goal in the 2011 semi-final against aberdeen
a year later and caught in a personal form slump , he was a substitute and restricted to the final four minutes as celtic unsuccessfully tried to equalise dieter van tornhout âs shock winning goal for kilmarnock
a hamstring injury has dogged commons since he penned his new deal last month but he âs trained this week and , with gary mackay-steven and stuart armstrong cup - tied , he looks a good bet to claim one of three attacking midfield slots in deila âs team to face dundee united
â i feel fine and i âm looking forward to playing â if selected , â said commons
â i think scott brown is the only member of the squad who has won it
