karl asked the team of india supporters : ' who âs going to be manning 7 - elevens today ? ' ' i 'm not sure about who 's going to be manning 7 - elevens but you might have to look at centrelink as well i think , karl , ' one of the fans hilariously retorted , owning the presenter with their response
' look i 'm not sure we can repeat that stuff on tv this early in the morning , ' the india fan smiled
one of the india fans ( right ) fired back telling karl he should be concerned as centrelink will be empty of australians as they all watch the cricket viewers quickly reacted to karl 's 7-eleven question on social media , calling it ' inappropriate and offensive ' andy cussen asked : ' how does karl still have a job ? complete muppet
and paul nolan said : ' i 'm usually a fan of karl but his 7 - 11 quip today was inappropriate and offensive
