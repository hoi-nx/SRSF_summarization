experts have abandoned an eight - day vigil for a wakeup call from the robot lander philae , but remained hopeful the scout will revive as it rides on a comet nearing the sun monitoring for the lander , which has been hibernating since november , will resume next month , the mission said
' perhaps it is still too cold for the philae lander to wake up on comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko , ' the dlr ( dlr ) said in a blog posted by the european space agency ( european space agency )
european space agency scientists have renewed efforts to contact the philae lander on comet 67p , shown in the illustration above the rosetta probe , which was carrying philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre ( 40 inches ) per second relative to the comet
the hope is that as the comet races towards the sun , more light will bathe the probe 's solar panels , enabling it to power up again and resume work
its mother ship rosetta sent down philae on november 12 after a 10 - year trek around the solar system
but there was only silence , and at 0400 gmt on friday , rosetta 's communication unit was switched off , the european space agency blog said
' engineers saw an early chance in march when comet and lander were about 300 million kilometers ( 187 million miles ) from the sun , and the amount of solar radiation had nearly doubled compared to november
the rosetta orbiter took a number of images of philae as it bounced , with its final suspected resting place in the top right
however , further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe philae touched down on 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko on 12 november , but rather than landing softly , the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice
the duck - shaped comet 67p/churyumove-geraismenko is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does this image sent back by the philae lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the mothership rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe
philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an overhanging cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander
this graphic shows how philae bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life
but there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander 's solar panels
the image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the rosetta probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the philea lander comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in august this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander
it will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up
once awake , philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the rosetta orbiter
koen guerts , part of the philae lander team at the dlr control centre , said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home
he said : ' philae is designed so that , since november 2014 , it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up
' ' at this time , we do not yet know that the lander is awake.to send us an answer , philae must also turn its transmitter â and that requires additional power
' this blurry image captures the moment philae bounced from the comet 's surface after failing to anchor itself rosetta captured a mothership 's view of philae as it descended to the surface of comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko on 12 november 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two - way communication
currently , scientists believe that philae is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys
