the mackintosh building was damaged last year after a blaze sparked when canned spray foam , which a student was using for an art project , drifted into a projector fan and caught alight
the building is considered by critics as charles rennie mackintosh 's finest work firefighters were able to save irreplaceable paintings and furniture by charles rennie mackintosh after curators showed them pictures and and told them where they could be found a student had been using highly flammable canned spray foam to fill in the gaps in a piece which involved three large sheets of thick foam , which formed three ' walls ' framing a fourth blank wall , onto which a digital projector was beaming images when the spraying took place
as the fumes from the spray foam spread around the room , they were sucked into the cooling fan of the projector and caught alight as they wafted over the heat of the circuit board
