families crossing the channel by eurotunnel or ferry face easter misery after ministers insisted on introducing new exit checks during one of the busiest getaways of the year
under the new rules , the passport of every passenger in a car or coach will have to be individually scanned
ministers insist that knowing who is leaving the country is vital for counting the number of immigrants in britain and fighting crime and terrorism
nightmare journeys : p&o ferries has claimed new border control rules will cause huge delays leaving the country with ' coachloads of little old ladies bearing the brunt ' but even though no checks have taken place over the past 17 years , the home office decided the best date to reinstate them should be on the second week in april â when vast numbers of britain head to the continent during the easter school break
mps on the home affairs select committee were sent a letter from the britain chamber of shipping claiming trials had shown that queues of at least 650 vehicles would form on busy days
â eurotunnel calculates the new system will quadruple the time taken to get vehicles onto shuttle trains
buses with 30 or more passengers on board will take even longer
eurotunnel public affairs director john keefe said : â you only have to multiply the number of people in each vehicle â five six or seven in a car or 30 or more in a coach â to see how this will play out
protective measures : the checks start on april 8 and eurotunnel and ferry companies will be checking the passports of all those leaving the country to tighten national security â that increases the risk of congestion and delays
â advice : immigration minister james brokenshire told the today programme that people should set out on their journeys earlier to avoid delays ministers were last night under pressure from mps to make exceptions to the rules , such as large coach parties
â he denied there would be chaos , insisting : â there are often queues at both eurotunnel and also dover in terms of their day - to - day operations
