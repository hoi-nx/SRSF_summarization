labour leader murphy said he would use cash raised in england to fund a spending splurge north of the border labour murphy has threatened a new Â£ 1billion tax raid on england to fund a fresh spending splurge north of the border
mr murphy said labour would hit bankers with a new â bonus tax â and slash the amount wealthy savers could pay into their pensions tax free
he said labour would use this cash , almost entirely raised in england , for a range of giveaways in scotland
mr murphy said he would introduce a â jobs guarantee â , which mr murphy says will end long - term youth unemployment
the Â£ 1billion package includes a Â£ 1,000 increase in bursaries for scotland students , a â future fund â worth Â£ 1,600 for every 18 and 19 - year - old in work and free university tuition
' mr murphy added : â while the living standards of those retiring now are greater than previous pensioners , young people 's living standards have stagnated compared to their older siblings and parents
â murphy said the snp could not match labour 's spending pledge because they wanted to break away from the uk on the jobs guarantee , mr murphy said : â we will use a new tax on the bonuses of bankers here in the city of london and in the uk 's other financial centres
â snp work and pensions spokeswoman dr eilidh whiteford said : â given that murphy has voted in favour of tuition fees at every turn , scotland 's young people wo n't fall for his empty attempts to buy their vote
â if mr murphy really wanted to invest in scotland 's young people , he would dump this ludicrous policy in favour of nuclear weapons and back the snp in spending the money on education , childcare and health
