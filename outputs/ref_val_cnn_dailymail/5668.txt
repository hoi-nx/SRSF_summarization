republican leaders are warning other countries to ' proceed with caution ' in negotiations with the obama administration because any deal could be later undone the white house 's tuesday announcement that the u.s. would cut greenhouse gas emissions by close to 28 percent from 2005 levels within a decade builds on a promise obama made last november in beijing in concert with chinese president xi jinping
' we can achieve this goal using laws that are already on the books , and it will be in place by the time the president leaves office , ' brian deese , a senior adviser to the president , said according to the new york times
obama has just two years remaining in office , but many of the senate 's republican lawmakers who oppose the initiative will remain in positions of power long after the current president has moved on
' considering that two - thirds of the u.s. federal government has n't even signed off on the clean power plan and 13 states have already pledged to fight it , our international partners should proceed with caution before entering into a binding , unattainable deal , ' senate majority leader mitch mcconnell noted on tuesday
