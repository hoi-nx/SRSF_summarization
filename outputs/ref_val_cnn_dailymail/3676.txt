a sour appearance on business competition show shark tank actually ended in success for start - up founder jesse genet
but the shrewd angel investors on the show refused to bite at genet 's offer of a 5 per cent stake in her company for $ 250,000 , believing she was overestimating the worth of the business of $ 5 million
o'leary and fellow shark laurie greiner offered jesse genet an alternative deal , based on a much - lower valuation of her company , but genet refused to budge , leaving the show empty handed
shortly after taping the show , genet applied for and was accepted into y combinator , one of silicon valley 's most prestigious start - up incubators
' on tuesday , she presented her company at y combinator 's biannual y combinator , showing off a whole new line of products not shown on shark tank - including custom stamps
on the right track : in three months at y combinator , genet has doubled her sales to $ 2.5 million
