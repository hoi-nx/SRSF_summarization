kidney stones are very common â larger stones often need surgery to remove them
john cousins , 46 , a divorced father of two who lives near southampton , came up with a novel way to help surgeons during his operation , as he tells angela epstein
john cousins ( pictured ) did not realise he was suffering from kidney stones until he collapsed from an unrelated condition last november the patient my kidney stone took me by surprise â i only discovered i had one after i collapsed with an unrelated condition last november
i run a 3d printing company which makes bones out of plaster of paris for surgeons to use as practice models for complex orthopaedic operations
however , scans also revealed a large stone in my right kidney
after they removed my appendix , i began wondering whether 3d technology might be helpful with my kidney operation
i discussed it with my consultant , urological surgeon somani , suggesting that a life - size model of my kidney with the stone inside might give him accurate information about my operation
after he collapsed , john cousins ( pictured ) was taken to university hospital southampton nhs foundation trust where he was diagnosed with appendicitis and had his appendix removed he âd heard of 3d being used in orthopaedic operations such as hip replacements but , as far as he knew , it had nât been used with this kind of procedure
he agreed it might help â anything allowing a surgeon to visualise the area in more detail could only make surgery quicker and more accurate
i was nât due to have the stone removed until january this year , so , after taking two weeks off work to recover from the appendix operation , i began work on the model
the machine we use for 3d printing , known as an isodo3d , used images of my kidney from ct scans to recreate a model , slice by slice , using layers of plaster of paris half a millimetre thick
john cousins used images of his kidney from the ct scan to recreate a model , slice by slice using plaster of paris ( pictured )
this allows the surgeon to complete surgery faster and more accurately these layers were then laid on top of each other
the replica of his kidney that john cousins ( pictured ) created , allowed mr somani to work out the best angle to go into the kidney with his instruments the soreness lasted a few days , but painkillers helped , and i was back in the office within ten days
i do nât know whether that âs because of the kidney model , but i like to think so
i âm planning to make more models for mr somani â for ten patients with kidney stones and ten with cancer
kidney stones occur when waste products removed from the blood form crystals , which over time form hard stones
but larger stones can get stuck â they can be extremely painful and lead to infections
john cousins ( pictured ) is now planning to make more models for mr somani , costing Â£ 123 a piece john cousins âs was a large stone that would have been hard to pass and he needed an operation , a keyhole procedure called percutaneous nephrolithotomy
it âs quite complex surgery â there is a risk of bleeding because the kidney has such a rich blood supply
a ct scan and x-rays are taken beforehand to pinpoint the exact location of a kidney stone
but i felt having a 3d model as well would give us even more detail : i âd be able to hold the model , take it apart , see the exact location of the stone and plan the precise angle of our surgical instruments
john cousins has also created a model of a kidney with a cancerous tumour ( left )
the right - hand picture shows the model of john cousins 's own kidney stone i hope this technology soon becomes widely available
â kidney stones â especially large ones â can involve fairly complicated surgery
