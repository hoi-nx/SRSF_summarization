working and fighting i 'm no better than no other man that 's doing the same as me , ' mckenzie tells sportsmail
' just because i 've played premier league football it does not mean that i 'm too good to work
i 'm delivering 60 - odd , 70 parcels a day
that 's probably a little bit of training in itself
' the best moment of mckenzie 's football career came in april 2005 , scoring in a 2 - 0 win against a manchester united team boasting cristiano ronaldo and wayne rooney
almost 10 years on he is looking for a new accomplishment , and beating ivan stupalo in the 10 - round fight would make him the mandatory for the southern area title

' in training dad pushes me to my max , ' mckenzie continues
' i 'm used to dying in training and coming back
we 're going to win the fight , and i want to win it for my dad as well
' after training i 'll just have a little time by myself
dad says that 's normal when you just go within yourself , and have little flashbacks of life and everything else
' mckenzie ( right ) pictured during his super-middleweight win against john mason in june 2013 ' this means everything to me because since a child i always knew i was going to be something
i always used to love watching dad fight
for this to be happening , i 'm 37 this year , it is a really big deal
' just because i 've played premier league football it does not mean that i 'm too good enough to work
