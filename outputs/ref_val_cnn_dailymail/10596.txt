the police chief at the hillsborough disaster said it was ' one of the biggest regrets of my life ' he did not think of the consequences of allowing thousand of fans in to the ground after he ordered exit gates to be opened
the match commander at the game agreed to a request to open the gates to prevent crushing at the turnstiles outside the ground , the inquest in warrington heard
former chief superintendent duckenfield says hillsborough was one of biggest regrets of his life but after gate c was opened on his orders at eight minutes before kick off , an estimated 2,000 fans poured in , heading straight for a tunnel leading directly to the already - packed central pens three and four , behind the goal
the jury was told as many as an extra 800 fans went in to pen three alone after the gate was opened
ninety - six liverpool fans died following a crush on the leppings lane terrace of sheffield 's hillsborough ground as the fa cup semi-final against nottingham forest kicked off on april 15 1989
mr duckenfield said he now realised ' in hindsight ' the ' most likely ' route fans would take once gate c was open was to go down the tunnel facing them and in to the central pens
do you think as a match commander the consequences of the decision you made , and in particular thought as to where the fans might go , is something you should have considered ? ' mr duckenfield replied : ' ma'am , i think it is fair to say that is arguably one of the biggest regrets of my life , that i did not foresee where fans would go when they came in through the gates
' mr duckenfield , who has admitted he had ' limited ' experience of policing football matches compared with other senior officers , added : ' if i had been a fully competent , experienced , knowledgeable match commander of the experience of duckenfield ( brian ) mole or mr freeman , i no doubt would have thought about it , but i was not in their position
' mr duckenfield , stationed in the police control box with a bank of tv monitors of the ground , said he was ' shocked ' at the request to open the gates from superintendent marshall from outside leppings lane after police became ' overwhelmed ' by the number of fans gathered at the turnstiles
96 liverpool fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground 's perimeter fence in 1989 the witness continued : ' certainly i 'm sat there , i do n't mind telling you i was shocked and taken aback by it and thinking , ' where are these people going to go if i open the gates ? '' he said another message then came through on the police radio from mr marshall saying : ' if we do n't open the gates someone 's going to get killed
mr duckenfield added : ' i think it 's fair to say i was overcome by the enormity of the situation and the decision i had to make
' fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster before the fa cup semi-final mr duckenfield said there was ' every possibility ' that he panicked , and accepted that it was a mistake not to have taken steps to close the tunnel leading to the central pens
' after viewing cctv footage of fans on a concourse behind the leppings lane terrace , having passed through gate c , mr duckenfield went on : ' i have a view from what i have seen that quite a few of the fans were apparently standing around , waiting for friends or wondering where to go or what to do
' the jury has heard that the exit gate remained open for five minutes , allowing fans to flow into the ground
' chair of the hillsborough families for justice margaret aspinall arrives at the inquest on tuesday agreeing with miss lambert that a match commander of reasonable competence ought to have thought where the fans allowed through the gate might go , the 70 - year - old claimed to have been ' distracted ' by a radio message referring to another gate ' going in '
miss lambert suggested to the former match commander that it might be said to have been ' obvious ' that fans climbing out of the central pens might be connected to the ingress of supporters through gate c. ' it was not obvious to me ma'am , ' mr duckenfield added
