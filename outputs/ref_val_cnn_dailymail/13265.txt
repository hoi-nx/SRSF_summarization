sen. rand paul , who is expected to announce on april 7 that he will be running for the presidency , is garnering a great deal of attention as he travels around the country promoting his brand of libertarian conservatism
the kentucky senator 's widely publicized appearance this month at the south by southwest festival at austin , texas , was one opportunity he used to appeal to a tech - savvy audience
for many disaffected younger republicans , rand paul offers a version of the conservative agenda that seems foreign to the modern gop
rand paul has been a vocal critic of the neoconservative turn that the gop has embraced in recent decades , during which the party moved beyond support for high national security spending and toward a bolder vision of aggressive nation - building and regime change
for some republicans , including rand paul , these policies were at the heart of the failures of george w. bush 's presidency and a sharp departure from the party 's principles
similarly , rand paul has been one of the few gop voices to argue that post 9/11 surveillance policies have dangerously curtailed civil liberties
rand paul has also backed away from some tenets of social conservatism that do n't sit well with a growing number of gop voters
but rand paul , who has appeared to be supportive of a stringent budget , has also been willing to put forward bolder ideas , including criminal justice reform , that deal directly with the conditions that have devastated african american communities
can rand paul really win ? that is unclear
and i do not think rand paul has crossed that threshold yet
rand paul 's extremely critical remarks about key aspects of the civil rights act of 1964 will certainly come back to bite him , as will some of his blistering attacks on the federal reserve
rand paul is also trying to make the case for a libertarian conservatism that is not pure
rand paul is still a gop , so he will continue to fit his ideas within the broader agenda of the gop
while rand paul argues that he is trying to take some of the ideas that libertarians liked about his father and make them politically viable , some of his supporters smell a sellout
" but if rand paul can sell primary voters that his blend of ideas still offers something distinct from the rest of the gop candidates , at a minimum he can help reshape the debate within the gop by raising questions about some of the party 's core positions .
