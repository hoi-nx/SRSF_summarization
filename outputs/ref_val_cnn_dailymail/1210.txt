clinton used her ipad as well as a blackberry handset while she was secretary of state , despite claims she used her own private email server so she would only have to carry one electronic device
however , the state department has released four emails to the ap which appear to show mrs clinton mixing personal and professional emails as well as sending correspondence from her ipad
critics claim that mrs clinton used the personal email account so her correspondence could not be subject to the same scrutiny as someone using an authorised government account subject to the freedom of information act
on one occasion , mrs clinton 's adviser abedin at the state department emailed the secretary of state an ap story concerning a drone strike in pakistan
clinton 's spokesman nick merrill said during her time as secretary of state mrs clinton primarily used her ipad to read news clippings
during some of the emails , mrs clinton replied to official mesages with questions about personal items mrs clinton , pictured , is expected to announce her latest bid to run for president next month earlier , mrs clinton said she used her own personal account instead of a government one as it was more convenient
mrs clinton became secretary of state in 2009 - a year before the ipad was launched
however , republican trey gowdy , chairman of the house committee investigating the 2012 benghazi attacks said mrs clinton 's use of a personal email account has allowed her to ' clean ' her email server and delete correspondence to the attacks
