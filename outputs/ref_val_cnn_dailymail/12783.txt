notwithstanding the polls , the valiant efforts of the obama white house , a new unity on the israel left and a controversial term , israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's likud party appears to have swept to victory in tuesday 's israel elections
while it will likely take some time for benjamin netanyahu to form a new government , the reverberations of his victory will be felt fast in washington
u.s. president obama has made no secret of his antipathy toward benjamin netanyahu , and many believe that obama has allowed disagreements over policy to spill over into personal animosity
so what will obama do on the issues that have increasingly divided israel and the u.s. ? some believe the president will be all the more constrained in his negotiations with iran , especially now that israel has doubled down on the man who took to a joint meeting of congress to publicly excoriate obama 's hoped - for deal with the islamic republic over its nuclear weapons program
but the stronger likelihood is that the likud victory will spur the administration to even more concessions to ensure a deal between tehran and washington
this is , after all , an administration that has written off the concerns of all of iran 's neighbors ( and u.s. 's allies in the region ) over a weak agreement that would likely do little more than pave the way toward a nuclear weapons capability for the ayatollahs
the reality is that where obama might have been inclined to listen to the israel left ( which differed little with the likud over iran ) , he will find it easy to dismiss the clamoring of the israel right , never mind that it represents the will of the people of israel
in the waning days of the election , benjamin netanyahu made abbas ' job all the easier by reversing his earlier commitment to a palestinians state , suggesting there would never be one on his watch
it will be tempting to just let the palestinians have at benjamin netanyahu , and the president will likely want to do just that
