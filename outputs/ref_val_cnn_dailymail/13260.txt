hillary clinton 's lawyerly news conference tuesday , at which she doggedly parried suggestions that her use of a private email server to conduct official state department business was improper , might extinguish the matter for most u.s. -- but it does n't get clinton out of the woods politically
the real possibility of lasting political damage to the former secretary of state will come if her emails reveal any favoritism to any of the foreign donors who contributed to the welter of powerful charitable organizations housed at the clinton foundation
this is the multibillion - dollar foundation hillary clinton leads alongside ex-president clinton and their daughter , chelsea
what we already know about the foundation 's donors is controversial : some of the corporations , banks and foreign governments that have funded foundation projects have abysmal human rights records and have been involved in everything from drug money laundering to aiding terrorism in violation of u.s. law
the clintons can make a plausible case that it 's best to solicit money from companies and foreign governments -- even ethically challenged ones -- and put it to good use attacking problems of global poverty
but the argument only works if clinton 's work as secretary of state was completely separate from the foundation 's tip - toeing around ethical challenges
the foundation 's thicket of relationships with corporate donors and foreign heads of states is difficult for outsiders to penetrate and understand
" hillary clinton and clinton have put some safeguards in place to put distance between her job as secretary of state and the inner workings of the foundation
during hillary clinton 's years as secretary of state , the high - profile cgi split off from the larger clinton foundation , and clinton says he had no direct involvement in its day - to - day operations
hillary clinton also stayed away from the foundation during her time at the state department and agreed to subject possible conflicts to the department 's ethics office
in one well - publicized case , hillary clinton pressed a state - owed russian airline to buy u.s. planes from boeing
" and according to the washington post , seven nations donated millions to the foundation during clinton 's time as secretary of state , including a $ 500,000 gift from algeria that the foundation failed to clear in advance through the state department 's ethics office
if emails suggest clinton was aware of the corporations , banks and nations sending money to her foundation during her time at the state department -- or worse , took action to help encourage the flow of donations -- the issue would almost certainly derail her likely presidential campaign
it 's much too early to count hillary clinton out , of course
but there 's no scenario in which voters can be expected to ignore or support the former secretary of state if she is shown to have been simultaneously arranging pay - to - play deals with businesses and governments seeking help or favors from the u.s. government while she was in office
what will matter is not why or how hillary clinton stored her emails but whether the actual emails show her in ethical quicksand from which no presidential candidate can escape .
