the screening of observation techniques system , nicknamed spot , breaks down body language and demeanor the tsa believes indicates either ' stress ' or ' deception '
mannerisms are assigned points based on their severity and are assessed by trained ' behavior detection officers ' , who observe passengers as they go through the security checkpoint
behaviors are given points based on their perceived severity
if you walk through security with a ' face pale from recent shaving of beard ' or happen to be yawning or whistling , you can be assigned one point
but you can also get points shaved off
the spot program , which has cost more than $ 800million since its inception in 2007 , was deemed ineffective by both the department of homeland security and the government accountability office last year
spot breaks down body language the tsa believes indicates ' stress ' or ' deception ' , including sweaty palms , a strong body odor , widely opened eyes or a bobbing adam 's apple ( file photo ) the government accountability office found that there was no scientific evidence to support the spot 's claim that terrorists can be picked out via ' behavioral indicators ' , and said the human 's ability to ' accurately identify ' suspicious behavior is ' slightly better than chance '
the department of homeland security report said that the tsa had not assessed the effectiveness of the spot program or designed a ' comprehensive training program ' for it
