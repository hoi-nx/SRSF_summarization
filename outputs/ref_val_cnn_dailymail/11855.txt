damaging splits have opened in the upper ranks of the conservative party over cameron âs plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration
the prime minister and home secretary theresa may have become increasingly isolated in their determination to fix a new measure for bringing net migration under control
mr cameron is considering including two different targets in next month âs manifesto â including a specific target to slash net migration from outside the eu , which , unlike eu migration , ministers can fully control
conservative rift : splits have opened in the upper ranks of the tories over cameron âs plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration - with the prime minister and theresa may becoming increasingly isolated he is also expected to re-state his commitment to sharply reducing overall net migration
but senior figures , including chancellor george osborne , health secretary jeremy hunt and communities secretary eric pickles are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea
it follows the failure of mr cameron âs 2010 pledge to reduce overall net migration to the â tens of thousands â
last week , the figure hit 300,000 â fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the eu of 190,000
i âm afraid that the net migration target has proved to be a mistake
â george osborne is said to be among thoseto to have voiced doubts about the prime minister 's idea baroness warsi , a former foreign office minister , added : â if you set yourself unrealistic targets , you are setting yourself up to fail and , in the long term , turn the whole thing into a bigger issue by fuelling the perception that the government ca nât get a grip
in a report , the right - of - centre organisation declared : â putting an unreliable cap on net migration centre - stage has meant that other measures of competency have been missed and unnoticed
one senior government source , who supports the migration target , said : â this is the coming fight in the party â liberal metropolitans versus people who have lived in the real world
