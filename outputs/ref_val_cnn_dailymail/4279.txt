a boy who was just 11 when he was charged with fatally shooting his father 's pregnant fiancee has launched an appeal to dismiss the charges or grant him a new trial
brown , now 17 , was jailed in 2012 for the fatal shooting of 26 - year - old houk and her unborn son with a shotgun in february 2009 because he was jealous that the child would be given his room
the court heard houk , then eight months pregnant , was sleeping when brown approached her with a blanket - covered 20 - gauge shotgun and fired a bullet into her head
however , brown 's attorneys claim the evidence used to convict him was insubstantial and he was the victim of a rush judgement
