israel prime minister netanyahu 's recent speech to the congress has received disproportionate media attention across the world : the leader of united states 's most important client state in the middle eastern defies the reservations of the white house , abusing congress as a platform for his israel election campaign
disregarding israel 's already strained bilateral relations with the united states , netanyahu readily risked the consequences of humiliating the obama administration in exchange for less than an hour of political self - manifestation -- typical for a man who is domestically known to be not much of a statesman
netanyahu is a charismatic speaker and a passionate israel - advocate , however , his personal and political interests have always taken precedence over serving israel 's national interests
political survival has been the maxim of his domestic and foreign policies
as a puppet of ideological , conservative playmakers who whole - heartedly reject a two - state solution , netanyahu has been held hostage by the likes of foreign minister avigdor lieberman and economy minister naftali bennett who pursue a discriminatory policy of sectarian segregation intending to contain palestinian public dissidence through mere coercion
consequently , netanyahu 's foreign policy vis - Ã - vis the peace process has been a disaster
he has given in to a toxic form of jewish nationalism , disregarded israel 's relatively good regional position vis - Ã - vis its otherwise - occupied arab neighbors ; he has continued to build settlements out of spite , thought of ever new preconditions for bilateral negotiations with the palestinian and waged a ruthless war against gaza without a clear strategic endgame -- a war that was lost militarily and in terms of international reputation
apart from the tragic effects of netanyahu 's policy on the peace process , his stubbornness has alienated allies in european and washington
israel 's monopoly on victimhood has been undermined by an inflexible , uncompromising short - minded policy towards a palestinian people under occupation whose narrative of victimhood increasingly finds attentive ears in the west
at a closer look , however , a continuation of netanyahu 's policies might actually help the palestinian cause
despite netanyahu 's pre-occupation with security , the derailment of the peace process has not been much of a topic during the campaign so far
thus , while another term of netanyahu will not be in the national interest of israel , it will very likely serve the palestinian interests .
