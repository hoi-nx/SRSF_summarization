a city in southern chinese has banned any new restaurants from making one of the region 's most popular dishes in a bid to control its rising air pollution problem
firewood chicken has become a popular delicacy in kunming , regional capital of yunnan province , with dozens of restaurants springing up in the last few months to offer the dish
local officials have decided to stop licensing new firewood chicken restaurants and ordered existing premises to burn a more environmentally friendly fuel , according to the people 's daily online
officials in chinese have banned restaurants from making firewood chicken because they believe burning lots of firewood to create the popular dish releases too many pollutants into the already smog - filled air in cities to create the dish , large quantities of firewood are burned every day to cook chicken for around 40 minutes
it is estimated that for a restaurant with a capacity of around 30 diners around 550kg of firewood would be burned during busy periods , and this would have a huge impact on air quality
a spokesman for xishan district environmental protection bureau said ' no new applications for firewood chicken restaurants are being accepted and this has been the case for almost a year already
