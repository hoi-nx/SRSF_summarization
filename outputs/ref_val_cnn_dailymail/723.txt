a mysterious san antonio ' priest ' is offering to absolve sins digitally - by taking confessions using snapchat
despite @ priestdavid claiming he wants to make confession easier , others see a cynical ploy to get people to admit their failings and mistakes to a complete stranger , who has not proven he is a member of any church or even a priest
available to hear your confession : christian priests in san antonio have warned against young people offering to confess their sins to @ priestdavid ' it 's not confession
it 's not what the sacrament is all about , ' said local san antonio priest , the reverend vilano to news 4 in san antonio
' while it is not known what christian denomination @ priestdavid is , he claims the snapchat confession is part of a college student 's project he is helping with
he also told news 4 4 he wants to engage more young people and claims he has been a priest for 23 - years
unethical : confession as a sacrament is meant to be performed in person to a priest - either divided by a veil or in some cases face - to - face traditional : this is the way that confessions have been heard for over a thousand years ' doing it snapchat , i mean , you can do snapchat or through the internet and list everything you 've done and there 's no humility in there
others are more damning of @ priestdavid
