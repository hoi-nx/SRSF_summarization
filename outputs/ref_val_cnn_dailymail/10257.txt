research by vets has shown many popular tinned foods contain high quantities of meat not on the label
of the 17 pet foods subjected to dna testing at nottingham university , 14 contained meats that were not spelled out on the can
as good as it looks ? 63 per cent of meat detected in bakers as good as it looks succulent stew â with beef â was chicken and 22 per cent was pork
none of the tins had horsemeat in them , but most contained beef , pork or chicken despite it not being mentioned on the label
some of the â beef â foods actually contained more pork or chicken
for instance , 63 per cent of meat detected in bakers as good as it looks succulent stew â with beef â was chicken and 22 per cent was pork
