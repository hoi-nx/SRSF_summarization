they say money can corrupt even the most honest of people
instead of transforming people into a charitable benefactors , professor paul piff believes money causes people to break the rules at the expense of others
professor paul piff from the university of california , berkeley , has revealed several experiments in which the rich struggled with empathy and generosity towards others , compared with their poorer companions ' it makes you more attuned to your own interests , your own desires , your own welfare , ' the university of california , berkeley , researcher told lucy hooker at the bbc
' it isolates you in certain ways from other people psychologically and materially
in one experiment , professor paul piff spent an afternoon going back and forth over a pedestrian crossing in los angeles
he found that none of the least expensive cars broke the law , while almost 50 per cent of the most expensive car drivers sped across the pedestrian crossing
in another recent study , professor paul piff brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab , and flipped a coin to assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged monopoly game
the rich players collected twice the salary when they passed go , and they were able to roll both dice instead of one , so they got to move around the board more
money isolates people psychologically and materially , according to recent research
' when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won in this rigged game of monopoly they talked about what they 'd done to buy those different properties and earn their success in the game , ' professor paul piff said in a recent ted talk
professor paul piff , however , says not all hope is lost for the wealthy
' after watching this video , an hour later , rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person , a stranger , as someone who 's poor , ' said professor paul piff .
