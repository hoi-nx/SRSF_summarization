two - thirds of the laws passed by britain âs parliament over the past 22 years have either been made or influenced by the eu , according to a study
an analysis of the laws made between 1993 and 2014 found that 64.7 per cent carried the fingerprints of brussels
the study , by the eurosceptic campaign group business for britain , found that 59.3 per cent of the total are regulations â binding eu laws which must be accepted by member states without modification
the study found that the largest number of eu - influenced directives passed into britain law was in 2009 when 294 were brought in
the findings will fuel debate about david cameron âs plans to renegotiate britain âs membership of the eu if he wins a second term , ahead of his promised in - out referendum before the end of 2017
â there must be a significant reduction in the amount and scope of eu legislation and powers over certain policy areas should be given back to parliament so decisions are made far closer to the britain people
last year , lib dem leader clegg and ukip leader farage held two televised debates about britain âs membership of the eu last year lib dem leader clegg and ukip leader farage held two televised debates about britain âs membership of the eu in which mr clegg claimed only 7 per cent of our laws are made in brussels , while mr farage insisted it was up to 75 per cent
â the britain gets a seat at the negotiating table and most of the time , one eu law gets rid of 28 different national laws across europe , making it much simpler and easier for businesses to export
