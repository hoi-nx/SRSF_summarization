yet not only has the united states intelligence community disagreed with netanyahu 's assessment of iran nuclear intentions , so does israel 's , according to leaked documents
sadly , netanyahu 's presentation reinforces caricatures regularly advanced by united states and gulf arab pundits -- caricatures of iran as aspiring middle east hegemon , bent on overthrowing an otherwise stable regional order
in netanyahu 's view , united states should only improve relations with an iran that stops its regional " aggression , " its support for " terrorism , " and its " threat [ s ] to annihilate ... israel
" in other words , united states should not improve relations with an iran whose regional influence is rising
as nuclear talks with tehran enter a decisive phase , rapprochement with a genuinely independent iran -- not a nominally independent iran whose strategic orientation is subordinated to united states preferences -- is vital to halting the decline of united states 's strategic position
as a result , the middle east today is less stable , more riven with sectarian and ethnic conflict , and more violent than at any point in its modern history
united states 's quest for middle east hegemony has failed for many reasons
while united states elites argue that united states benefits from such arrangements , they are ultimately unsustainable , as iran 's 1979 revolution demonstrated
a determination to dominate the middle east keeps locking washington into these kinds of relationships ; for its own sake , the united states needs to stop trying to be the middle east 's hegemon
that means embracing a regional balance of power -- not the chimera of united states dominance misleadingly labeled as " balance , " but an actual balance in which major regional states , acting in their own interests , constrain one another
but the islamic republic -- which iran built themselves as a participatory islamist system representing their interests , not those of rulers beholden to foreign powers -- has a legitimacy united states must accept to foster a truly stable middle east
washington needs cooperation with just such an iran against common foes like the islamic state of iraq and syria , and to balance counterproductive policies of united states 's regional allies
israel 's pursuit of these policies -- facilitated by united states guarantees of its " qualitative military edge " -- conditions washington 's commitment to keeping over 100 million arabs under united states - backed autocracies and puts united states on a war footing with an iran unwilling to join this inherently unstable regional order
united states needs constructive relations with all major regional states , including iran , so that they constrain one another 's reckless impulses .
