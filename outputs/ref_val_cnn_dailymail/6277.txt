chelsea captain terry was made to warm up toilets seats early in his career for then - skipper wise
terry revealed his duties as a young player included cleaning wise 's boots and making hot drinks for senior players at chelsea 's old harlington training ground - a far cry from the facilities the club 's youngsters enjoy at their world - class cobham base now
but easily the strangest thing that terry did to impress was make sure the likes of wise , kevin hitchcock and michael duberry did not have to sit on cold toilet seats
terry may be chelsea captain now , but when wise was skipper and terry was a junior player at the club , his duties included warming toilet seats for senior players , making drinks and cleaning boots terry ( left ) warmed up toilet seats for wise and his senior chelsea team - mates as a young player and would receive Â£ 25 from wise every time the former captain scored while wearing boots cleaned by terry terry grew from a young player to a senior member of the side during training sessions at harlington ' i 'd do anything for them , ' terry said
' terry , now earning around Â£ 150,000 - a - week as one of chelsea 's key players , used to take a tip of Â£ 25 from wise whenever the feisty midfielder scored with the boots terry had cleaned
' i used to clean his boots and he wanted them perfect so i took really good care of them , ' terry told chelsea pitch owners
every time he scored i was on Â£ 25 , which was half my wages at the time ! i used to be praying we 'd get a penalty or he 'd score
' jon harley , wise and terry ( l-r ) pose in chelsea kit ahead of an umbro launch back in 2001 wise 's boots were cleaned by terry and he used to give his eventual successor as captain a Â£ 25 tip but terry could not just rely on his toilet - warming skills to get him noticed by the senior players
' i would go in and win tackles against first team players , and i remember at the time people were going , â ooh , you ca nât do that " , ' he said
' sometimes you 're losing a game at half - time , which does n't happen often at this club , and you expect to come in and get a rollicking , ' terry said
' terry says dan petrescu was not pleased with the way terry went around tackling the seniors in training terry is now chelsea 's longest - serving player but youngsters do not have to do what he used to do the chelsea captain has led his side to the top of the barclays premier league this season
