a tribunal hearing has found a midwife failed in her duty of care to a teenage mother who she told to ' keep her legs together ' after the young mum suffered a vaginal tear while giving birth
new zealand 's human rights review tribunal also heard community nurse natasha thomson showed up six minutes after the baby was born at her patient 's house on january 15 , 2012
she did this despite receiving five phone calls in one hour from the mother who described herself to be in ' excruciating pain '
the patient - only known in tribunal documents as ' b ' - gave birth to her baby ' on her hands and knees in the bathroom '
thomson did not bring her scissors to cut the umbilical cord and instead had to use kitchen scissors found by the teenager 's partner , mr b. after examining ms b 's perineum - the area between vagina and anus - thomson told the mother there was a tear
it was a home birth and the midwife arrived late despite receiving five phone calls in one hour from the mother who described herself to be in ' excruciating pain ' the teenage mother gave birth to her baby ' on her hands and knees in the bathroom ' she said the tear was not a bad one , referring to it as only a ' tiny tear '
but tribunal documents say ms b had to be later admitted to hospital
tribunal documents said ms b only went to hospital weeks later when the midwife should have had her admitted at the time in the weeks after the pregnancy , ms b was in so much pain in her perineum that she could barely walk
