â a circuit of marrakech âs souks , the crowded warren of retailers in the medina to the north of the famous djemaa el fna square , is an exhausting and sometimes worrying experience
if there is a moroccan office of fair trading â unlikely , i âm guessing â its writ fails to extend to the souks , and do nât even think about going back for an m&s - style no - nonsense refund
the nearest soul - crushing uk equivalent to the souks that i can think of is that moment of existential despair in ikea where you lose your bearings in light fittings and begin to think that you may never find the road out
a circuit of marrakech âs souks is an exhausting and sometimes worrying experience mind you , the mysteries of the souk have always been over-romanticised
in it , charles boyer plays jewel thief pepe le moko , who uses the city âs market as a hiding place and becomes entranced by the ravishing beauty of co-star hedy lamarr
in fact the line is actually used by french cartoon skunk pepe le pew in the later looney tunes send - up of algiers
the royal palm resort is huge , with much of the 570 acres devoted to an 18 - hole golf course i went to casablanca , moroccan âs largest city , about 15 years ago to see how closely the modern - day place resembled the movie version
if this sounds daft , it âs because it was a made - up device to drive the plot
a vip experience awaits passengers who fly into marrakech and head to resorts such as the royal palm casablanca âs director was handed the script on a day - by - day basis
nobody â not even the scriptwriters â were entirely certain what would happen in the end
some are execrable : bogart âs rick recalling with bergman âs ilsa the day the nazis marched into the french capital : â the germans wore grey
it âs only when i visit marrakech that i feel like crying : â play it again , sam ! â here is to be discovered all the mystery of the casbah along with the exotic heat of the desert and the intriguing mingling of french and arabic cultures â with the croissant set beside the tagine
if i had time , i âm sure i âd find rick âs american cafe with sam at the piano still burbling : â you must remember this â¦ â while it would be curious to enjoy a holiday in marrakech without being taken to the souk , these days the city centre has become something of an optional extra for a new breed of visitors
in the past five years , there has been a substantial building boom in the outer reaches of the city with the construction of several extremely plush stand - alone resort hotels which offer everything you need in one self - contained holiday place
the hotel has 135 suites and villas all built in a style that manages to combine the modern and traditional that means you can now enjoy chic marrakech breaks in cool top - end resort hotels â and your stay does nât necessarily have to involve a visit to the centre of the city , avoiding slipper - buying jaunts altogether if you prefer
marrakech is now also one of those places that you can enjoy on a cunning fly - cheap , stay - posh basis
and flying into marrakech â unlike flying into tenerife â passengers heading for resorts such as the royal palm , one of the newest and most impressive , have a bit of a red - carpet experience awaiting them
we are then fast - tracked through immigration â pushed in front of a sizeable queue â and into the baggage hall
outside , we are met by the hotel driver who takes our bags to a brand - new land rover discovery for a 15 - minute drive to the hotel , which lies about eight miles from the centre of marrakech
the royal palm 's imaginative kids â club features models of lifesize sheep , all woolly and very cuddly on the flight back , the reverse process is so well managed that we go from kerbside to aircraft seat in less than 15 minutes â i âd go back to marrakech just for this unwonted delight
driving up to the main hotel building is pure hollywood , with blazing fire pits and walkways illuminated by dozens of hand - lit lanterns â not so much bogart , more indiana jones
the royal palm resort is huge , with much of the 570 acres devoted to an 18 - hole golf course lined with bougainvillea , laurel , roses and hibiscus shrubs â and shaded by some 4,000 olive trees , many hundreds of years old
if you âre worried about the wisdom of having a water - hungry golf course sitting on the edge of the sahara , the resort is at pains to explain that it has been designed with the utmost care for water resources and local vegetation
as i climbed out of the taxi in marrakech âs famously madcap main square , i found myself face to face with a baby goat
