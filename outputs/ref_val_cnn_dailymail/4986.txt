hell and high water by sean as usual with books about crazed adventures and daft derring - do , this one , about the author âs attempt to swim the length of the british coastline , begins with an account of the preparation involved
however , very unusually for such books and adventures , sean âs account is mainly about what he has nât thought of doing
charity swimmer sean , 32 ( pictured ) , arriving at john oâgroats , in the north of scotland , after being the first person to swim from land âs end to john oâgroats just weeks before he âs due to dive into the sea off land âs end , he has nât done any training or sought any funding and has no â plan â to speak of
indeed , it seems that he only thought of this ultra-long - distance swim up the british coast because his attempt to cycle around the world did nât happen as he âd have wished â all was going well until he had a crash and , although he completed the pan-global bike ride , it could nât get him into the guinness world records
first , there âs the temperature : â i slowly walked into the water , â sean recalls , â and was surprised at how cold it was
which is exactly what happens to sean
soon after , there âs another problem â seasickness , for sean , as well as two of his support crew
sean âs original â plan â was that he âd be swimming for two months
more calamities lie in store â running out of money , losing members of his support crew â but sean copes with them all
and , astonishingly , remarkably and record - breakingly , 135 days after he walked into the surprisingly cold sea off land âs end , he swims into john oâgroat âs harbour
