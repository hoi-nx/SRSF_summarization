scientists discovered that patients who listened to experts of mozart had enhanced gene activity in the brain in areas including memory and learning
meanwhile , the music also affected the activity of a risk gene connected to parkinson
classical music can help slow down the onset of dementia by enhancing gene activity in the brain , new research has found the finnish researchers found the changed activity was only present in ' musically - experienced ' patients , who listened to music regularly , suggesting the importance of familiarity with music
for the study , participants were asked to listen to mozart 's violin concert no 3 , g - major , k.216 , a piece that lasts 20 minutes
the research involved participants listening to mozart ( pictured ) for 20 minutes the study showed that genes were enhanced in those deemed ' musically experienced ' in areas such as dopamine secretion , which is when a neurohormone is released in the brain , synaptic neurotransmission , which is how neurons receive information , and learning and memory
one of the most affected genes in this area was synuclein - alpha ( snca ) , which is also a known risk gene for parkinson
