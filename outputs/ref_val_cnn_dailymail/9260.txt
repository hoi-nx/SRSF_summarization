convicted criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons after a landmark court ruling
criminals could be banned from smoking in the communal areas of prisons following a landmark ruling at the high court in london however , the judge accepted his ruling had wide - ranging implications and said it should not take effect until mr grayling has had a chance to appeal
the judge was told by government lawyers that criminalising smoking could lead to unrest in the jails of england and wales
prisoners can smoke in their cells with the door shut and outside in exercise yards , but both inmates and staff could face prosecution for lighting up in communal areas if the ruling is not overturned on appeal
the case was brought by paul black , an inmate at hmp wymott in lancashire , who says he suffers from a range of health problems made worse by second - hand smoke
high court judge mr justice singh , pictured , made the ruling after rejecting the argument that crown premises had immunity from the health act 2006 , which bans smoking in public places and in workplaces lawyers for paul black , a sex offender who has been at hmp wymott since 2009 , argued both prisoners and staff were guilty of lighting - up in areas prohibited under prison rules , including on landings , in laundry rooms and in healthcare waiting rooms
the case was brought to the high court by paul black , an inmate at hmp wymott in lancashire , pictured , who says he suffers from a range of health problems made worse by second - hand smoke paul black 's solicitor sean humber , head of the prison law team at leigh day , said : ' the judgment confirms that the legal restrictions on smoking apply every bit as much in prisons as in the public places and workplaces in the wider community
' the judgment is important in confirming that prisoners are entitled to the same level of protection from the risks posed by second - hand smoke as everyone else
