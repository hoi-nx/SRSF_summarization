michael and jacqueline tucker were holidaying in botswana when the animal bore its fangs at them during a safari
rather than run from the hungry animal , mr tucker , 38 , whipped out his camera
as his stunning collection of photographs show , the animal changed its mind at the last minute , waddling off in search of food elsewhere as their group 's motorboat kicked in
who 's there ? an angry hippopotamus made a dash for a group of tourists in chobe national park , botswana , with one of the group able to capture the moment it nearly reached their boat in a swamp closing in : the animal moved with ' astonishing ' pace said mr tucker , a professional photographer in the area with his wife , jacqueline not happy : the beast was far from pleased when the group of tourists brought their boat into its territory of the water the encounter was not without risk though , he said , with their guide hurriedly trying to start the boat 's engine as the hippopotamus closed in
' get your own swamp : mr tucker was able to capture the beasts ' yellowed fangs and tongue in a stunning collection of photographs getting closer : the rest of the group remained in their seats as the guide tried to restart the boat , the animal growing ever closer off you go : eventually the tour 's boat restarted , with the animal pleased to see them leave just in the nick of time do n't bother coming back : while mr tucker said he was glad to have been able to capture the encounter , he said the images remind him of how much danger they were in at the time
