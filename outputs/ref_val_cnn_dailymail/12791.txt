another flight brings another complaint about an airline interfering with a passenger breastfeeding her baby
hilderman was feeding her 5 - month - old son on board united as the aircraft taxied along the runway before taking off from houston to vancouver
" a male flight attendant named keith walked up to our row and said to my husband ( loudly , so that everyone around could here ) , ' are you two together ? ' " hilderman wrote
when her husband said yes , hilderman said , the flight attendant " tossed a blanket at him ... and said tersely , ' then here , help her out
' " when she twice asked what he was supposed to help her out with , she said , the flight attendant ignored her
passengers on the plane were supportive , she said , and told her they had n't known she was breastfeeding until the flight attendant singled her out
united spokeswoman dohm said that the airline reached out to hilderman on monday night via twitter and that airline officials " look forward to speaking more with her and to our crew member to understand what happened
" she wants her facebook page encourage airlines " to publicly post their explicitly clear pro-breastfeeding / pumping policies inside every airplane so the rules are not left to interpretation by an airline employee , and in turn harass / shame / bully a mother
" united , delta airlines and other major u.s. airlines say breastfeeding is allowed on their aircraft , although united does n't post its policy on the airline website
though you ca n't please everyone in the air , women are allowed to breastfeed in flight , says veteran flight attendant and author poole , who is also a mother
