ray davies : a complicated life by rogan the exhilarating finale of a musical called sunny afternoon currently offers one of the great nightly spectacles in north london âs so - called â theatreland â , as hundreds of mostly middle - aged punters leap or , in some cases , creak to their feet , jigging and jiving to the music of the kinks
just a few weeks ago , i was one of them , and resolved as i left to learn more about the singular life of ray davies , the band âs brilliant but melancholic frontman , who wrote such timelessly wonderful hits as waterloo sunset , you really got me , lola and , indeed , sunny afternoon
ray davies ( pictured ) is the brilliant , but sometimes melancholic , frontman of the kinks well , rogan âs monumental biography has filled all the gaps in my knowledge of one of the men who made the sixties swing ( while simultaneously lampooning the sixties with his mickey - take of carnaby street dandies , dedicated follower of fashion )
gloriously rousing though it is , the stage show hardly does justice to the enigma that is ray davies
mercurial , introspective , sometimes cruel and spectacularly , almost sociopathically , mean with money , but also sensitive , principled and capable of great kindness , ray davies is above all one of the creative geniuses of our age
ray davies was born in 1944 in muswell hill , north london , on the night of an air raid
much later , dave âs musicianship would also be central to the success of the kinks , but he was resented by ray davies from day one
he bent over him , whispering , â are you ok ? â , only for ray davies to spring up and punch him hard in the face
â while dave grew up happy and outgoing , ray davies was troubled and solitary and was even sent to a child therapist , which ca nât have been usual in working - class north london during the fifties
while young stewart forged his own path towards superstardom , the ray davies quartet , shedding start and adding drummer avory , mutated into the boll-weevils , the ravens and , finally , the kinks
pop group ' the kinks ' ( pictured in 1964 ) left to right : pete quaife , ray davies , avory and dave davies there are various contradictory explanations for the famous name , but the best guess is simply that â kinky â was a fashionable adjective in the early sixties
â similarly uncertain are the precise origins of the kinks âs first hit , you really got me , in the summer of 1964
but it reached number one and made ray davies a star
and the band âs manager , larry page , was present on the day ray davies âs first wife , rasa , who he âd met when she was a schoolgirl attending one of their gigs , pleaded with him , â ray , what about that coat ? â he replied , â no , you ca nât have it
the ray davies quartet , mutated into the boll-weevils , the ravens and , finally , the kinks ( pictured in 1964 ) ray davies âs parsimony is one of the reasons why the story of the kinks is a tale of epic in - fighting , as well as marvellous music
four decades later , ray davies himself was almost the victim of a murder , when he was shot in new orleans while chasing a mugger who âd stolen his then - girlfriend âs handbag
but shining through the violence , the personality clashes , the litigation with former management , the volatile relationships with women , even a mental breakdown , are the songs â none of them more enduringly haunting than waterloo sunset
ray davies ( far left ) wrote timelessly wonderful hits such as waterloo sunset , you really got me , lola and sunny afternoon his voice might not be what it was , but ray davies was the perfect choice , and it was the perfect song , to close the london olympics three years ago
