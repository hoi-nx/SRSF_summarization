it has between 370 and 470 calories , depending on the fillings , and will cost $ 2.49 at most restaurants nationwide
the biscuit taco 's introduction comes as the chain tries to build on its year - old breakfast business by once again going after the dominant player in the mornings : mcdonald 's
' new addition : starting thursday , people can get the baked wrap filled with options like eggs , sausage , cheese or deep - fried chicken and jalapeno honey sauce - it has up to 470 calories , depending on the fillings propaganda : in a new ad campaign ( above ) , taco bell plans to paint egg mcmuffins as boring , routine food for the brainwashed national tv ads will feature testimonials from real - life ' defectors ' saying things like ' i admit i used to be a mcdonald 's fan
' it 's a continuation of an ad campaign last year that featured real - life people named mcdonald professing their love for taco bell offerings
at one point , mcdonald 's responded by tweeting a photo of mcdonald kneeling down to pet a frail chihuahua , which was once the mascot for taco bell
' booming business : already , the launch of a national breakfast menu has helped drive up sales at taco bell , which has been trying to redefine itself as a hip brand with its ' live mas ' slogan all gone : the biscuit taco at taco bell will replace the waffle taco ( above ) which contained 460 calories and 30g of fat per serving the chain has also repeatedly said the star of its breakfast menu is the a.m. crunchwrap , which is a grilled tortilla stuffed with eggs and a hash brown along with sausage , bacon or steak
in the latest quarter , the chain 's sales rose seven per cent at established locations , driven by breakfast , according to parent company yum brands inc. taco bell ceo brian niccol said breakfast has been holding steady at about six per cent of sales
that 's compared with between 20 and 25 per cent for mcdonald 's , which has been playing up its own offerings by noting it cracks fresh eggs to make egg mcmuffins
