there will come a time , hopefully soon , when jose mourinho accepts that the role of the television analysts and newspaper columnists is to pass comment on key decisions
here at stamford bridge there were four moments - minute 18 , minute 23 , minute 46 and minute 56 , as jose mourinho refers to them - that affected the direction of this game
â pundits are pundits and managers are managers , â explained chelsea âs manager after his team had been held to a 1 - 1 draw by an engaging and adventurous southampton team at stamford bridge
jose mourinho may one day accept that the role of pundits is to pass comment on key decisions yet again , after jose mourinho 's chelsea drew with southampton , jose mourinho attacked his critics â pundits are paid to wear my suit , but i âm not paid to wear their suit or comment on their comments
â he really has a bee in his bonnet over the role of graeme souness or sportsmail âs jamie carragher , gravely offended that anyone could dare to criticise his tactics or his team
this is yawnsville and as unappealing as this will sound to chelsea âs manager , the match officials are also tiring of his constant complaints
here mike dean , the latest poor sap given the onerous duty of refereeing the barclays premier league leaders , was pretty much spot on
referee mike dean was lumped with taking charge of chelsea and on key decisions was pretty much spot on mike dean awarded this penalty to southampton , scored by tadic , which did n't please jose mourinho chelsea were a goal to the good through costa when jose mourinho âs faithful servant rui faria was sent down the tunnel to watch the television replay of the decision to award southampton a penalty when matic fouled mane
a few days ago , in the boisterous atmosphere of the second leg of their champions league clash with paris saint-germain , chelsea âs players were guilty of kettling dutch referee bjorn kuipers to get zlatan ibrahimovic sent off
â my view is not important because what is important is the referee âs view , â claimed jose mourinho
costa appeals for a penalty that would have seen fonte sent off had it been awarded the biggest bone of contention was the failure of mike dean to spot the delicate tap on branislav ivanovic inside the penalty area when southampton âs goalscorer tadic flicked out a boot
matic was booked in the first half for his challenge on mane and should have been sent off when he clattered into southampton âs deep - lying forward in the 46th minute
fonte calls for branislav ivanovic to be booked for a dive but replays showed he been clipped by tadic â when that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow would come , â admitted a doleful jose mourinho
there is no agenda and no - one is out to get chelsea
