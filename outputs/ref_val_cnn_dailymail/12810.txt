every year , animal handlers travel throughout england and welsh to compete at agricultural shows
jooney woodward 's " best in show " is a documentation of those competitions , with photos that place a spotlight on the handlers and their animals
" when you go to ( the shows ) , they tend to be all about the animals -- people photographing the animals , " jooney woodward said
" while those involved with the competitions are the focus of many press photographers , jooney woodward 's work stands out for its distinctive portraiture style
" the " best in show " portraits lead viewers down a winding pathway to ponder those inexplicable yet noticeable connections and bonds that exist between the handlers and their animals
jooney woodward 's photos also contain subtle details
" it 's just the way ( wendy ) had gone through the effort of decorating the pen ( with union jacks ) where the cows were being kept , " jooney woodward said
this is especially evident in the photo of the traditional welsh pigs being judged , as jooney woodward points out there is an advertisement for sausages behind the pigs
regardless of what elements make up jooney woodward 's photos , the emotions and aesthetics remain particularly important
jooney woodward said that when photographing jamie and his jersey cow , his happiness and smile made her want to " share that sense of enjoyment " that handlers have when competing with their animals in the shows
what drew jooney woodward to harriet and her guinea pig gentleman jack were the similar colors radiating from both of them
and she also had her own guinea pig with her , which had red as well , " jooney woodward said
jooney woodward said this was an enjoyable aspect of her work because " you get to see lots of familiar faces
those competing have a lot at stake when they make the decision to travel and compete , because the shows are just as much business events as they are social gatherings
