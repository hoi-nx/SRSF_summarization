every time a snowstorm bears down on mark boughton , connecticut -- which has happened a lot this winter -- students and parents turn to twitter to find out whether schools will be closed
instead , mark boughton residents see jokes , meme - filled videos and teasing references to snow days at fictional high schools from " glee " or " grease " -- all courtesy of mayor mark boughton , a social - media prankster whose @ mayormark account provides actual updates about school closings amid all the buffoonery
he was in especially rare form tuesday night , tweeting almost a dozen snow - day jokes , storify user and freelance journalist kristin hussey chronicled , as yet another storm hit mark boughton
parents and students tuning in for real news about snow days might find this running gag irritating
but on twitter , at least , many students seem to get the joke
they understand , because it 's sort of a tradition around here , " said boughton , who told cnn he 's been trading jokes about snow days with students on twitter for several years now
" one twist of the whole thing is that boughton does n't even make the call about closing mark boughton schools
but boughton , who ran for governor of connecticut last year and has 18,000 twitter followers , usually posts his school - closing tweets first
finally , after hours of build - up , the mayor gave people of mark boughton the news at 6:21 a.m. wednesday : schools would open two hours late
" as a parent , has it been helpful ? no , " said stephanie pabon , whose 6 - year - old son attends a mark boughton magnet school
