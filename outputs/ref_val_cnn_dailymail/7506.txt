facebook has already begun flying its giant drones designed to bring internet access to the world , mark zuckerberg has revealed
' as part of our effort to connect the world , we 've designed unmanned aircraft that can beam internet access down to people from the sky , ' he posted on his facebook page
' mark zuckerberg revealed the final design will have a wingspan greater than a boeing 737 but will weigh less than a car
low - orbit and geosynchronous satellites , which have orbits that match the earth âs rotation and are effectively stationary , will cover more remote areas in africa and asia
' the final design will have a wingspan greater than a boeing 737 but will weigh less than a car
' at facebook 's f8 conference in san francisco , the firm 's facebook 's chief technology officer schroepfer revealed the firm thought drones were key to getting connectivity around the world
' at a summit in new york earlier this year , facebook 's engineering director announced the vehicles will be closer in size to jumbo jets , than traditional drones , and they 'll soar at 65,000ft ( 19,800 metres )
following the tests , it could then be just three to five years until the super-sized , solar - powered drones are hovering above remote parts of the world to provide internet access

' the final design will have a wingspan greater than a boeing 737 ( pictured ) but will weigh less than a car , ' said mark zuckerberg

the large drones will be capable of broadcasting a powerful sthe drones will be tougher and able to fly for longer periods of time than balloons , while also being able to have their location precisely controlled
