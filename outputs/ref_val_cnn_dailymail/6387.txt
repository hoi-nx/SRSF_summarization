study found playful people deem humour , a laid back attitude and creativity more important in partners than their more serious peers ( stock image ) the new study builds on the research of anthropologist garry chick from pennsylvania state university , who developed a theory that playfulness in adults is a desirable trait in sexual selection
this is because it indicates to women , a low level of aggression in men and to men , vitality in the fairer sex
proyer and lisa wagner from the department of psychology at the university of zurich , have shown that playfulness also plays an important role in the choice of a partner in the european culture
for example , women found a sense of humour more important than men and men found an exciting personality more important than women
they also found that participants who described themselves as playful also valued playfulness , humour , a laid - back attitude , a fun tendency and creativity among potential partners themselves
â although we should be cautious while interpreting the data , this could be an indication that playful people are actually perceived as more attractive partners or that playfulness increasingly develops in the relationship , â dr proyer added
