griffiths , 30 , of ruabon , wrexham , told her two children to lie down and go to sleep as she started the blaze
but her 10 - year - old daughter ran out of the house as the fire began to spread and raised the alarm
heroically her neighbours - both in their sixties - were able to get griffiths and her seven - year - old son out of the burning house despite griffiths fighting to stay inside with the boy
she was ' grabbed by the scruff of her neck ' and dragged out - and even then tried to get back in
griffiths has now been jailed for five years and four months at mold crown court after she admitted arson
the judge said : ' the fact remains that you intended to kill your children and yourself by setting fire to the house
griffiths set fire to the house with her family inside shortly after being told she was facing eviction but she ended up fighting with her sister while drinking wine before buying another bottle to drink at home which culminated in her starting a number of fires in the early hours of the morning
john philpotts , prosecuting , said griffiths told the children to lie on the sofa and that ' everything would be all right '
but her brave daughter refused and ran out of the house to the house next door , the home of mr and mrs bride
mrs eileen bride , 62 , tried to get into the house and shouted to griffiths to come out , but griffiths refused and demanded her daughter go back in
mr eileen bride , 66 , got into the burning house through the back door , braving thick black smoke to find griffiths holding her son
