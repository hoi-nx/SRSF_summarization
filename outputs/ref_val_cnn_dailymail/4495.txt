these fascinating pictures show the hoard of nuts collected by a squirrel who stole them from a bird table before stashing them away under the bonnet of a honda civic
the animal helped itself to food left out for the birds in the garden of a gloucestershire property before crawling inside the engine of the car and hiding them in the air filter
the secret stash of nuts was only discovered when the owner of the honda civic 1.6 took her vehicle to the garage because she could n't work out why it would n't go above 40mph
he , along with colleague plaister , spent an hour sucking the nuts out of the air filter with a vacuum cleaner and collected enough to fill half of a supermarket carrier bag
she 'd been leaving nuts on a bird table in the back garden , and somebody had been helping himself to them
' he 'd been getting into the garage , where she parked the car , and had been climbing right inside the engine bay and squeezing himself into the air filter
