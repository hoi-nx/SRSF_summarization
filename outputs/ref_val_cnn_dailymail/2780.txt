europa league broadcasters itv have pulled off a coup by persuading the injured everton and england defender baines to be part of their panel for tonight 's important tie between roberto martinez 's men and dynamo kiev at goodison park
baines has been ruled out the first leg because of a knock to his quad muscle and will join 1980s everton legend reid for the live television coverage to see if his side can salvage some respect for the premier league after a dismal european campaign for our leading clubs
roberto martinez 's side are the only english survivors in the europa league following exits for liverpool and tottenham in the last round and itv have chosen to show the match from goodison park on their main channel itv1 rather than itv4 where most europa league games are screened
