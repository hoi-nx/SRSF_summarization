shamed payday lenders are still hounding vulnerable customers suffering from illness and bereavement despite pressure to clean up the industry , a report has found
only one year after a new regulator was tasked with keeping loan companies in check , many are still employing bully boy tactics when a customer defaults on their repayments

vulnerable : the fca 's own report found evidence that high - risk applicants were still being accepted for loans ' in many cases , these customers were still being chased for their debts through daily letters , emails and phone calls ' , the fca said
