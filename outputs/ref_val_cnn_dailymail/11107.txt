it is the perfect invention for the house proud - a substance that means clothes will never stain , glass will not mist and kitchen surfaces automatically shed their germs
the substance , made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles , works because it is very , very water resistant
the substance is made out of coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles and any drop of moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away , cleaning up any dust or germs in its path any drop of moisture which touches it turns into a ball and rolls away , cleaning up any dust or germs in its path
the breakthrough , by chemists at university college london , comes after years of research into highly water - resistant - or â superhydrophobic â - substances
waxy feathers , for example , repel water , keeping a bird afloat and its plumage clean
professor parkin , head of chemistry at university college london , said : â if we can do this as well as nature does it , we will have a series of breakthrough products
â phd student lu , whose lab work at university college london contributed to the breakthrough , has shown in a series of tests that the substance can be applied to the threads of textiles which could allow it to be used to create waterproof and stainproof clothes
mr lu demonstrated that cotton - wool coated with the substance could be dipped into blue coloured dye and yet emerge pristine white

in addition , the coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so tough that they survived being rubbed 40 times with sandpaper the idea was inspired by copying elements from nature
waxy feathers , for example , repel water , keeping a bird afloat and its plumage clean
but coated titanium dioxide nanoparticles are so tough that they survived being rubbed 40 times with sandpaper
mr lu said : â being waterproof allows materials to self - clean as water forms marble - shaped droplets that roll over the surface , acting like miniature vacuum cleaners picking up dirt , viruses and bacteria along the way
