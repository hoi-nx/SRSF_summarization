allowing dynamo kiev to score an away goal means everton will require a performance of strength and discipline in ukrainian next week but at least they can travel with confidence thanks to lukaku âs 82nd - minute penalty
lukaku celebrates his late penalty which gives everton a precious lead ahead of next week 's return leg in the ukrainian capital after a long wait , a nervy lukaku put the ball to olexandr shovkovskiy 's left and his penalty just about beat the keeper to nestle in the net steven naismith celebrates his leveller as the scot 's instinctive finish restored parity before the break after great work from lukaku steven naismith coolly slips the ball beyong the onrushing olexandr shovkovskiy to raise the roof at an expectant goodison park oleg gusev slips away from ross barkley on the far post , darts toward the near post and connects with a corner to steer past tim howard oleg gusev wheels away in jubilation after giving the visitors the lead to give everton fans plenty to think about on a nervy europe night lukaku reacts after squandering a chance to put everton ahead , but the club 's Â£ 28m record signing made amends later with his spot kick everton ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : tim howard 6 : coleman 6.5 , antolin alcaraz 6 , jagielka 8 , luke garbutt 7 : james mccarthy 6.5 , gareth barry 7 : steven naismith 7.5 , ross barkley 6 ( leon osman 74 , 6 ) , kevin mirallas 6 ( kone 64 , 6 ) : lukaku 7 subs not used : joel , gibson , besic , atsu , browning

there were excellent performances , not least from captain jagielka and gareth barry , and there was also courage , not least from lukaku
andriy yarmolenko flung in a corner , james mccarthy was too slow to react and oleg gusev nipped in to direct a volley into the roof of the gwladys street net
steven naismith finished off some wonderful work from lukaku to give everton a foothold in the game

the momentum shifted when jagielka charged down a loose ball and surged upfield , passing to lukaku with dynamo kiev keeper olexandr shovkovskiy stranded outside his area
had lukaku returned the pass , jagielka would have had an open goal to aim at but instead the belgian shot horribly wide
everton had a spark and in the next attack , after 37 minutes , luke garbutt âs inswinging corner was met flush by jagielka but the england defender âs header was cleared from under the bar by silva

lukaku can infuriate with his ability to make the wrong call but his play to create the equaliser for steven naismith was outstanding , bull - dozing his way past three challenges before slipping in the scot , whose finish was admirably cool
as he wheeled away to celebrate , steven naismith made a point of signalling to jagielka and for good reason
they came out of the blocks for the second period with purpose and lukaku âs hulking presence continually unsettled silva and forced him to make mistakes
one such error led to a corner from which steven naismith almost scored with a header
that steven naismith missed was not a problem
everton looked dangerous every time they attacked and the suspicion was that shovkovskiy would buckle if they kept testing him , as the impressive luke garbutt did with a fizzing free - kick

when silva handled substitute leon osman âs cross , referee carlos carballo had no hesitation pointing to the spot
lukaku did the rest , firing his penalty straight down the middle
