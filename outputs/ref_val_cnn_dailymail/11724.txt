the prime minister will condemn ' warped ' sense of political correctness which prevented council staff from reporting abuse for fear of appearing racist teachers , social workers and councillors who turn a blind eye to child sex abuse will face up to five years in jail under plans for a new criminal offence
the government has decided to act following an official report that found at least 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual abuse in rotherham between 1997 and 2013
children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators , abducted and trafficked to other cities in england
the prime minister will say a â warped â sense of political correctness contributed to local authorities not acting
the inquiry found there were fears among council staff of being labelled racist if they focused on victims â descriptions of the majority of abusers as asian men
the prime minister will say : â we have all been appalled at the abuse suffered by so many young girls in rotherham and elsewhere across the country
â children were ignored , sometimes even blamed , and issues were swept under the carpet â often because of a warped and misguided sense of political correctness
it is about making sure that the professionals we charge with protecting our children â the council staff , police officer and social workers â do the jobs they are paid to do
