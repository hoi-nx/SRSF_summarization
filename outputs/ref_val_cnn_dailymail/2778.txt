among the stream of letdowns to flow from england âs cricket world cup perhaps the most poignant poured from the lips of eoin morgan on sunday
eoin morgan is the most inventive england batsman of his generation , and that includes kevin pietersen
and so , reflecting on the horrific nine - wicket loss to sri lanka in wellington after england had scored 309 for 6 , eoin morgan sought comfort in stats
england captain eoin morgan found solace in statistics following the heavy defeat by sri lanka first this : â we were 25 above par , and the stats backed that up
â stats have always been a hallmark of peter moores âs england
famously , he introduced andy flower to moneyball , michael lewis âs classic account of sabermetrics ( the statistical analysis of baseball ) ; infamously , he allowed stats to encourage the selection of darren pattinson against south africa in 2008
what , after all , is the relevance of stats when the change in fielding restrictions has made 300 the norm ? and why defer to hawk-eye when naked-eye told you england bowled like drains ? buttler needs to be cut loose at the top of the batting order when the situation merits his promotion ballance ( left ) is suffering from poor form and england 's insistence on using him as a no 3 the system is nât working
if it were working â or even close to working â england would not have lost to australia by 111 runs , to new zealand with more than 37 overs to spare , and to sri lanka by nine wickets while defending over 300
and england are playing a form of 50 - over cricket more suited to oliver cromwell and 1645
when buttler hit the fastest one - day hundred by an england batsman , against sri lanka at lord âs , alastair cook told us he was nât ready for test
the free - hitting alex hales has not been trusted to form a regular part of their 50 - over batting order taylor leaps to take a catch against sri lanka - and his position in the order has also dived to no 6 england have inverted one of the first rules of international sport , which is to do what the opposition least wants you to do
why not buttler , armed with a licence to do something violent ? instead , ballance scratched around for 10 in 18 balls , england slowed down , and a near - certain score of 350 - plus became 303 for 8
the total proved well beyond scotland â but , funnily enough , not beyond sri lanka , whose 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ( dilshan , sangakkara , jayawardene , mathews ) is as classy as anything in the tournament
yet , after moeen ali and bell had again provided a useful platform ( 62 in nine overs ) , england proceeded to potter around before the final assault , safe in the knowledge that the 300 was â 25 above par â

here , england seemed to have borrowed not so much from moneyball as from annie hall
â england coach peter moores has been left to reflect on an embarrassing start to the cricket world cup peter moores is a fan of moneyball ( left ) but his regime has more in common with annie hall england seem to believe that stats will ease them all the way through from notion to concept to idea to â¦ cricket world cup success ! this may work in test cricket
but if england accept that stats - driven prudence is no way to win one - day internationals , they can yet challenge for the 2019 world cup
that was the week that was new - ball nightmare england âs over-planned batting is only part of their problem
the point has been made that england âs battery of right - arm seamers have become distinguishable only by height and hair colour
during england âs tour of sri lanka , it was regularly assumed the attack would be stronger for their return from injury
the bowling of stuart broad ( left ) and james anderson ( right ) has been smashed at the cricket world cup so far shifting the goalposts there âs nothing like a ( nother ) cricket world cup fiasco to skew the debate
which of ballance , root , bell or moeen ali are you going to drop ? and if kevin pietersen is to be brought back for the one - day team , you âd have to ask a fresh batch of questions about how seriously england are about winning the 2019 world cup : kevin pietersen will turn 39 that june
but he drifted away from the 50 - over format in his final year as an england player , and did nât do especially well when he was picked
kevin pietersen ( right ) has had the door opened on a potential return to the england set - up someone else âs problem ms dhoni earned a few pats on the back for saying , after india had thrashed the uae , that the associate nations needed more exposure at the highest level
