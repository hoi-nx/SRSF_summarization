in the dream scenario gerrard 's final action in a liverpool shirt will be the lifting of the fa cup at wembley on may 30 , his 35th birthday
for more than 16 years gerrard was anfield 's beating heart
gerrard returned to liverpool training earlier this week after almost a month out with injury the club captain led liverpool to champions league glory against ac milan in 2005 in total there was a champions league , a uefa cup , two fa cups and three league cups
even in the bad times ( and there were plenty as a premier league title remained elusive ) the local boy was a source of scouse inspiration
' at least we 've got gerrard '
imagining a liverpool without gerrard is like imagining the beatles without paul mccartney
but the show must go on and , in henderson , rodgers might just have the ideal replacement
a year later gerrard inspired the reds to an fa cup win against west ham a liverpool team without gerrard will be like the beatles without paul mccartney ( front left ) his goalkeeper certainly thinks so
' can henderson lead from the front like gerrard ? can he carry the team on his back ? some would point to the penalty spat with mario as evidence that the 24 - year - old is not cut out for the job
henderson has led the team in gerrard 's absence as liverpool have made a charge for the top four henderson has been in inspired form for liverpool and struck sensational goals in his last two games gerrard , they say , would never have let the italian take the ball
surely that is the mark of a good captain ? gerrard , a fine skipper , was the master of responding to adversity and henderson is no stranger to ramming critics ' barbs back from whence they came
since sir alex ferguson 's trial by autobiography he has written promising new chapters in his liverpool career
sound familiar ? henderson celebrates after finding the top corner against manchester city last weekend in the five games hemderson has played since gerrard 's absence liverpool have won all five matches his accent may be more wearside than whiston but henderson is now being talked up as a successor and for good reason
whether it 's in brent or at the britannia , liverpool will bid a painful farewell to their talisman and he will be missed
but if gerrard remained the player that so often dragged his side from the turf rodgers would not have allowed him to leave and that is worth noting when the inevitable tears are shed at his watershed
in the six premier league games that gerrard has missed this season liverpool have won them all it is easy to get sentimental when it comes to such a figure
in the premier league this season liverpool have played 22 games with gerrard in the side
without gerrard they have played six games and won them all with an average of 2.3 goals for to 0.3 goals against
