i wanted to spend some time together - just the two of us - before she flies the nest
we 've always lived in london , but valentina has a keen interest in the animal world and longed to know more about the mysterious orca whale
skimming the internet , i found a site called sea kayak adventures , offering a five - day sea kayaking trip in the middle of august in northern british colombia , canada
fins could n't be better for julietta in her kayak in the johnstone strait in canada we would kayak to base camp on the johnstone strait and from there take daily excursions , paddling among the pods of orcas that come back year after year during the months of july and august
the website said there would be a 97 per cent chance of seeing an orca during these two months
it was also clear from our itinerary that we would be without any showers , hot water , electrical power or wi - fi during our time in the wilderness
we were told to bring fast - drying synthetic clothes and whittle our possessions down to the essentials
when they ' breach ' , they jump fully out of the water ; a ' spy hop ' involves them having a quick look around to see what 's going on ; and at night they ' fin slap ' , which sounds like a gun going off our group also included a couple , a single man , joe , and two excellent guides , julia and qui
on that first day , we kayaked down the strait to a beautiful stony beach where we ate lunch - salad , eggs , ham , cheese and fruit - prepared by julia and qui
afterwards , as we headed back towards camp , we found ourselves right in the path of a pod
they were moving quickly towards us , occasionally with their fins above the water and ' blowing ' through their noses
watching these animals glide majestically through the water was breathtaking
the guide had asked us to ' raft ' our kayaks together so that we could make a larger body in the water above them
from that moment on we realised that humans really do not belong in a place like the johnstone strait
the animal kingdom was around us at all times : sea lions , humpback whales , bald eagles , jellyfish , dolphins , porpoises
kayakers raft their vessels together as a killer whale approaches in the johnstone strait this was their world , not ours
our base camp was beautiful , our tent pitched just a few yards from the beach
valentina and i spent five extraordinary days in the johnstone strait
we tracked pods every day
at times they would come and scratch their backs just yards from the beach at our base camp
in the morning the whales would gun down the johnstone strait as if they were on the school run , then at dusk they would drift back slowly , as if they were heading home at the end of a busy day
when they ' breach ' , they jump fully out of the water ; a ' spy hop ' involves them having a quick look around to see what 's going on ; and at night they ' fin slap ' , which sounds like a gun going off
julietta and her group at the water 's edge at telegraph cove near port hardy our guides told us not to be frightened as no one has ever been hurt , let alone killed , by a whale in the johnstone strait
the local whale - watching boats know the pods well
each pod has a name and can be distinguished by the sound of their communication under the water - each family makes different sounds
without one , i opted for the next best thing - a dip in the freezing sea
