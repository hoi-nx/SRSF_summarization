a multi-million - pound office building just off trafalgar square has been taken over by anarchist squatters
around 50 people are currently living in the former offices of the institute of directors on pall mall in central london after moving in on friday night
the self - proclaimed ' bourgeois squatters ' today vowed to stay put for ' as long as possible ' in the building , not far from buckingham palace , which they targeted because it was originally opened by tony blair
the anarchists say that they have not done any permanent damage to the building , designed by scottish architect alexander peebles , apart from vandalising the plaque which records mr tony blair opening the premises in 2001
the building is currently on the market with estate agent cluttons after being vacated several months ago by the institute of directors , which used it as an annexe to its main headquarters a few doors away
food : half - eaten meals in what appeared to be ocado and co-op bags were seen in a corner of the squat vandalised : this plaque recording the opening of the building by tony blair was defaced by the squatters posters : the cluttons advert was defaced , while another poster showed the heads of ed miliband , nick clegg and david cameron on stakes hallway : a welcome table appeared to have been set up at the bottom of the stairs in the building mockery : one of the anti-capitalist messages painted on a poster in the window one squatter , 28 - year - old dominic , who was previously jailed for assaulting a police officer during an anti-capitalist protester , said that the group intended to take care of the building
message : a protester known as patrick writes out a sign to be put in the window cheery : one message simply said ' have a nice day ' in contrast to other more aggressive posters washing up : this morning the squatters claimed they had not yet had time to do the cleaning claim : the squatters say they have a legal right to be in the building and have ignored a court summons aggressive : some posters declared ' class war ' and ' the working class strikes back ' ' we have a wide range of people here - chefs , caterers , law and politics students , and even an aspiring model - with an age range from about 18 to 60
' dominic claimed the building 's link with mr tony blair was one reason the squatters moved in
' it is a massive building to be empty , and we could see that plaque through the door - the building was opened by tony blair who is a war criminal and has blood on his hands , so we decided to take it
' defiance : one poster made a reference to the late anti-war protester brian haw , who lived in parliament square contraband : a police hat appeared to be hanging from a coathook in the office building celebration : a squatter draped in the irish flag in an apparent homage to st patrick 's day the squatters say they will stay ' as long as possible ' , but do not yet know how long they will be able to remain
a spokesman for the institute of directors , which represents the interests of company directors , said that the institute has had no link to the property since moving out
