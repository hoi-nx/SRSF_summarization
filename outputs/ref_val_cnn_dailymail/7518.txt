health secretary jeremy hunt said britain would become the first country in the world with a nationwide meningitis b vaccination programme after the government reached a deal with drug maker glaxosmithkline all babies will be offered an injection against deadly meningitis b â ending a year - long delay , the health secretary said yesterday
the vaccine costs Â£ 20 a time and is expected to be available on the nhs by the end of the year
jeremy hunt âs announcement follows growing pressure from charities , highlighted by the mail , which warned that children were dying and suffering devastating injuries while wrangling about the cost continued
there are around 1,870 cases of meningitis b in the country each year and it commonly affects the under - fives and teenagers
the government then spent almost a year negotiating with drugs manufacturers trying to agree a cheaper price
on saturday , the mail highlighted how the jab was being denied to babies because of the cost row
nearly 800,000 babies each year would be eligible for the jab at an average annual cost of Â£ 16million
charities estimate the nhs would spend around Â£ 3million treating and caring for just one child who has survived meningitis but is left with life - long disabilities
in most cases , they would have it with the five - in - one jab and the rotavirus oral vaccination
the move means the britain will be the first country in the world to offer the vaccine to all babies

â chris head , of the meningitis research foundation , said : â we are delighted that vaccinating all babies against this devastating disease is within sight , cementing the britain âs position as a world leader in meningitis prevention
