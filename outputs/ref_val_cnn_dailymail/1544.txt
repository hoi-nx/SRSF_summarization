the worry for england is that things could get worse before they get better
the cricket itself is bad enough
one of the side - effects of england 's horrible performance at the world cup was to bring forward the moment when our game would have to confront itself
the most alarming development of another improbable week was alastair cook 's outburst in abu dhabi
england vice captain jos buttler looks dejected as he leaves the field after their world cup exit england 's exit at the world cup was humiliating as they went out in adelaide , australia england coach moores ( left ) at the end of the world cup match between england and bangladesh but alastair cook was unhappy
more to the point , he has n't got his head round his sacking as one - day captain
his cri de coeur came not long after coach moores had assured us that alastair cook had dealt with the disappointment of being axed only weeks before the world cup
thoughts returned to the days before that axing , when moores stressed his support for alastair cook 's leadership ; once the leadership was over , moores said it was ' the right thing to do '
and it had better be reinterpreted fast : england are about to embark on 17 tests in 10 months
it is a period that will define both captain and coach , assuming they emerge unscathed
yet alastair cook also needs to be frank with himself
alastair cook was dismissed for three on day one of the champion county match in abu dhabi alastair cook trudges off the field in abu dhabi after falling for five following just three in the first innings for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on twitter : @ the_topspin team insiders believe his words came out the wrong way
but had they been uttered by kevin pietersen , they would have brought howls of ' insubordination '
and kevin pietersen , lapping up the limelight once more , has loved every minute
meanwhile , confusion continues over what exactly graves said to kevin pietersen
reports vary : he 's offered an olive branch , no he has n't ; he 's assured alastair cook that kevin pietersen wo n't play for england again , no he has n't ; he 's told pietersen there are no guarantees , no he â¦ you get the picture
and his statement on kevin pietersen â play county cricket or there really is no hope â had the virtue of treating him like a member of civilised society
kevin pietersen will have nine county championship matches at the most to impress england 's selectors he 's secured a released from sunrisers hyderabad to stake his claim for an england return in the ashes but the latest bout of confused messages , simmering feuds and egotistical grandstanding are a reminder that english cricket should be careful when it next mocks , say , the pakistanis or the west indians for presiding over complete chaos
it 's over a year now since kevin pietersen was told to pack up his troubles in his old kit bag
kevin pietersen has played the media game with his customary flair , befriending those he once disdained
if they imagine they can win his silence while planning not to pick him â and that , by the way , is their plan â then alastair cook 's meltdown may not be the last
when the icc posted what they thought was a congratulatory tweet to the ireland team on a ' memorable and inspiring ' world cup , they enthused : ' see what captain @ purdy34 had to say here â¦ ' ' captain @ purdy34 ' , aka william porterfield , saved twitter users the bother of clicking on the icc 's link by responding directly with a tweet of his own : âª ' @ icc so memorable and inspiring that you have decided to cut the next world cup to 10 teams
