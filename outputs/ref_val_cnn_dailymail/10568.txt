the execution of the only woman on georgia 's death row , kelly gissendaner , was delayed for a second time on monday because the lethal injection was ' cloudy ' georgia has taken the decision to temporarily halt executions after the drug used for lethal injections appeared faulty , authorities said
tuesday 's decision came a day after the execution of kelly gissendaner was delayed for a second time when the execution team found that the lethal pentobarbital dose appeared cloudy
kelly gissendaner , who was convicted of murder in the february 1997 slaying of her husband , had originally been set for execution last week on february 25 , but it was postponed because of a threat of bad weather
the cloudy drug bolstered death penalty opponents , who have been vocal in their opposition after three botched executions in other parts of the country
attorneys for kelly gissendaner said in a filing with the united states supreme court that a lawyer for the state called them around 10:25 p.m. on monday to say the execution would be postponed for several days because the state 's pharmacist had looked at the drug an hour earlier and determined it was cloudy
the state 's lawyer called back about five minutes later to say the prison was n't sure which drugs they had checked , ' this week 's or last week 's , ' and that they were considering going forward , the filing says
the cloudy drug bolstered death penalty opponents , who have been vocal in their opposition after three botched executions in other parts of the country about 11 p.m. , the state told reporters an independent lab checked its potency and it was acceptable , but it later appeared cloudy and the execution was postponed ' out of an abundance of caution
corrections spokeswoman gwendolyn hogan said ' there was never any confusion within the department about the drugs which were to be used , ' but also indicated the department was not part of the conversations between the attorney general 's office and defense attorneys
georgia attorney general sam olens said in a statement it is ' essential that executions are carried out in a constitutional manner ' and that he approved of the decision to temporarily suspend executions

georgia and other death penalty states have bought execution drugs from compounding pharmacies in recent years after pharmaceutical companies stopped selling to united states prisons
the cloudy drug ' raises significant concerns about georgia 's ability to carry out executions in compliance with the constitution , but we do n't know what really happened , ' said mccracken of the university of california , berkeley , school of law 's death penalty clinic
richard dieter , executive director of the death penalty information center , which tracks data on executions , said he 's never heard of an execution being halted at the last minute because of a problem with the drug itself
he will be eligible for parole in eight years after accepting a life sentence and testifying against kelly gissendaner missouri and texas are also actively using compounded pentobarbital in a one - drug formula for executions , and south dakota has also used this method , mccracken said
