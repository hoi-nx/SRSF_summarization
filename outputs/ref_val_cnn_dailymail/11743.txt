claim : dragons â den star jones revealed he limits his children âs pocket money to Â£ 25 a month his work ethic has seen him build a business portfolio worth millions of pounds
yesterday the business tycoon , 48 , revealed he limits his children âs pocket money to Â£ 25 a month - and expects them to earn it through household chores
he said he has also told them he wo nât be funding their first homes , but will reward money they earn themselves with contributions
giving an interview , in which he also criticised the national curriculum for not teaching children business skills , jones said : â my pocket money is based on incentive
it âs like , â you âve got to clean your room , to get this , â and if they do nât do it , they do nât get the money
â another prickly topic of conversation , no doubt , will be that jones , who is worth an estimated Â£ 475 million , has told his children he will not be buying their first homes
jones â extensive business portfolio includes technology website expansys , gifts company red letter days , and the re-launched camera chain , jessops
and he has also established an entrepreneurs â foundation for schools , after growing frustrated at the lack of business training in the national curriculum
jones said he has also told his children he wo nât be funding their first homes , but will reward money they earn themselves with contributions he said : â i âve been campaigning as much as i can
i âve been an advocate for ten years now , across two governments â first with gordon brown , then with david cameron â on enterprise , and really encouraging , pushing , cajoling , to do everything we can to embed enterprise in our national curriculum , and i continue to be disappointed that we just pay lip service to the issue
