when an onion bulb is cut it causes a chemical reaction that generates propanthial s - oxide
this makes up the lf enzyme and is responsible for causing tears

this makes up the lachrymatory factor ( lf ) enzyme responsible for causing tears
house foods group bombarded a bulb with irradiating ions to remove components and drastically reduce the level of lf ( right ) the enzyme responsible is known as lachrymatory factor ( lf ) synthase
