if history and a tilt at the career grand slam at the masters seems a world away for rory mcilroy amidst the water torture of doral , then this is the week when it will all come into blessed focus
forget the frustrated figure he cut on friday when he created a youtube highlight with his highland toss of his three iron into one of the many hazards that give the blue monster its name
how does a couple of days behind closed doors at augusta sound , with your dad for company , a couple of mates , a club member who knows all the course secrets and an athlete who is even more celebrated in america than the world no1 ? rory mcilroy plays a shot on the sixth at the the wgc-cadillac championship on saturday rory mcilroy plans to link up with four - time super bowl champion brady at augusta all that awaits the 25 - year - old as he combines a bit of rest and recreation with a touch of sharp prep work with the first major of the season now just a month away
he has played augusta once before and shot a 77 , so he is clearly no mean competitor
for a massive fan of virtually every sport like rory mcilroy , the appeal of linking up with brady is obvious
as for the club member , knox accompanied rory mcilroy when he was first man out in the third round of the masters last year
world no 1 mcilroy threw a club into the water in frustration after more erratic play on friday it is not rocket science , therefore , as to why rory mcilroy would seek him out in a more friendly setting in an attempt to pick his brain
