a country song with a theme as old as time has some listeners up in arms - and some radio stations now refusing to put it on the airwaves
' is it frustrating to you that here is your song - that is one of the top 10 sellers for weeks and weeks and weeks - and people on the radio are still afraid to play it because they think it âs a lesbian song ? ' radio host bobby bones asked the group during a recent interview according to the washington post
bones , who hosts the most popular country radio morning show in the country then said ; ' it should nât even matter if it âs a lesbian song , is the first thing
kacey musgraves ( left ) went through the same thing when her single follow your arrow included a line about girls kissing girls , but katy perry topped the pop charts with i kissed a girl ( right ) newcomer kacey musgraves dealt with the same problem from country radio when her song follow your arrow , listed by some in the industry as one of the best songs of 2013 , was shunned as it included the lyrics ; ' kiss lots of boys / or kiss lots of girls / if that 's something you 're into
now , the group has actually filmed a spot that explains the song , with fairchild saying ; ' it âs about a girl saying , you know , " why do you love her and not me ? " ' the group did at least have their last song go to the top spot on the country charts and receive plenty of airplay-day drinking .
