the flight crew of the delta air lines plane that skidded into a fence at laguardia airport last week cited brake issues during the landing , according to an update on monday from the ntsb
the crew said they did not sense any deceleration from the wheel brake upon landing , despite the auto brakes being set to " max , " according to an ongoing investigation by the ntsb
they based their decision to land after receiving a brake action report of " good " from air traffic control , the ntsb said
" the automatic spoilers did not deploy , " the crew told the ntsb , " but that the first officer quickly deployed them manually
