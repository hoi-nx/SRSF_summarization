from an iconic marble statue of a heavily pregnant disabled artist to the more recent giant blue cockerel , london 's fourth plinth art project has always provided a controversial modern twist to the traditional landmarks around london 's trafalgar square
the latest offering , " gift horse , " which took up residence in the trafalgar square 's northwest corner thursday , looks set to continue the tradition with a work that explores the link between power , money and history , according to organizers
unveiled by london 's mayor johnson , the sculpture created by german - born conceptual artist haacke portrays a skeletal riderless horse with an ribbon - shaped electronic ticker tied to its left leg showing live market data from london 's stock exchange
" ' gift horse ' is a startlingly original comment on the relationship between art and commerce and i hope it will stimulate as much debate as other works that have appeared on the plinth , " johnson said
further nods to the past and the sculpture 's location can be found in the pose which is based on the engraving " the anatomy of a horse " by english artist stubbs , whose famous equine portraits hang on the walls of the national gallery on trafalgar square 's north side
many of haacke 's most famous works have explored systems , be it physical -- as evidenced by his famous 1960s work " condensation cube " -- or the social and political as seen in " moma poll " ( 1970 ) , " a breed apart " ( 1978 ) and more recently his " der bevã¶lkerung " ( the people ) installed in german 's reichstag building in berlin in 2000
" it 's a very prominent spot , " said the 78 - year - old , reflecting on the " gift horse 's " positioning in trafalgar square , " it 's very beautiful
" " gift horse " is the 10th artwork to sit on the plinth and follows the " hahn / cock , " created by german artist katharina fritsch which was in residence from july 2013 to february this year .
