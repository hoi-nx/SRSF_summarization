the most committed formula one fans are never outraged by team orders and regard the constructors â championship as equally compelling
so why the fuss about mercedes ? if the rules state that a designer must be limited or regulated if he gets too good , what is the point in having a constructors â championship at all ? mercedes driver lewis hamilton celebrates his win at the season - opening race in melbourne , australia lewis hamilton and mercedes team - mate nico rosberg were in a class of their own as they dominated the race lewis hamilton , the reigning world champion , is the overwhelming favourite to defend his formula one crown give everyone the same car , forget teams and make formula one about drivers only

â just get your head down , work hard and try to sort it out , â was the advice from mercedes chief toto wolff and he is right
if this season is about lewis hamilton versus his team - mate nico rosberg , tough
