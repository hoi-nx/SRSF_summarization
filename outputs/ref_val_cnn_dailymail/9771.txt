mullins has turned the olbg mares â hurdle into a one - man show
the irish trainer would have won it with annie power had she not stumbled at the final fence and thrown off ruby walsh but still ended up lifting the prize with stablemate glens melody
that makes it seven wins running , mullins having lifted the prize for the last six seasons with another record - breaker in quevega before she retired to stud
glens melody capitalises on annie power 's fall to win the olbg mares â champion hurdle it will be a shame if mullins â total domination of day one overshadows the first cheltenham festival win of trainer neil mulholland courtesy of the druids nephew in the handicap chase
jockey sam twiston-davies ( above ) was adamant that his mount the new one was not himself irish trainer elliott is more established than neil mulholland but his efforts in plotting a route back to the cheltenham festival with his national hunt chase winner cause of causes also deserves praise
