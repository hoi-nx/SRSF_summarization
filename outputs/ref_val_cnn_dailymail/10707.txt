two single beds side by side , canes hanging from coat hooks and retro britain food tins on a gingham - covered countertop - these are the poignant images that capture the lives of two elderly sisters in their family home
jean and joy were born in the house in ryde , isle of wight , in 1916 and 1922 , never married and even shared a bedroom in their family home for 27 years until jean 's death in 2008
now their quiet , old fashioned life together has been documented by a photographer barker , with her picture series , the house of two sisters
jean 's picture is in the centre , to the right is their brother jim in his royal artillery uniform the new owners have kept the enamelled pots and pans and other vintage pieces of kitchenware and continue to use a ' cool cupbord ' with perforated metal door and sides for storing cheese , butter and eggs jean taylor ( left ) was born , lived and died in her home in ryde , isle of wight ; after the loss of her sister in 2008 , joy , now 99 , ( right ) sold the house in 2013 to move into a care home barker 's pictures are as much a document of the sisters ' lives together and of a glimpse of a vanishing britain
her images record an immaculately kept house with vintage features such as antimacassars on the armchairs , tins of treacle in the kitchen , a dressing table and highly - patterned carpets
barker said : ' very much a family home in the early days , the sisters shared the house with their mother and their aunt edie until both mother and aunt passed away
this was jean 's home all her life
' aged 23 and 17 respectively when the second world war broke out , the joy sisters came of age in an era of thrift , rationing and self - sacrifice

their beds are seen reflected in the mirror the new owners have kept the old electrolux hoover along with the carpet that remains in this room jean and joy shared a bedroom from the 1950s until jean 's death
barker said : ' in 1957 joy left to live in london , though returned to the house almost every weekend
despite being a large house the sisters shared a bedroom right up until jean passed away
' these plastic flowers were given to the sisters by the grandmother of the woman who delivered their lunches in the last two years of jean 's life
gill remembers how impractical these armchair ' tables ' were andmugs of tea would slip off unless held on to tightly joy sold the house in 2013 but her coat still hangs on the coat rack along with the sisters ' canes ( left ) ; the women hung their sunday best dresses on the back of the bedroom door ( right )
their niece gill , who says her aunts were always smart dressers , remembers jean wearing this two - piece on warm summer days the isle of wight - based photographer was asked to take her camera around the house by the new owners after joy - the last of the joy family in ryde - sold her house in 2013 to move into a care home
' they 've kept a lot of the sisters ' furniture and objects , selected from the things that the sisters ' family did n't want , many of which are currently in storage , but they plan to display them around the house once the decorating is completed
the new owners of the house have kept this fowler 's treacle tin and many other old containers including over-the - counter medicines and salves , with a view to displaying them in the house in future the sisters had an identical much - loved chair and even joy is n't sure whether this one was hers or jean 's barker documented the interior before it was renovated
