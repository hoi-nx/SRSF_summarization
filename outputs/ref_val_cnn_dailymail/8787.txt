williams wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written a brutally honest letter written by roald dahl to a teenager who asked him for advice on his a-level project has surfaced
budding writer williams wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written
the 17 - year - old did not expect a reply
but mr williams , who grew up near carlisle , was delighted when he received a typed note signed by the man himself
however , in true roald dahl style , there was a sting in the tail
however the letter was not what the eager teenager had expected with roald dahl heavily criticising his use of ' beastly adjectives '
' it should be fairly obvious to you what the role of a short story is in modern literature
' study particularly the american short story writers like o'henry and runyon and hawthorne and poe , and lots and lots of english ones
roald dahl responded saying the teenager was ' asking too much , ' but that said that he had read his story ' study hemingway , particularly his early work and learn how to write short sentences and how to eschew all those beastly adjectives
mr williams in his teens , left , and the celebrated author roald dahl , right , who replied to his letter ' instead he gave me this fairly forthright criticism
' the story was for an a-level english literature project , and was probably really self - indulgent , overflowing with flowery adjectives , which roald dahl quite rightly bristled at
