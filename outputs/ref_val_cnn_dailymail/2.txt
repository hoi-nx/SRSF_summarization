the message , as jenkins relaxed at his al fresco media conference overlooking rome âs central park , was that wales have not even thought about the maths
the wales assistant coach insisted his squad are not interested in points - difference â just winning a test match against italy
wales were heaped with praise for their defensive display last week but â with the wingers in danger of not scoring a try all tournament for the first time since 1995 â wing liam williams is ready to shift the focus towards attack
liam williams insists wales will pile on the points against italy in rome jenkins says the first objective is to win the game â we know a lot of things need to happen , â said liam williams
â we are on first so we âll go out , do the business and then sit back and watch the other matches
â liam williams and george north both scored during last year âs 51 - 3 rout of scotland on the final day of the competition
a similar scoreline in rome would make warren gatland âs side big favourites for the title although they would have to wait for their reward as the new trophy is already at twickenham and its replica in edinburgh
for liam williams , it is a chance to silence his critics once and for all
liam williams was ordered to improve his discipline and has subsequently conceded one penalty in six tests , compared to 13 in his first 16
warren gatland will be hoping to get some points on the board early on against the italians wales , pictured this week in training , have travelled to rome knowing a win could secure six nations glory â i hope they âre happy that i âve started four out of five games in this six nations
â sharing his surname with famous predecessors â jpr , shane and martyn to name three â liam williams will now hope to match their big - game temperament
he will look to the forwards to provide a platform for victory â although the front - row casualty list is a worry â but it is up to the back line to deliver a title - winning scoreline
the absence of sergio is a huge boost for wales
the italy captain has a foot injury and the odds of wales winning the title shifted when his omission was confirmed
â sergio âs absence should temper italy âs gung - ho approach while the captaincy has been handed to hooker ghiraldini
wales centre jonathan davies said this week that ireland should â fear the wounded animal â of scotland , but italy are also limping after losing to france so wales must also be on their guard
