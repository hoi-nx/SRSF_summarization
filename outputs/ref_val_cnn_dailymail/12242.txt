washington no deal is better than a bad deal , say critics of president obama 's nuclear talks with iran
but what if gop and democratic opponents succeed in their intensifying effort to derail the diplomacy ? the price of failure could be an ugly blame game and cascade of political reprisals leading to nuclear chicken between iran and the west -- potentially leading to war
" we would have to deal with a resumption of iran 's nuclear activities , which we do n't want to see take place
iran would have to deal with the resumption of sanctions , which they do n't want , " said gary samore , a top nonproliferation official during obama 's first term
for now , the grave consequences of a breakdown in talks are one reason the united states and iran are still at the table , as a grueling diplomatic process reaches critical deadlines and painful political decisions beckon
iran deal : a treaty or not a treaty , that is the question secretary of state kerry and iran foreign minister javad zarif are haggling over the remaining issues in lausanne , switzerland , ahead of an end - of - the - month deadline for a framework agreement , which then must be finalized by july 1
but time may be running out for a deal in which six world powers would lift sanctions that have throttled iran 's economy in return for assurances that tehran will continue to stay a year or so away from developing a nuclear bomb
the white house puts the chances of a deal at only 50 - 50 : disputes still rage over the scale of nuclear infrastructure iran will be allowed to keep , the pace of sanctions relief and the extent of nuclear site inspections
despite the controversy stoked last week in washington when 47 gop senators sent a letter to iran 's leaders warning that the future of a deal was not guaranteed , many analysts believe that the talks will go on , even if the end - of - march deadline slips
but senate mitch mcconnell majority leader mitch mcconnell told cnn 's dana bash on " state of the union " that obama was on the cusp of agreeing a " very bad " deal that would allow iran to keep its nuclear infrastructure intact
if no deal is reached , mcconnell said on sunday that he would press ahead with toughening sanctions on iran , he said
that leaves the real possibility of a pitched political showdown on iran in the coming months
and if no deal emerges by july , political pressure for a tougher administration stance towards iran may be unstoppable
if diplomacy fails , how events unfold will be dictated by how the process collapses ; who gets the blame ; and the political pressures exerted on obama and iran president rouhani in washington and tehran
" what that will mean is the iran will reciprocate
" iran could start up centrifuges halted during the nuclear negotiations , bring more advanced machinery online and enrich uranium to the potent 20 % level that would get it closer to a weapon
and if it bars international inspectors , the world would have no idea how far iran is from making a bomb
what 's in the iran nuclear deal the administration thinks that if the united states gets the blame for using hardball tactics that derail talks -- if , say , congress imposes more sanctions , as administration critics want -- there is no way its international partners would keep existing sanctions in place , let alone double down and impose new ones
in addition to unilateral united states sanctions congress has imposed , the united nations , european union and other countries have put in place their own sanctions cutting off iran from international partners and not just the united states economy
" walsh continued , " we would be between a lame duck ( united states ) president for whom negotiations had just failed , a weakened rouhani , for whom negotiations have just failed , and a coming united states presidential election -- not exactly the best environment to return to talks and accomplish a diplomatic settlement
" aborted negotiations that leave iran rededicated to its nuclear program raise the specter of tehran with a bomb -- or some enemy country taking military action to stop it
the diplomatic effort has powerful critics among hardliners in tehran who , whatever 's written on paper , could push to illicitly expand iran 's nuclear program and close in on a bomb
a future gop president could reverse obama 's sanctions waivers fairly quickly , as the senators warned in their letter to iran
whether the new president would want to do so is another matter , however , especially if iran lives up to the terms of a deal , which would include stringent verification by international inspectors
