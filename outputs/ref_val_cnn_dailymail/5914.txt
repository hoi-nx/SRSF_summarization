one sunday morning last summer , bieniewicz , a referee in the michigan united soccer league , showed a player a yellow card for a bad tackle
the player , saad , began to shout abuse at him , so bieniewicz reached for his pocket and prepared to send him off
before bieniewicz could dismiss him , saad felled him with a punch that knocked him unconscious
bieniewicz died two days later in hospital
on friday , as saad âs trial in a detroit courtroom came to an end , the referee âs widow was determined to do one last thing to honour her dead husband âs memory
kris bieniewicz approached the bench as saad waited to be sentenced and pulled something from her pocket
â i would like to serve mr saad with the red card that he was entitled to , â she said
bieniewicz 's widow , kris bieniewicz , addresses the court and holds up a red card to saad saad ( left ) will spend at least eight years in prison after killing bieniewicz with one punch it sounds almost like a parody , does nât it ? but it was nât
the judge sentenced saad to eight to 15 years in prison
tragedies like the one that happened in michigan are rare but you only had to watch manchester united â arsenal and chelsea - paris saint-germain last week to know that referees are under siege
i listened to some of the chelsea - paris saint-germain game on the radio and the dismay in the voice of mark lawrenson as he commented on what he saw was powerful
bjorn kuipers was hounded by nine chelsea players as zlatan ibrahimovic was sent off for a tackle on oscar paris saint-germain players also surrounded the dutch official as tempers threatened to boil over let âs be honest about this : it is getting to the point now where if you want to be a referee , only heroes need apply
if we carry on like this , we âre going to have to start paying referees danger money
a few years ago , i watched a sunday league game between two junior teams at paddington rec in west london that ended amid some disagreement about whether the referee had blown the final whistle too early
as the referee was walking off , he was kicked by several of the kids , who were in their mid-teens
a few of the players tried to trip the referee up as he headed for the touchline
casual intimidation comes with the territory for referees now
how have we sunk this low ? how have we got to the point where angel di maria thinks it is acceptable to chase after oliver and yank at his shirt ? angel di maria puts his hands on referee oliver following his first yellow card for diving oliver received plaudits for his swift and stern reaction to di maria 's display of disrespect how have we got to the point where it is deemed merely a pragmatic part of the game for chelsea âs players to fall upon dutch referee bjorn kuipers like hungry beasts when they want a decision to go in their favour ? how has it got to the point where some seek to justify that kind of behaviour as shrewd or cute or clever ? the gist of the defence appears to rest on the morally bankrupt idea that everybody else is doing it so we have to do it , too
but it is easy to see how the sight of premier league players hounding a referee will influence children on a local park to do the same and possibly worse
this is not just about chelsea or manchester united , by the way
after the manchester united - arsenal game , there was an immediate and protracted outpouring of support for oliver
he was , indeed , treated like a hero for refusing to tolerate di maria grabbing at his shirt despite the angry protestations of manchester united âs players
di maria protests his innocence in vain , but the manchester united playmaker was admirably dealt with di maria trudges off to leave manchester united depleted and facing an fa cup exit following his tug at oliver 's shirt it was as if a great wave of relief was flooding over the wider football community that finally someone was standing up for what was right
â referees are out there on an island with no one to defend them , â said the widow of bieniewicz yesterday
