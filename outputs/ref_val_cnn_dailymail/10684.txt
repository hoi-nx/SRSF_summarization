would nât it be embarrassing for mourinho if he blew the title and gifted it to that â specialist in failure â arsene wenger ? would the special one be able to show his face in english football again after such humiliation ? it âs a big call if you think the gunners will win the title , but history suggests there is a chance chelsea could implode
this time last year mourinho was reeling from an unlikely 1 - 0 defeat at aston villa
that day at villa park chelsea huffed and puffed , ramires was sent off , and mourinho was charged by the fa after he went on to the pitch to question referee chris foy. chelsea manager mourinho gestures to his players during the 1 - 1 draw with southampton mourinho saw chelsea draw with southampton in the same week they crashed out of the champions league liverpool ca n't expect any loyalty from raheem sterling if they are not prepared to offer him the same deal as daniel sturridge if you view wayne rooney as anything other than a fantastic player then you have no passion for football they went on to drop points at crystal palace and at home to sunderland and norwich
a year on , chelsea are huffing and puffing again , dropping points again , and mourinho went early with his campaign against referees
will history repeat itself , or has mourinho learned from his mistakes ? the chelsea team looks knackered , does nât it ? they âve made a habit recently of drawing home games , and that cost them dearly in europe
those players are kevin de bruyne , patrick bamford and loftus-cheek
but how can mourinho explain that champions league exit ? how does he account for the lethargy his players have been displaying for the past two months ? the answer lies in the quality of his squad â or rather the lack of it
chelsea 's season unravelled last year when they lost away at aston villa and mourinho was charged chelsea had a bad week by their standards last week after going out of europe and drawing in the league i ca nât help thinking he might have provided some energy and quality at this stage of the season
mourinho âs decision to sell seemed to be made in haste â the belgian made fewer than 10 appearances for chelsea
i âm also a little sceptical of mourinho âs insistence that he will put youth in the team some time soon
kevin de bruyne was sold by mourinho and the belgian has been in excellent form for wolfsburg patrick bamford scored two excellent goals for promotion - chasing middlesbrough against ipswich ruben loftus-cheek ( left ) has not seen much first - team action at chelsea this season mourinho says the only reason he has n't seen more action is because chelsea have been under pressure to win lots of games in different competitions
and what happens next season when chelsea are competing on all fronts again ? will he be ready then ? strange logic from the chelsea manager , and the fact they failed to make the quarter - finals of the champions league this season proves that he did n't get it right
oscar was chelsea 's only outfield player on sunday under the age of 24 while drogba is 37 did you see young chelsea striker patrick bamford score two brilliant goals at the weekend on loan at middlesbrough ? his second came after a truly world - class piece of imagination that had me out of my seat
it was the kind of creativity chelsea have looked devoid of in recent weeks
video mixed feelings for mourinho over southampton draw how the top of the premier league looks this kid has done his time on loan in the championship before this season , so why send him back there ? surely his presence at chelsea would have been no bigger a risk than re-signing an ageing drogba ? you could argue he âs too young and inexperienced - you could even suggest he might not be good enough
the truth is we do nât know if patrick bamford could have contributed to chelsea âs push on four fronts this season
has mourinho done his mate at middlesbrough aitor karanka a favour at the expense of his own club chelsea ? i âll believe mourinho âs commitment to the chelsea academy when i see it
