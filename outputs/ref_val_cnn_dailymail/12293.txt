tunis tunisian president essebsi confirmed that a third person took part in last week 's bardo museum terror attack in an interview sunday with french tv station itele
" previously two suspects had been identified -- yassine and saber khachnaou -- though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by tunisian security forces
the development came a day after the bodies of four italy tourists slain in the attack arrived back in italy , an official with the tunis crisis center told cnn , but 14 victims ' remains still lie in the morgue
nineteen of them were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in tunis
french , spanish , italy , british , japanese , russian and colombian citizens are among those to have been formally identified so far
the bodies of the italy were met in rome by italy prime minister matteo renzi , who paid his respects to the victims and their families in a brief ceremony
eleven people who were injured in the attack remained in the hospital in tunisian on saturday , the official at the tunis crisis center said
but he said yassine was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum
" it 's true that yassine carried out this terrorist attack , he was killed ; his head , his body , we do n't have it back , " he said
" after the revolution of 2011 he started to pray , before he would drink beers from time to time , like a young tunisian
although his nephew said he 'd gone to the tunisian city of sfax to work , his family now suspected he had been in libya because of the phone numbers he called from
he also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized , saying he was " a normal tunisian guy ... but not an extremist
the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in tunisian , he said
like tunisian , libya saw its longtime leader moammar gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the arab spring
that bloodshed is " just the start , " the isis message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for tunisian investigators
