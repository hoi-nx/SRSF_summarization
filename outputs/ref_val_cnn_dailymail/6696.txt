but in the last year alone , scientists have discovered 1,451 new species in our oceans , according to an international audit of the seas published today
the marine creatures include weird and wonderful beasts from the deepest , darkest oceans , microscopic shrimp from coastal caves and even two new types of dolphin
marine explorers off the coast of australian discovered the venomous ' keesingia gigas ' jellyfish last summer â long as a man âs arm and powerful enough to kill a human
and in 2014 biologists identified two new species of dolphin â one found near papua new guinea and the other in a brazilian river â both of which are already threatened by fishermen
despite the expansion of our knowledge however , scientists estimate we still only know about a tenth of the marine life on earth
but scientists estimate there could eventually be two million on the list as our knowledge of the oceans grows
over the last eight years since the project started , scientists have pored over records , examined historic journals , and poked and prodded the bodies of mysterious creatures of the deep
after countless hours of research , they have found we know only a fraction of the fish , whales and sharks swimming around our shores , or the squid and shrimp found in the darkest reaches of our oceans
â but he added : â sadly , we fear , many species will almost certainly disappear due to changing maritime conditions â especially warming , pollution and acidification â before we âve had a chance to meet
