labour 's flagship energy price freeze was in further chaos last night as miliband was forced to re-launch it as a drive to cut fuel costs
today , the labour leader will announce that he would pass a law to force the regulator ofgem to push prices down by up to Â£ 100 this winter
his officials are now drafting legislation to allow ofgem to â put an immediate end to the overcharging by the big six energy firms â which costs families and business around Â£ 2.5billion a year
labour was forced to â rebrand â the proposed freeze as a price cap when power companies started reducing household fuel bills earlier this year in response to falling wholesale costs
the conservatives have pointed out that if energy prices had been frozen when mr miliband announced the policy , it would have meant families paying bills Â£ 100 higher than necessary today
if miliband had frozen gas prices when he announced his policy back in 2013 , households would now be paying Â£ 100 more than necessary after falling wholesale prices drove down bills opponents of mr miliband say this mistake reveals the danger of meddling in a free market , and warn that any further intervention could risk investment and jobs last night energy minister matt hancock said : â this is now the sixth version of a chaotic labour energy policy that would have put up families â bills by Â£ 100 and could do the same again â their record at setting prices has been a disaster
â and only miliband could propose giving a new power to a regulator he plans to scrap
â mr miliband will say today that in one of his first bills of the next parliament , he would give ofgem â a legal duty to review prices by the autumn â and the power to order price reductions in time for the winter â
