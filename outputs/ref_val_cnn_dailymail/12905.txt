maui , hawaii when she was just 4 years old , chelsea elliott went blind in her left eye
then , two years later , she lost hearing in her right ear
not wanting other children to feel the same frustration , anger and limitations , elliott launched a nonprofit that offers free vision and hearing screenings to school - age children -- particularly from lower income communities
here 's a stunning statistic : 25 % of u.s. children ages 5 - 17 suffer from vision problems , according to the national commission on vision and health
nonetheless , eight states still fail to require vision screenings at schools
as you might guess , the name honors helen keller -- who overcame blindness and hearing loss as an infant
" when i learned about helen keller for the first time in the fourth grade , i surmised that i am half blind and half deaf like half helen keller , " said elliott
" what better role model than to name a nonprofit after the most extraordinary woman who overcame obstacles being blind and deaf ? " do you know a hero ? nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015 i talked with elliott about the motivation behind her work
cnn : you do vision screenings right in the schools
how does it work ? chelsea elliott : we use our tool , the spot camera
we learn so much more about a child 's vision health in a fraction of the time it takes to do a basic eye chart test
see more cnn heroes cnn : your efforts first started in texas
why did you choose to focus on hawaii next ? elliott : the state of hawaii currently does not require vision or hearing screenings in schools
only certain schools on the island were receiving vision screenings , when it was convenient
cnn : how can a vision problem affect a child 's education ? elliott : a child 's learning can be set back several years by not being able to see the words on the page or if they 're at a slant , if they 're blurred , if they 're nonexistent
a common misunderstanding with the need for these services is that if a child has a vision problem , they 'll tell you
i would like to see every state require preventative screenings in order to ensure that every student has an equal opportunity to the best education possible
cnn : where does the name of your organization come from ? elliott : when i learned about helen keller for the first time in the fourth grade , i surmised that i am half blind and half deaf like half helen keller
and then when i graduated from college and i realized what my purpose was in this life , i realized what better role model than to name a nonprofit after the most extraordinary woman who overcame obstacles being blind and deaf ? helen keller did so many extraordinary things with her life , i can only hope to be half as wonderful as she is
