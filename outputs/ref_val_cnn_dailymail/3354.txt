this morning observers across europe were treated to a rare solar eclipse as the moon passed across the face of the sun and obscured it almost entirely from view
but while many , in the uk especially , had to contend with clouds , plenty of images captured the event â and an odd black spot on the sun. while it might have looked like a speck of dust at first , this was actually a sunspot on the solar surface , caused by a concentration of magnetic fields
but several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun ( shown )
these were sunspots , caused by concentrations of magnetic fields
they are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares sunspots are fairly common , with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is
they occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce , making a specific section stand out from the surroundings
they range hugely in size , from just 10 miles ( 16km ) to 100,000 miles ( 160,000km ) - big enough to be seen from earth without a telescope , and more than ten times the size of our planet
sunspots are regions where powerful magnetic fields emanate from the sun these magnetic fields can get wound up so tightly that they rise up from inside the sun , and the sunspots mark the points where this happens
sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun , namely solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , all of which are linked to magnetic fields
the sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle , which has an average duration of 11 years , which also changes the frequency of sunspots
sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes , regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface
they occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce , making a specific section stand out from the surroundings some observers took to twitter to express their views on the sunspots , which were spotted in live footage showing the moon passing across the face of the sun others bemoaned the cloud coverage in the uk , which meant that many observers were unable to actually see the event at all
there were more than 10,000 mentions of the eclipse per minute on twitter , according to social media monitoring company brandwatch the sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle , which has an average duration of 11 years , which also changes the frequency of sunspots
in this nasa image , multiple sunspots can be seen across the solar surface this morning , millions across uk stopped to watch the country 's first solar eclipse this century , which plunged parts of the uk in to brief darkness
astronomer gemma lavender from all about space magazine explains : ' when a solar eclipse occurs , what you âre witnessing is earth , moon and the sun aligning
with this in mind , it âs quite easy to think that we should get an eclipse every month but because the moon âs orbit around earth is tilted by around five degrees to that of our planet âs , our natural satellite âs shadow usually misses the earth âs surface by passing above or below it
during a partial solar eclipse , only some of the sun âs surface gets blocked out by our lunar companion
' uk 's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the moon started to move between us and the sun , with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country
the last solar eclipse of such significance occurred on august 11 1999 , and was ' total ' - with 100 per cent of the sun covered when seen from cornwall
another ' deep ' partial eclipse visible in the uk will not occur until august 12 2026 , and the next total eclipse not until september 2090
more than 100 people flocked to the 5,000 - year - old callanish stones on the lewis to witness the solar eclipse
this morning , millions across uk stopped to watch the country 's first solar eclipse this century , which plunged parts of the uk in to brief darkness ' this is the end of the age of aquarius and we wanted to get here to see the eclipse , ' said mr mccallum , who works in a fine food business
instead , solar eclipse glasses ( shown ) helped people observe the event four intrepid shadow seekers even boarded a special boat trip with kilda cruises from leverburgh on the isle of harris at 5am to witness the eclipse at remote st kilda
