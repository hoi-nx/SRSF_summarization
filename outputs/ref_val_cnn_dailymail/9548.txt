one has straight ginger hair , a fair complexion and deep blue eyes
the other has masses of curls , far darker skin and her eyes are a sparkling brown
their mother was astonished when she first saw the twins , as nothing on the scans had prepared her for their different skin tones
fair - haired lucy , who lives with her family in gloucester , said : â it was such a shock for her because things like skin colour do nât show up on scans before birth
â their mother , who is 47 and a warehouse worker , and their 53 - year - old father , who works as a scaffolder , split up after the twins were born
family line : the twins ' mother donna is half jamaican and their father vince is white , and their siblings george , chynna and jordan all have darker skin than lucy and lighter than maria two of a kind : the twins , who live in gloucester , were born in january 1997 different strokes  studies law at cheltenham college , while ' shy ' lucy studies art and design at gloucester college all together : maria and lucy with their mother donna and siblings george , 23 , chynna , 22 , and jordan , 21 the 18 - year - olds have three older siblings , george , 23 , chynna , 22 , and jordan , 21
lucy said : â our brothers and sisters have skin which is inbetween maria and i. we are at opposite ends of the spectrum and they are all somewhere inbetween
non-identical twins come from separate eggs , so inherit different genes
the girls â half - jamaican mother carries genes for both white and black skin
by chance , lucy will have inherited genes for white skin and maria will have genes that code for black skin
lucy studies art and design at gloucester college whilst maria studies law at cheltenham college
lucy explained : â maria was outgoing whilst i was the shy one
