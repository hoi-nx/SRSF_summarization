many years ago , a colleague told me how frustrated her husband was by " amazon mom , " a special membership program offered by the retail giant that provides discounts , recommendations and other information to help parents during the crazy toddler years
" but still it is called " amazon mom , " irking my colleague 's husband to no end since he was the one ordering the majority of diapers and other products for their babies
a petition created a few years ago calls on amazon to change the name of the program from " amazon mom " to " amazon family
that changed after the recent death of a beloved dad blogger , miller , who created a facebook group for dad bloggers in 2012 that has grown to more than 1,000 members
in 2013 , miller called on men and women to sign the petition to get amazon to change the name of the program
" why did amazon bother changing the name of its parenting program when the program started in the united kingdom ? what made them realize they could n't get away with calling it ' amazon mom , ' and why do they get away with it here ? " miller wrote
" someone actually started a petition to change the name to ' amazon family ' in the america , and so far it has less than 100 signatures
" the push for inclusivity in the parenting arena has been well received by many a brand in the past few years and , like miller , many of us think the change to ' amazon family ' is a no - brainer , " heenan said
judgy moms and dads face off in hit ad bishop , a father of two in calgary , alberta , and founder of the blog dad camp , points out how amazon calls its program " amazon family " in germany , japan , austria , france and canada as well as the united kingdom
" the petition has gotten over 4,800 signatures
