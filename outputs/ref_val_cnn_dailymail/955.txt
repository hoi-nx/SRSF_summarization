the white bluff home was built on a fault line and was gradually collapsing with the cliff side into the lake it took less than an hour for the fire to level the home above lake whitney
flames consumed exterior walls after crews spread bales of hay and fuel to ignite flames throughout the expansive home
neighbor steve mellgren told wfaa : ' it 's getting larger ... it 's getting wider ... it 's getting deeper ' the u.s. army corps of engineers said tuesday it will work to ' keep things as safe as possible in the area until the danger has subsided ' the ground around the home cracked and became unstable until a part of the land gave way beneath the 4,000 - square - foot home , leaving pieces of the house dangling off the side of a cliff
authorities said destroying the house was better than waiting for it to topple into lake whitney
