former referee keith hackett has called on webb to come out of retirement in a bid to improve the standard of officiating
webb , widely considered one of football association 's best ever referees , retired in august 2014 to become the technical director of the pgmol ( pgmol )
his first season out of the game has been littered with refereeing controversies , the most recent of which have come inside the last week
webb , who is widely regarded as one of football association 's greatest ever referees , retired in august 2014 burnley 's ashley barnes was not punished for a horror challenge on chelsea midfielder nemanja matic martin atkinson 's decision not to punish burnley 's ashley barnes for a tackle on chelsea 's nemanja matic attracted widespread criticism , while on saturday roger east sent off sunderland 's wes brown for a foul john o'shea committed against manchester united
east claimed on saturday , through a pgmol statement , that he had considered wes brown to be the guilty party , hence his dismissal
keith hackett , who used to head up the pgmol - a job now done by mike riley - wants webb , 43 , to return
' he should be encouraging webb to come back into the game as a referee
' keith hackett has not been shy in criticising standards over recent weeks and says officials are giving away cards ' like confetti '
john o'shea fouled manchester united striker radamel falcao in the box , but wes brown was sent off instead the sunderland players crowded round referee roger east but the incorrect decision was allowed to stand on the east decision , he said : ' i think it was another error in refereeing that we 've seen , we 're seeing it pretty often
