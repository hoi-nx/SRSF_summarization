emilie-lea hayward , pictured with mother naolmi , munches through an incredible 30 pots of petits filous per day a fussy four - year - old girl refuses to eat anything other than petits filous - munching her way through 30 pots a day
emilie-lea hayward refuses to eat any solid food and becomes hysterical every time mother naomi , 32 , offers her anything other than raspberry and strawberry flavour yoghurt
the youngster wo n't touch chocolate , sweets or ice cream and even bursts into tears if she is offered an alternative brand
each 47g pot of petits filous contains around a teaspoon of sugar , meaning emilie-lea hayward is consuming 30 teaspoons a day - more than twice the recommended adult intake
but doctors who have examined the youngster say her unusual diet - which costs more than Â£ 2,000 a year - is not affecting her health or development
however , full - time mother naomi is worried about the long - term implications and is desperately trying to find somebody to give her some answers
the mother - of - three , from beaconsfield , buckinghamshire said : ' she has seen pediatricians and dietitians but nobody has been able to help her and i do n't know what to do
' she will play with other food and touch it with her hands but she becomes hysterical if you try and feed her it
she refuses to eat any solid food and becomes hysterical every time mother naomi , 32 , offers her anything other than yogurt doctors who have examined the youngster say her unusual diet - which costs more than Â£ 2,000 a year - is not affecting her health or development ' we thought the pediatrician would be able to help but she has n't had a case like it before
' naomi has to make daily visits to her local supermarket to cope with emilie-lea hayward 's diet - which tops 11,000 pots a year
naomi said her daughter even turns her nose up if she tries to disguise one by putting it in an empty petits filous pot. siblings daisy-grace , two , and nine - month - old harper-jane eat normally
despite her diet naomi says doctors at high wycombe hospital have told her the youngster is just as healthy as any other child her age
a mountain of yoghurt : emilie-lea hayward ( pictured with uncle bryan hayward ) will eat six pots for breakfast and then snack on another two dozen pots throughout the rest of the day ' it has n't affected her health in any way
