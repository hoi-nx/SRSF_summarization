the white house confirmed on monday that president obama knew about clinton 's private email address because he emailed her at it during her tenure of secretary of state
when obama said in an interview that aired sunday that he found out clinton used a private email account to conduct official business at ' the same time as everybody else learned it through news reports , ' what he meant was that was the first he 'd heard of her exclusive use of use of personal email and of her private server , his spokesman clarified this afternoon
' i 'm glad that clinton 's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed , ' obama said
clinton , seen as the front - runner for the democratic 's presidential nomination in 2016 , said on wednesday she wanted the state department to publish her emails so that the public could read them
pressed by reporters to acknowledge that the president had in fact emailed his secretary of state during her four - year tenure , his spokesman said monday , ' the point that the president was making is not that he did nât know secretary clinton âs email address , he did
' ' but he was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how clinton and her team were planning to comply with the federal records act , ' earnest explained
earnest said he did not know when the white house 's office of legal council first knew of clinton 's private email and server system
he also stuck by the white house 's stance that there 's no ' reason to doubt ' that clinton 's team has not done ' exactly what they said they would do ' and give the state department a copy of all of her work - related emails
' the growing controversy over clinton 's use of personal email for work while she was u.s. secretary of state threatens to cloud the expected launch of her campaign
the state department has said there was no prohibition during clinton 's tenure on using personal email for official business as long as it was preserved
