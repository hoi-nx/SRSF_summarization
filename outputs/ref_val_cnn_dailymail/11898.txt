prescott was accused of being an ' apologist for terrorism ' after saying uk was to blame for the radicalisation of muslim teenagers ed miliband was tonight facing growing calls to condemn the labour peer prescott of claims uk is to blame for radicalising young muslim into joining isis
the former deputy prime minister said the country should ' face up to the fact ' that it had somehow pushed already devout youngsters into the throngs of extremism
he added if he was a young muslim in uk today , he too ' could be radicalised ' because of ' injustice ' in gaza and u.s. drone strikes in syria
former minister loughton said mr prescott was playing into the hands of isis and â acting as an apologist for terror â
fellow conservative mp burns said mr prescott 's view was ' half - baked , ill thought - out and sensationalist '
in his weekly column for the sunday mirror , prescott , who last week said tony blair 's ' bloody crusades ' in iraq had contributed to terrorism , said : ' is n't it time we faced up to the fact we 've played a huge part in making them want to leave uk and take up arms in a foreign land ? ' he was referring to a handful of youngsters to have fled the country to join isis extremists abroad
rather than blame ' trojan horse schools ' , at which he claimed there was ' no proof ' of radicalisation , prescott said of the impressionable teens : ' it was n't just jihadi john who radicalised them
â prescott should focus on that an ed miliband should immediately condone these remarks and be clear that these views can not be justified
â mr loughton said the remarks as â extremely dangerous â , adding : â prescott now appears to be acting as an apologist for terror
â i hope ed miliband will distance himself from this comments at a time when we need to do everything possible to dissuade young muslim listening to the poisoned voices of those who try to glamourise a case which characterises itself by murderous barbarism
sir peter fahy said the parents of jihadi runaways should take more responsibility for their actions â people like prescott would probably want nothing more than for it to blow up between the jews and the palestinians
' prescott an apologist for terrorism , you could have mistakened ( sic ) him for qureshi for i 'm cage , ' wrote one user calling himself shaykh zahir mahmood
' speaking on behalf of the terrorist when his identity was revealed last month , qureshi tried to claim he had been unfairly targeted by police before leaving the uk sometime between 2012 and 2013
