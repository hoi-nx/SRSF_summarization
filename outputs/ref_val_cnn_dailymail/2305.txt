being in the right place at the right time is a mark of a successful formula one driver â a truism that will almost certainly lead hamilton to agree a new deal at mercedes , possibly within the week
the double world champion has chosen shrewdly throughout his career by hitching himself to mclaren in the early years and then moving to mercedes for the 2013 season , despite the aristocracy of british motor racing advising him to stick with his existing team
hamilton sits on the podium alongside vettel after he claimed his first victory for ferrari hamilton , out of contract at the end of the season , says his new mercedes deal will be completed this week hamilton , who finished second , also thought of alonso , whose career management has been disastrous since he left renault in 2005 , the year he won the last of his two world titles
the spaniard then walked out on mclaren when he could have won a third championship , went back to renault as a stop - gap , joined ferrari while it was moribund and returned to mclaren this season as they are slowly coming to terms with new engine partners honda
â it âs nice to see ferrari back up , â said hamilton
hamilton finished behind race - winner vettel in sepang but still remains in the lead of the world championship hamilton led vettel off the start - line at the malaysian grand prix but eventually lost out to the german â mclaren are a fantastic team
hamilton , 30 , does not want to fall into the same trap , and says he is ready to sign a new contract with mercedes for three more years beyond this season
no matter sunday âs result â hamilton beaten on pure pace by vettel âs ferrari â mercedes are the team of the moment
asked about signing for ferrari , hamilton said : â no , do nât be silly
my contract at mercedes should be done this week
â hamilton is expected to earn more than his current annual Â£ 20million salary when he pens his new deal the exact terms of drivers â contracts are kept secret , but it is thought that hamilton will get more than his current annual Â£ 20million salary , though probably not match vettel âs deal at ferrari , which could be worth up to Â£ 35m if he collects all his bonuses and extras
the mercedes board want their team to be cost - efficient and will not pay the earth even for a driver of hamilton âs talent
as well as tying up the contract , mercedes will spend the fortnight before the next race in china responding to the ferrari challenge
â i do nât think ferrari âs win is a one - off , â said hamilton
