it 's fair to say mcilroy 's curious sunshine state funk continued in the opening round of the wgc at doral on thursday
the world number one had an eagle and three birdies in a blistering five hole spell to come home in 33 blows and salvage a 73
mcilroy placed the blame on his outward half on being too tentative
' mcilroy hits a shot from the fairway during the first round of the wgc in sunshine state mcilroy lines up a putt on the 16th green during a difficult opening round for the world no 1 mcilroy tries to play his way out a trouble after landing his shot in the bunker on the 17th hole he 's certainly got some work to do
mcilroy will start out no fewer than 11 shots off the pace set by former american ryder cup player jb holmes
world number three henrik stenson carded a 69 while welshman jamie donaldson , runner - up here last year , composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies
as for mcilroy , a desperately mediocre outward half of 40 strokes meant he had played his first 45 holes in the sunshine state this year , taking in last week 's two rounds at the honda classic , in a startling 11 over par. the world number one thought he had ironed out some difficulties he experienced in the wind last week but there was precious sign of it at this stage
world no 2 bubba watson plays his second shot on the 10th hole ad the american finished one under par henrik stenson kept the heat on the leaders as the swede finished the day 's play three under par opening up from the tenth offered the chance of a flying start , since there are two par fives in the first three holes
but mcilroy drove into fairway bunkers on both to squander the chance for early gains
two over par coming to the 18th , mcilroy became another victim of this punishing hole as he found the water from the middle of the fairway with his approach , and failed to get up and down for a bogey from the side of the green
welshman jamie donaldson composed a 70 comprising 16 pars and two birdies it was n't until his 13th hole that we got the first glimpse of the real mcilroy
it was his worst competitive score in 455 events as a pro. lee westwood , who became the first man to play in 50 wgc events , was one over par after nine
