ukip will form an electoral pact with northern ireland mps to keep the tories in power after the next election , farage said this morning
the ukip leader said the conservatives will emerge from the general election as the largest party but would n't have enough mps to govern on their own
mr farage said he would force an early referendum on britain 's membership of the eu as his price for keeping david cameron in number 10
ukip leader farage said the conservatives will emerge from the general election as the largest party but would n't have enough mps to govern on their own the ukip leader 's intervention comes amid growing pressure on the tories to rule out a power - sharing deal with ukip after the election
mr david cameron has repeatedly challenged labour to reject a coalition with the snp , but has side - stepped questions about whether the conservatives would rely on ukip to form a government
' i think between ukip and possibly the dup in northern ireland as well , there will be a body of mps there to have significant influence and to force a referendum on our eu membership
' mr farage has previously insisted he would be willing to support a conservatives minority government only if a referendum on britain leaving the eu was held before the end of this year â two years earlier than david cameron plans
farage said ukip would form an electoral pact with northern ireland mps to keep the tories in power after the next election the tories have insisted that mr david cameron needs two years to re-negotiate britain 's membership of the eu
' david cameron may be forced to rely on ukip and dup mps to stay as prime minister mr tusk â the european council president â last week claimed mr david cameron 's proposal for a new eu treaty was ' mission impossible '
' farage said ukip mps could join forces with dup members , led by nigel dodds ( left ) , in the commons to keep david cameron in number 10 mr farage has claimed that his party will win a ' handful ' of seats at the election , which means the tories would likely also need the support of northern ireland 's dup ( dup ) to maintain a minority government
ukip would back the tories ' first budget if a referendum on britain 's eu membership was promised before the end of 2015
