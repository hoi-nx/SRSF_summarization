they may not be much to look at - but these scraps of land and tumbledown shacks could prove a bargain for buyers in new orleans
the city government is selling some 1,700 vacant lots and ruined properties which have gone unclaimed for years - many since the devastation wrought by hurricane katrina in 2005
the vast majority of the lots are empty plots typical : more than 1,000 empty spaces like these will be sold - after the city has given up any realistic hope of finding previous owners
pictured is 838 bellville street and after years of taxes and charges on the land piling up , city authorities have decided to cut their losses by putting them all up for auction
there is no minimum bid , but every property comes with at least $ 3,000 of fees - meaning nothing will go for less than that
nonetheless , anybody interested must put down a $ 650 deposit , to cover the cost of trying again to track down the owners and giving them one last chance to square their debts
anomaly ? apartment # 10 inside this building , 627 ursuline avenue in the french quarter , is also listed for auction , despite its much smarter appearance than most lots for sale
empty : the unused land around this university building is another one of the lots - listed under 131 south liberty street all - natural : 1925 felician street is another of the chunks of land which has gone unclaimed and unmaintained trash - heap : 3039 pauger street was another of the vacant lots up for sale in the huge auction city authorities have also said that all the sales are conditional on the auctioneers being able to get title insurance for the homes
