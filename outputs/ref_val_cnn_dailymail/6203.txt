berezovsky was killed in his bathroom because he was preparing to give putin evidence of a plot involving leading oligarchs to topple the strongman in a coup , it was claimed today
the exiled russian tycoon was slain by western secret services linked to the plan to overthrow the kremlin leader
the theory comes from berezovsky 's former long - time head of security sokolov , who disputed the version of british police that the ex-billionaire took his own life , aged 67 , in berkshire in march 2013
' if berezovsky 's death is a puzzle for you , it is a problem solved for me
berezovsky was killed simply because he possessed certain secret information and was going to make it public
' sokolov , the head of a major moscow private security agency , said his ex-boss was intent on returning to russian , and had opened negotiations with putin on allowing him back despite years of bitter opposition to the president
' berezovsky forwarded putin a letter with repentance , ' he said
deceased : berezovsky , left , was found dead at his ex-wife 's home in berkshire in march 2013
an outspoken critic of putin , he is said to have sent the kremlin leader a ' letter of repentance ' and was planning his return to russian ' it was a part of the big venture he had been planning
berezovsky was living and looking forward to his return to russian
' berezovsky was killed only because he possessed information which he was going to share with putin
' i am absolutely sure that berezovsky had video and audio evidence about certain oligarchs who offered to organise a coup in the country , promising him to be seen as being at the head of the attack
' berezovsky - who had a penchant for secretly recording conversations - had hidden his treasure trove , claimed sokolov
allegations : the explosive theory was made by sokolov , who claimed his former boss had gathered ' compromising material ' as part of his plan to return to russian ' western secret services are still chasing it
' he claimed that berezovsky had inside information from mi6 about russian
but ' when he became dangerous for their recruited residents such as russian politicians and oligarchs , the western secret services decided to get rid of him
' he alleged : ' berezovsky 's murder was prepared for several months
there were people around berezovsky who were recruited by these secret services , including some of his guards
death : berezovsky was found dead at his ex-wife 's home , pictured , in berkshire in march 2013
' ' not a poor man ' : berezovsky owed the taxman Â£ 46 million when he died , but sokolov claimed he had about $ 1 billion in his bank account sokolov also claimed that in the 1990s , berezovsky had ordered him to follow nemtsov , the russian opposition leader killed in moscow on 27 february
' but first of all , western secret services are the beneficiaries of nemtsov 's death
negotiation : berezovksy had opened talks with putin about allowing him to come out of exile and return to russian a coroner last year recorded an open verdict at berezovsky 's inquest
mr berezovsky , 67 , was found with a ligature around his neck
berkshire coroner peter bedford said that ' contradictory ' evidence meant he could not prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the businessman either took his own life or was unlawfully killed
sokolov was head of the atoll security agency , and worked with berezovsky from 1994 to 1999
soon after his body was found , sokolov said : ' berezovsky was not a threat to anybody and nobody really needed him
