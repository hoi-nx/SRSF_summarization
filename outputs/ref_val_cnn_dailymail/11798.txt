but the super-sized feline , who tips the scales at 24.5lbs ( 11kg ) and is 45 inches long , is only 17 months old and is set to continue growing
â he âs a lovely cat - he âs very friendly and affectionate but some people who visit are scared of him as they âre used to seeing dogs that size , not cats
â when i pick him up , it âs like picking up a baby â he âs huge â the maine coon belongs to kelsey and matthew gill from ryhill , west yorkshire , who bought him from a breeder around a year ago she said : â i âm not sure if he âs the biggest in britain yet , but he âs definitely close
â we realised he could be one of the biggest when my husband looked it up on the internet and found ludo was slightly above all the other cats , â there âs a debate about when they stop growing , but he âs only 17 months so i think he âs still got a lot of growing to do
â â we âve had maine coon âs for a while , but never one this big
â even though he âs huge , he âs so friendly and lovable
mrs kelsey gill , 28 , who runs a chip shop with her husband , said : â when we bought ludo , he was no bigger than any of the other kittens in his litter as maine coon âs are quite chunky as kittens ' â although he âs big , we âre still able to pick him up and take him places if we want , but he is very heavy
â maine coon â â which are known as â the gentle giants â of the cat world - produce some of the biggest domestic felines
the world âs longest domestic cat , stewie , a maine coon , measured 48.5 inches before he died in 2013 from cancer .
