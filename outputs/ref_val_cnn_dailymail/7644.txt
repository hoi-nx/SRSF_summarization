scientists have reported multiple cases of cape fur seals attacking blue sharks off the coast of south africa
the behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals have turned to attacking the torpedo - shaped sharks the seals , which are normally prey for great white sharks , have been seen attacking and killing medium - sized blue sharks , devouring their guts before leaving the rest of the carcass
divers also report seeing the fur seals attacking other species of shark and rays
the behaviour has left marine biologists baffled as to why the seals , which normally hunt smaller fish , have turned to attacking the torpedo - shaped sharks
the blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator
the blue sharks are around the same size as the seals and it is thought to be the first time a seal has been seen preying on such a large predator
an expert said there are relatively few reports of pinnipeds , or seals , preying on sharks in general , and in all cases these involved smaller sharks blue sharks , like the one above , are one of the ocean 's top predators with a sleek body and mouth full of teeth
dr neil hammerschlaf , a marine biologist at the rosenstiel school of marine and astmospheric science said the seals appear to be eating the guts of these sharks as they contain the most energy he said this behaviour may have serious implications for blue sharks , as their numbers are already in decline due to over fishing
' seals are generally considered prey of larger sharks , and blue sharks have been observed pursuing juvenile and adult male cape fur seals , though no kills have been witnessed , ' he continued
cape fur seals , like the one pictured , normally use their manoeuverability to prey upon smaller fish and squid
scientists believe that the seals could also be attacking the sharks partly to remove competition for the fish they normally eat ' the consumption of large sharks by a cape fur seal is a departure from the prevalent view of this species â diet , which is generally reported to consist of a diverse diet of small fish species , cephalopods and birds
they are commonly attacked by great white sharks , which attack them from below , and killer whales which hunt them in packs
fur seals have been known to mob great white sharks in large numbers but this is thought to be a defensive tactic to scare them away from breeding colonies
in this case the fur seals have been observed attacking the blue sharks , which are open ocean predators that can grow to be about 9ft long ( 2.82 metres ) , on their own
fur seals are common prey for great white sharks , which snatch them in their jaws from below ( above )
fur seals will often group together and mob these sharks , but this is thought to be a defensive tactic in 2012 he again saw a large cape fur seal attack five blue sharks from a shoal of ten over a two hour period
