stone age farmers in puglia italy cut the flesh from the bones of their dead before burying them , a new study has found
researchers at the university of cambridge have discovered cut marks on 7,000 year old human remains buried in a cave in puglie , south eastern puglia italy
these cuts and scrapes , made with stone tools , suggest the skeletons had their flesh carefully removed in rituals before being placed in the cave
many bones , such as this fibula , found in the scaloria cave showed fine cut marks made with stone tools archaeologists leading the research believe cleaning of the dead was probably the culmination of a protracted multi-stage burial process
dr robb , a reader in european prehistory at the university of cambridge , and his team say it might have been a way of returning the bones to their stone like origins
they say that many of the stalactites in the cave resemble bones themselves and the floor of the cave is littered with long , thin broken stalactites
farmers from villages up to 12 miles away are thought to have brought their dead to the scaloria cave in the tavoliere region of puglia italy
writing in the journal antiquity , dr robb and his colleagues said : ' neolithic people at scaloria cave engaged in a varied range of funerary practices including primary burial , skull removal and redeposition , and defleshing and secondary deposition
' if we suppose that stalactites were understood as equivalent to bones on a stone - like plane of existence , then cleaning bones and returning them to the stalactite - filled cave may have been understood as returning the bones to an eternal place where they came into being , the conclusion of a cycle of temporal incarnation
' conversely , the water that formed ' stone bones ' in the cave ( stalactites ) and hence bones in the living may have been understood as spiritually powerful or nourishing
it was completely sealed off until its discovery in 1931 , when human remains , stone tools and broken pottery were discovered inside
there neolithic people placed pottery vessels where dripping water from the stalactites collected
scaloria cave is a deep multi-caverned grotto in tavoliere region of puglie , in southeastern puglia italy , shown above the delicate stalactites in the cave ( left ) resemble bones as can be seen in the image on the right where a collection of bones recovered from the cave and stalactite fragments found among them on the cave floor archaeologists found more than 40 pots encrusted into the stalactites themselves
an isolated adult skull was also found in a small stone niche in the cave
the bones were found among pieces of broken pottery in the scaloria cave during excavations in 1971 they found no evidence of gnawing or damage caused by animals and few of the bones had been broken
however they did find that the bones were covered in small , barely visible cut marks made using flint or other stone tools
they found no heavy chop marks and instead it appears they had been cut using controlled , fine incisions
they said they found cut marks through out the skeletons they found , particularly around major joints or tendon attachments
