lauren recently appeared in i 'm a celebrity get me out of here â when i first got injured i could not use my right arm at all because i âd lost all my feeling in it
â it âs not just the loss of a sport that you âve loved all your life , but it âs the loss of a potential income as well , ' warrick told daily mail australia
' professional rugby was thriving , especially in england , and i thought i was set for life
in this event at the world âs strongest man competition in los angeles last year warrick has to throw kegs of different weights over a bar five metres in the air â i do nât think i âve ever got over it
â contact sport was now out for warrick
he soon put on a huge amount of weight and did nât know what to do with himself until a friend came up with an idea â why not try bodybuilding ? after moving into powerlifting in 2005 he set an australian record in the discipline â i had become depressed and was eating everything in sight
â but my friend got me back in the gym training again and a year later persuaded me to get on stage and compete in the queensland bodybuilding championships
the atlas stones is one of strongman 's signature events
here warrick raises one off the floor
he did this by lifting massive weights in the gym to start with , before moving into powerlifting where in 2005 he set an australian record in the discipline
it was a simple transition after that to start competing in strongman competitions
it was great to watch because they were big and strong , but they were also amazing athletes , â warrick said
the fact that competitors were great athletes as well as being immensely strong was what attracted warrick to taking part in the events warrick first competed in america âs strongest man in 2008 and 2009
