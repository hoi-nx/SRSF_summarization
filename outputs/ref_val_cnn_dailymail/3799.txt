wisconsin lawmakers voted friday to make their state the 25th to enact ' right - to - work ' legislation , pushing a fast - tracked bill through the assembly after an overnight debate and sending it on to gov. walker for his promised signature
the assembly passed the bill 62 - 35 after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate
it was a straight party - line vote , with no democrats backing the contentious measure that will ban unions from forcing non-members to pay dues

the assembly passed the bill 62 - 35 on friday after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate wisconsin assembly speaker gop , a gop , walks off the floor after passage of right - to - work on friday
the bill passed on a party - line vote , with gop in support and all democrats against
the wisconsin senate passed it last week the proposal would make it a crime punishable by up to nine months in jail to require private - sector workers who are n't in a union to pay dues
but opponents said the goal is to destroy unions , which tend to vote democrat , and a right - to - work law would depress wage and create more dangerous workplaces , in turn hurting the economy
the protests from unions in wisconsin were not nearly as large as they were four years ago when walker and gop in the state legislature pushed through reforms to public sector unions , growing only as large as about 3,000 people compared with 100,000 in 2011
but two weeks ago , when wisconsin senate gop said they were going forward with it , walker said he would sign it pointing out that ' the bill would be dead if he opposed ' it , shober , a political science professor at lawrence university in appleton , wisconsin , told tpm last week that walker had to side with his party on the issue
opponents say the goal of the proposal is to destroy unions , which tend to vote democrat opponents of the wisconsin legislature 's ' right - to - work ' measure rallied at the state capitol last saturday
' walker is scheduled to be in iowa for an agriculture summit on saturday that 's attracting other likely gop presidential candidates
the wisconsin executive 's well - established intentions to compete for the oval oval next year had state democrats accusing their gop colleagues of pressing the issue to help walker 's likely presidential campaign , even though walker had said he did n't want the fight as he turned his eye to national politics
gop accused democrats of having ' walker derangement syndrome , ' and said the bill was about giving workers the freedom to choose whether to pay union dues
still , the largest rally attracted roughly 3,000 people ' instead of addressing the real problems facing wisconsin , ' dlcc executive director michael sargeant said , citing a $ 2.2 billion budget deficit , ' gop decided instead to speed the passage of legislation that lowers wages , interferes with the operations of private companies , and satisfies the demands of the right - wing special interest groups that seem to have been calling the shots in walker âs wisconsin since he took office
