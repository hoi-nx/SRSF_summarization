' marina has been keen to stress the importance of communication in a successful marriage , and has said she can see how couples can easily get so busy that they leave no time for each other
whilst many of her toddler - raising friends agree that marriage counselling is a good idea , marina suggested that most couples who receive therapy make the decision too late
she added : ' we spend a day deliberating about which sofa to buy , but we ca nât relinquish an hour for the sake of our marriages ? ' and the fogles ' marriage has faced more challenges than most in recent years
