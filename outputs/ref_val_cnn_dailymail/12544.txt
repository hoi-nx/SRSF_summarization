kuala lumpur , malaysian jaquita gonzales still tries to call her husband on his cellphone
twelve months after mh370 vanished without a trace , jaquita gonzales has n't given up hope
" she 's not alone
families of victims we spoke to hold on to the slimmest belief that mh370 , which disappeared barely an hour into its flight from kuala lumpur to beijing on march 8 last year , did not crash and that the 239 passengers and crew on board are alive
we tap into that hope in order to go on day by day , " says jaquita gonzales
neither able to move on , nor go back
her comfortable home in the suburbs of malaysian 's capital remains virtually the same since her husband of nearly 30 years , patrick , left for work on the evening of march 7 as lead purser on the mh370 red - eye bound for the chinese capital
the only real sign that time has moved on , amid the family photos and plaques celebrating her husband 's work achievements is a newspaper on top of a stack in the living room with the word " lost " splashed across its front page
" like jaquita gonzales , many other families cnn has spoken to say they live in hope that their loved one are still alive even though it seems now a virtual impossibility
anger at the malaysian authorities and malaysia airlines who , jaquita gonzales says , are ignoring them
grace 's mother was on mh370
but now she has gone public after what she describes as the malaysian authorities continued " mishandling " of the disappearance
" there is a lack of transparency , a lack of communications between us and the relevant authorities , ' she says
" it 's not like they have n't learned
they just want to move on
" one recent decision by malaysian authorities has caused bitter resentment among many families
in late january , the government televised a pre-recorded announcement from the civil aviation chief that the passengers and crew of mh370 were " presumed lost " after the plane crashed as a result of an accident
more than 150 passengers on the flight were chinese nationals
" i have n't spoken to the media at all since the accident happened but after that treatment i decided it was time that we said something
it was a group decision that we speak to the media because ( the authorities ) never respond to anything we write to them or ask them about , " she adds
for relatives like jaquita gonzales and nathan , each day is a struggle , a struggle to stop being overwhelmed by memories
