a talented designer has come up with a real ' floating palace ' that is sure to catch the eye of superyacht owners
desautel 's salt concept is very much a luxury item
but it is no celebrity - style motoryacht ; it is a 180ft yacht , complete with two masts and huge sails
the living quarters resemble a glass box , offering stunning views 24/7 and the glass area can be folded away so as to open up the yacht and take in the sea air
' the world is a laboratory of ideas that can be borrowed , ' lujac desautel writes on his website
' a walk down to the lower deck offers a stunning balcony view that can also act as a sun trap the yacht is a progression from lujac desautel 's glass structure which was inspired by skyscrapers and lego for any crew employed there are also four twin - bed cabins in a separate part of the yacht
' lujac desautel was last year nominated for young designer of the year by boat international media and is a bachelor of architecture student at california college of the arts in the us
the upper deck offers relaxing space , and despite the choppy seas there are plenty of facilities to keep you relaxed on board benjamin maltby , principal consultant at matrixlloyd â the worldwide authority on superyacht purchase and construction â gave mailonline travel his views on the salt concept
the superyacht is very much a futuristic design , the brainchild of talented yacht lover lujac desautel ' i love the water - yacht interfaces
' the steps on the side are wonderful , but some thought would be needed as how and where they would be stored when not in use as weight on a sailing superyacht must always be carried as centrally and low as possible to counteract the action of the wind on those sails
