around 2002 , i was browsing in a used book store in pittsburgh , and there it was : " the ethics of star trek " by judith barad and ed robertson
coincidentally , i was working at that time on integrating ethics into engineering education at penn state university
i immediately bought the book , and after reading it through , realized that it could be the basis for an engaging course for our first - year engineering students
i first offered the course , the ethics of star trek , in the fall of 2003 -- and i 've been teaching it ever since
my children grew up watching the shows that followed the original series , which continued the tradition established by " star trek " creator gene roddenberry of tackling current events like war , genocide and pollution
it was good family entertainment that also prompted reflection on issues of the day
and it was this exploration of both space and the issues of the day that inspired me to try to apply these moral lessons to students
first there was the friendship between kirk , mr. spock , and dr. mccoy , aka bones
plato described the human soul as composed of three aspects : spirit , reason and emotion
internally , we each strive to balance these three forces
if we manage to do this well , we become a more virtuous person and attain a fourth virtue : justice
so , how was all this applied in a classroom ? the " star trek class " is a one - credit seminar for first - year students that meets once a week , one of about 60 different seminars offered by the college of engineering
students read relevant chapters in the book , and then every other week we watch a related " star trek " episode
one of the recurring plot elements in " star trek " is the discovery of new creatures
are they intelligent ? is their intent malicious ? in one episode , " metrons , " the enterprise engages in battle with an alien vessel , flown by the gorn , that has attacked an earth colony
this episode has been used in the following week 's discussion in various ways , depending on the current events that form the backdrop to the semester
i supplement the " star trek " background with arguments by other philosophers and commentators
as the discussion evolves , various indicators of other species ' moral standing are investigated , including rationality , ability to experience pain and suffering , utility to humans , and perhaps that these other creatures have intrinsic value regardless of their use to people
my favorite spock - centered episode is a two - parter , " the menagerie , " which uses scenes from the original pilot , " the cage
) nearly every episode had a moral lesson or dilemma like this , meaning that not only was " star trek " great entertainment , but a show that could really make you think
that 's why i was saddened to learn of leonard nimoy 's passing friday
