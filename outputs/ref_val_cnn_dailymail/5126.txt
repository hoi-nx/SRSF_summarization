a trainee teacher who suffered agonising cystitis for 17 years has managed to get her condition under control - by cutting out pizza and alcohol
sarah carr said for years she felt like she needed to go to the toilet 50 times a day - but urinating was like ' passing razor blades
' the now - 23 - year - old was bullied at school by children in primary school who told her she should ' wear a nappy ' as she ran for the loo
at seven years old ( left ) , sarah carr , now 23 , began suffering pain and a frequent urge to urinate
as she got older ( right ) she began needing the loo 50 times a day , but said urinating was like ' passing razor blades ' in 2013 she was finally diagnosed with interstitial cystitis , a chronic form of the condition which does not respond to antibiotics and can be hard to treat but finally , it emerged she had the serious condition interstitial cystitis , which causes recurring pain , urgency , a need to pass water frequently and a burning sensation when passing urine
after reading leaflets about her condition she found a surprising cure : cutting out some of her favourite foods â including pizza and sweets
interstitial cystitis is triggered by inflammation of the bladder wall , which can follow childbirth , surgery or repeated bouts of bladder infections , though sometimes there is no known cause
while most cases of cystitis clear up on their own or with antibiotics , interstitial cystitis does not respond to the drugs and can turn into a painful long - term condition that is hard to treat
miss sarah carr , of hull , chose to speak about her intimate problems to let other women suffering from the same illness know they were not alone
interstitial cystitis causes recurring flare ups of discomfort in the bladder and pelvic area
the condition is commonly diagnosed around the age of 40

' when she was seven , miss sarah carr 's mother tracey carr , now 50 , took her to an urologist who failed to find anything wrong with her
' i thought it might be in my head , ' miss sarah carr said
' i was still dashing for the toilet 50 times a day
in 2013 she was finally diagnosed with the chronic bladder condition interstitial cystitis , for which there is no known cure
miss sarah carr said the diagnosis brought little relief because she had hoped doctors would be able to help her
' while there is no cure for the disease , making lifestyle changes is thought to help ease its symptoms
the interstitial cystitis association advises people with the condition to stop consuming caffeine , chocolate , carbonated beverages , citrus drinks , and foods with high levels of vitamin c. spicy foods and artificial sweeteners can also aggravate the bladder , although the charity warns that specific combinations of foods and drinks will act as a different trigger for each person
miss sarah carr decided to try cutting out some of the recommended foods to see if her condition improved
she said : ' i cut out everything that could trigger a flare up including alcohol , spicy food , plus anything high in sugar or fat , like pizza
she said : ' when i have a flare up , i do have to dash to the ladies 50 times a day
miss sarah carr found cutting out pizza , spicy foods and alcohol allowed her to manage her symptoms
but for now , miss sarah carr believes cutting out trigger foods will allow her to live a near - normal life
