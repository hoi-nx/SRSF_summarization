just three drinks a day can be enough to cause liver cancer , according to an extensive review of global research
the increase in risk per 10g of alcohol consumed â around one alcoholic drink â is about 4 per cent , says the world cancer research fund
the review also found a strong association between obesity and liver cancer , as well as evidence that drinking coffee can protect against the disease
the risk of liver cancer is increased by 4 per cent for every 10g of alcohol consumed , meaning three or more drinks a day pose a significant cancer risk , a research review has claimed the world cancer research fund 's continuous update project reviewed global research into the relationship between diet , weight and physical activity , and liver cancer
in all , 34 studies were analysed covering 8.2million people of whom more than 24,500 had liver cancer
world cancer research fund reviewed 34 studies involving more than 8.2million people in order to reach its findings on alcohol , weight , physical activity and liver cancer although the research found strong evidence that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of the disease , the report did not recommend the amount that should be drunk
she added : ' to help reduce the risk of getting alcohol - related liver cancer , it is best to drink within the lower - risk guidelines of 2 - 3 units a day for women , that 's a 175ml glass of 13 per cent wine , or 3 - 4 units a day for men , a pint and a half of 4 per cent beer
' sir david spiegelhalter , winton professor of the public understanding of risk , university of cambridge , said that while the increase in risk of liver cancer per 10g of alcohol consumed was about 4 per cent , that level of alcohol was ' extremely unlikely to cause cancer ' , especially as the report says the increase in risk only starts at levels above 5.5 units a day
