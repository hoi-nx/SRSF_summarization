activists : members of the union have asked for jazz hands rather than clapping in case it caused anxiety young student union activists have asked other conference delegates to wave with ' jazz hands ' instead of clapping or cheering speakers in case it ' triggers anxiety ' among nervous members
hundreds were asked to wave in silence because other people found ' whooping ' to be ' super inaccessible '
union women 's campaign tweeted : ' whooping is fun for some , but can be super inaccessible for others , so please try not to whoop ! jazz hands work just as well
critics have said the messages had ' damaged feminism '
tara hewitt tweeted : ' this damages real equality nothing from conference will make a difference today but " jazz hands " nonsense damaged feminism '
nona buckley-irvine , general secretary at the lse su , said : ' jazz hands are used throughout union in place of clapping as a way to show appreciation of someone 's point without interrupting or causing disturbance , as it can create anxiety
' practical example : this woman shows how jazz hands should be done - but union delegates were urged not to make any noise doing it lse su women 's officer gee linford-grayson added : ' as someone who is new to the union conference culture it surprised me at first , but actually within a few rounds of jazz hands applause it began to make a lot of sense , as loud clapping and whooping can be intimidating and distracting when you 're speaking on stage
an union spokesperson said : ' the request was made by some delegates attending the conference
