saturday night live pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining isis , and not the us army , at the end
the segment was laid out the same as the recent dad spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his toyota camry
in this version however , the father , played by taran killam , dropped off his daughter , played by dakota johnson , and as he tearfully said goodbye she says to him ; ' dad , it 's just isis
' when the father then says to take care of his girl , one of the men yells ; ' death to america
' dakota johnson winked at her father to assure him everything was all right in the parody some on twitter found the parody ' depraved ' others on twitter found the bit ' hysterical ' dakota johnson teels her father not to worry saying , ' dad , it 's just isis ' this all comes on the same week three men were arrested in the america with ties to the terrorist organization and three female british teenagers left to join the group
' apparently nbc and saturday night live thought it was funny to have a skit showing isis driving to an airport to pick up an america girl
