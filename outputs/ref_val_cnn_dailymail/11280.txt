samantha cameron and her two older children , nancy , 11 , and elwen , 9 , were in the gallery just beside me for pmqs â and they chose a belter
as the prime minister took his seat he looked up and spotted his children
magimix time ! mr ed miliband had seemed sure he had the zinger par excellence with which to undo his great rival
the labour leader stood at the table , feet planted wide , a superior twitch on his lips as he leaned into the microphone
after a drollery about mr cameron 's ' retirement plans ' ( that tv interview which has so excited the pm 's more crosspatch critics ) , ed mil ' challenged the pm to give a straight answer to a straight question
' will he now rule out a rise in vat ? ' asked mr ed miliband
mr cameron : ' yes
mr ed miliband had been expecting the pm to give a waffling non-answer
now the so - and - so cameron had gone and ruled out any such rise
from my perch i could not see mr ed miliband 's eyes but a colleague who was watching him reports that they revolved like a couple of fruit - machine dials whose lever had just been given a mighty yank
labour mps sat stony - faced as tory mps roared with laughter when mr cameron ruled out a vat increase er , er , er , er : the ed miliband mainframe went into catastrophic systems freeze
then , with desperation : ' nobody 's gon na believe him ! nobody 's gon na believe him ! ' this drew laughter from the government benches , aghast silence from labour
lucy powell , labour election supremo , was sitting beside mr ed miliband
mr cameron capitalised on the ambush ( which , one hears , may have been arranged with george osborne )
he pounced on labour confusion and asked mr ed miliband if he would reciprocate by ruling out a labour tax rise on national insurance
after all , pms is meant to be about questions to the prime minister , not from him
speaker bercow let it pass and mr ed miliband flailed
he offered no such promise on national insurance , allowing mr cameron to clinch the moment by accusing labour of a ' jobs tax bombshell '
mr cameron appeared to be enjoying his time at the despatch box , with wife samantha cameron and children nancy and elwen looking on from the public gallery the government benches were in loud , rampant tumult
it was a high - velocity whizzing which left the labour leader a sorry , smoothiefied splodge on the floor
