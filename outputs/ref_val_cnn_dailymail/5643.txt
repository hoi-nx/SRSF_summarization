' it featured both a portion from the nazi song ' horst-wessel-lied ' and the anthem of soviet - ruled ukraine but the controversy raised a broader question -- how explicitly do artists need to state that allusions to history 's darkest chapters are meant to condemn rather than condone ? the new york youth symphony , which recognizes performers and composers under age 22 , said tarm only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of ' horst-wessel-lied , ' one of the nazis ' main anthems which is banned in modern germany and austria
the symphony said that the nine - minute piece could have been ' an important teaching moment for our students ' but that tarm refused to lay out his reasons for using ' horst-wessel-lied
