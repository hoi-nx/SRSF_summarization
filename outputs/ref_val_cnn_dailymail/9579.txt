more than a dozen dangerous offenders committed terrorism offences while on bail , including jihadist ellekhlifi who fled to syria while on bail for a spate of violent muggings in london more than a dozen dangerous offenders committed terrorism offences while on bail , damning figures have revealed
in the last three years , 13 suspects allowed to walk free for other offences were arrested for breaching anti-terror laws
the figures , obtained by mailonline , also show the shocking scale of offences committed by suspects on bail , with one crime every five minutes
the staggering figures , released by the moj under freedom of information laws , show that nearly 350,000 offences were committed on bail in the last three years
this equates to one offence every five minutes - sparking yet more fears about the state of britain 's justice system
the statistics raise further questions over the monitoring of terror suspects , such as jihadist ellekhlifi , who fled to syria in 2012 while he was on bail for a spate of violent muggings in london
ellekhlifi , 22 , threatened victims with a taser - style high - voltage stun gun and forced them to hand over valuables including designer watches and mobile phones , but fled the country before he could face trial
he is believed to have been two years below emwazi - revealed last week to be jihadi john - at quintin kynaston school in north west london and was killed in 2013 near the city of aleppo
' if courts are not going to remand defendants in jail then we should at least place them under 24 - hour house arrest using electronic tagging to keep them at home rather than free to commit crime
' ellekhlifi ( right ) was killed near aleppo in 2013 alongside mohammed el-araj , from west london ( left ) magistrates have been under mounting pressure in recent years to remand fewer suspects into custody to ease the burden on over-stretched prisons
' jane was murdered by her ex-boyfriend jonathan vass while he was on bail for raping her the shock terror figures come just weeks after it was revealed that one in nine victims of murder or manslaughter were killed by someone on bail
clough , the father of 26 - year - old jane who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend jonathan vass while he was on bail for raping her , said the sheer scale of offences showed change was needed
offenders on bail also committed an average of two rapes a week and a sex assault on a child almost every two days
tory mp mp , a member of the home affairs select committee , said : â these shocking figures indicate how important it is that our judges remember that before granting a suspect bail they consider the risk posed to the general public , including children
the number of sex offences against children by those on bail stands at 134 in the last year the moj could provide figures for , falling from 182 three years ago
meanwhile more than 22,000 violent crimes were committed on bail in the last three years
