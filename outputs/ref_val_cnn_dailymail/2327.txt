wrexham were all set to celebrate their 150th birthday and had their eye on a rather nice present - the fa trophy
coasting at 2 - 0 with just a quarter - hour remaining here at wembley stadium , wrexham had their celebrations well underway
goals from moult and jay harris had the welsh side in complete control but ferriby , who play a division below , forced extra time through liam king âs penalty and kendall âs late leveller
players of united celebrate after winning the fa trophy on penalties then , incredibly , they took the lead as kendall pounced again , only for moult to send this magnificent advertisement for the non-league game to penalties
and so it was wrexham âs steve tomassen , under the pressure of sudden death , who had to be the fall - guy
his penalty was kept out by adam nicklin and so ferriby were the ones who ascended the 107 steps to lift the handsome silver trophy

this was their third visit in as many years - in 2013 , they beat grimsby town in the fa trophy final before returning later in the same campaign for the conference play - offs final , losing to newport county
players of both team prepare for extra time which ended up finishing 3 - 3 after the 30 minutes among those watching on was hull city chairman assem allam , while tigers manager steve bruce had fixed it with his pal sam allardyce for ferriby to use west ham âs training facilities on the eve of the game
the welsh side were backed by some 10,000 supporters and , as expected , they made the early running

kay harris scores to make it 2 - 0 during the fa carlsberg trophy final but it was n't enough for wrexham early in the second - half , there was encouragement for ferriby when jason st juste , an international for saint kitts and nevis , shrugged off steve tomassen and was only denied when coughlin dived at his feet
jay harris , part of the team that won here two years ago , was played into acres of space on the right by connor jennings , raced clear and calmly slotted the ball past adam nicklin

st juste did well to retrieve the ball wide on the left and , cutting in from the byline , he delivered a low cross on a plate for substitute kendall to turn home
kendall is the equivalent of wrexham âs moult

a barrage was only half - cleared and it fell perfectly for moult to thump home sweetly on the half - volley and ensure the drama of penalties
