at some point on thursday morning it will be gone , expunged from the memory , all thoughts turning to a significant european championship qualifier with gibraltar on sunday
an improving northern ireland have their own qualifier against finland and , like the scottish , had an eye on the bigger prize
the 85th - minute corner from debutant ritchie which placed the ball onto the head of goalscoring substitute christophe berra salvaged the night from irrelevance
christophe berra gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for scotland christophe berra celebrates his late goal , which was one of the few memorable moments in a game lacking intensity or quality the ipswich centre back celebrates with his team - mates after securing the win five minutes from time steven fletcher gets a shot away , one of few clear cut chances created by either team , but was unable to put his team ahead the sunderland striker is denied again by mcgovern as he goes through one on one to try and break the deadlock scotland : craig gordon ( mcgregor 45 mins ) , steven whittaker ( russell 78 ) , greer , martin ( christophe berra 45 ) , forsyth , james mcarthur ( james morrison 63 ) , darren fletcher , ritchie , maloney ( naismith 45 ) , steven fletcher ( jordan rhodes 63 ) , anya
goal : christophe berra 85 northern ireland : mcgovern , danny lafferty , jonny evans ( mccullough 81 ) , baird 9hodson58 ) , dallas , reeves ( ryan mclaughlin 70 ) , mcnair , hughes , norwood ( steven davis 69 ) , magennis ( mckay 75 ) , grigg ( paddy mccourt 58 )
â i thought it was important to win this game , â said the scotland boss
northern ireland have improved immensely over the last year , beating hungary and greece
their boss oâneill , an old face on the scottish scene , said : â for us i thought there were more positive than negatives
we left a lot of our first - choice players out , seven or eight of our players that will probably start on sunday [ against finland ]
â christophe berra âs breakthrough came in his first appearance for his country since november 2013
northern ireland 's stuart dallas carries the ball away from maloney as both sides warmed up for competitive football scotland captain darren fletcher issues instructions from his position in front of the back four ikechi anya ( right ) , who was one of scotland 's livelier players , takes on manchester united defender mcnair on the wing it was a reward scotland just about deserved
they had given it a go in the opening half , but looked to have run out of ideas after a raft of substitutions
reared a mile or so from hampden park his endeavour and tempo kept things interesting when an unspecified crowd estimated at less than 30,000 allowed their minds to drift towards the latest plot on coronation street
a sharp cut - back was turned towards goal at the second attempt , northern ireland keeper mcgovern â also hamilton âs keeper â producing a terrific save to push the ball over the bar
dallas goes up for a header against steven whittaker as the two sides attempted to stamp their authority on the friendly fixture bournemouth star ritchie , who made his debut in wednesday night 's game , controls the ball in midfield it took half an hour for another scotland player to have a crack on goal , steven fletcher âs low shot from 18 yards taken comfortably by mcgovern
five years have passed since steven fletcher , sunderland âs Â£ 14million man , last scored for his country
a steven fletcher goal celebration in a scotland shirt is now a solitary event
steven fletcher lasted an hour before accepting that this , once more , would not be his night for a goal
manchester united 's jonny evans ( left ) , the northern ireland captain , holds off steven whittaker as the ball goes past mcgovern gets up well to punch away , under pressure from scotland striker steven fletcher , as mcnair watches on the substitutions are a necessary nuisance in these games
naismith and , critically , christophe berra joined mcgregor as half - time replacements , the hull city no1 replacing celtic âs craig gordon
on the hour mark , james morrison and jordan rhodes â steven fletcher âs replacement - were also handed a half hour to turn things around
for northern ireland , the arrival of the mercurial paddy mccourt - scorer of extraordinary goals for celtic - and former rangers skipper steven davis also raised interest levels
ritchie had better luck with his delivery from a corner five minutes from time when christophe berra claimed his third goal for scotland
and just when northern ireland boss oâneill thought his young , inexperienced side had come through the game unscathed
against a gibraltar team who have shipped 21 goals in four qualifiers , oâneill expects scotland to do likewise
â there is a lot more depth in the scotland squad at this moment in time , â he said
i do nât anticipate gibraltar will give you too many problems
