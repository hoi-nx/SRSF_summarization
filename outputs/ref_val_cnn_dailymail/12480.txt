the family of an unarmed biracial 19 - year - old killed by police in madison , wisconsin , is pushing for peaceful protests online and in the streets
" our hands are stained with the blood of my nephew , and we are all left to deal with the aftermath , " carter , the teen 's uncle , told reporters on monday
carter stressed that his family was n't anti-police , but said tony robinson 's death " highlights a universal problem with law enforcement and how its procedures have been carried out ... specifically as it pertains to the systematic targeting of young black males
" but he said the problem goes beyond the chants of " black lives matter " that have already been used at protests over the case
... we do n't want to stop at just ' black lives matter , ' because all lives matter , " he said
here 's what we know about the friday night shooting
the incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars , madison police chief koval said
dispatchers identified him as tony robinson , according to 911 audio obtained by wkow-tv
a little later , the dispatcher says , " apparently tony robinson hit one of his friends
" about 30 seconds later , an unidentified officer says , " shots fired , shots fired
" when officer kenny went to the apartment , he heard some commotion and forced his way in , koval said
" once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer , " koval said
after that , according to the chief , " the officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject
two brothers shared the other apartment in the duplex , and tony robinson was their friend , bufton said
in 2007 , he shot and killed a man in what the police chief described as a " suicide by cop
during the confrontation friday night , kenny suffered a blow to the head , koval said
" it 's a stressful period for him and his family , but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation , " said palmer , executive director of the wisconsin professional police association
under wisconsin law , officer - involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency , in this case the division of criminal investigation
palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation , but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer
" the real fear for any officer when he 's being attacked , generally speaking , is that their weapon will be taken away , " palmer said , " and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly
" wisconsin circuit court documents indicate tony robinson pleaded guilty in december to an armed robbery that occurred last april
" the police chief refused to comment on tony robinson 's criminal history or run - ins with police
" i frankly think it is , for our purposes today , wholly inappropriate and i am not going to blemish anyone 's character , particularly someone 's as young as his
" on monday , tony robinson 's uncle told reporters his nephew was n't a saint and had made some poor decisions , but was still a " good , kindhearted kid
" " we paint him as a human being , a 19 - year - old who made a terrible mistake at one point , which is completely dissociated from this act , " he said
madison mayor paul soglin , who said he met with tony robinson 's family the night of the shooting , said officials are n't going to put the teen on trial
" " we know that he was not armed , and as far as the police chief and i are concerned ... the fact that tony robinson was involved in any kind of transgression in the past has nothing to do with this present tragedy
" because tony robinson did not have a weapon , the death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police : michael brown in ferguson , missouri
" tony robinson 's racial ambiguity reinforces the fact that american 's racial lines are completely , 100 % blurred , " he said
" koval said he knows it may be difficult for madison to move forward after tony robinson 's death
