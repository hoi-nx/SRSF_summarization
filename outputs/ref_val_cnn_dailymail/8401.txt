cocaine use in uk has trebled in two decades , with a new ' phenomenon ' of rising drugs consumption among people in their forties and fifties
a new government report launched amid concern that cocaine is seen as safe found it is no longer ' the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities '
its authors found the drug is now ' firmly embedded in uk society ' , and warned launching an anti-cocaine campaign could encourage more people to take it
cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens , but there have been significant increases among people in their forties and fifties the advisory council on the misuse of drugs said the drug has spread throughout all areas of society since the mid- 1990s
cocaine use has traditionally been highest among people in their twenties and late teens but while usage among younger age groups has fluctuated in recent years , figures from the office for national statistics show the percentage of over- 35s taking cocaine at least once in the past year increased from 0.8 per cent in 2001/2 to 1.5 per cent in 2013/14 â the equivalent of about 188,000 men and women
use among older adults has been less common , particularly among 45 - 54 year olds
in 2013 - 14 , 1.8 per cent of people aged 34 - 44 took cocaine up from 1.3 per cent a decade earlier
among 45 - 54 - year - olds the figure doubled from 0.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent
but the report said : ' it is notable that there have been statistically significant increases ( 1996 to 2013 - 14 ) across all age groups up to the age of 54 years ; a phenomenon that has not been observed in respect of other drug types
' it could be that more people are taking up cocaine later in life , but the data suggests it is the result of ' continued use among an ageing user cohort ' , suggesting age does not lead to people giving the drug up
cocaine use has trebled in two decades , although the proportion of people saying they have used drugs in the last year has fallen sharply professor iversen , chair of the advisory council on the misuse of drugs , an independent body which advises the government , said : ' consumption of powdered cocaine in the uk has changed radically over the last two decades
' once characterised as the preserve of wealthy bankers and celebrities , the research highlighted in this report shows a cheaper , low - purity version of the drug has permeated society far more widely
cocaine use has now become ' firmly embedded ' in uk society ' given the clear health risks associated with even infrequent cocaine use , and associated issues such as dependency and crime , this development has posed a huge challenge to health professionals , law enforcement , educators and academics
' he added : ' i believe the drug is firmly embedded in uk society
' using data from the crime survey for england and wales , the report said 0.6 per cent of 16 - 59 year - olds took powdered cocaine in 1996 , compared to a peak of 3 per cent - or 885,000 people - in 2008 - 09
while the report said a slight fall in use since 2009 - to 743,000 people in 2013/2014 - could be a sign of a general decline in the uk , mr iversen said it is not yet significant
â a multi-millionaire businessman âs 40 - year marriage was destroyed by his Â£ 6,000 - a - week cocaine addiction which started in middle age , a high court judge said yesterday
the 62 - year - old grandfather , who has not been named , is likely to die if he does not kick his habit , mr justice moor warned during a divorce settlement hearing
â the judge added : â whoever introduced him to cocaine in his early 50s deserves a very long prison sentence as that person has destroyed a 40 - year marriage
