a defiant father - of - ten who has had his christmas lights up for almost five months is refusing to take them down despite being branded a ' pikey '
franklin got a friend to put up the huge festive display on his council house after he suffered a stroke in november
he stopped turning them on in january but said they helped calm his autistic son bradley , 15 , and plans to switch them back on for autism awareness month in april
despite the good cause he has received a poison pen - letter from someone on his street in dunstable , bedfordshire , calling his family ' pikeys ' and the lights ' grotesque ' , ' tacky ' and ' an eyesore '
the letter said : ' i know you live in a council house but there 's no need to make it look like one '
row : defiant father - of - ten franklin is refusing to take down the christmas lights still hanging outside his council house backlash : a neighbour put this poison - pen letter through his door , calling the lights ' grotesque ' and the family ' pikeys ' good cause : mr franklin says that the lights are good for his autistic son bradley so he has kept them up since november mr franklin now says he has even more lights in his garage , which he will add to the collection on his house
sad : franklin , 53 , who lives with wife michele , 46 , who cares for bradley full - time , said the letter upset him the poison pen writer sent an anonymous letter addressed to ' the pikeys that live at number 80 '
it read : ' i am fed up of seeing your grotesque , tacky , council house christmas lights
' i do n't want to keep driving past this eyesore , every time i do my kids scream
' i know you live in a council house but there 's no need to make it look like one
' franklin , 53 , who lives with wife michele , 46 , who cares for bradley full - time , said the letter had upset him but said he planned to put up more lights , rather than take them down
' apart from that they 're going on in april which is autism awareness month , because i have a 15 - year - old autistic son
' response : mr franklin has refused to cave in to pressure and says he will put even more lights up festive cheer : the family believe it brightens up the area but a disgruntled neighbour told them : ' i know you live in a council house but there 's no need to make it look like one ' fundraising : the franklins hope that the display will raise cash for autism charities he added : ' i think the person who sent the letter comes from the posh side of the street
it 's still my house and i 'm proud of it
' we 're going to make sure the house is covered and really give them something to whine about
' one neighbour said a petition was started to try to get franklin to remove the christmas lights , although many residents in the street are divided over the ongoing display
matthew ludley said : ' i heard someone started a petition and a few people had complained , i do n't know who would have sent the letter though
' i 'm not really bothered by the lights being up , it does n't really affect me
there is a big divide between the people who have purchased their houses and the council house lot
conspiracy : mr franklin suspects the rude note came from people on his street ( pictured ) who may have bought their house ' i 'm not offended by the lights , i think if he has been ill then that 's actually a good enough reason not to take them down
beckie louise wrote on facebook : ' absolutely disgraceful ! ! have people lost their minds ? ' is this really causing anyone physical harm ? emotional harm ? physiological harm maybe ? the answer is no. ' i ca n't believe money and resources are being spent on worrying about christmas lights on someone 's house
' franklin , who used to run a pub but is now unemployed , responded to the outcry by saying he has a garage full of more lights which he is now planning to put up next week .
