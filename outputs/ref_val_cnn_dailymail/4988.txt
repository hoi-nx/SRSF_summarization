however , thanks to a new ' life hack ' video from youtube user rumble viral , a pepper is opened up in a matter of seconds without disrupting any of the pips
first the pepper 's top and bottoms are sliced off before the remaining body is cut through on one side
this cuts out the heart of the pepper with all of the seeds included
so that no piece is wasted , the green stalk is popped out of the top of the pepper with the chef pushing it through with his fingers
