burnley boss sean dyche believes dressing - room spats between players are ' a natural occurrence ' at the highest level
city visit turf moor on saturday at the end of a week where the club have been forced to play down reports that captain vincent kompany was dropped following a bust - up with team - mate fernandinho
the row allegedly came at half - time during their defeat by liverpool earlier this month , with neither player in the starting line - up for the clash with leicester three days later
vincent kompany ( left ) and fernandinho ( right ) were involved in a dressing - room row at liverpool but sean dyche dismissed suggestions it was a good time to face city and can understand why passions occasionally run too high
you 've got highly - talented , highly - motivated people , all in a working environment that 's very challenging
it 's not just players , you 're dealing with the whole shebang - pr consultants , agents , pas , who knows what else
there 's always going to be challenges because they 're powerful - minded people , which is why they 're at the top of the game
' vincent kompany was dropped to the bench when city hosted leicester burnley are without a win in two months and sit second bottom of the premier league table , three points from safety
but city and manager manuel pellegrini will certainly not underestimate the burnley after their stunning performance at the etihad in december , when they fought back from 2 - 0 down to claim a draw
but that does n't guarantee us anything this time around
