interest rates are unlikely to rise until the middle of next year as the bank tries to stave off a deflationary spiral , economists said last night
official figures revealed the inflation rate fell to 0 per cent last month â the lowest level since 1960
experts warned britain is now just one month away from deflation as food and petrol prices continue to tumble
delaying a rates rise would mean continued rock - bottom interest rates for mortgage borrowers , but more misery for savers
lower rates would encourage people to spend , rather than save , stimulating demand and pushing up prices
ben brettell , senior economist at stockbrokers hargreaves lansdown , said : â it appears interest rates will be stuck at 0.5 per cent for some time yet â i do nât see them rising until mid- 2016 at the very earliest
the ons found the consumer prices index between february 2014 and february 2015 stood at 0 per cent with wages rising by 1.6 per cent while prices are flat , it means families should see their money going further each month â the bank raises rates to curb inflation , but that is obviously not a problem at the moment , so they will keep them on hold
â john hawksworth , of pricewaterhousecoopers , said the bank was now â under no immediate pressure to raise interest rates â
low inflation , and even deflation , over a short period can be good for the economy and boost family finances , but a continuous fall in prices is harmful
by alex brummer the good news ... and the bad news bargain prices in shops could be used by employers as an excuse to keep wages low , while workers could delay big purchases in anticipation that costs will fall further â triggering a downward spiral
yesterday , prime minister david cameron seemed unconcerned by predictions that prices would fall further , saying britain did not â face the dangerous deflation that some other parts of europe may potentially have a problem with â
he welcomed the lowest inflation rate in 55 years , saying it was â good news for family budgets â , while chancellor george osborne declared that â prices are frozen â
estimates released by the ons show the last time inflation was below 0 per cent was march 1960 â when harold macmillan was prime minister and the beatles had just formed in liverpool
before that , in the late 19th century the prices of goods , property and shares fell sharply provoking a banking crisis similar in scale and danger to that of 2007 to 2009
in the early 18th century the value of the pound was fixed against gold and prices were flat and falling until the outbreak of the napoleonic wars
inflation measures the rise and fall of 700 goods and services , from energy prices to clothing
but it is the plummeting cost of petrol , diesel and food that has dragged down the rate to zero
in the past year , there has been a huge fall in the cost of global wholesale oil , causing prices at the pump to tumble by almost 17 per cent
the ons reported that food prices had fallen by more than 3 per cent in february compared with a year earlier
we still think that deflation in the britain will be a â good â development , giving households â incomes a welcome boost and supporting the economic recovery this year
â chief secretary to the treasury danny alexander said that , as pay rises pull ahead of price increases , people had more money in their pockets , helping â millions of families â
day by day , month by month , britain 's getting stronger : jobs are on the rise , the deficit 's down , the economy 's growing and wages are going further
and there 's more good news for family budgets , with the inflation figures announced today at a record low of zero per cent
david cameron told mailonline the figures were ' more good news for family budgets ' and proof the government 's economic plan is working at a time when the world economy is increasingly unstable , these latest figures are a reminder that we 're on the right track â and that doing things differently would put it all at risk
