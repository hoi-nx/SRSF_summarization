a lawyer for the man accused of shooting two police officers during a protest rally outside the ferguson , missouri , police headquarters last week said on monday that his client was beaten when he was taken into custody , an allegation police called ' completely false
' williams , 20 , had bruising across his back , on both shoulders and his neck , and a welt on his head and a mark on his face , attorney jerryl christmas said , adding that he met with him for two hours on monday but could not take pictures
' he was beat up by the police , ' said christmas
williams had appeared briefly in court on monday morning without counsel and did not enter a plea
the shooting was the latest violent incident in months of demonstrations in ferguson , a st. louis suburb , after a white police officer fatally shot unarmed black teen brown during a confrontation in august
in announcing williams 's arrest on sunday , st. louis prosecutor mcculloch told reporters williams had admitted firing the shots that wounded the officers early on thursday and told authorities he was not shooting at police
' with regard to the allegations that jeffrey williams was ' beaten ' by police , the st. louis county police department calls these allegations completely false , ' spokesman schellman said in a statement
shooting : police take cover after two officers were shot while standing guard in front of the ferguson police station last thursday christmas said williams was taken into custody on a probation warrant and did not know he was being arrested until he was taken for questioning
no one responded monday at the williams address listed in court records , a one - story blue house that had trash strewn on the lawn
police had called the shooting an ' ambush ' of the officers , who were standing side by side , by a gunman embedded with protesters , but mcculloch said on sunday that williams may have been shooting at someone else
' clearly this was not a police ambush and police were never the target , ' christmas said , adding : ' it could have easily been the protesters who got shot instead of the police
' the shooting of the officers followed a flurry of resignations and protests in the week after the u.s. justicedepartment released a damning report accusing ferguson of racially biased policing
