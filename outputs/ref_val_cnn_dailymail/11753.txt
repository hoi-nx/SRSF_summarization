evans ' actions in spitting at cisse were ' simply disgusting ' , a fa regulatory commission ruled
the written reasons for evans ' six - match ban were released by the fa on thursday
' if that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre ? evans ' actions have been described as ' simply disgusting ' by the fa 's regulatory committee both evans and cisse were charged and banned by the fa for spitting , but cisse admitted the offence ' mr evans had ( and has ) a duty of care , if spitting for whatever reason , not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent , or indeed anyone else
' there may , in some quarters , be substantial sympathy for mr evans , but the video evidence shows that he did what he did , and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life , let alone on any football field
