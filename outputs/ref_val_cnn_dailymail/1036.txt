the spanish press has laid into real , and in particular the world 's two most expensive players , ronaldo and bale , after their defeat to barca on sunday
as showed a picture of ronaldo missing from four yards , with the headline ' they missed and they paid for it ' , while marca went with bale 's reaction and the line ' so many misses '
both real - based papers emphasise real 's superiority during the game , with as claiming they ' dominated while modric lasted ' , and attacking bale for ' failing again '
as say real ' missed and they paid for it ' while marca highlight real 's dominance and their misses marca ( left ) refused to give bale a rating , while as said his performance was worth only 4.5 out of 10 marca went even further , refusing to give the welshman a mark in their player ratings
