imagine sitting on a dusty , busy street in new delhi , crowded with vendors and people running quickly about the market
a woman 's lapis - colored sari swishes past you in the golden - colored dusk
you 've been here since morning
a tourist extends a hand with a crumpled paper bill
you try to lift your hand to accept , but you ca n't
the muscles are paralyzed , and your mind ca n't command them to move
you use your knee to balance your arm and grasp the rupee
then you use your foot to pick up your bag and head home for the day
this is everyday life for kumar
kumar , known as bk , contracted polio as a child , and he has learned to adapt to how he moves and lives
kumar has no brothers or father to provide for him , so he moved to new delhi 10 years ago to pursue the only means of income he could -- begging on the streets
photographer elena del estal was in india last year when the world health organization announced that polio had officially been eradicated from the country
she could n't help but wonder about those already living with the crippling effects of this horrible disease
she traveled to a small village near kolkata to meet a little girl who was india 's last case of polio
this gave her the inspiration to begin a long - term project on those suffering in a country that 's now " polio - free
" first she met a boy named dharmender who lived in uttar pradesh , a state in northern india
" elena del estal is a spanish photographer based in india .
