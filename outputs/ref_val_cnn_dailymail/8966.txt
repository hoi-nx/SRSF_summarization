the estranged wife of former clippers owner donald sterling turned her romantic rival 's words against her in court friday , playing a recording that showed her husband showered v stiviano with millions of dollars in gifts
in closing arguments in the trial seeking the return of more than $ 2.8million in community property the sterling acquired over six decades of marriage , sterling 's lawyer relied on the words of miss stiviano to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy
testimony in los angeles superior court was n't as clear - cut even after donald sterling 's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks donald sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of stiviano 's $ 1.8million spanish - style duplex near beverly hills
judge richard fruin jr , who did n't indicate how soon he would rule , had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the donald sterling family 's real estate company to stiviano 's bank accounts
nehoray spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law does n't allow sterling to go after a third party like stiviano because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband
key witness : stiviano was called to testify in the non-jury trial of a lawsuit brought by donald sterling 's wife , which seeks the return of $ 3.6million â say he gave $ 2,000 to a call girl , â nehoray said
â in her testimony earlier friday , stiviano painted two conflicting portraits of donald sterling , saying from the witness stand that he was a kind , generous mentor and father figure to her but was a bigot who was mean to others
sterling , who accused stiviano of fraud when she testified wednesday , has painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and is now out to hurt him
wife speaks : sterling , estranged wife of former clippers basketball team owner donald sterling , and her attorney pierce o'donnell arrive at los angeles superior court friday
mrs sterling painted stiviano as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts stiviano , seen here outside the court thursday , testified that tolerating sterling 's racist moments was ' part of the job ' stiviano has not disputed donald sterling 's largesse , though she has quibbled with the sums at stake and has emphatically denied she used sex to manipulate him
the apparent contradictions finally led sterling 's lawyer , pierce o'donnell , to confront stiviano with the question : â who is the real donald sterling ? â â the real donald sterling is a con artist , a bigot ... he 's mean , he 's despicable , â stiviano replied , before quickly adding that to her , he was â kind , loving , sweet ... a mentor , a father
platonic relationship : the 32 - year - old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the clippers owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature she said , he said : stiviano rejected the idea that she used sexual favors to manipulate the married billionaire and insisted that he was the one who tried to manipulate her in her testimony friday , miss stiviano claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor , and she named a male friend of donald sterling 's who accompanied them on trips to dubai , paris and thailand
sterling said outside court that the assertion was crazy , and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises stiviano
the judge allowed the testimony as stiviano 's lawyer tried to show where large , unexplained checks may have gone from donald sterling 's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $ 1.8million duplex , luxury cars , jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman sterling asserts was his mistress
she has denied that those were her bank accounts , and donald sterling 's lawyers could n't make that connection
the 32 - year - old witness said she had worked for donald sterling 's charity and spent about 12 hours a day with him over more than two years , driving him to view real estate or attending clippers meetings and games together
