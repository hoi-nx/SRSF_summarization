drought caused by climate change may pushed syria towards the devastating civil war currently riping the country apart , according to researchers
a new study has found that many parts of the country were hit by a record dry period between 2006 and 2010 which may have propelled the uprising against the syria regime in 2011
the drought , which scientists say was likely made worse by climate change , destroyed much of the agriculture in the north of the country , driving farmers into cities
this image taken in syria in 2009 shows how drought left farmers unable to grow crops on the parched land the resulting rising urban populations combined with poverty , government mismanagement and other factors combined to trigger the unrest that led to the civil war
the brutal civil war in syria has left a trail of destruction so deep on the landscape that it can be seen from space
an estimated 200,000 people have now been killed and an estimated nine million syria have fled their homes since the outbreak of the war
dr richard seager , a climate scientist at the lamont-doherty earth observatory at columbia university in ny , said : ' we 're not saying the drought caused the war
' a drought of that severity was made much more likely by the ongoing human - driven drying of that region
' the study , published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences , said that the 2006 - 2010 drought was the worst and longest on record compared to those in the 1950s , 1980s and 1990s
nearly half a million people left this area during the drought and 85 per cent of livestock were killed by the lack of water rising city populations and increasing poverty due to the drought led to the 2011 uprising which swelling into outright conflict which is now devastating much of the country like aleppo 's al-shaar neighbourhood above this caused agricultural production to plunge by a third in syria
shahrzad mohtadi , a student at the school of international and public affairs at columbia university who also took part in the research , said that this led to 1.5 million people moving from the countryside to the cities
the initial 2011 uprising and subsequent civil war has now mutated into a complex battle between factions , like the kurdish people 's protection unit pictured above , islamic state fighters and the assad regime writing in the journal , the authors said : ' rapid demographic change encourages instability
