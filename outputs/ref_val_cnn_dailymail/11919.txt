prince charles , pictured today , has been told his letters to ministers must be released despite warnings it would infringe his ' freedom of expression ' prince charles 's ' lobbying ' of ministers is set to continue unabated â even though more than two dozen private letters already written by him on issues of government policy will be made public within weeks
clarence house yesterday expressed its ' disappointment ' that the supreme court ruled the attorney general had acted unlawfully in using a veto to block publication of his so - called ' black spider ' memos
charles has long been accused of bombarding ministers with memos in an attempt to influence policy on issues close to his heart such as the environment , farming , the countryside , gm crops and complementary medicine
the correspondence â nicknamed black spider memos because of charles 's scrawling handwriting and use of underlining and exclamation marks â is said , according to previous attorney general grieve , to contain ' full and frank ' expressions of his ' most deeply held personal views '
in 2012 , however , the attorney general employed a rarely - used ministerial veto to block publication under section 53 of the foi
he said the public could interpret the letters sent to ministers in the last labour government as showing charles ' disagreeing with government policy '

one was whether grieve , the attorney general in 2012 , was right to issue a section 53 certificate under the freedom of information act , effectively blocking publication of the letters
the other question was whether an obscure eu directive â the 2003 environmental information regulations â meant that any specific environmental information contained in charles âs letters must be published
six of the judges said that environmental matters in charles âs letters should be made public under the eu directive
mr david cameron echoed clarence house 's views yesterday , saying : ' this is a disappointing judgment and we will now consider how to release these letters
' david cameron said the ruling was ' disappointing ' and argued that senior royals should be able to communicate with ministers ' confidentially ' but senior royal sources also insisted that charles and his team were quite ' sanguine ' about the decision
