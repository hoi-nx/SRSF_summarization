the fate of flight fu 9525 that was deliberately crashed into the alps has chilling similarities to a number of other aircraft believed to have been downed by flight crew
germanwings pilot lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before ploughing the airbus a320 into the mountain at more than 400mph , killing all 150 on board
the final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by french prosecutors who said lubitz 's sole aim was to ' destroy the plane '
it echoes a number of recent aviation tragedies and could explain what happened to flight mh370 - which vanished last march while flying from kuala lumpur to beijing with 239 people on board
above , workers at the crash site today lubitz 's actions could explain what happened to flight mh370 - which vanished last march while flying from kuala lumpur to beijing with 239 people on board
above , file image of a malaysian airlines aircraft recent analysis of satellite data taken from the lost malaysian airlines flight indicates the aircraft may have been deliberately flown off course - suggesting the pilot took actions similar to lubitz 's
other pilots believed to be responsible for fatal air crashes include herminio dos santos fernandes , who was captain of moza lam flight 470 that crashed in namibia in november 2013
air crash investigators think the embraer 190 jet was flown into the ground by the captain after his copilot went to the toilet , killing all 27 passengers and six crew
herminio dos santos fernandes was believed to have had serious personal problems at the time of his death
when his co-pilot went to the toilet , flight data information recovered from the scene found that herminio dos santos fernandes manually changed the aircraft 's altitude from 38,000 feet to almost 600 feet below ground level
he also pushed the aircraft 's throttles back to idle and selected the jet 's maximum operating speed

it emerged today that co-pilot lubitz made similar changes to his autopilot system - entering a new target altitude of just 96ft moments before the crash
the first relief officer of an egyptair flight was blamed when the aircraft crashed into the atlantic ocean approximately 30 minutes after leaving john f kennedy airport in new york on october 31 , 1999
the boeing 767 - 366 had 14 crew and 203 passengers on board
the ntsb who investigated the disaster blamed the crash on the flight 's relief first officer
the first relief officer of an egyptair flight was blamed when the aircraft crashed into the atlantic ocean some 30 minutes after leaving john f kennedy airport in new york in 1999
above , debris from the downed plane captain al-batouti said he would relieve the current pilot - even though he was n't due on the flight deck for a further three hours
the co-pilot remained with al-batouti , but when the co-pilot went for a toilet break , the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into the sea , killing everyone on board
the cockpit flight recorder heard al-batouti claim in arabic ' i place my fate in the hands of god ' before the aircraft hit the ocean
el-batouty even shut down the aircraft 's engines , which prevented his co-pilot from saving the aircraft
according to the ntsb ' the probable cause of the crash of egyptair flight 990 was the airplane 's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the atlantic ocean as a result of the relief first officer 's flight control inputs
' the reason for the relief first officer 's actions was not determined
' in december 1997 , a boeing 737 with 97 passengers and seven crew crashed into the musi river in southern sumatra , indonesian
the ntsb investigated this crash as it involved a us - built aircraft and determined that the jet crashed due the ' direct flight control inputs ' of the pilot , probably the captain
however , in both cases , egyptian and indonesian authorities do not accept that either of their pilots would have deliberately crashed their own aircraft .
