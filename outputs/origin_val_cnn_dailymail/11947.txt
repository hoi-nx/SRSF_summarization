the lapd have claimed he was trying to take an officer 's gun at least one officer was wearing a recording device during the encounter , and surveillance cameras were also overlooking the street
more witnesses are also thought to have filmed the killing on their cell phones

when asked whether the man reached for a policeman 's gun , he said : ' my footage do n't say that , my eyes did n't see that
' yolanda young , another bystander , said : ' he did n't bother nobody , he did n't have no weapon , they just shot him
' jerome guillory , who also saw the attack , said : ' there was no reason to do that to him , the guy , he was n't no threat to them

fight : at the beginning of the encounter , the man is seen taking swings at several police officers on skid row confronted : he was being confronted over reports of a robbery before five shots were fired he told the la times : ' that man never was a threat - the amount of officers present at the time could have subdued him
' daily mail online spoke with a close friend of africa on monday , who said the man moved to los angeles sixth months ago , and had a combination of mental illness and drug addiction problems
nick said the man âs real first name is booth , but people called him â africa â because he was originally from cameroon
â booth was trying to get back home to africa but he did nât have no money , that âs why he was homeless , â nick said
â â i talked to him a lot of days , he was a very respectful , honest man
he did nât bother nobody , he would sit in his tent reading his bible
â he told me about his family and he said he had to go back home to take care of some things
â â he do nât have nobody out here so i would come down and help him out , get him food , some money , a cigarette , â he said
nick said police had responded not because of a robbery but because booth was arguing with a neighbor who lived in a tent next to his
â a lot of guys who know him would have helped calm him down , the police know the man , they talk to him everyday , ask him to take his tent down , â he said
friend : nick gee spoke to daily mail online about the man who was shot dead tributes : flowers were left by the man 's skid row tent monday as people attacked the lapd for the killing â you âre dealing with a guy with a combination of mental illness and drug addiction , they used over excessive force

â the lapd has its own investigation into the killing , which will ' determine whether the use of deadly force was consistent with lapd policies and procedures '
la county 's district attorney 's office will also conduct its own probe
last night , lapd spokesman andy smith insisted that the shots only came after the struggle over a firearm
he told reporters : ' during the attempt to detain him , this individual resisted our officers
theys struggled with him , they tried to tase him a couple of times
' ' that was ineffective and eventually the struggle occurred where the officers that were struggling with the individual over one of the officer 's weapons
