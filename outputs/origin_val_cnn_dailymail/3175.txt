workers at the u.s. government 's forest service have been asked to use online tests to check whether they are secretly racist , or harboring other biases
the federal employees were asked to use work time to take tests , lasting some 15 minutes each , to see whether they have unconscious biases based on sexuality , nationalist , race and whether somebody is disabled
the practice was reported on by the washington times , which said the directive to take the harvard quizzes came from forest management director bryan rice
test : employees were asked to take assessments such as the above on race , where users alternate between sorting black and white people , then good and bad qualities
the speed with which they do it determined underlying bias , according to the study he also reportedly asked bosses at other federal agencies to spread links to the harvard tests , hosted at implicit.harvard.edu
idea : bryan rice , pictured , sent the tests round to staff the tests are a kind of word association game , which flashes up emotions or qualities such as ' happy ' , ' agony ' and ' laughter ' , which users must sort into ' good ' and ' bad ' categories
these are then mixed with elements of the category being tested - for example the race test flashes up pictures of black and white faces
participants complete several rounds of testing , first being instructed to associate all the ' good ' words with one race , then the other
the more quickly and accurately they make each association - good or bad - the stronger their underlying bias is said to be
bryan rice asked his workers to take two tests each , and said they would be discussed in a later meeting
an unnamed congressional source suggested to the washington times that the tests are a waste of time , and the agency should focus on stopping forest fires
defending himself , bryan rice said : ' the unconscious bias material can help us explore diversity and inclusion in the workplace
' it was included in a discussion of diversity as part of a continuous series of collaborative discussions on a variety of topics we have on my staff that cover key forest service policies and values as a means of fostering continued awareness
' federal agency : bryan rice urged leaders of departments other than his slice of the forest service to start using the tests
