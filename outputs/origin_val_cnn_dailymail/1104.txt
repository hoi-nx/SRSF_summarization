at least 52 dogs have died after being struck down by an horrific kidney disease , vets have warned
in the first recorded outbreak of alabama rot to be reported in uk , dogs have fallen ill and died up and down the country
pet owners are warned to look out for lesions on their dogs ' legs as vets continue to search for the cause of the disease
the disease was unknown in this country until november 2012 , when reports started emerging of dogs dying mysteriously in the new forest , hampshire outbreaks of alabama rot , which attacks blood vessels in the skin and kidneys , have affected dogs in the us as long ago as the 1980s
but the disease was unknown in this country until november 2012 , when reports started emerging of dogs dying mysteriously in the new forest , hampshire
the results of an investigation into the outbreak , published last night in the journal veterinary record , reveal the full horror of the disease
although the initial cases were reported in hampshire , incidents have since been confirmed across english and wales , from somerset in the south west to county durham in the north east
unlike the us cases , which have only affected greyhounds , the uk outbreak has caused problems to a wide variety of different breeds
it has affected english springer spaniels , flat coated retrievers , whippets , labradors - dogs of all shapes and sizes from a cocker spaniel to a doberman
there have been 103 suspected incidents reported by vets , lead researcher walker told the daily mail last night , although only 52 of those have been confirmed by postmortem examinations
all those dogs died - either killed by the disease or put down by their vets
unlike the us cases , which have only affected greyhounds , the uk outbreak has caused problems to a wide variety of different breeds , including this retriever erin who died from the disease mr walker , a vet who practises in hampshire , said the team 's investigation had not established why the disease had so suddenly sprung up , how it had arrived in uk , or why certain dogs had been affected
but he warned pet owners to remain alert to symptoms
' the main message is that we are still seeing cases spring up
although the numbers are relatively small , continued vigilance is the best thing
people should look out for skin lesions when the dog has n't obviously been cut on something
' he admitted much remains unknown about the problem
' we do n't know whether this is a condition that has been in the uk for a while , but just was unrecognised , or whether it had recently emerged , ' he said
one of the many dogs struck down the disease was tegan , a three - year - old fox terrier cross , who died in february 2014 after walking near ashurst in the new forest
the scientists are still investigating whether the disease was caused by environmental factors such as a bacteria or virus , or whether the problem was genetic - this spaniel , jess , died of the disease her owner sarah thairs , of north baddesley , hampshire , took her to the vet but her condition worsened and tegan died soon afterwards
she said at the time : ' my poor little girl had been through so much
' tests showed the disease had gone to her pancreas
i had to make the decision to put her down , which is heartbreaking
' the investigation found no obvious link between any of the dogs - even those who became ill within a few days in the new forest
mr walker said : ' when we looked at all their walking routes and other factors , we could find nothing in common
' the results rule out early theories that the dogs had been poisoned by contaminated food
they also ruled out a link to the e.coli shiga toxin , another early theory
the scientists are still investigating whether the disease was caused by environmental factors such as a bacteria or virus , or whether the problem was genetic
they are comparing it to a similar human disease of the kidneys , called haemolytic uraemic syndrome , which is genetic but can be caused by exposure to certain medications , to see whether it can offer any clues .
