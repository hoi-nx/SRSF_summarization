jon stead ( left ) is disappointed his side could n't beat reading despite dominating for long periods hope akpan ( centre ) goes past francois zoko during the fa quarter - final clash at valley parade ' we are disappointed because we feel we can do better
' in the second half we pinned them in for long spells but we needed a goal
we limited them to a few chances
' we 're still in the hat but there 's a little bit of disappointment that we have n't gone through
it 's half a job
andrew davies ( 5 ) heads the ball wide of the reading goal in one of many chances bradford had to score yakubu ( right ) bursts forward but was unable to score past a formidable bantams defence at valley parade ' we 've still got to go and do the business down there
there 's great belief in the players and the staff and we 'll give it everything we 've got
' manager phil parkinson was more upbeat , saying on bt sport : ' were still in the hat so we 're pleased with that
' you 've got to give reading credit , they came and made it difficult
it was a cagey old affair
i thought our lads did excellently in a different type of way than sunderland
phil parkinson ( centre ) was pleased with his side 's overall performance in a tightly fought encounter ' we had to be very professional and wait for the moment to arrive
in the second half we had the momentum but we did n't have that touch of class in and around the box
' we look forward to the replay
everyone will be expecting reading to win that one but you never know what can happen on the night
we know they 'll approach it differently and look to open up
' when we went to stamford bridge , it was a day out , no one expected us to get through
' reading set out their stall early on to be hard to beat but manager steve clarke knows the job is far from done yet
the facial injury received by alex pearce showed how physically demanding the contest was he said : ' we came here and decided to roll up our sleeves
we knew we 'd have to battle , fight for every second ball and see if we could produce something
' we hit the post twice and on another day we could have nicked something
but it was a fair result
' there was never really a moment where i was too worried
we were in the game from the first minute , and we were determined to get them back to our place if that was the best we could do
' i think both teams will fancy their chances so let 's get it on
