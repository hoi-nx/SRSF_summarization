the beginning of mls 's 20th season can not come quickly enough for its newest , and arguably most highly anticipated , member
ever since manchester city announced that nycfc would help form the us branch of the all - encompassing city football group ( cfg ) empire , huge doubts of skepticism have rained over the big apple and beyond
when someone like sheikh mansour , whose personal wealth stretches towards Â£ 20billion , becomes involved with a sporting venture it 's natural to assume huge swathes of spending will swiftly follow
david villa is expected to make his mls debut against orlando city fc on sunday for new york city new york city make their mark off the pitch with stellar signings and aggressive advertising to sell seats after all , there is no institution on planet football which has the kind of structure cfg have attempted to build
the yokohama f-marinos were purchased last may while melbourne city are enjoying the fruits of their abu dhabi association
nycfc manager kreis and his squad enjoyed time rubbing shoulders and tapping into manuel pellegrini 's knowledge last month
a simply priceless opportunity not afforded to others
yet mls does n't operate like the premier league , or anywhere else for that matter
the sheik 's incredible Â£ 1.2b investment in manchester will not be replicated here
with strict , and at times mind - numbingly convoluted , rules ensuring spending does n't exceed strict guidelines , nycfc have n't been able to scour the world and bring a bucket load of superstars to manhattan
kreis was swiftly brought in by former manchester city midfielder claudio reyna who is now the club 's sporting director
forty - two - year - old kreis is highly rated in the us following an impressive seven year - spell with real salt lake city where he won the mls cup in 2009
with the franchise being based in new york city , a place where the biggest names come to play , the money men in the middle east were acutely aware just how important it was to bring excitement to the table
nycfc manager kreis and his squad rubbed shoulders with manuel pellegrini 's manchester city nycfc start their season on sunday in front of a 60,000 crowd against fellow new franchise orlando city putting bums on seats was vital - a view not shared by the red bulls
star men thierry henry and tim cahill have not been replaced with faith placed in younger , hungrier players
the natives at the red bull arena are far from happy
nycfc though knew big names had to arrive especially at the inception with a temporary home at yankee 's stadium in the bronx not the ideal base to spend the first three years
a soccer specific stadium is in the pipeline â yet , as david beckham is finding out in miami , locating real estate for sporting venues in major us cities is anything but straightforward
so in came david villa and , protractedly , frank lampard
both stellar signings tap into the fervent , cosmopolitan football fanbase here
villa ticks all the boxes for the spanish speaking fans who pack the bars when barcelona and real madrid strut their stuff in la liga
providing the 33 - year - old steers clear of injury , it would be a shock if the former barcelona forward does n't get 20 goals or more
the slow paced , pretty much championship standard of mls will ensure a player of his class will provide defences with more than their fair share of nightmares
expect him to drop deep , yet still cause all manner of problems in kreis ' preferred diamond formation
frank lampard poses with the manhattan behind him after his introduction as a new york city player villa and frank lampard ( pictured ) have helped sell seats and season tickets as the mls prepares to get going orlando city tweeted this about how frank lampard wo n't be there and wrote : ' sorry , frank lampard - we 're sold out ' frank lampard too will have fun even if his signing was woefully handled by all concerned
new york city are not used to being forced to settle for second best
and they wasted no time in showing their discontent
with the former chelsea midfielder 's name plastered all over billboards along with villa , his arrival was the trigger which helped secure 14,000 season tickets sales
naturally when news broke of his decision to stay in the premier league until the end of the season , there was anger
manchester city hoodwinked mls commissioner don garber who , for someone who rules with such autonomy , was shown to be a touch naive throughout the whole ' will he , wo n't he ' saga which always looked like having an outcome which would n't benefit new york city
the fury , though , also indicated there are people who already care
when kick - off arrives on sunday at a sell - out 60,000 in orlando , frank lampard wo n't be on their minds frank lampard was a major signing for nycfc but will not play on sunday as he remains with manchester city yet when kick - off arrives on sunday at a sell - out 60,000 againt fellow new franchise orlando city , frank lampard wo n't be at the forefront of anyone 's thoughts
with us midfielder diskerud signing from rosenbourg , kreis is building a strong core while a contingent from south america and europe add flair excitement - and something of the unknown
' we have players who want to play , who like to play one and two touch and excite the crowd , ' said 24 - year - old diskerud , who was part of jurgen klinsmann 's world cup squad last summer
' i definitely think that we are starting history here
' with the red bulls based in new jersey â a minimum 30 - minute train ride away from manhattan â nycfc have advertised aggressively to make their mark
brazilian star kaka will play for the new mls franchise orlando city , who nycfc face on sunday community projects have flourished for the past two years following the creation of the manchester city soccer schools in harlem while the tie - in with the new york yankees â one of the most famous and iconic sporting brands in the world â should not be underestimated
building a team which will be competitive wo n't be easy
yet if the honeymoon period stretches over a few victories , who knows where the feel good factor could take manchester city 's latest potshot at glory
an indelible mark has already been made off the pitch
now 's the time to start producing on it
kaka - orlando city the brazilian won the ballon dâor back in 2007 , so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new mls franchise orlando city
he may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass
frank lampard â new york city fc one of two high - profile signings made by new york city on their introduction to the league
frank lampard won more than 100 caps for england and 11 major trophies with chelsea in 13 years
he is due in new york city in the summer once he has finished playing with manchester city
gerrard â galaxy the liverpool midfielder will become the second former england captain to join galaxy following the successful period of david beckham
like frank lampard , gerrard will not join galaxy until the summer once the premier league has finished
he will link up with former reds team - mate robbie keane
david villa - nycfc villa became new york city âs first marquee signing when he joined after helping atletico madrid win la liga last season
he has spent time on loan at melbourne city in the australian a league and he will be expected to score the bulk of new york city âs goals in their debut season
bradley wright-phillips - red bulls overshadowed by brother shaun in england but since moving to mls he has been the star man for the red bulls
he won the golden boot last season with 27 goals in 32 games
with the departure of thierry henry and tim cahill he could struggle to score as many this term .
