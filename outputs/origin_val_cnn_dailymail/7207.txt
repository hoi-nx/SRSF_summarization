until then , we will not make any comment on the report
' cycling independent reform commission was a key part of cookson 's campaign pledge ahead of his election as uci president in september 2013

' we should all prepare ourselves for that , ' cookson said
' when you open a can of worms , you find a lot of worms
it 's going to be very interesting to see
' he also promised transparency , where legally possible
he added : ' we 're not going to get into a fifa - type situation of arguing about the report
' if they want to redact anything , they can redact it
they may well give us some unredacted information as well , but the report that they give us will be the report that they say is able to go into the public domain
' the investigation centred on the uci 's dealings with doping findings and allegations during the late 1990s and early 2000s , including its handling of claims against armstrong , who has since admitted to using performance - enhancing drugs cycling independent reform commission was established in january 2014 , with its terms of reference announced the following month
cycling independent reform commission is independent from the uci , chaired by switzerland 's former state prosecutor dick marty and included peter nicholson , an australian who has investigated war crimes for the united nations
professor ulrich haas from germany , a specialist in anti-doping rules who works for the court of arbitration for sport , is the third person on the commission
the key to the commission 's success may hinge on whether cookson 's predecessors agreed to give evidence

' i think the sport is definitely making a lot of headway in trying to improve its image and and putting the past behind us ' whether the cycling independent reform commission report does enough to leave the past behind in a sport which is still beset by doping remains to be seen .
