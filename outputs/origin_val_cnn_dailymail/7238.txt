a pet dog that got trapped in a tiny six - inch gap between two walls has been rescued by twelve firefighters
soap , a pole and webbing were used by emergency services after they were called to the house in west hollywood around 3.40pm on monday
department described the rescue as ' creative '
' each time the dog would whimper or cry , he âd fall deeper into the six - inch gap
' as the dog moved , it would become wedged more tightly between the walls
' first responders were unable to break the walls to rescue the dog , so they got creative
' firefighters slid a pike pole , which is normally used to pull down ceilings during a fire , under the dog to prevent him from falling further
they then tied webbing around his paws and pulled him out ( left ; right after the rescue ) firefighters slid a pike pole , which is normally used to pull down ceilings during a fire , under the dog to prevent him from falling further
