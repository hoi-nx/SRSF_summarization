seven - year - old faith lennox never thought she needed a left hand ; after all , she could n't remember losing hers when she was only 9 months old
the 7 - year - old , grabbed the replacement as soon as it came off a 3 - d printer on tuesday in los alamitos , california
she put it on and raced off on her bicycle
later , faith happily showed off the hand to others , flexing its pink and blue fingers as she gripped her small , stuffed ' nemo ' fish
the prosthetic was constructed overnight at the build it workspace
it represents a breakthrough in small , lightweight hands that are economical and easy for children to use
particularly when she got to pick the colors â her favorite pink , blue and purple , like the ones on the tank top she was wearing
it did n't hurt , either , that the appendage , called a robohand , looks a lot like the pair marvel superhero iron man wears
' it 's really cool ! ' the otherwise shy little girl said with an exuberant grin as she stood surrounded by high - tech computers in the build it workspace in this orange county suburb on monday
build it workspace is a 3d printer studio that teaches people to use high - tech printers and provides access to them for projects
it also does commercial printing
she had gotten out of school early to go there with her mother , nicole , to watch in fascination as her new hand began to take shape
she stood for several minutes transfixed as it slowly moved from computer image to hard - plastic reality
the finished product will be the result of an emerging technology that is revolutionizing prosthetics , said build it 's lengsfeld , especially for children like faith , who quickly outgrow expensive prosthetic limbs and have trouble even using them because of their size and weight
many functions : faith lennox , 7 , rides her bicycle with her newly 3d printed hand outside the build it workspace parking lot on tuesday cool tricks : lennox holds a ' nemo ' plastic fish as his daughter faith grabs it with her newly 3d printed hand as her mother , nicole and build it workspace president , lengsfeld , looks on ' it 's an amazing thing to be doing , ' the company 's president and founder said of making a hand that weighs less than a pound out of the same kind of plastic used in automobile parts
although lengsfeld 's company has printed out everything from pumps for oil and gas companies to parts for unmanned aerial vehicles , this is the first hand he and his three employees have built
airwolf , whose printers built faith 's hand , recently cranked out 200 hands for children around the world as part of an international competition to see which company could use the most 3d printers in one space at one time
airwolf , with 159 printers going , won by one , said the company 's creative director , tyler caros , who was keeping watch on monday as the hard plastic going into faith 's hand slowly unspooled
in love with her hand : faith lennox , 7 , left , forms a heart with her newly 3d printed hand on tuesday going for a ride : faith lennox , 7 , adjusts her helmet before riding her bicycle with her newly 3d printed hand outside build it workspace in los alamitos , california the oldest of three children , faith had compartment syndrome when her position during childbirth cut off the flow of blood to her left forearm , irreparably damaging tissue , muscle and bone
after nine months of trying to save the limb , doctors determined they had to amputate just below the elbow
faith 's parents were working with the nonprofit group e-nable to get her a 3d - printed hand , but the technology is so new there 's a waiting list , her mother said
then she learned of what lengsfeld 's company could do from a friend whose son visited with his scout troop
e-nable provides open - source technology for building the hand , lengsfeld said , making it economical for anyone with the right printer and a set of instructions to create one
faith 's only costs $ 50 , and when she outgrows it she can easily build a bigger replacement
' it 's been an honor to help her , ' he said
the little girl who taught herself to swim at age 3 and surfs with her father already knows what she plans to do when she puts that new hand on
' ride my bike ! ' she said with a big grin
although she 's already a competent rider , she noted that making turns with just one hand can be a little tricky
