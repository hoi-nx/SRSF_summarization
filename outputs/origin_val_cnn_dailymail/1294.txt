saturday is the day when love of math and a hankering for pastry come full circle
the date is 3 - 14 - 15 , the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi : 3.141592653
the best times to celebrate are at 9:26 and 53 seconds , morning and evening , and the occurence wo n't happen again until march 2115
on saturday the date is 3 - 14 - 15 , the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi : 3.141592653
pi day is celebrated on march 14th ( 3/14 ) around the world
pi ( greek letter â Ï â ) is the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant â the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter â which is approximately 3.14159
' it 's a portal into this magical mysterious world of mathematics , ' said university of california berkeley mathematician and author frenkel
' pi is the constant used to calculate the area of a circle , as in pi times the radius squared , but it appears all over other parts of mathematics
it ' is kind of a basic atomic building block ' for math , said temple university mathematician and author john paulos , who was interviewed at precisely 3:14:15 p.m. in some places , pi day is celebrated with the edible type of pie
' it 's a real exciting moment for math enthusiasm , ' said nathan kaplan , a yale university math professor , who called it a time for people to ' remember how much fun they found some of the stuff in school
' kaplan acknowledged that most people do n't really recall math as fun , blaming that on how it 's taught : ' there 's fun stuff out there in the quantitative world
' one interesting aspect of pi is that it is irrational , which means the decimals after 3 go on to infinity with no repeating patterns
yet in 1897 , a bill before the indiana legislature tried to round it up to 3.2
' we can not change it
it 's not subject to opinion or taste or time , ' frenkel said
' how many things like this in the universe mean the same thing to everyone through time and space ? ' this pi story goes full circle , with exactly 314 words
in honor of mathematical constant 's designated day , mit will be announcing its ' regular action ' admissions on march 14 , 2015 at 9:26 a.m. et. celebrating pi day is n't new for the prestigious college , but this year is extra special , as the date aligns perfectly with pi 's first eight numbers : 3.1415926
pi has been calculated to over one trillion digits beyond its decimal point
as an irrational and transcendental number , it will continue infinitely without repetition or pattern
while only a handful of digits are needed for typical calculations , pi âs infinite nature makes it a fun challenge to memorize , and to computationally calculate more and more digits .
