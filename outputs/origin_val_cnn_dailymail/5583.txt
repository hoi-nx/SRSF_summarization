manchester united benchwarmer falcao sent a message to louis van gaal with two clinical finishes for colombia in their friendly in bahraini on thursday night
falcao struck twice in four minutes for colombia 's second and third goals in a 6 - 0 thrashing of the world no 103 - ranked side at the bahrain national stadium
the 29 - year - old has been craving regular football having not started for his club since february 28 but delivered as he so often has for national team head coach pekerman
falcao celebrates the second of his two goals for colombia in their friendly against bahraini out - of - favour manchester united striker watches his first strike , a classy volley , hit the bottom corner 1 arnoldo iguaran 24 goals in 68 games 2 falcao 23 in 55 3 faustino asprilla 20 in 57 4 freddy rincon 17 in 84 5 vã­ctor aristizabal 15 in 66 6 teofilo gutierrez 14 in 37 adolfo valencia 14 in 37 8 ivan valenciano 13 in 29 antony de avila 13 in 54 10 james rodriguez 12 in 32 willington jose ortiz 12 in 49 first though , falcao was the provider for fellow striker carlos bacca to open the scoring on 14 minutes after chelsea 's juan cuadrado hit the post early on
showing strength at the back post falcao headed back to bacca at the top of the six - yard box for the sevilla marksman to drill home the finish
captain falcao then stepped up in the 32nd minute to get himself on the scoresheet with a clinical left - footed volley after a looping ball over the top of the flagging bahraini defence
falcao 's second came moments later , again with a first - time finish , but this time after his explosive run between defenders was met with a well - weighted through ball
the strike , which it must be said took a significant deflection , took falcao 's international tally to 23 in 55 matches , just one short of his country 's all - time top - scorer arnoldo iguaran 's 24 from 68
carlos bacca drills home colombia 's first goal after a strong header from falcao set him up falcao pierces through the hapless bahraini defence on thursday night as he enjoys valuable game time defender abdulla khaled al-haza'a brings down falcao wide on the right during their friendly after the break borussia dortmund 's adrian ramos came on to add his second goal in as many international showings after a deft pass from inter milan 's fredy guarin for 4 - 0
after pekerman decided his star man had had enough after 72 minutes , real valladolid 's johan mojica and mexico - based andres renteria came off the bench to continue his work with goals five and six respectively to wrap up the mismatch
despite his personal tally getting a boost , falcao made a point to commend his team 's effort after the match
' great victory today against bahraini , ' he wrote on his instagram page
' the most important think , the amazing team work ! ! ! go colombia
' falcao has scored just four times in 22 appearances since coming to old trafford on loan from monaco and is almost certain to go elsewhere in the summer
colombia 's andres renteria , who plays for santos laguna in mexico , beats said ahmad jaffer for the sixth chelsea 's juan cuadrado shoots in colombia 's 6 - 0 win at the bahrain national stadium in riffa bahraini keeper sayed mohammad jafar makes himself big as falcao comes close for a third colombia enjoy support away from home in bahraini as they continue preparations for the copa america but with some sharp running and eagle eye for goal - at least twice - he showed glimpses of the reasons why the club thought him worthy of Â£ 260,000 - a - week for this season
he should have left the pitch with a hat - trick , to be fair , with a golden chance at the far post on 49 minutes squandered following a poor bahraini clearance from a free - kick
falcao 's last goal for van gaal 's side came on january 31 when he scored manchester united 's second in a 3 - 1 defeat of leicester
his most recently involvement under van gaal has been minimal - as an 83rd minute substitute in wins against liverpool and tottenham after being hooked after 68 minutes with manchester united 1 - 0 up against sunderland - as the dutchman puts his faith in wayne rooney with support from danny welbeck and juan mata in the absence of robin van persie
colombia 's match in riffa served as a warm - up for the copa america in chile from june 11 to july 4 at which they will be hoping to see the return of real madrid 's james rodriguez who is still recovering foot injury .
