eating nuts and peanuts reduces the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke , a new study claims
researchers found they were linked with a reduced risk of death from heart disease among people on low incomes
and they believe their findings suggest peanuts may be a cost - effective measure to improve cardiovascular health because they are so cheap
however experts cautioned today that salt - covered nuts would not have the same health benefits
the new study , led by dr shu , of the vanderbilt university school of medicine , tennessee , analysed various groups of people
one involved 72,000 low - income black and white men and women living in the us , the other 134,000 men and women living in shanghai , chinese
in both groups , men ate more peanuts than women
in the us group , about half of the nuts consumed were peanuts , and in the chinese group only peanut consumption was assessed
catherine collins , principal dietitian at st george 's hospital nhs trust , said : ' research over the past few years has shown heart - health benefits of including nuts and legumes ( like peanuts ) as part of a varied diet
' this is probably because nuts and peanuts contribute a valuable source of protein , dietary fibres , healthy fats , vitamins b1 , b6 , folic acid , vitamin e , magnesium and zinc to the diet
although almost half the weight of a peanut is fat ( 48 % ) , the majority is of the heart - healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated types
studies where nuts have been added to the diet ( such as the european predimed study ) , and long - term population studies have consistently shown a reduction in death from heart disease when nuts and legumes are included in the diet
the researchers found that across the board , eating nuts reduced the risk of death from heart disease
this was regardless of gender , race , bmi , smoking , alcohol consumption and conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity
in the us , the highest consumption resulted in a risk reduction of 21 per cent
in the chinese group , it was 17 per cent
dr shu said : ' we observed no significant associations between nut or peanut consumption and risk of death due to cancer and diabetes
' she added the findings highlight the large public health impact of nut or peanut consumption in lowering deaths from heart disease - especially given their affordability
the research was published in jama internal medicine
dr mitchell katz , deputy editor of the journal , added : ' of course , peanuts are not really nuts - they are legumes since they grow in bushes , unlike tree nuts
nuts reduced the risk of death regardless of gender , race , bmi , smoking , alcohol consumption and conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity ' but who cares if they help us to live longer at an affordable price ? ' however experts have cautioned that people should not start eating ' large quantities ' of nuts and peanuts in light of the research
commenting on the findings , professor peter weissberg , medical director at the british heart foundation , said : ' this large study found that death rates from heart attacks were lower in people who eat nuts , particularly peanuts , than in those who do n't
' however , the data do not show that the more peanuts you eat the lower the risk of a fatal heart attack , so people should not start eating large quantities of nuts , particularly salted nuts , in the hope that it will protect them from heart disease
' the results suggest that including a modest amount of nuts as part of a well - balanced diet may be of benefit
