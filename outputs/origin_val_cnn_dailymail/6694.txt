hidden in a vault in marrakesh , it has been one of the most highly - anticipated albums in music history
and tonight , after six years , the wu-tang clan finally opened the handcrafted silver box that holds their unheard record wu-tang clan - before sealing it away once more
in an attempt to break free from the spotify and youtube era of freely - shared music , rap 's most influential collective is selling the 31 - track double lp to one bidder for millions of dollars
after a private online - only sale this month through art dealers paddle8 - which employs british 's princess eugenie - the buyer can not share the album for at least 88 years
dailymail.com was there with the group 's de facto leader rza , producer cilvaringz , a small group of prospective buyers and half a dozen selected fans in queens , new york , for the first and last time any of the album would be played before the year 2103
it has been six years in the making the record comes in a silver , jeweled box with a specially - designed wax seal and a leather - bound book the box : it was displayed for potential buyers who are expected to pay millions to obtain the sole incarnation the staten island - born group revived the east coast as an epicenter for hip hop in the early 1990s confirming the rumors that she would make a guest appearance , cher 's voice bellowed out during the 13 - minute extract
and though it was n't played , dailymail.com understands it to be true that barcelona fc players also make a cameo appearance
typical of the group 's first record 36 chambers , it features styles that shook the music scene in 1994 - soul samples , clips of dialogue from movies , and fierce rapping over sound effects of rain and thunder
reiterating its own grandeur , there are regular skits and pieces of dialogue that say , ' this has never been done before
' all of the staten island clan 's eight living members appear on it - but had no idea what they were recording when they laid down their parts
the record casing was handcrafted from silver and wood by artists in morocco , with a seal designed and printed by wax - smiths in serbia
' this has never been done before , ' rza told dailymail.com after playing the record
' music is just handed out now , the industry is in crisis
people feel like they deserve to have it for free
this is art. you can take a picture of the mona lisa but that 's not art. ' the same with this : you can never reproduce it - this is the final thing
' the pre-sale event played up to the idea
those invited were subjected to airport - style security checks , and electronic devices were confiscated
in a dark room , buyers spoke to auctioneers as light symphony music played
the nickel silver and jeweled case with black cow leather lining was sat on a podium under spotlight , with two bodyguards standing either side
while some were fans , others were advisers who hailed from as far as asia to inspect the ' artwork '
one adviser for a chinese collector , who wished to remain anonymous , told dailymail.com collectors are clamouring to get their hands on the record and its silver box - whether they like wu-tang clan or not
the box comes inside a cedar wood treasure chest covered with black cow leather and light beige velvet lining
inside , is a cinematic - style record , plus a leather - bound 174 - page manuscript printed on gilded fedrigoni marina parchment with lyrics , credits , tales about the recording
the adviser said : ' someone said it would be worth $ 1 million
this is something completely different ; completely new
i do n't think i could put a price on it
' the concept has not been seen before - and from the biggest rap collective in history ... it is huge
' the wu-tang clan formed in the early 1990s , reviving the east coast 's reputation as an epicenter for hip hop
rza - pronounced ' rizza ' - drew together nine mcs , including his own cousins who adopted the pseudonyms ol ' dirty bastard and gza
the remaining slots were filled by raekwon , masta killa , u-god , ghostface killah , method man , and inspectah deck
ambition : rza , nÃ© rza , wants the long - awaited album to be treated like a work of art unlike their other albums , it has not been produced by the group 's de facto leader rza ( pictured ) but by his apprentice , morocco rapper and producer tarik ' cilvaringz ' azzougar the new album pays homage to the wu-tang clan 's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry with industry domination in their sights , rza saw that each member of the wu-tang clan was signed with different production companies , while maintaining their loyalty as a group
their first album , 36 chambers , was hailed as unprecedented , with samples from soul music and kung fu movies
spanning 128 minutes , the stories and rhymes were largely recorded in staten island , new york , and hark back to their original mid- 90s lyrics about the shaolin
it features all eight of the original members plus some affiliate rappers
and as for cher 's cameo appearance , rza said : ' did nobody ever have a crush on cher ? she 's the ultimate
ai n't nobody like cher
' unlike their other albums , it has not been produced by the group 's de facto leader rza but by his apprentice , morocco rapper and producer tarik ' cilvaringz ' azzougarh - a wu-tang clan fan who visited the group 's new york office five times until they took him on
cilvaringz explains he and rza were already developing the concept of a record charting the wu-tang clan 's history when the music industry changed completely
wu-tang clan has been stored in a handmade silver and nickel box embossed with the wu-tang clan 's shaolin symbol and a decorative design by yahya , a british - morocco artist collectively , the group has produced seven albums - sometimes within months of each other within five years singles plummeted to the price of $ 0.99 , and artists were streaming their work for free
simultaneously , cilvaringz was chairing an art festival in morocco , where he saw three tent poles bought for thousands of dollars
' that [ was ] the first time i asked myself : " why and how are these artists valued at such a price ? " people like dre or kanye or rza are geniuses in what they do , and their music is valued at 99 cents
' no disrespect to andy warhol , basquiat , damien hirst , or any other artists , but if you walk down the streets and ask people randomly , " do you know damien hirst ? do you know basquiat ? " they 'll say " who ? " if you say , " do you know dr. dre ? do you know kanye ? , " they 'll say " yeah
" ' the album , he says , pays homage to the wu-tang clan 's history and meteoric rise to dominate the record industry
the group became known for their business genius as they created a collective but each had their own solo contracts , thereby dominating the recording industry 36 chambers : this was the collective 's debut album which revolutionized the hip hop scene and despite years of disputes erupting between the clan 's members , rza insists that there was ' no tension ' when he informed his brethren he had been working on a secret album , adding ' the eight members , excluding myself , are the most talented mcs i have ever encountered
they are true artists because they are n't taught
you ca n't teach art. ' speaking later with genius executive editor sasha frere-jones , rza described his ambitions : ' maybe richard branson will just buy it and put it on one of his planes and send it to another planet
that 'd be dope ! ' however , cilvaringz conceded , the fact that the buyer can not commercialize it means that they could distribute it for free
' i hope they do n't , ' rza said
' this is unique and something only has value if it is rare
