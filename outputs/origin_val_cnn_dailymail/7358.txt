glee star shum been showing off some riveting new dance moves â which he performed while on a moving treadmill â in a post on his facebook page
the talented 32 - year - old made working out seem effortless as he danced along to michael jackson 's love never felt so good
shum , who is best known for his role as mike chang on the television show glee , performs a variety of complex dance moves during the routine , including a number of moon walk - style steps which are reminiscent of the moves once favored by the late singer
in this particular video , which was filmed last year in the gym at his atlanta apartment , shum manages to perform for a full five minutes , completing a variety of intricate moves and , at times , using the treadmill as a prop to showcase his skills
treadmill dancing began making a comeback earlier this year after choreographer carson dean posted his moves to bruno mars ' uptown funk earlier this month
shum 's upbeat facebook post comes after his former co-stars paid an emotional farewell to glee last week
getting down : after appearing in glee since it began , shum has been starring in digital series caper and is in the next crouching tiger , hidden dragon movie copycat : shum managed to pull off some of the late michael jackson 's signature moves , although it was the treadmill that was helping him moonwalk ! although shum was n't in last week 's finale , it is the end of an era for a program which had become part of popular culture while addressing issues of teen pregnancy , sexuality , suicide , bullying and also showed the first transgender character 's transition on network television
glee leaves behind a remarkable legacy
it dared to try something that had seldom if ever succeeded in television history , blending episodic narrative with musical production numbers
the serie did something else few would have thought possible : it helped make glee clubs cool while it promoted arts programs in schools
and it served as a platform for new talent , launching such stars as lea michele ( rachel ) while giving wide exposure to veterans like matthew morrison ( will ) and jane lynch ( sue ) , with guest appearances by a broad range of celebrities that included helen mirren , lindsey lohan and ricky martin
pop music - both new and well - established - reached new audiences , both on the show and through sales of more than 50 million songs and 13 million albums under the glee signature
fans of show are excited to see what their much - loved starts go on to do next
end of an era : after six seasons glee leaves behind a legacy that will be a tough act to follow
