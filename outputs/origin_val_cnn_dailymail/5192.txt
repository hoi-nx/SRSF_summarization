a â deceitful â businesswoman has been left with a Â£ 100,000 bill for tricking her husband into believing he was the father of their son born after ivf treatment
minutes after the ruling , the victim of the con was reduced to tears as he read a statement in which he described the actions of his ex-wife as â absolutely appalling â and pleaded to remain part of the boy âs life
â i live in hope that when he is 18 he looks for me â¦ and be part of my life again , â he said
â he is truly missed
â a lecturer who said his former wife deceived him into thinking her son born via ivf was his has won Â£ 100,000 after a court heard the boy , who is now nine years old , was conceived using another man 's sperm the man â a lecturer in his sixties who can not be named for legal reasons â thought the boy was his after the couple visited a fertility clinic
but the woman , who is in her 50s , had returned a few months later with an ex-boyfriend and was impregnated with his sperm
' i wanted my former wife , and her former boyfriend , to realise the consequences of their deceitful actions practised over almost six years
it has deeply affected me and my family , but most importantly their own son and my ex-son , which is absolutely appalling
this four - year litigation has been incredibly difficult and stressful and i have sometimes felt : â i think i am in the wrong film â
not only did my ex-wife commit the deceit but she misled her own child too
i ca nât imagine what my then â son â must have felt to have had a loving father substituted by another man â how can she ( and he ) sleep at night ? they used me to ... support him economically whilst maintaining a secret little family life behind my back
i live in hope that when he is 18 he looks for me , and i and my family can show him how much we loved him and he can be part of our lives again
' her deceit was only revealed when , following their divorce , the man sought further contact with the boy
central london county court heard that the couple married in 2002 and two years later they went for ivf treatment in barcelona
the boy was born in 2005 but the pair separated when he was just six months old and their divorce was finalised in 2008
at no time did the man know that the boy was not his , said his barrister , thomas brudenell
â it is hard to imagine a more cruel deceit , â he said
the court heard that the man had looked after the child when the woman was working away from their london homes and had paid more than Â£ 80,000 in maintenance over the following years
but in 2011 a dispute arose over the amount of contact he was having with the youngster â and the woman then dropped the â bombshell â that he was not the biological father , which was confirmed by a dna test
it led to her ex-husband claiming damages for the â distress and humiliation â he had suffered along with the return of maintenance and compensation for loss of earnings
the court heard the pair had a troubled marriage when they had ivf in 2004
they then fell out , so when the woman returned to the ivf clinic in 2005 , she took an ex-partner , whose sperm was used to conceive the woman said there had been no deceit , no fraud and no misrepresentation , but judge taylor found in favour of her ex-husband
the judge accused the woman of being an â untruthful witness â after finding much of her account â highly improbable and inconsistent â
judge taylor said she did not believe the woman 's testimony , adding that she had ' deliberately misrepresented ' the facts she said she was satisfied that the woman intended her ex-husband to believe that he was the boy âs father and rejected her suggestion that she believed the boy â may â not be his child
judge taylor said the woman had been guilty of â deliberate fraudulent misrepresentation â , and added : â she presented herself as a victim of circumstances rather than a participant
â the judge was told that the man had lost almost all contact with the boy , who is now nine
she ruled that he should get Â£ 10,000 damages for the distress he had suffered , Â£ 4,000 for loss of earnings and more than Â£ 25,000 as compensation for the maintenance he had paid
legal sources suggested she would have to pay a further Â£ 60,000 in costs
the lecturer said he sometimes felt he was taking part â in the wrong film â and had been â used â by the woman and her lover
â i ca nât imagine what my then â son â must have felt to have had a loving father substituted by another man â how can she ( and he ) sleep at night ? â he said
the ex-wife left court refusing to comment
during the hearing it emerged that she could have settled the case last year for Â£ 12,500 but decided to press on with her defence .
