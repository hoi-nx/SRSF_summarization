alexie , gave birth to the baby alone in a garage in eastpointe , michigan , on december 22 , 2014 , and cut the umbilical cord with her teeth
the mother - of - three , whose children are all in foster care , claims she did n't have the strength to take the baby to authorities as she was embarrassed and did n't know if her boyfriend was the father
wrapping the child in a blanket , alexie left the him on the floor of the open - windowed residential garage for two days as she slept inside , checking on him every two hours
she attempted to breastfeed him , she says , but he never latched on
she did not bring him formula
alexie , 24 , ( pictured in february allegedly delivered the baby boy on her own in the unattached garage of a friend 's house that she was residing in and then put the baby in a recycling bin after he had died on christmas eve , john died , and alexie posted on facebook ' rip baby ' , which she claims referred to somebody else 's child
alexie placed the body in a plastic bag and left him on the floor of the garage for another week before somebody placed the bag in a recycling dumpster , the court heard in february
the court also heard from johnson , a worker at recommunity recycling who saw john 's body come down the conveyor belt on january 14
he was blue , covered in snow , and curled up as if he were trying to stay warm , johnson said
' when i first saw , it scared me , ' johnson said tearfully
i realized this was an actual baby
' it is believed that the child was born on or around december 22 in the garage of a friend 's house in eastpointe ( pictured ) and died christmas night , but the macomb county medical examiner 's office is still working to confirm the timeline ' it just grabbed my heart
i knew something was n't right
' ' i said , ' that 's a real baby
stop the line ! stop the line ! '' she testified
there is no official cause of death but authorities believe hypothermia played a major role
she let that child freeze to death , ' macomb county assistant prosecutor bill cataldo said , according to detroit free press
' he died when there were a number of ways to save him
' alexie said she concealed the pregnancy from her boyfriend and pretended to have miscarried
authorities released an appeal to find the mother , which prompted a response from amy lesniak , who is caring for two of alexie 's children
she said she suspected alexie was pregnant when she started missing visits , claiming to have the flu or stomach problems
when she heard a baby was found in the dumpster , she called police saying she believed the child was alexie 's
steven kaplan , alexie 's attorney , said she has a ' severe lack of parenting skills , limited intelligence and lack of family support ' in court yesterday
kaplan will not seek a competency exam because it appeared to him that ' she has sufficient cognizance to assist her attorney in the hearing '
he plans to request a forensic evaluation regarding the issue of criminal responsibility or culpability , which he believes could lead to an insanity defense
alexie relinquished her rights to bury the baby
