hong kong a canada pastor , who went to north korea on a humanitarian trip in late january , is being held in the reclusive communist state , his family said early thursday
the family of rev. hyeon soo lim said they received notice from canada officials that pyongyang has confirmed that the pastor is being held
" the hyeon soo lim family and the church community is asking fellow canada and the international community to continue praying for his release and safe return home , " a family spokeswoman said in a short emailed statement
hyeon soo lim , 60 , went to north korea on a humanitarian trip as he had done over a hundred times before , said lisa pak , a spokeswoman for his church , based in mississauga , ontario
on january 30 , hyeon soo lim traveled to north korea from china with a companion from the church who last spoke with him the following day
hyeon soo lim was scheduled to return february 4 from what was described as a " routine " trip to rajin , in northeastern north korea , where his church supports a nursery , orphanage and nursing home , according to the light korean presbyterian church
in 1986 , hyeon soo lim immigrated to canada from south korea with his wife and son
he speaks fluent korean and leads a 3,000 - member church
pak , the church 's spokeswoman , said she does n't believe hyeon soo lim would have engaged in any type of proselytizing , which is prohibited in north korea
" he knows the language , he knows the nature of the government , so we do n't see that as a legitimate reason that he would be detained , " she said
" we do n't believe that 's the way he would have behaved
he 's very wise about that
" previously , north korea has detained westerners on religious grounds
cases include u.s. bae , who was detained for two years after north korea accused him of trying to bring down the government through religious activities
bae was released in november

aijalon mahli gomes , a u.s. citizen sentenced to eight years of hard labor and believed to be a christian activist , was released from north korea in 2010 after a visit to pyongyang by former u.s. president jimmy carter
