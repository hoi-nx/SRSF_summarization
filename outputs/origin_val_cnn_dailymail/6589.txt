kathryn , 41 , who makes smoothies from raw placenta is being investigated by public health officials a mother - of - two who makes smoothies from raw human placenta is being investigated by public health officials
kathryn produces the drinks for new mothers from their own afterbirths for around Â£ 25 each
the 41 - year - old insists the smoothies , produced as soon after the delivery as possible , are perfectly safe and that they have many benefits
but health officials , worried about potential ' serious health risks ' , attempted to gain an emergency court order banning them
they were unsuccessful , but ms kathryn has offered to stop making the drinks pending a visit from officials to inspect her hygiene standards
' most species of mammal eat their own placenta straight after birth , raw - it is normal in the animal kingdom , ' said ms kathryn from swindon , wiltshire
' we are unusual in that we do n't routinely do it
it is full of iron , stem cells and hormones and is reputed to help with milk production and post-natal depression
' for the placenta smoothies ms kathryn visits the new mother in their own home or private hospital room as soon after the birth as possible
she puts a couple of pound - coin sized pieces of the placenta into the blender and mixes it with fruit , including berries and bananas
what is left can then be dehydrated , ground into powder and put into capsules for the new mother to take
she can also create the pills , which cost around Â£ 150 , using the chinese method
this involves the placenta being steamed with lemon , ginger and chilli and it is believed to have enhanced healing properties
the capsules are ms kathryn 's most popular product
ms bearle got involved in consumption of placentas - known as placentophagy - two years ago after meeting the founder of the independent placenta encapsulation network
she only makes placenta products for mothers who provide their own organ for processing
she explained : ' women who want to use their placentas are tested during pregnancy , and if we know the placenta carries any blood - born pathogens we will not use it
' ms kathryn , pictured left , and a placenta smoothie , pictured right , made with banana , blueberries , strawberries and apple juice last week swindon council went to court seeking a hygiene emergency prohibition order against her but it was not granted as she had no future clients booked
instead , public protection officials will visit her home next week to check on what she is doing
' i have voluntarily stopped taking bookings until they approve everything

raw placenta sliced and ready to be dehydrated , pictured left , and placenta wrapped in its own amniotic sac , pictured right , ready to be steamed over green chili , lemon and ginger , in line with the traditional chinese medicine ' i am assuming i will get a food hygiene rating , provided they do not decide to close me down
' i do not believe i am doing anything that puts myself or the public in any danger
there are more than 50 people around the uk doing the same thing
' when i do this it is a more time - consuming process because i have to follow the right procedures and constantly wash my hands
' mums will often take theirs ' home and cook it or bury it in the garden
' if i am doing it at least it is safer , because it needs to be thoroughly dehydrated to kill all the germs
' celebrities such as kim kardashian and gwyneth paltrow have used placentas for their supposed health benefits
one direction star harry styles also dabbled in the fad when he had a luxury sheep placenta facial
ms kathryn also makes umbilical cord keepsakes which are made by shaping the umbilical cord into either a spiral or a heart - shape and dehydrating it until it becomes translucent shades of gold and red
swindon borough council said : ' we can confirm public protection officers attended court on tuesday , march 10 seeking a hygiene emergency prohibition order in respect of raw human placenta practices
the order was not granted on this occasion
' our investigations continue and we are therefore unable to comment further at this stage
' while the health benefits of this activity are not clear , the processes involved in the production of human placenta for human consumption present a number of potentially serious health risks , which explains this action
