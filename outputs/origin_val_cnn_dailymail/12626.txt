kids , being kids , like to climb on things
more often than not , that 's ok
but when the thing in question is a war memorial ? that 's the question burning up online parenting groups and in family rooms after an amateur photographer snapped a picture of two children scampering on top of the vietnam women 's memorial in washington
the photographer , munson , described the shot on facebook as " two little brats climbing over war memorial right in front of a veteran
" the parents , he said , were laughing
" it actually drew a crowd of spectators and the parents realized how evil they were being and quickly took off before i could take a picture of them all , " munson wrote
" the more i look at this photo the angrier i get
" he has plenty of company there
as the photo went viral , comment after comment poured in on facebook and twitter , chastising the parents for allowing the kids to play on the statue , part of the vietnam veterans memorial that depicts three women tending to a wounded soldier
one nurse cradles the wounded fighter while another looks despairingly into an empty helmet
the third looks skyward , to a rescue helicopter or perhaps god , according to the memorial foundation 's website
in munson 's photo , a visitor to the memorial seems to grimace at the sight as he pushes an older man in a wheelchair
the older man , wearing a navy ballcap , and a woman also look on
the children 's parents are n't shown
" disgusting , " facebook user trisha davidson wrote of the children 's actions
" so wrong , " twitter user karsonwithak chimed in
but not everyone was upset
" i fully take why people can get annoyed and respect that , " reddit user z3k3 wrote
but the writer said a grandfather who was a veteran of world war ii " loved watching the kids play on the local memorial
" " he saw it as a way for the next generation to take some joy out of something so terrible and at the same time gave them a link to the past as many would stop to read the names or even get interested enough to read up on the subject a little , " z3k3 wrote
fair enough , some said
but some memorials are meant to be interactive
and a statue depicting a nurse caring for a gravely wounded man just does n't seem to be the place for play , a reddit user with the screen name nickfree wrote
" unless the memorial is designed to be climbed on -- unless the message of the memorial is clearly ' use me , interact with me , to help carry my message ' ( e.g. memorial benches ) , the default is leave it respectfully alone , " nickfree wrote
on the mommyish parenting blog , associate editor maria guido wrote that " there 's nothing wrong with children who may not understand how gleefully playing all over a memorial may seem inappropriate to some
" " if these kids were just doing that -- gleefully playing all over a memorial -- i would n't find anything wrong with the image , actually
but they 're not , " she wrote
" these parents were disrespectful , " she wrote
" the kids were being kids and following their directives
" though the national parks service , which operates the memorial , did n't immediately respond to a request for comment , the vietnam veterans memorial fund urged visitors to treat veterans memorials -- sites of powerful and often emotional pilgrimages for many who served -- with respect
" please remember to be respectful to memorials honoring and remembering our nation 's veterans , " the group wrote on facebook
" we hope our visitors understand this moving forward
