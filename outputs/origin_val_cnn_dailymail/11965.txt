it 's the ultimate compliment for any player to have their talent recognised by their fellow professionals
so , to settle the argument of which is the greatest premier league since it started in 1992 - 93 , sportsmail has studied every pfa team of the year to find out which players are most highly - regarded by their peers
the results are fascinating â and surprising in some cases too
legendary united goalkeeper peter schmeichel was selected in only one pl all - star team ( 1993 ) , as was dennis bergkamp ( 1998 ) and therefore are well short of being considered for the greatest xi. peter schmeichel famously saves a penalty from dennis bergkamp in 1999 ... but neither make the all - time xi eric cantona and paul scholes were n't voted for often enough either while gianfranco zola â regarded as one of the best players in chelsea 's history â was never picked in a pfa side
roy keane and frank lampard were picked on fewer occasions than central midfield rivals steven gerrard and vieira
likewise , stars like luis suarez and gareth bale performed too briefly on the premier league stage to be chosen as often as other players
based on the number of times they were voted for by their fellow professionals in the pfa premier team of the season , here is the best xi over the last 23 years
and for steven gerrard , heavily criticised after his red card against united on sunday , there is some good news â nobody has been picked more often
the premier league all time xi edwin van der sar ( pfa team 2007 , 2009 , 2011 ) played in premier league for : fulham , united sir alex ferguson compared the dutchman 's influence with peter schmeichel 's after he helped united return to the top following a period of dominance by jose mourinho 's chelsea
edwin van der sar was 34 when he joined united from fulham but it proved to be a master signing , and one that alex ferguson admitted he wished he 'd made earlier
edwin van der sar won three league titles in a row and was the hero of united 's penalty shootout win against chelsea in the 2008 european cup final , making the match - winning save from nicolas anelka
edwin van der sar celebrates with his united team - mates after beating chelsea in may 2011 gary neville ( 1996 , 1997 , 1998 , 1999 , 2005 , 2007 ) played for : united the heart of united 's team that dominated english football for two decades and part of the 1999 treble - winning side
gary neville was united 's effective leader and club captain off the field well before he eventually wore the armband on it
the right - back for united and england was the most voiceferous member of the famed class of 92 and since retirement has become a hugely influential figure both as a television pundit and england coach gary neville was a stalwart of the united side and was named six times in the pfa xi rio ferdinand ( 2002 , 2005 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2013 ) played for : west ham , leeds united , united , qpr a skilful centre half in the continental mould , rio ferdinand started at west ham but was first voted into the premier league team in 2002 after an excellent season at leeds united
after impressing at that summer 's world cup , united paid a Â£ 29million transfer fee for rio ferdinand , a british record that stood for four years
he became an integral part of united 's success in the 2000s culminating in their premier league - european cup double in 2008
now plays for qpr but is expected to retire at the end of the season nemanja vidic ( 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2011 ) played for : united united 's hard - man captain who formed a formidable central defensive partnership with rio ferdinand
the serbia international endured a poor first six months at old trafford after arriving from russian football but went on to become a huge fans ' favourite
one of the bravest players seen at old trafford , nemanja vidic put his head and body in where others feared to , leading to a number of injuries
when sir alex ferguson left , nemanja vidic signed for inter milan , and the incoming manager david moyes missed his presence
nemanja vidic ( left ) and rio ferdinand formed a formidable partnership at the heart of united 's defence ashley cole ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2011 ) played for : arsenal , chelsea considered by many the greatest english left back of all time with more than 100 caps , ashley cole won the premier league title with arsenal and chelsea with fans in north london not forgiving him for moving to stamford bridge
ashley cole was quick , mobile and had the ability to defend and attack
the controversial decision by roy hodgson to leave him out of england 's world cup squad backfired and ashley cole decided to move abroad where he now plays in serie a for roma
one of the few defenders who could get the better of cristiano ronaldo in his prime
ashley cole ( left ) gets the better of cristiano ronaldo during the 2004 - 05 season cristiano ronaldo ( 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 ) played for : united hard to believe he was only in the premier league for six years such was the impact he made
he was voted into the pfa team for four seasons in a row before he signed for real madrid for a then world - record fee of Â£ 80million
there were eyebrows raised when sir alex ferguson sold david beckham and unveiled an unknown portuguese teenager
cristiano ronaldo treated old trafford to a series of stepovers on his debut and by 2008 was voted world player of the year , the only time that honour has gone to someone in the premier league after michael owen in 2001
he has subsequently gone on to scale even greater heights at real madrid
cristiano ronaldo was named world player of the year during his outstanding united career steven gerrard ( 2001 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2008 , 2009 , 2014 ) played for : liverpool indisputably the best player of the premier league era not to have won the championship , steven gerrard is nonetheless regarded as the greatest player in liverpool 's history alongside kenny dalglish and was man of the match when he led their comeback in istanbul to win a fifth european cup in 2005
steven gerrard in his prime was the ultimate box - to - box midfielder , stopping goals , creating goals and scoring goals , often spectacular ones
will leave liverpool this summer to join los angeles galaxy in the mls
no player has been named in the pfa xi more times than liverpool captain steven gerrard ( centre ) vieira ( 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 ) played for : arsenal , manchester city was voted into the pfa team for six consecutive years between 1999 and 2004 , an unprecedented spell of dominance in the premier league era
vieira was arsene wenger 's first signing â actually arriving at highbury shortly before the manager who was tied up with contractual issues in japan â and was the blueprint for an arsenal team who set new standards for the whole country
a tall , quick and powerful midfielder , vieira helped arsenal win the double and then succeeded tony adams as captain , leading the 2004 invincibles side that went through an entire season unbeaten
patrrick vieira ( right ) gets in the team ahead of his great rival at united , roy keane ( left ) ryan giggs ( 1993 , 1998 , 2001 , 2002 , 2007 , 2009 ) played for : united statistically the greatest player in the premier league , with a record number of titles ( 13 ) and appearances ( 632 ) , ryan giggs was named six times in the pfa team spanning a period of 16 years
he was a flying 19 - year - old winger who had led united to their first championship for 26 years when he was named in the 1993 all - star side , and a clever 35 - year - old central midfield playmaker when he was chosen in 2009
now assistant manager to louis van gaal at united having been interim manager at the end of last season
ryan giggs back in 1993 , when he was entered in his first pfa xi , 16 years before his last alan shearer ( 1993 , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , 2003 ) played for : blackburn , newcastle the premier league 's record goalscorer with 260 â more than 70 goals ahead of anyone else , alan shearer won the championship with blackburn and became the only premier league player to also be the world 's most expensive player when he signed for hometown club newcastle for Â£ 15million having just finished as leading goalscorer at euro 96 for england
alan shearer could score all types of goals , rocket shots , tap - ins and headers , and following a brief spell as newcastle 's interim manager , is a respected tv pundit

like vieira , thierry henry was picked for six consecutive pfa teams and won the golden boot for being the leading scorer in the division on four occasions
rivals cristiano ronaldo as being the best premier league import ever seen and after spells with barcelona and new york red bulls is back in this country , offering his views on the game with sky sports
thierry henry was named in the pfa xi an incredible six times in a row between 2001 and 2006
. and an unlikely all - star xi. these players all made the premier league team of the season on one occasion : tim flowers ; david bardsley , ugo ehiogu , thomas vermaelen , stig inge bjornebye ; nani , scott parker , tim sherwood , harry kewell ; emmanuel adebayor , chris sutton
