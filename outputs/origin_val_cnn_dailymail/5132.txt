but with sebastian vettel 's fastest time over seven tenths of a second adrift of nico rosberg , the opening day 's practice will strengthen belief that the first rounds of the new season may be a private duel for race wins between the mercedes duo
williams driver valtteri bottas posted the fifth - fastest lap , with red bull 's new recruit kvyat sixth in the second session
kvyat 's team - mate ricciardo had a less memorable day
tenth fastest in the first session , ricciardo was forced to sit out the second after an engine problem , a fate also shared by williams driver felipe massa
toro rosso 's 17 - year - old driver max verstappen impressed with the sixth - fastest time of the first session , before falling back to 14th - quickest in the second
dogged by reliability problems during winter testing , the gloom in the mclaren garage followed drivers jenson button and kevin magnussen onto the track

van der garde was at albert park , suited up and apparently ready to drive , but neither he nor nominated drivers marcus ericsson and nasr drove in the first session
