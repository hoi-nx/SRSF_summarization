as a pro-snowboarder he earned $ 170,000 a year , lived in a 4,000 square - foot home and traveled around the world for international tournaments
but mike basich has since shunned the frantic lifestyle and opted to live somewhere far closer to his beloved slopes
he now lives in a tiny , isolated cottage in the sierra nevada mountains mountains near truckee , california , and now lives with no electricity or indoor plumbing - but has 40 acres of slopes with no one else in sight
speaking to laura ling from seeker stories , he described how the property took five years to build , and involved him moving 175 tons of rock and hand - mixing all of his cement
now he has his own sanctuary complete with a hot tub and a chairlift he made from scratch with his friends
it operates through an electronic motor
each chair has it 's own tray to carry lunch and a drink while the route up has sculpture ' i like to think of it as getting back to the basics of humanity , ' mike basich said
' i like feeling connected to the earth more than i could with a 4,000 square - foot house
next to the house is a chairlift he built from scratch with his friends
it took him eight months to complete ' it gave me the strength to do everything myself
the project was fulfilling a childhood dream
' the house is fitted with an oven , made with a door picked up from a junk yard , and a fire where mike basich does all of his cooking and heating
he sleeps in a bunk next to a stained - glass window and there are no curtains
' i go to bed with the sun and wake up with it
i do n't feel like i 'm trying to race time , ' he added
' like in a city you always feel like you are in a rat race
and here it feels like you are in sync with what is actually happening
' mike basich stopped participating in competitions around 15 years ago and now spends most of his time taking pictures
