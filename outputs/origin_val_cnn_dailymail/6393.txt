chelsea manager mourinho has spent 21 months since returning to stamford bridge trying to mould the team spirit that he craves - and now he seems to have achieved it , labelling his side as a band of ' brothers '
chelsea ground out a hard - fought 1 - 0 win over west ham on wednesday night and their manager reserved special praise for the togetherness of his players , with terry and co embracing at the final whistle before applauding the travelling support
the scenes were similar to a defining game of mourinho 's first spell at chelsea , in an away game at blackburn in february 2005 when arjen robben split the sides in a gritty ewood park clash

the special one also confirmed that his players would be enjoying two days off with a week 's gap until they play paris saint-germain in the return of their champions league last - 16 tie
â my team were brothers on the pitch , ' mourinho said
' that is important if you are to win the most difficult league in the world
i want to sleep now until midday
we could easily have lost two points
â the way west ham play , nobody is better than them
they are the best at the way they play
it is not just to play football , the pressure , the tension and the emotion , my players were fantastic
â i told the referee is it very difficult to be a ref here , because of the style of their game
west ham had lots of balls in the box , very difficult , very intense and really difficult for the referee
they complain for everything , the crowd is behind them and it is really , really difficult

and mourinho led the plaudits for the playmaker who he has criticised in the past for his work ethic
' eden hazard was fantastic , ' he said
' he is punished by opponents in a very hard way
not in a violent way , just an aggressive football way because they tried to stop him but the kid is playing , scoring and defending
' but the portuguese coach was less impressed with the rescheduling of chelsea 's game against leicester , which could have been held this weekend with both clubs out of the fa cup but will instead take place on april 9
â it is not a good thing that we play leicester in two months now - that âs not a good thing , for someone in the title race to have played one match less , ' he said
