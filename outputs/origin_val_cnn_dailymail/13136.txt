entertainers are paid for entertaining and it 's time athletes received financial recompense for taking part in the olympic , says 100m hurdler sally pearson
in 2014,while the winner of wimbledon received $ 2,600,000 and the augusta masters champion picked up $ 1,620,000 , when pearson won gold in the olympic three years ago she received zero prize money
" people come for the entertainment from the athletes -- we are entertaining them , we are entertainers " the australia , who set an olympic record of 12.48 seconds in her 2012 winning run in 2012 , told cnn anchor alex thomas
" entertainers get paid every single time they step up onto a stage , and that 's exactly what we 're doing in a sporting sense
" billions might have tuned in to watch london 's london 2012 olympics which saw over 10,000 athletes compete across 302 events in a battle for golden glory , but the ioc 's current policy is to ( ioc ) hand out gold , silver and bronze medals as well as a bouquet of flowers to athletes , but no financial remuneration
" i can see why they do n't , and i 'm sure they want to keep it like that , they want to keep it pure , " added pearson
" to be honest we 're all still going to turn up whether we get paid or not
but the games would n't happen without the athletes
" it also would n't happen without sponsors
the ioc has just signed a new eight - year sponsorship deal with car manufacturing giant toyota -- reportedly worth just under $ 1 billion -- adding to their list of partners that include mcdonald 's and coca-cola
athletes usually fund themselves through sponsorship deals , government support , grants and part - time work
in 2012 only half of american track and field athletes -- who were ranked in the top 10 in their nation -- earned more than $ 15,000 a year from their sport
the fifth fastest 100m hurdler in history , pearson told the australia 's daily telegraph in 2013 how a year after her olympic gold medal in london she still was n't attracting enough sponsors
no stranger to hard work -- the hurdler sometimes vomits after intense training sessions -- she decided to chase down her own deals rather than sit on her hands waiting for private sponsorship
while she has some support from qantas , amp and adidas , appearance fees and prize money in the diamond league -- an annual series of track and field meetings -- also provides revenue earning potential for the 28 - year - old
now targeting more medal success at the 2016 rio olympics , pearson achieved a resounding win at the queensland track classic on march 7 with a time of 12.74s
even so the issue of olympic prize money still clearly grates
" i think the times have changed from 1896 to 2016 , i think it might be time to at least have a think about it , and discuss it because there 's no such thing as the olympic without athletics or athletes , " said pearson .
