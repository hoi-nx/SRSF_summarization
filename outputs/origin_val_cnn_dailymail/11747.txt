former new england patriots star hernandez was seen ' messing with ' the security camera in his basement the day after the lloyd was killed one of his maids testified in court on tuesday
he also exchanged text messages with the man he is charged with murdering in the hours before the killing took place according to cell phone records shown in court on tuesday
macdonald , a t-mobile employee , testified that the messages from hernandez were on the cell phone of lloyd , whose bullet - ridden body was found in an industrial park near hernandez 's home in north attleborough , massachusetts , on june 17 , 2013
the texts appear to have been deleted from hernandez 's phone some time after they were sent to lloyd
bristol county assistant district attorney patrick bomberg showed lloyd 's phone in massachusetts superior court in fall river , massachusetts , and asked macdonald to read text messages sent from a number identified as hernandez 's
on the night of june 16 , hernandez texted lloyd ; ' imma hit u when i 'm dat way like las time
' after midnight on june 17 , loyd texted back : ' we still on
' a few hours later , prosecutors say , hernandez and two friends , wallace and ortiz , picked up lloyd at his boston home and drove him to the industrial park where he was later shot dead
the records also showed calls to lloyd 's phone from wallace 's number , and do not show any further calls or texts from lloyd 's phone after 3:23am on june 17
hernandez , 25 , had a $ 41 million contract with the new england patriots when he was arrested for lloyd 's murder in june 2013 , but was dropped him from the team hours after his arrest
wallace and ortiz will be tried separately
all three men have pleaded not guilty
during the testimony , hernandez leaned over to speak with his attorney at one point lloyd , 27 , was a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of hernandez 's fiancee
the sister testified earlier that the men were in the early stages of a friendship and smoked marijuana together , but were not close
defense attorneys have argued hernandez and lloyd were good friends , and that hernandez would never have shot him
defense attorneys , meanwhile , filed a motion to prevent jurors from hearing about a civil suit filed by a former friend of hernandez , alexander bradley , who claimed hernandez shot him in the face after an argument in florida in 2013
prosecutors want associate justice susan garsh to allow the jury to hear about that case , arguing it refutes the defense team 's assertion hernandez would not shoot a friend .
