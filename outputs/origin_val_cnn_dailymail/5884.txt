with a murder conviction hanging over her head , it would have been easy for her to hide away
but instead , amanda knox has tried to lead a normal life in the us over the past three - and - a - half years
she has graduated from the university of washington in seattle with a degree in creative writing , penned theater reviews for a weekly paper and become engaged to musician sutherland
and now , she has been sensationally cleared , alongside her ex-boyfriend , sollecito , of the murder of her former roommate , meredith kercher , who was found dead in italy seven years ago
surrounded by her father , knox , mother , edda mellas and mr sutherland , knox , 27 , broke down in tears as she addressed the press following italy 's supreme court 's ruling on friday night

i am the lucky one
' the former inmate added that she is ' so grateful to have my life back '
in december 2009 , knox and sollecito were convicted of the brutal murder and sexual assault of kercher , a british student
they were sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison respectively
however , after they had already served four years in prison , an appeals court in perugia - where the student was discovered dead - threw out the couple 's conviction and declared them innocent
knox returned to the us , before another u-turn in the case saw a court in florence reinstate her original 2009 conviction and increase her sentence to 28 - and - a - half years in january 2014
