boston tsarnaev 's attorney made one thing clear during her opening statement in the boston marathon bombing trial : he did it
" it was him , " defense attorney judy clarke told jurors
tsarnaev carried one of the pressure cooker bombs on april 15 , 2013 , and placed it near the finish line , she said
he was there when a police officer was killed
he was involved in a shootout with police
the accused bomber will not sidestep any of his actions , clarke said
so , why even a trial at all ? because there 's disagreement over why tsarnaev did it , clarke said
tsarnaev was influenced by his brother , tamerlan tsarnaev , clarke said
he was enlisted by his brother to commit these horrific acts , she said
the first day of the trial provided jurors with a peek at the strategies of the prosecution and defense
based on their opening statements , both sides agree on the basic facts around the attacks -- who carried them out and how
but both sides presented divergent views of why tsarnaev carried out the attacks
the goal of the tsarnaev brothers was to kill as many people as possible , u.s. prosecutor weinreb said during his initial statement to jurors
the prosecutor described in detail the deaths of three victims near the finish line of the 2013 boston marathon and painted a picture of tsarnaev as a holy warrior committed to violence
more than 260 others were maimed or injured by two pressure cooker bombs that exploded within 12 seconds of each other
a fourth person , an mit police officer , was ambushed and killed in his patrol car three days after the bombings as tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , allegedly ran from police
tamerlan tsarnaev , 26 , was killed after a gunbattle with police
so it is tsarnaev who is on trial , charged with 30 counts related to the bombings
weinreb said tsarnaev 's actions after the bombings -- going to whole foods to buy a gallon of milk , hanging out with friends -- show that he did n't care about what he did
to the contrary , the prosecutor told jurors , he believed he had done good
the motive for the attacks can be found in the boat that ultimately became tsarnaev 's hideout before his arrest , he said
there , tsarnaev allegedly wrote messages explaining that he believed the u.s. government is an enemy of islam
boston marathon bombing timeline tsarnaev listened to jihadist lectures and songs , and had an online presence in which he espoused a radical view of islam , weinreb said
he had a collection of magazines published by al qaeda , one with instructions for building the same type of bomb used in the boston marathon attack , he said
the defense pinned the radicalization on tamerlan
clarke showed two side - by - side photos in court : one of the brothers smiling , and one of them carrying backpacks linked to the attacks
the attacks were " incomprehensible , they 're inexcusable , " she said , but also asked , who turned tsarnaev from the smiling kid into a bomber ? it was tamerlan who self - radicalized , and tamerlan who influenced his brother to follow him , she argued
at the outset of the trial , weinreb spoke in detail to the jury about the lives ended by the pair of bombs at the marathon
martin , an 8 - year - old spectator , was standing with his family cheering runners on when the second bomb exploded just feet away
martin was only 4 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 70 pounds , the prosecutor said
the bomb blew large holes into the boy 's chest and organs -- " tore large chunks of flesh out of martin 's body , " weinreb said
the first witness the prosecution called wednesday was grilk , executive director of the boston athletic association
grilk provided some facts about the marathon , but assistant u.s. attorney aloke chakravarty also asked him to talk about the day of the bombings
the prosecution played videos of the first explosion , then the second , showing people scrambling in the aftermath
grilk let out a long sigh as one of the videos was paused
" every day you walk outside , you are in that area , " testified o'hara , the manager at marathon sports , a running store close to where the bombs went off
he was emotional as he vividly recounted what sounded to him like a loud cannon , and the instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows
o'hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair , and cries for help
the decisions about who to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunt him , he said
there were cries , sirens and screams , he said in answer to prosecutors ' questions
he sniffled as a photo of the blown - out storefront was shown in the court
he told the jury the plea he heard from one of the injured : " stay with me , stay with me
" wednesday 's testimony centered on the stories of the survivors
tsarnaev 's lawyers opted not to cross-examine any of the witnesses who testified to what they lived through that day
kilgore and rebekah gregory were part of a large group who were present to cheer on a family member
kilgore took the witness stand and described the videos he shot after the blasts
it was an instinct to record the scene , he said
" i was blown through the air
there was a deafening explosion , " he said
he saw bodies and faces also tumble through the air
his videos captured the chaos , the cries for help , people using any material they could find to help perform first aid
at one point , kilgore recalled , he sat on something hot , only to realize he was sitting on pieces of burning metal and shards
gregory testified that she was watching the race , but also looking after her 5 - year - old , noah , who was a bit bored
after the blast , she could n't feel her legs
" my bones were literally laying next to me on the sidewalk , " she said
" at that point i thought that was the day i would die
" her first instinct was for noah 's safety
she asked god to take her if she was indeed dying , but to let her know that noah was ok
somehow , she said , despite the confusion and her pain , she could hear his voice calling her
gregory now wears a prosthesis
sydney corcoran was a high school senior on the day of the bombings
her testimony centered on her near certainty that she would die that day
she passed out and awoke to a group of men attending to her , putting pressure on her leg , trying to find where she was bleeding
one man put his forehead on her head and told her she would be ok
but then , another man said he could see her eyes were going white , she testified
" i could feel my body going tingly and i was getting increasingly cold
i knew i was dying , " she told the jury
it took nearly two months of juror interviews -- 256 people over 22 court days -- to select the jury in the bombing trial
the group includes 18 people from across the socioeconomic spectrum , but the group is almost exclusively white
race has been an issue raised by tsarnaev 's defense during four unsuccessful attempts to move the death penalty trial from boston
his attorneys argued that the way the court issues jury summons led to picking a panel that 's older and whiter than the community at large
but prosecutors argued that the jury had been picked properly
" the prosecution got exactly what they wanted , " said cnn legal analyst mark geragos , a criminal defense attorney in los angeles
middle - aged white jurors tend to be more likely to support death penalty verdicts , he said
" it 's a target demographic for a death penalty jury
" just one juror seemed to combine youth and ethnic diversity
a college student who is taking a break from his studies , he said his mother was born in iran and converted from islam to the baha'i faith
the slip away , a boat in which tsarnaev sought cover after the police gunbattle , also is expected to be a key piece of evidence
the prosecution is seeking to remove a panel on which tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so jurors can see it
weinreb has said the boat is too large to bring into the courthouse
the defense , however , wants the jury to see the entire boat , complete with bullet holes
defense attorney david bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and would n't fairly reflect tsarnaev 's state of mind
court papers have already given the public a glimpse of several statements tsarnaev allegedly wrote inside the boat : " the u.s. government is killing our innocent civilians , " he allegedly wrote
" i ca n't stand to see such evil go unpunished
" " we muslims are one body
you hurt one , you hurt us all
" " now i do n't like killing innocent people
it is forbidden in islam but due to said ( unintelligible ) it is allowed
" " stop killing our innocent people and we will stop
