a self - driving car is gearing up for a 3,500 - mile cross-country road trip from san francisco to new york that begins next week
a person will always be behind the wheel of the autonomous car , developed by delphi , in order to take control if there is a situation the vehicle can not handle on its own
the car will begin its journey on march 22 so that it can reach new york in time for the international auto show
the autonomous vehicle will mainly stick to the highways , where it will be able to pass slower cars and maintain a safe distance from other automobiles all on its own
delphi cto jeff owens told wired the road trip will be the ' ultimate test ' for the vehicle , as it will be exposed to a ' range of driving conditions ' as well as various types of weather
it 's design is based on a 2014 audi sq5
according to delphi officials , the road trip will be the longest automated drive ever attempted in north america
in 2010 an autonomous van created by italian company vislab completed an 8,000 - mile journey from europe to shanghai for three months
unlike google 's driverless car ( pictured ) , dephi 's vehicle senors are tucked in the car 's front , rear and sides and thus can not be seen
although it will be the delphi car 's longest journey , it wo n't be its first
the delphi vehicle has driven around the company 's silicon valley office and has already completed a trip from san francisco to los angeles
but the car really earned its stripes when , during a demonstration at the las vegas consumer electronics show in january , it braked by itself as two drunk men stumbled into the street in front of it
delphi says the vehicle is capable of making complex decisions , like stopping and then proceeding at a four - way stop , merging onto the highway or maneuvering around a bicyclist or a trash can
when the car wants the driver to resume control , it uses a verbal warning and flashes lights on the dashboard
although most experts say a true driverless vehicle is at least a decade away , delphi 's autonomous automobile is helping the technology look more like a regular car
unlike other driverless cars developed by google and honda , the lidar sensors on dephi 's vehicle are tucked in the car 's front , rear and sides and thus can not be seen
the car also has cameras throughout , including one that watches the driver
because lidar systems can cost around $ 70,000 apiece , they drive up the price of the autonomous prototypes
but delphi engineer doug welk said one of the reasons for the road trip is to help decide what combination of sensors is best suited for the car , which will ultimately help lower costs
delphi estimates it will cost around $ 5,000 to make a vehicle almost fully autonomous by 2019
