factory worker lubecki , 19 , from ipswich , admitted supplying class a controlled drugs and possession with intent to supply a class b drug
justas ropas , 23 , was found dead at his home in ipswich on christmas eve , and gediminas kulokas , 24 , was found on new year 's day at his home in the suffolk town
ipswich ipswich heard polish factory worker lubecki sold the red superman - branded pills over the christmas eve period last year on the streets of ipswich , suffolk
he had supplied the drug to lithuanian machine operator mr justas ropas , who died at home on christmas eve
the same superman pills were linked to the death of lithuanian labour mr gediminas kulokas who died on his 24th birthday on new year 's day
but the court heard that the supplier of the drug to mr gediminas kulokas had not been identified and there was no evidence that it was lubecki
prosecutor crimp said : ' the prosecution ca n't say they came from the defendant
' the drug was also originally linked to the death of british labourer hocking , 20 , who died on new year 's day at a friend 's home in rendlesham , suffolk
but suffolk police confirmed today that they no longer believed mr hocking had taken the rogue mdma
the deaths prompted suffolk police to issue a warning over the superman - branded pills , which contained the drug pmma which is said to be five times as toxic as the usual mdma ingredient mdma
a court heard lubecki sold the red superman - branded pills ( pictured ) on the streets of ipswich , suffolk but pmma which has the full name pmma is slower acting than mdma so some users are tempted to take higher doses
the court heard that a housemate of mr justas ropas had contacted lubecki on december 23 and asked if he could supply some ecstasy tablets
he and mr justas ropas , who was diabetic , then went to meet up with lubecki in norwich road , ipswich
mr crimp said : ' between them they purchased five ecstasy tablets for Â£ 5 each
they were triangular in shape , red and had a ' superman ' logo on them
' the men went back to their rented victorian terraced house and mr justas ropas rook one and a half of the tablets
mr crimp said others in the house who had taken ecstasy before said the superman tablets ' seemed different ' , describing their effect as being slow to start off with and then ' suddenly very strong '
lithuanian factory worker justas ropas ( pictured ) was found dead on christmas eve at his house he added : ' tragically the effect on justas ropas was that by christmas eve he was discovered dead in the flat and the cause of his death was found to be pmma toxicity
' the court heard how lubecki was arrested and then confessed to police where he had hidden his remaining batch of the drug
officers recovered a bag 461 of the pmma tablets with the ' superman ' logo and 49 mdma tablets with a snail logo
mr crimp added : ' they were carefully hidden and not thrown away
' the court heard how text messages suggested lubecki had been supplying drugs to people in ipswich from around last april
judge john devaux told him : ' i accept you did n't foresee that your drug dealing might lead to a death
' thomson , defending , said lubecki was devastated by what had happened to mr justas ropas and it was something he would have to live with for the rest of his life
he said lubecki had got involved in drug dealing to fund his own drug use , but after what happened to mr justas ropas he did n't want anything more to do with drugs
mr thomson said that lubecki had told police where the remaining ' superman ' tablets were hidden to prevent a further tragedy
police have warned drug users not to take the suspected rogue batch and to hand in supplies
chief superintendent jon brighton said : ' lubecki 's sentencing reflects the seriousness with which drug offences are taken
' our message is clear - the supply of dangerous drugs will not be tolerated and every effort will be taken to bring those responsible to justice
' the tragic deaths of two men in ipswich led to an extensive police operation , not only to locate anyone supplying the drugs but also to ensure that communities were aware of the dangers and risks associated with taking them
' we will continue to work with our partners to combat drug dealing in ipswich and to help those individuals who wish to stop their substance misuse
' cases like this show the stark dangers of taking drugs and the simple fact that any illegal drug can result in death
' we would encourage anyone who takes drugs to seek help from one of the many support agencies available in ipswich or suffolk - wide
' inquests are due to be held at a later date
lubecki was sentenced to five years and four months in prison at ipswich crown court .
