japan 's navy today took delivery of its biggest warship since the second world war as it continues expanding its military capability in an attempt to shed its post-war pacifism
today the izumo , a helicopter carrier as big as the imperial navy aircraft carriers that battled the u.s. in the pacific , was delivered to the navy in a crowning achievement for the nation 's military forces
with a crew of 470 sailors , it is a highly visible example of how japan is expanding the capability of its military to operate overseas as prime minister abe seeks lawmaker approval to loosen the restraints of japan 's pacifist post-war constitution
here civilians watch as it departs from yokohama , south of tokyo sailors stand at attention on the deck of the warship , while a japan naval flag flutters before them
the huge warship is considered symbolic of japan 's growing military capabilities the 248metre ( 813ft ) long warship resembles u.s. marine corp amphibious assault carriers in size and design but it is designated as a helicopter destroyer - a label that allows japan to keep within the bounds of a constitutional ban on owning the means to wage war
aircraft carriers , because of their ability to project force , are considered offensive weapons
general nakatani , japan 's minister of defence , told media at the handover ceremony in yokohama : ' the vessel can serve in a wide range of roles including peace keeping operations , international disaster relief and aid
it also helps improve our ability to combat submarines
' japan is also adding longer - range patrol aircraft and military cargo planes to its defence capability , and buying f-35 fighter jets , amphibious assault vehicles and boeing 's osprey troop carrier , which can operate from the izumo
president abe 's attempts to ease japan 's pacifist constitution and its build up in defence capabilities is unnerving neighbour china
the izumo does not have a catapult necessary to launch fixed - wing fighters , but a planned vertical - take - off - and - landing ( vtol ) variant of the f-35 could fly from the izumo 's flight deck
based at yokosuka naval base near tokyo , also the home port of the u.s. seventh fleets carrier battle group , the izumo will join two smaller helicopters carriers already in service that are also classed as destroyers
soldiers march and salute on the deck of the massive warship , which is capable of holding a maximum of 28 aircraft however , japan classes it as a helicopter destroyer , a label that allows it to keep within the bounds of a constitutional ban on owning the means to wage war general nakatani , japan 's defense minister , speaks to naval soldiers during the commissioning ceremony of the izumo warship soldiers untangle a rope on board the aircraft carrier , which measures 250m in length japan 's constitution , known as the peace constitution , is most famous for the renunciation of the right to wage war
it was drawn up under the allied occupation which followed the second world war and was intended to replace japan 's previous militaristic and absolute monarchy system with liberal democracy
japan was responsible for drawing the u.s. into the war after it launched a surprise attack on the u.s. naval base pearl harbor in 1941
the attack was intended as a preventive action to keep the u.s. from interfering with its planned military actions in southeast asia , which included overseas territories of the uk , netherlands , and the u.s.
the conflict escalated massively when the u.s. dropped an atomic bomb on hiroshima on august 6 , 1945
this led to the surrender of the empire of japan on september 2 , 1945 and brought the hostilities of second world war to a close
japan 's constitution was enacted on may 3 , 1947
hiroshima was left devastated ( pictured ) after the u.s. dropped an atomic bomb on the city , ending the war and leading to the ' peace constitution '
