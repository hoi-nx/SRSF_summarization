deila secured his first trophy triumph as celtic manager â then cut short the celebrations by slapping a midnight curfew on his players
goals from kris commons and substitute james forrest â who also missed a late penalty â secured the scottish league cup against 10 - man dundee united
with the sides set to meet for a third time in 10 days in wednesday âs scottish cup replay , however , the parkhead coach warned his players to forget any notions of a scott brown - style blow - out
deila hopes to become the third celtic manager to achieve a domestic treble with the bhoys â we should enjoy the moment , but there is not going to be any nightlife , â deila said , reacting to the furore created by his skipper âs revelry in edinburgh strip clubs four nights before the final
â the players will have a calm night
we will go back to the stadium and have a couple of beers and enjoy it , but it will be early to bed before midnight and be ready for training tomorrow at 1pm
â deila then joked : â for the staff it âs a little bit longer
â despite urging his players to be â 24 - hour athletes â earlier this season the norwegian played down the seriousness of the scott brown incident , with pictures of the skipper slumped on a pavement plastered over the pages of newspapers
scott brown lifts the scottish league cup alongside craig gordon ( right ) after a difficult week in the headlines insisting there was no question or disciplinary action or dropping the 29 - year - old , deila added : â this case , for me , is not a big one
he was home at 10.30
it just looks like he was home at six in the morning
â he was drinking , he had a day off the day after
i have no rules about that
i said the players have to be fit â and scott brown is the fittest player we have
â but we have a reputation to take care of and the way the pictures appeared in the newspaper was nothing for him or me to be proud of
so we have to learn from this
â when you play for celtic everybody chases you and you do nât get the personal time
â you have to always know what you are doing
celtic manager deila gets ready to lift the scottish league cup with his players on sunday â this is something everybody has to learn from â but , again , it was not a big issue for me
â asked if scott brown had apologised , the parkhead boss added : â he was not happy about it , but he did nât do anything big or harmful for me
â it âs not a positive example for youngsters
but broony has played 60 or 65 matches this year , he had a day off and wanted to be out with his friends
â as i said he was home at 10.30pm so it was not a big thing
we will see if he learns in the future but he made up for it today â he played a very good game
â keeper craig gordon gets the drinks flowing in the dressing room and sprays champagne ast his team - mates johansen was also quick to support his captain with the 29 - year - old leading his club to the first leg of what celtic hope will be a rare treble
and despite admitting it was ; not what you want to see â , johansen insists his midfield colleague showed his class in sunday âs 2 - 0 win
â i think broonie showed what a captain he is today â a captain with a big letter at the front , â johansen said
â i thought he was absolutely fantastic
he âs 100 per cent in training every day so when that ( night out picture ) came up i was nât concerned , not even a little bit
celtic manager deila urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble â it âs not what you want to see happening , but it âs happened and you have to move on
but what scott brown did today was unbelievable
he showed today what a player he is
â deila meantime believes his side fully merited their step towards his target of a domestic treble and said : â it is a great feeling
â it is good to get a good start when you are the manager in a big club such as celtic and this was the first trophy we could win
we did it and you get an appetite from this
â you want more and i am happy for the boys and proud of them
i think we put in a professional performance
you should really enjoy this moment

â we have talked about the treble many times and it is a dream
it is so tough to do it , but it is possible and the dream is still alive
we have one trophy and we have to be back again on wednesday if we are to win another cup trophy
â deila , meanwhile , insists he knows nothing of reports of a loan deal for liverpool legend gerrard during the mls off - season next january
amid claims celtic could help the former england captain keep fit for three months deila said : â no , that âs a new thing to me
that âs a year away until that time and we have to take it day by day instead
but gerrard is a hero
he is a liverpool star and best player of all time
it âs a good name , but we will see if that âs possible in january
it âs something you know more about than me
