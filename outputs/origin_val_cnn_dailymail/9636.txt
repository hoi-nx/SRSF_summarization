germany has been gripped by claims and counter-claims that footage allegedly showing the new greece finance minister giving the country a one - fingered salute was faked
a video appeared online earlier this week which appeared to show varoufakis holding up his middle finger when giving a speech about greece 's finances and germany in 2013
jan bohermann , host of satirical tv programme ' neo magazin royale ' on public broadcast channel zdf , then admitted that his production team had doctored the footage
but now it has been claimed that his confession itself was faked - sparking confusion as to whether the video really is genuine
he added : ' sorry mr varoufakis , we wo n't do it again
' but zdf has now issued a knowing reminder to its audience that ' neo magazin royale ' is a satirical programme and ironically tweeted that it would place a ' careful , satire ' warning on all future broadcasts
that has sparked a new wave of speculation over whether the video is in fact the real deal and the hashtag # varoufake has been germany 's top trending topic on twitter throughout today
the footage appears to show mr varoufakis raises his finger and saying : ' my proposal was that greece should simply announce that it is defaulting , just like argentina did , within the euro , in january 2010 , and stick the finger to germany and say well , you can now solve this problem by yourself
' mr varoufakis has repeatedly denied the footage was authentic and laughed off the incident on twitter
he sent a message to mr jan bohermann that read : ' humour , satire & self deprecation are great solvents of blind nationalism
we politicians need you badly
' mr varoufakis is continuing to negotiate for a reduction in greece 's debt from the eu and has been doing a whistlestop tour of european in a bid to get support for his proposals
pressure : varoufakis has been under increasing pressure to secure a better loan repayment deal for greece he has been trying to negotiate favourable terms for the country to pay back its debt to the eu since the election of the radical left - wing party syriza in january
alexis tsipras , leader of the radical left - wing party heading the new coalition , immediately demanded a renegotiation of greece ' Â£ 179 billion international bailout deal
the party has continued to describe itself as ' anti-austerity
' mr varoufakis last month visited chancellor of the exchequer george osborne in london to garner support for the move and has been touring several european countries
greece was likely to run out of money by march if a deal was not reached before the end of february , and a four month extension to the bailout programme for greece was agreed on a conditional basis

january 2015 - alexis tsipras of syriza becomes prime minister and launches attempt to persuade eu and international monetary fund to ease terms of bail - outs
but there are still concerns the country could run out of money , as greece officials complain the repayment measures are starving them of money
earlier this week , greece had handed over 580m euros to the international monetary fund , clearing its debt for this month
but it will face another 350m euros bill tomorrow - generating further tensions between greece and the eurozone and fears that the country could drop out of the single currency altogether
the allegations come as varoufakis , an outspoken marxist economist and blogger , has faced a number of criticisms
he came under fire after taking part in a photo shoot for paris match - him and his wife posing with glasses of wine on their roof terrace .
