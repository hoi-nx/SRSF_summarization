' but in terms of being around england , it 's great because there 's no feeling that i need to sneak through , if i see someone , stuart lancaster , graham rowntree or the players , i just say ' hi , how 's things ? '
' there 's absolutely nothing i can say about that story , honestly , it 's the most difficult thing , because i can say actually nothing about it
' it 's as clear as , i imagine , someone has decided ' i 'm going to write this ' and then there 's a story
' it 's not annoying
it makes no difference to my life either way , but it probably does to you guys
' i live just round the corner ( from pennyhill park ) and i use the gym so sometimes when i 'm walking down to the gym i 'll bump into catty and i 'll ask him how things are
