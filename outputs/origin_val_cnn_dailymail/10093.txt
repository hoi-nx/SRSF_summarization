a stray dog who lost his nose after he accidentally caught it in a snare could soon be able to smell again thanks to surgeons who are planning to insert a specially designed implant into his snout
parys , from bialystok , poland , will undergo surgery tomorrow in order to receive his new nose , which was designed by poland company ledo
the tube shaped implant - which was specially built for parys following a ct scan - was invented by dr marcin elgal from the individual medical implants , after he heard of the dog 's plight
parys ( pictured ) a stray dog from bialystok , poland , lost his nose after he accidentally caught it in a snare - but he could soon be able to smell again thanks to surgeons who will implant a chip in his snout tomorrow the implant was specially designed for parys by dr marcin elgal ( pixtured ) from individual medical implants veterinarians will insert the implant during surgery to reconstruct parys ' nose tomorrow
he will then be sent home to recover with his new owner , magdalena smosarska , in bialystok , and his new nose
it is hoped the implant will not only restore his sense of smell , but help reconstruct the shape of his nose which was left disfigured by the accident
noses are particularly important to dogs as their brains are dominated by an olfactory cortex , boasting millions of smelling receptors which help them to survive
the implant for the dog 's new nose was designed and created ( process pictured ) by poland company ledo it is hoped the implant will not only restore his sense of smell , but help reconstruct the shape of his nose parys with his new owner magdalena smosarska , in bialystok , poland today - the day before his surgery while the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex , dog 's brains are dominated by an olfactory cortex
the olfactory bulb in dogs is roughly forty times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans the average dog has 125 to 220 million smell - sensitive receptors
the bloodhound exceeds this standard with nearly 300 million receptors
it is estimated that dogs in general have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred thousand to one million times more sensitive than a human 's
in some dog breeds , such as bloodhounds , the olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater than a human 's
a dog 's wet nose , or rhinarium , is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell
the mucus on a dog âs nose helps capture scent particles - which is why they lick their dry noses , to recover this scent capturing
by smelling a drop of another dog 's urine , a dog can often determine the dog âs sex , diet , health , and emotional state
the implant will be used to reconstruct the former stray 's nose after he lost it in a snare this small implant could change the stray dog 's life forever by returning his ability to smell again
