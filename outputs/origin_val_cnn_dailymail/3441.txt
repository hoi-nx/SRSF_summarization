delph can be an instrumental figure in england winning euro 2016 , according to aston villa manager sherwood
roy hodgson called delph into his squad for the coming matches against lithuania and italy , to little surprise for sherwood having tried to sign the 25 - year - old at tottenham
â roy hodgson will stumble across a team that will win the euros
he will , i tell you
they will win it , â said sherwood
â i feel we âve got top young talent who will have another year âs football
a lot of them would play for any country across europe
delph was included in the latest england squad and could be a fixture in the future aston villa boss sherwood says the midfielder can be part of euro 2016 glory with his country â i âve told delph he could be on the verge of something
there âs competition there but he could be a big part of it
â sherwood recalls a chance meeting with delph âs representative while he was in charge at tottenham last season and the aston villa midfielder was mulling over signing a new contract
delph penned fresh terms in january
â i spoke to his agent in london and told him that if i was still in charge at tottenham , i âd definitely want him to come
he âd cost too much money now , but he would have been a bargain then
â he âs got a change of pace and a hammer of a left foot
i think he âs got the ability to drop his shoulder and go past people
i would nât want him to do that to me
â some players you do nât mind playing against and then there âs others like ( paul ) paul gascoigne who can put you on your arse â just because he will face you up and want to make you look stupid
gazza used to do it with tricks but delph has got more pace and drive
â deph has got more ' pace and drive ' than paul gascoigne , according to sherwood the 25 - year - old unleashes a strike past the west brom defence during a fa cup victory earlier this month
