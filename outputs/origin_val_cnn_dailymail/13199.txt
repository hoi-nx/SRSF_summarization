a gloved hand reaches for a scantily - clad backside
it could be an image from the hit television series " mad men , " which documented the ribald world of advertising in 1960s america
except this is 2015 and " who squeezes them in harelbeke ? " is the poster strapline for the elite e3 harelbeke competition in belgium , accompanied by that gloved cyclist 's hand poised to pinch a woman 's bottom
unlike the wind provocatively lifting up her skirt , the controversial advertisement was n't dreamed up out of thin air
it 's inspired by previous winner slovak peter sagan , who pinched a podium girl 's behind at the 2013 tour de flanders -- something he later apologized for , saying " i promise to act more respectfully in the future
" a week earlier , he was also pictured on the e3 harelbeke podium , making an ass - grabbing motion towards another flower girl
e3 harelbeke 's organizers chose to celebrate his antics in their 2015 campaign , sparking a global debate about sexism in cycling that has raced far beyond the billboard
" old boy 's club " " a guy grabbing a woman 's ass is very much indicative of a level of sexual assault , " said bertine , former professional cyclist and director of " half the road , " a documentary about female racers
" this poster makes cycling look very outdated
they 're relying on a ' good old boys club ' tactic to help them sell a product -- and in this case that product is racing
" judging by e3 harelebeke 's provocative standards , the poster could even appear tame compared to previous years
in 2011 organizers opted for a naked woman lying in a field , while the silhouettes of miniature riders traversed her bare backside
more baffling was last year 's poster featuring a woman straddling three other females curled into the shape of a bike
" such provocative imagery may have been seen by some in the 1950s and 1960s as a basis for selling products , but marketing communications are a rather more sophisticated and progressive activity than they were 50 years ago , " said simon chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at coventry university
" i think e3 harelbeke are rather out of kilter with the way that most people think today
" " a playful nod " cycling 's world governing body , the uci ( uci ) has since requested the poster be removed , to which the e3 harelbeke organisers have agreed -- not that they necessarily see it as offensive themselves
" personally , no i do n't think it 's sexist , " marc claerhout , e3 harelebeke manager , told cnn
could he see why others might find it offensive ? " i do n't know
you have a lot of publicity where you see more than some underwear , " he said
" and we did n't mean it as sexist
" the organization has since withdrawn the poster , releasing an official apology to " anyone who might find it intimidating , discriminatory or sexist
" " the organization launched this campaign as a playful nod to the stage incident two years ago in which a rider got ready to squeeze the buttocks of a flower girl , " it added
removing the poster is one thing -- but the uci missed an opportunity to make an example of a tournament which has used seemingly sexist campaigns for years , said olympic road race champion , cooke
" telling the race organizers to remove the posters is not much of a deterrent , " added the retired cyclist whose autobiography " the breakaway " highlighted sexism within the sport during her over decade long career
" a whopping fine and canceling the race would have sent out the strong message that there is no place for sexism in cycling
instead , the race has received huge publicity
" celebrating sexual assault ? the poster also glorifies what would be seen as sexual assault in any other workplace , said laura bates , founder of the " everyday sexism project
" " it contains a direct reference to an incident of sexual assault , which should n't be treated as something to celebrate and joke about , " she added
similarly , belgium 's institute for the equality between men and women , said the image violated 2007 anti-discrimination legislation and " incited sexual intimidation
" it 's unlikely the same image would have been used in a female tournament
" not only is the poster sexist -- this race does n't even have a women 's field , " said bertine , who has long campaigned for a women 's edition of the tour de france equal to the men 's -- a race often seen as the ultimate prize in cycling
" here we are , fighting these battles to make equality happen
and posters like this are not helping to pave the way for cycling , " she said
she sees the problem not with the majority of " supportive " male cyclists , but with the lack of female representation among race directors and promoters
money talks indeed , sponsorship is a big factor is getting a race like the women 's tour de france off the ground , said alex russell , one of two females on the board of cycling
" a lot of it comes down to whether something has a market value -- and it 's not necessarily down to gender , " she said
" we 've introduced a women 's tour in britain and we have got financial support for that
but you ca n't just jump to mass spectators and mass broadcasting because these things grow incrementally
" former world road race champion cooke points to the discrepancy in prize money as another big obstacle for women within the sport
" the inspiration for the poster is the 2013 tour de flanders , for which male winner fabian cancellara received â¬ 20,000 ( $ 22,000 ) for his efforts
in comparison , when i won this event , i was happy for the team to split the modest â¬ 1,000 i received amongst the other riders , " she said
" the biggest change i would recommend to provide protection , security and credibility for female road riders , would be the introduction of a minimum wage , as there is in place for male riders , " added cooke
" cycling can not be allowed to exist outside the laws of society , like some sort of medieval anarchy
" it seems that rather than a podium girl 's bottom , the one being put under the spotlight at this year 's event , will be the organizers themselves .
