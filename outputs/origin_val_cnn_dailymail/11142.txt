you know england when you want a flat
you know england when you want f * * * ing anything
' but when you want to try and talk about us on the train you talk in your own lingo
he said : ' it was a total shock to witness this racist abuse
you really do n't expect to see it in this day and age

everyone in the carriage was absolutely shocked
' wearing a black leather jacket and dark trousers , the blonde woman first confronted the two men saying : ' do n't f * * * ing sit on my train and speak about me behind my back in your lingo
' do it to my face
i really ai n't f * * * ing shy
i do nât know what you âre talking about because you âre doing in behind my back

nah you do nât have the b * * * * * * s. ' one of the men responded saying : ' you do nât even know what i was talking about
