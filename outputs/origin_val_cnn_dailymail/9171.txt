' i 'm delighted with the win , ' said cherries boss eddie howe
' we felt it was going to be a difficult fixture when you see players fulham have , but we started well , we were very positive , we scored at good times and could have scored more
bournemouth manager eddie howe has joked that he is happy not to have to pay out goal bonuses bournemouth players celebrate cook 's ( second left ) goal during the 5 - 1 away win against fulham ' thankfully we do n't have goal bonuses in the contracts
' brett pitman , only in the side due to an injury to yann kermorgant - who hit both goals in their midweek victory over wolves - got the ball rolling just before the half - hour mark with his first goal since boxing day
matt ritchie doubled the advantage before half - time with a deflected effort and brett pitman helped himself to a fine solo goal on the hour
matt smith pulled one back with his first goal in fulham colours , but any hopes of a home comeback were extinguished when fernando amorebieta was sent off for fouling callum wilson and matt ritchie blasted in the resulting free - kick
cook then crashed in number five with six minutes remaining to put the icing on the cake for the cherries , who made it back - to - back victories after five games without a win to put their promotion bid right back on track

' i did n't think there was anything wrong with the team and i think we have proved that
when we have that ruthlessness we are hard to stop
' the lead has changed so many times it 's almost become the tag no one wants
that 's been the nature of it and it may stay that way until the end of the season , so back - to - back wins are so important
' fulham , by contrast , are looking over their shoulders at the relegation battle - their cushion could be cut to five points by saturday evening
' it looked like top against bottom , ' admitted manager kit symons
' all credit to bournemouth but we are bitterly disappointed with the performance
' until we are mathematically safe we have to get as many points as we can
we are conscious of what 's below us
no one is under any illusions , you only have to look at the table
everyone is fully aware of where we are
