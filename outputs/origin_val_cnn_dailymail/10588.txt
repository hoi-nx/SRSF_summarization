information obtained using torture was used to help foil an al-qaeda plot to bring down two planes , it has been claimed
british authorities intercepted a bomb at east midlands airport after being ' tipped off ' by saudi arabia security forces , reportedly following the interrogation by torture of an al-qaeda operative
the claim comes as former mi5 head sir john said torture does produce ' useful information ' and can be ' effective in the short term
' intelligence obtained via torture was reportedly used in a ' jack bauer real - time operation ' to foil an al-qaeda plot to bring down two planes and intercept a bomb at east midlands airport ( pictured ) a major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from yemen to the us in october 2010

it is believed the bombs were designed to go off mid-air and bring the huge planes down over the us
after what was described as a ' tip - off ' from saudi arabia security forces , the planes were stopped at east midlands airport in leicestershire and the united arab emirates and the bombs uncovered
a group called aqap ( aqap ) later took responsibility for the plot
now it has been claimed the discovery at east midlands airport was only possible because british officials in saudi arabia were in communication with a team believed to have been using torture on a member of terror group al-qaeda
' the people in london went back on the phone two or three times to where the interrogation was taking place in riyadh to find out specifically where the bomb was hidden
there were two british there , in immediate communication with where the interrogation was taking place , and as soon as it happened , they were in touch with the british
it was all done in real time , ' an intelligence source told jamie merrill , james hanning , mark leftly and nick clark at the independent on sunday
a major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from yemen to the us in october 2010

he added : ' of course we use intelligence from torture
we take it from wherever we can get it , but we are never , ever going to say " we do nât want that "
or ask too many questions about where it has come from
it is the difference between intelligence and evidence
' last month , following the death of king abdullah , prime minister david cameron defended british 's ties with saudi arabia - despite the country âs record on human rights
he also said that a piece of counter-terrorism intelligence supplied by the arab state had ' saved potentially hundreds of lives ' in the british , which aides have confirmed was a reference to the bomb plot
he added : ' now , you can be prime minister and say exactly what you think about every regime in the world and make great headlines , and give great speeches
former mi5 head sir john said yesterday that torture does produce ' useful information ' and can be ' effective in the short term ' ' but i think my first job is to try and keep this country safe from terrorism and if that means you have to build strong relationships sometimes with regimes you do n't always agree with , that i think is part of the job and that is the way i do it
and that is the best way i can explain it
' former spy chief sir john , who was head of mi6 from 2009 to 2014 , yesterday hit back at claims that security services played a role in the radicalisation of british jihadist emwazi
asim qureshi , research director of cage , claims emwazi , who was nicknamed john , was interrogated by mi5 and subjected to security agency harassment before becoming a militant
but sir john said arguments that harassment drove emwazi to join is were ' very specious '
' the idea that somehow being spoken to by a member of mi5 is a radicalising act , i think this is very false and very transparent , ' he told bbc radio 4 's today programme
sir john also told presenter mishal husain : ' torture had been used for â thousands of years in order to extract useful information
' if you decide in 2015 that it does n't work at all then that would be to misunderstand the problem
' he added : ' the whole problem about torture and maltreatment is sadly is that it does produce intelligence
and that âs why in a civilised society like ours we have to set aside certain methods , even though they might be effective in the short term
in the longer term they are very counterproductive ; they are undermining the values of our society
