a driver with what looked to be a child in his minivan stopped his car and spewed profanities at a bicyclist who slapped the car when he claimed the driver cut him off
the bicyclist was wearing a helmet camera while cycling through san francisco and caught the whole thing on film
at the beginning of the video the bicyclist and silver toyota minivan traveling side by side at first
a driver with a child in his minivan stopped his car and spewed profanities at a bicyclist who slapped the car when he claimed the driver cut him off then the minivan pulls up in front of the bike , its blinker on , in preparation to turn into the parking lot
' hey , watch it
what the f * * * ? ' the driver can be heard saying as the car pulls up right in front of him
the bicyclist posted the video on reddit and explained that the driver had ' plenty of time ' to see that they were going at about ' the same speed ' but still decided to make the turn
' i made impact before we even came to a complete stop , ' the bicyclist wrote
' then i slapped the rear window in an emotionally charged outburst after we had come to a complete stop
the bicyclist said the tire of his bike hit the rear of the minivan during the impact
' i had thought the guy saw me , since he was right next to me for awhile , and was slowing down to let me go past , ' the bicyclist wrote
' then he slammed on his brakes and got right in front of me bicylist said he hit his front brake as hard as he could and went over the handlebars ' a bit '
he said he then slapped the rear window ' in an emotionally charged outburst ' the driver pulls up in front of the entrance to the parking lot and stops his car , yelling profanities the second he gets out of his vehicle
' what the hell motherf * * * er , what 's your goddamn problem ? ' he said
the bicyclist can be heard responding ' you saw me the whole way , you were right next to me it 's all on camera
' the driver replies : ' i do n't give a s * * * , you saw me making a f * * * ing signal , i did n't run into you i passed your f * * * ing a * *
you were way back there , bullshit motherf * * * er '
when the bicyclist tells the driver to calm down and step away from his property , the driver responds ' then do n't be hitting my car , you hit my f * * * ing car jacka * * '
he then asks the bicyclist ' how do you like this ? ' and kicks his bike twice
on reddit the bicyclist said the driver was ' ready to start throwing fists ' before he pointed at his helmet camera
the driver yelled at the bicyclist : ' you saw me making a f * * * ing signal , i did n't run into you i passed your f * * * ing a * *
you were way back there , bullshit motherf * * * er ' the bicyclist told the driver to calm down and step away from his property
the driver responded ' you hit my f * * * ing car jacka * * ' and then asks the bicyclist ' how do you like this ? ' before kicking his bike twice the bicyclist , who went by the username agentx85b , said he originally got the camera because of the disregard he felt other drivers had for his safety on the road
when commenters on the site said it looked as though the bicyclist was farther away then he first implied , he said it was because of the wide lens angle and the slowed down speed
' i had thought the guy saw me , since he was right next to me for awhile , and was slowing down to let me go past , ' the bicyclist wrote
' then he slammed on his brakes and got right in front of me
i hit my front brake as hard as i could and actually went over the handlebars a bit
' the bicyclist also pointed out that he was able to slap the car with his forearm , proving that the vehicle was not the legally required distance of three feet away from the bike
california law states that a you can not turn into the bike lane if there is a bicyclist currently in the lane , according to the state 's department of motor vehicles
it also states that the width required for ' safe bicycle passage ' is three to four feet .
