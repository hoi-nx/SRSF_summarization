contractors building a highway tunnel under seattle are preparing to remove the world 's largest boring machine so that it can be repaired
the gigantic drill , known as bertha , stopped working in december 2013 after digging just 1,000ft of its two - mile journey to replace the aging alaska way , which was damaged in 2001 by an earthquake
its stalling left crews working on the $ 80million project scrambling to determine how to rescue and repair the five - storey , 2,000 - ton drill
but , using its own power , it was able bore through nearly 20 feet of concrete last month to break through a wall leading to the rescue pit 's opening , and it is now ready to be extracted
now managers of the project are preparing to show off the cutting head as the refurbishment takes place
it will then be shown off the media the machine had experienced various mechanical issues , including increased temperatures , before it stalled out there had been concern that bertha , buried 120 feet underground , might not be able to move itself to the pit opening because it had experienced various mechanical issues , including increased temperatures , before it stalled out
the machine 's breakdown and other construction issues have left the project two years behind schedule and sparked concern about cost overruns and other unforeseen obstacles
supporters , including seattle mayor ed murray , have said it was important to make sure the corridor project is completed
the original highway overhaul was expected to cost $ 2 billion and be completed by 2015
the new timeline for replacing the busy alaskan way viaduct , damaged in a 2001 earthquake , is 2017
state transportation officials , contractor seattle tunnel partners ( stp ) , and manufacturer hitachi zosen were readying next steps in bertha 's removal and repair , a project spokeswoman said on friday
' stp has told us that taking the machine apart and lifting it to the surface will take significant time and effort , ' a statement said
along with mechanical issues , the project has been set back by other concerns
in february , four men at the site were injured when a rebar wall collapsed , causing them to fall 25 feet
two seattle firefighters walked about a half mile into the state route 99 tunnel and carried out one of the injured men while the others walked out
a fifth worker escaped injury , while his four colleagues were taken to harborview medical center , he said
one of the men suffered a fractured arm
