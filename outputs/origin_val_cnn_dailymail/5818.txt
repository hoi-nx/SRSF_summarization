roy hodgson has revealed that arsene wenger rang him for advice before signing danny welbeck for Â£ 16m on transfer deadline day - and that he is delighted that his strong recommendation paid off for both arsenal and danny welbeck
arsene wenger has since said that he only appreciated quite how good a player danny welbeck was after seeing him close up every day in training - and roy hodgson says he gave similar feedback to the arsenal manager when arsene wenger was weighing up whether to buy danny welbeck or not last august
roy hodgson said : ' arsene wenger and i speak more often than most managers as he always comes up to the directors ' box at arsenal and i speak to him very often
and we spoke of course before he signed danny welbeck
i was singing danny welbeck 's praise so i 'm delighted that arsene wenger has seen that my judgement was n't wrong and that he shares that judgement
danny welbeck joined arsenal from manchester united for Â£ 16m on transfer deadline day danny welbeck scores the winning goal for arsenal against his former club in the fa cup quarter - final ' we like danny welbeck very much
we 've always shown faith in danny welbeck
many times he 's been selected by me and my staff when he was not actually playing for manchester united
sometimes he 's not even been on the bench and yet still we ' ve selected him because we think he has the qualities required
' and what danny welbeck really needs is the faith of his manager , which he obviously has from arsene wenger , to get more games
and then i think we 'll see more and more performances from him that we 've been lucky enough to see with england and arsenal were lucky enough to see the other night when he played at monaco
i thought he was really , really good
' danny welbeck is likely to start for england in their euro 2016 qualifier against lithuania next friday
he made 24 starts for manchester united last season and since moving to arsenal on transfer deadline day has already started 25 times with at least eleven games remaining , which roy hodgson believes is benefitting the england player
arsene wenger and roy hodgson in the director 's box at the emirates stadium ' arsene wenger has used him and he 's played quite a lot of games if you compare it to the games he played for manchester united
with us he 's always done what i think is a very , very good job for the team
there are n't many times when he 's played for england where i 've been disappointed in him or in his work rate or desire
but of course it would be great if he gets himself as one of the first names on the arsenal team sheet and play for them every week , that would be a bonus certainly for him and it wo n't do us any harm
' i 'm pretty sure he must have benefitted ( from arsene wenger 's confidence in him )
but it 's not something that has struck me like a bolt of lightning , that 's for sure
when he 's come with us he 's not lacked confidence ever
he knows what we want from him
and he knows that he can deliver what we want from him
he knows that we believe in him
i 've never felt he 's ever come to us with a massive lack of confidence
