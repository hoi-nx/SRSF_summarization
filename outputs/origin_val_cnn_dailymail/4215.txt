americans are usually renowned for exaggerating how big things are in their country , but there âs no need for this in australian â not when you âve got earthworms the size of snakes
this is what the tamara family found out when they spotted two giant earthworms near their buderim home on the sunshine coast
â at first glance we thought they were snakes
it was just this dark long object on a pale tile , â tamara told daily mail australia
but after a closer look the snakes turned out to be giant earthworms
the two worms measured between 60cm and a metre long
â the heavy rain that hit queensland when cyclone marsha passed by was what brought the giant earthworms to the surface
earthworms are uncomfortable when the ground is very saturated and they were probably looking for higher ground during bad weather
it 's this big : scarlett lays the giant earthworm on the floor to show how long it is â they were massive
the ones i âm used to seeing are more like spaghetti
there was one in the garage that was crawling slowly along the concrete , while the other one appeared a few days later on a mat on our patio , â tamara said
tamara had lived in canada for eight years , so she when she put pictures of the giant earthworms on facebook her canada friends could not believe it
â the best comment was : â in canada we call that a snake
â they were all pretty shocked
a few others said they were going to come and visit me after seeing this , â she said
scarlett was fascinated by the huge earthworm and could n't wait to pick it up â but even my australian friends were pretty surprised at the size of them
â tamara âs seven - year - old daughter scarlett was fascinated by the worms , and could nât wait to pick them up and inspect them
â she put on a gardening glove and picked it up
she was very gentle when she picked it up
then it expanded and got even longer
we put it in the garden and watched it make its way slowly back underground , â she said
one giant earthworm was found lying down the side of the tamara 's garage floor
