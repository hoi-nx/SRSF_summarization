nato jets scrambled to intercept russia military aircraft as they neared latvia airspace , officials said on wednesday
estonian radar detected the aircraft over the baltic sea on tuesday night , nato said
other than the lead aircraft , nato said , none of the other russia military aircraft was on a flight plan
nato sent jets to identify the planes and later reported that the military aircraft flew on into russia airspace
nato did n't say how many russia aircraft were involved
the flights come as russia 's northern fleet has been placed on full combat alert for military exercises involving nearly 40,000 troops and 50 warships
the exercises have rattled nerves in nearby nato states , including latvia , where u.s. troops and equipment recently arrived for nato training , and where fears are growing about russia president putin 's next move
at the same time on wednesday , putin joined a celebration in moscow 's red square , where russia celebrated the one - year anniversary of the annexation of crimea
nato has condemned the annexation as an illegal territory grab and is boosting its troop presence in the region in what officials say is an effort to discourage putin from encroaching into other countries
putin describes the annexation as a " reunification , " saying that crimea 's residents overwhelmingly voted to be part of russia
