the bafta - winning presenter , 44 , told the racing post : â i knew i could nât do the grand national because of the oxford-cambridge boat race
' i have not been quiet about my commitment to women âs sport and next year will be a really historic moment because the women âs oxford-cambridge boat race will be on tv for the very first time
' i would have liked to do both events , but whereas i âve covered the last 21 grand nationals i âve never covered the women âs oxford-cambridge boat race
â i felt i could nât say all i say about women in sport and then not be there that first time the women are on the tideway
â yesterday one of her twitter followers , doolan , wrote : â still ca nât believe you are doing the oxford-cambridge boat race over the grand national # deserter
â she responded : â for the record , the grand national does nât need my help , women âs sport does
â after mr doolan said he was upset she was leaving the grand national after 21 years because she was such a good presenter , she added : â you âre very kind but it âs a very good team at c4 and i do nât think you âll even notice i âm not there
and i believe that sometimes you âve got to do something unexpected to make your point
my point being women âs sport matters

â miss balding has long been an advocate of women âs sport and believes that in recent years female athletes have been taken more seriously
she told the independent last year : â i âve felt that , especially since london 2012 , the demand for a variety of women âs sport is there from the public
â they âre interested , they âre engaged and i have the feeling that in the next ten years we are going to see a massively changed cultural landscape

she thought i âd said â inventor â
when i corrected her and told her my ambition was to go to the olympics she just silently passed on to the next girl , while everyone else in the class laughed
â i would like to think nowadays if any girl said they wanted to be an equestrian , an athlete , a swimmer , a footballer or a cricketer , that would be taken seriously as a career option and they would be properly supported and advised
