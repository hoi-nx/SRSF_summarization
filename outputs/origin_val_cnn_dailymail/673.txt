' all i could hear was my little girl shouting " i want my mummy , i want my mummy "
' after arresting mrs cadman-khan on suspicion of child neglect , det sgt colin helyer ' lied under oath ' to claim aimee had been mistreated , the court heard
' he falsely asserted that aimee had been purple and suggested the client had been violent to him , ' nick stanage , barrister for mrs cadman-khan said
' sadly this was a witness that even when caught in a lie by the court he was unwilling to be honest about it
' ' for a woman of good character from that profession to be arrested and accused of allegations of child neglect and cruelty is of the utmost seriousness

he was concerned for the mental and physical wellbeing of aimee
' judge gillian matthews qc however told the court the sergeant had been ' freestyle lying ' in his accounts

he was prepared to mislead the court in what i call freestyle lying , ' she said
