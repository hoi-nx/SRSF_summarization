los angeles the search for a rookie lapd officer suspected of homicide has expanded into an international manhunt , focused on the border cities of el paso , texas , and ciudad juarez , mexico
the fbi said friday it believes awol policeman henry solis is armed and dangerous and drove 800 miles across the desert from california to el paso with his father in a pickup a week ago
the fbi is offering $ 25,000 for information leading directly to the arrest of solis in connection with the death of salome rodriguez , 23 , who died after a fight between the men in a downtown pomona , california , bar
" the pattern suggests he crossed into mexico , but he has family and friends living in el paso and ciudad juarez , " said garriola , special fbi agent who runs the fugitive task force from the los angeles bureau
" so he could be on either side of the border
" " it 's a quick bus ride from the interior of mexico to other parts of the country and central america
" the fbi , pomona police and los angeles county district attorney declined to comment on whether victor solis might face charges for allegedly helping his son flee to el paso
garriola said solis is a veteran of the marine corps and " he has extensive training and weapons " understanding
authorities posted three photos of solis , with and without facial hair , and said he may now have a full beard
police said after the early morning bar fight solis pursued his victim on foot in the nightclub district and shot him multiple times
garriola said solis then reportedly called his father in lancaster , california , and later that morning they began the trek to el paso
victor solis said he dropped off his son at a bus stop in el paso and his son made some incriminating statements " not only about his actions that day but also that he would never be seen again , " garriola said
henry solis worked in the devonshire division of the san fernando valley , where he rode with a training officer
earlier this week , lapd chief beck fired solis and appealed for him to give up

marine corps records say solis served in iraq from april to november 2007 , earning several medals , including for the iraq campaign , global war on terrorism service and marine corps good conduct
