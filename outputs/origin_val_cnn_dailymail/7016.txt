a former isis captive has described how the extremists enjoyed watching teletubbies and game of thrones to relax and sometimes struggled to justify their barbaric acts
french former captive henin has said they watched ' everything ' on tv , and also claimed they were ' fragile people ' who could not turn back after initially committing violent crimes
mr henin , aged 39 , and fellow captive torres , 30 , were kidnapped in raqqa , syria in june 2013 and released 10 months later
french journalists nicholas hã©nin ( left ) and torres ( right ) spent time with briton david haines as isis captives when it came to time off from waging jihad , henin said in an interview with the bbc placed on the spiegel website in germany : ' they watched everything , from teletubbies to game of thrones
' the recruits are fragile people - once pushed to commit a crime when they arrive there is no way they can turn back
' he refused to talk specifically about kuwaiti - born briton briton on the grounds that fellow prisoner , british journalist john cantlie , is still held hostage by the group
he added that he and fellow released captive mr torres played a game at night devised by doomed briton david haines
david haines was beheaded on camera by the islamic executioner now revealed to be kuwaiti - born briton briton
a russian engineer , sergey gorbunov , who was killed during henin 's time there , was remembered in a small ceremony by the rest of the prisoners , he says
french former captive henin said his isis captors watched ' everything ' on tv , and also claimed they were ' fragile people ' who could not turn back after initially committing violent crimes ' everyone paid tribute to him
john cantlie spoke first and then we held a minute 's silence
' talking to some of his captors during his 10 months as a hostage , he says he saw flickers of doubt ' and a lot of bad faith , because they had to justify it to themselves , and some of their acts were impossible to justify '
' i remember with a couple of the captors , we had discussions that showed their convictions were a bit fragile and that they maybe even had regrets about what they were doing
' a bit of chat might help , but no pity for sure because they are totally closed to pity
' asking for pity is the worst thing you can do
' henin was interviewed upon the publication of a children 's book he wrote in captivity with torres based on the game devised by david haines
the book , will daddy hedgehog ever come home ? , was written for henin 's five - year - old daughter , and is published this week .
