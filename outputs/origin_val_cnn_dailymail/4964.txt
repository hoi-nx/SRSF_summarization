as the wembley clock ticked over into the 89th minute , the booming pa system kicked in and proclaimed that welbeck was england 's man of the match
sometimes the sponsors ' choice is met with bewilderment , even derision
the reaction was warm applause from all four corners of the stadium - universal acknowledgement and appreciation
welbeck had been excellent , by some distance the stand - out player
direct and deadly , this was welbeck at his game - changing best
who needs harry kane ? welbeck leads the celebrations after putting england 2 - 0 ahead against lithuania on friday welbeck 's header deflects into the back of the net to send england into a commanding lead welbeck is congratulated by england captain rooney after scoring his sixth of the qualfying campaign welbeck 's pitch map from the lithuania match shows his influence right across the front line welbeck has scored eight goals in 29 appearances for arsenal this season but has six in four qualifiers for england
on a productive night , welbeck blasted in the shot that led to rooney 's opener , stooped to divert home england 's second , had three other shots on goal and tormented the lithuanian defence with his pace , power and passing
the goal augmented his international goal tally to 14 - drawing level with paul scholes - and he duly became the leading scorer in euro 2016 qualifying with six goals , one ahead of israel 's omar damari
welbeck 's touch map showed his influence right across the field , switching places with rooney and raheem sterling in a dynamic front three that linked up seamlessly throughout
the only dampener on the evening was the knee injury that will force him out of tuesday night 's friendly with italy in turin
which all begs the question - why does n't welbeck play like this for arsenal ? welbeck caused the lithuanian defence problems all evening and justified his selection welbeck ran directly at the lithuanian defence all evening in a positive performance welbeck is congratulated by former manchester united team - mate rooney after doubling the lead welbeck 's touch map from the match with lithuania shows his presence right across the attack pushed out to the wing to accommodate the in - form olivier giroud , welbeck has all - too - often looked a spare part in arsenal colours this season following his Â£ 16m move from manchester united last september
the fact his england goal tally for the campaign is just two shy of his club return speaks volumes - perhaps arsene wenger should ask roy hodgson for advice on how to get the best out of the frontman
because he looks a man transformed on international duty - while with arsenal , the wide berth is regarded as something of a snub , inhibiting his performance
with england it somehow plays to his strengths
with the england on his chest , welbeck is content and confident , raising his game to a level rarely seen for the gunners
there he can be aloof , slow and ineffective
the memes that often go viral on twitter portraying welbeck as a world cup winner or with the ballon d'or are very much tongue - in - cheek but he can rise above the mockery
at the moment , welbeck is unlikely to displace olivier giroud , who has 17 goals in 26 games this season , but friday night 's electric performance proves that he can perform in a wide position - on both flanks
arsene wenger should liberate him and say ' you 're playing wide for the foreseeable future , but make it your own
get the head down , get the legs pumping
when you run at opposition defences , it is a frightening proposition
inevitably , positive play will lead to more goals
and more goals will lead to a sustained title challenge
' welbeck has often cut a frustrated figure playing wide for arsenal this season one of the memes on social media portraying welbeck as a world cup winner with england the arsenal man holds the ballon d'or for best player in the world in another viral image another meme had barcelona star lionel messi lifting his shirt to reveal a t - shirt of welbeck 's face arsenal manager arsene wenger has pushed welbeck out to the wings to accommodate olivier giroud welbeck is the first to congratulate debutant harry kane after scoring two minutes after coming on welbeck celebrates with rooney after he turns home the rebound after the arsenal striker 's effort was saved welbeck 's goals have put england in firm control of their euro 2016 qualifying group sure , it was only lithuania but welbeck does n't select the opposition
he delivered against switzerland and slovenia too earlier in the qualifying campaign
with goals comes the confidence to deliver against the top teams as well , in the premier league , champions league and euro 2016 when it rolls around
we now have the blueprint
let 's hope we see welbeck deliver .
