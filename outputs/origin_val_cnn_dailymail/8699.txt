around 40 per cent of a typical public toilet is contaminated by bacteria and viruses , with just one germ multiplying eight million times in eight hours
but a new hand dryer claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of this potentially deadly bacteria quickly and effectively
called the sterillo , it uses a technology known as ' uv plasma ' to blitz all the dangerous airborne molecules inside a room
there she blows : a new hand dryer called sterillo ( pictured ) claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of potentially deadly germs
it uses a form of uv light to blitz all the bacteria inside a room the technology is already used in ambulances and care homes to kill infections , but in the form of a hand dryer can tackle unsanitary conditions in bathrooms
the device uses technology discovered in the 1920s , called dual wave uvc light
this is a form of uv light and is already used in hospitals and to purify water in fish tanks
the device makes use of two wavelengths to kill the viruses
a lamp in the hand dryer creates a type of oxygen molecule called oxygen radicals
such molecules are found naturally and are nature âs way of cleaning
plasma is blasted from the dryer and destroys the germs
this can eradicate airborne infections such as salmonella , e-coli , mrsa and hepatitis a it can eradicate airborne infections that lurk in toilets such as salmonella , e-coli , mrsa and hepatitis a , and inventor levy said the dryer could also benefit schools and offices
the unit costs just under Â£ 500 ( $ 740 )
it contains a ' uvc plasma technology ' unit that silently destroys bacteria in a room â every second of every day â
mr levy told mailonline that the device uses technology discovered in the 1920s , called dual wave uvc light
this is a form of uv light which is already used in hospitals and to purify water in fish tanks , for example
â plasma comes out and goes around the room destroying germs , â mr levy said
the device makes use of two wavelengths to kill the viruses

germ slayer : the hand dryer can eradicate airborne infections that lurk in toilets such as salmonella , e-coli , mrsa ( a scanning micrscope image is shown ) and hepatitis a. inventor levy told mailonline the dryer could benefit schools , offices , hospitals and care homes mr levy explained that inside buildings there are fewer self - cleaning molecules than outdoors , which helps create the perfect environment for germs to breed
he said sterillo 's technology is harmless to humans and that the dryer produces lower levels of radicals than are found outside
â bringing them inside can kill germs and bugs that are not around outside , â he continued
there is an added bonus of the device eradicating unpleasant smells too , as well as any mould
the unit , which costs just under Â£ 500 ( $ 740 ) , contains a uvc plasma technology unit that silently destroys bacteria in a room â every second of every day , to eradicate smells and sanitise surfaces ( illustrated above )
