for many people with primary school children , their weekends are filled with football and cooking , laughter and games
however , for some families , time away from school is filled with violence and the constant dread of being attacked - by their own children
while incidents of domestic abuse against women by their partners is well known , violence against mothers by their children is still a relatively taboo subject
indeed , she says sometimes his attacks are so violent , she 's had to call the police to come and save her
' i 've got locks on my bedroom door - at the top and the bottom - so i 've got somewhere safe to run away from robert , ' says tracy , who lives in preston
' sometimes it 's just a clip around the head , other times it 's a punch or a kick
' in the past two years , tracy has had to call the police on numerous occasions to intervene
' once the police used riot gear to go up the stairs after him , ' tracy said
' he used to throw a paddy when he was two and people used to say to me , " do n't worry , he 's going through the terrible twos , he 'll grow out of it " but it did n't stop , it just got worse , and it hurts a lot more now
' robert sits in his bedroom and contemplates his behaviour having spoken to ann ramsden from the rosalie ryrie foundation
robert can be seen attacking his mother on the channel 5 show my violent child
tracy says her son was diagnosed with adhd ( adhd ) at the age of five and he 's now on the strongest dose possible
' robert can be full of life , full of energy , very loving and very caring , ' adds tracy
' but the other side he can be violent and primarily nasty
i 've had to put locks on my door so if robert is getting violent i have somewhere safe to go
' it 's terrible having to have somewhere in the house that 's safe for me - this is my home , i should feel safe all the time
tracy anxiously peers through the window wondering what mood her son will be in when he returns home ' he kicks , hits and throws things at the wall
when he 's in a temper , he 's got so much force behind him
' i 'm scared that one day he 's really going to hurt me , and if it is n't me , it 's someone else and then he will get into trouble for it
' robert 's stepfather , steve , said he 's concerned about the escalating levels of violence
' he can be evil at times and chased tracy out of the house with two bread knives and we had to call the police
