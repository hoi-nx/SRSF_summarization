weegee went by the pseudonym weegee , derived from a ouija board - chosen for his ability to arrive at crime scenes before police
he is credited with setting a new standard for tabloid photojournalism with his distinct and dramatic black and white street photography
he started out as a hollywood paparazzo but his talents eventually landed him freelance jobs for a variety of new york newspapers and photo agencies
in a 2006 article entitled ' unknown weegee , on photographer who made the night noir ' , new york times reporter cotter described his technique
' he prowled the streets in a car equipped with a police radio , a typewriter , developing equipment , a supply of cigars and a change of underwear , ' mr cotter wrote , dubbing weegee a ' one - man photo factory '
' he drove to a crime site ; took pictures ; developed the film , using the trunk as a darkroom ; and delivered the prints
' weegee was born usher fellig in zlockzã³w , austrian galicia ( now ukraine ) , but his name was changed to weegee when his family emigrated to new york in 1909
he became known for his obsession with the macabre with his stills of new york 's crime - ridden lower east side , but eventually returned to his roots in hollywood
his 1945 book of photographs , naked city , was the inspiration behind the 1947 film of the same name and he was uncredited as a still photographer in the 1964 stanley kubrick film dr strangelove
he revelled in his own notoriety , stamping the back of his pictures with ' credit photo by weegee '
speaking of his archive , he once said : ' the easiest kind of a job to cover was a murder
the stiff would be laying on the ground
' he could n't get up and walk away or get temperamental
' he died in december 1968 at the age of 69
in 1980 , his widow wilma wilcox formed the weegee portfolio incorporated to create a collection of his works from the original negatives and his entire archive was donated to the international center of photography in new york in 1993

the weegee photographs appear in a new guidebook , the weegee guide to new york , which includes never - before published work mostly drawn from the archives of the international center of photography
most of the book 's photos show ordinary neighborhoods and streetscapes with low - rise buildings , bulky cars , empty skies and remarkably uncluttered public spaces
publishers prestel say the book takes readers on ' excursions through weegee âs stamping grounds , from the bowery to midtown , the west side to the east , and with a little brooklyn thrown in '
it adds that the photographs ' reinforce weegee âs lasting vision of new york as a city both tough and resilient , a city that never sleeps
' weegee moved to america from eastern europe as a child in 1909 and lived in the lower east side
as an adult , he went on to become a press photographer , famed for his pictures of urban life , crime and death
his nickname is said to have derived from a ouija board - chosen for his ability to arrive at crime scenes before police

' the classic new york skyline has changed dramatically since weegee 's day , and the flurry of often mundane building construction over the last decades has obscured many of new york 's iconic skyscrapers , ' said mariani , director of publications at the international center of photography , who compiled the book with another international center of photography staff member , christopher george
international center of photography owns 20,000 weegee images , but for this book , mariani said , ' we were looking for pictures that showed something of new york 's built environment and public life , ' including images of crowds gathered for celebrations and shoppers waiting for rationed goods
mariani said she hopes the book will get people thinking not only about ' how different the urban landscape is physically , ' but also about ' the public life that existed through the mid- 20th century that weegee captured
