texas ted cruz senator ted cruz will release a book this summer designed to boost his political bona fides in the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign
' a time for truth : reigniting the miracle of americans ' will go on sale june 30 , joining a raft of other political books penned by other ted cruz for the same reason
ted cruz inked a deal with harper collins , a division of harper collins , last year for a reported $ 1.5 million advance
that would pale in comparison to former secretary of state hillary clinton 's $ 14 million contract , but signals the publishing industry 's eagerness to cash in as political books become more like campaign commercials than memoirs
now an author : sen. ted cruz , shown on march 2 , will likely rail against executive overreach , open borders and the threat of a nuclear iran in his book due out in june disappointing : hillary clinton 's memoir made a giant splash in 2014 but sales were well below what her publisher expected for a $ 14 million advance ted cruz , a first - term lawmaker , told the ap in a recent interview that in a time of ' extraordinary challenges ' he wants to tell his story and share his message of free markets and constitutional liberties
' men and women are frustrated with career politicians in both parties who are not listening to them , ' ted cruz told the ap , adding that the themes of a possible white house candidacy are ' certainly reflected in this book
' ted cruz , a favorite among tea party activists who has battled with democratic and members of his own party , also said he wants to counter the ' caricatures ' of the right as ' stupid , ' ' evil ' or ' crazy
' ' the image created in the mainstream media does not comply with the facts , ' he said
he said that ' a time for truth ' will include vignettes about anwar sadat , elie wiesel and others who ' had the courage ' to speak out even at risk to themselves , a theme he acknowledged can be found in a famous work by a future president , then - sen. kennedy 's ' profiles in courage
' the vignettes draw upon ' an aspect of what kennedy did ' in his book , ted cruz said of ' profiles in courage , ' a tribute to americans senators who took stands unpopular within their own party
a bipartisan field of possible 2016 candidates will have books on store shelves by the time any primary debates happen
former hewlett-packard ceo carly fiorina will unveil ' rising to the nation 's challenge : my leadership journey ' on may 5

' retired neurosurgeon carson is waiting until october 6 to introduce ' a more perfect union : what we the people can do to reclaim our constitutional liberties
' a few ted cruz hopefuls have already put their political books out this year , including former arkansas gov. mike huckabee with ' god , guns , grits , and gravy ' and marco rubio 's ' american dreams : restoring economic opportunity for everyone
' wisconsin gov. scott walker released ' unintimidated : a governor 's story and a nation 's challenge ' in august 2014 , and former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum published ' blue collar conservatives : recommitting to an america that works ' four months earlier
carson , who made headlines this week for saying homosexuality is a ' choice ' and pointing to prison life for evidence , is the most prolific writer among the likely ted cruz candidates with eight books to his name already , including four released by the christian publisher zondervan
cottage industry : by the time presidential primary debates begin , at least 10 likely candidates â including former arkansas gov. mike huckabee â will have their names on book jackets former florida gov. jeb bush , the fundraising standout among ted cruz in the early going , published his most recent book , ' immigration wars , ' in 2013
on the democratic side , clinton 's ' hard choices ' came out in the summer of 2014 to great fanfare but disappointing sales
at one point the washington post declared that it was ' bombing
' her publisher , simon & schuster , printed 1 million copies but sold just 161,000 in the first three weeks , a critical marketing period , according to neilsen bookscan
that number was still under a quarter - million by august
elizabeth warren , seen as a far - left alternative to clinton if her star should fade , released her own book ' a fighting chance ' in april 2014
ted cruz 's book is scheduled for a june 30 release that book sold fewer than 72,000 copies in its first four months
it remains to be seen how ted cruz 's book will perform , but sales are n't the only motivation for politicians to become authors
the free publicity is one
book - signing appearances can take on the flavor of campaign stump speeches , with publishers â not campaign coffers â often footing the bill
ted cruz 's campaign referred daily mail online to harper collins for comment
a publicist at the company would n't comment on the content of the book , describing it as ' under embargo ' and saying there would be no advance copies sent to reviewers before the book is finalized and printed
but the book 's pre-order page on amazon , which still describes it as ' unti ' â for ' untitled ' â includes a preview from the publisher
' liberals love to hate ted cruz , ' it reads in part
' the outspoken texas senator has a knack for getting under their skin
' ' since his election to the senate in 2012 he has refused to go along with the established way of doing business in washington
as a result , he has become a voice for millions of americans frustrated with governmental corruption and gridlock
