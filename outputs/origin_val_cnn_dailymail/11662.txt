england will unleash their ' special ' force of nature , lawes , against scotland at twickenham on saturday to add clout and dynamism up front following the crushing loss to ireland
northampton 's 26 - year - old lock returns to the starting xv as one of two changes from the setback in dublin which dashed hopes of a grand slam for yet another year

lawes will make a welcome return for england against scotland at twickenham on saturday backs : m brown ( harlequins ) ; a watson ( bath ) , j joseph ( bath ) , l burrell ( northampton ) , j nowell ( exeter ) ; g ford ( bath ) , b youngs ( leicester ) forwards : j marler ( harlequins ) , d hartley ( northampton ) , d cole ( leicester ) ; d attwood ( bath ) , c lawes ( northampton ) ; j haskell ( wasps ) , b vunipola ( saracens ) , robshaw ( harlequins , c ) subs : t youngs ( leicester ) , m vunipola ( saracens ) , k brookes ( newcastle ) , g parling ( leicester ) , t wood ( northampton ) , r wigglesworth ( saracens ) , d cipriani ( sale ) , b twelvetrees ( gloucester ) lawes will add clout and dynamism up front to stuart lancaster 's side reeling from their loss to ireland head coach stuart lancaster said : ' there 's always a lot of competition for places and having experienced players like lawes , tom and geoff available after playing well for their clubs in the last few weeks adds to our options
' it 's been an intense two weeks of training as everyone wants to be on that field on saturday and we 've had to make some tough selection calls
' lawes will win his 37th test cap against the scots , having proved his fitness with the saints after being out for two months with an ankle injury
two comeback club matches have been enough to convince the england management that he is primed to reignite their championship campaign
reuniting lawes with dave attwood in the second row means george kruis of saracens is out of the match - day 23 , for the time being
having dipped against ireland after storming displays in the wins over wales and italy , the rookie has made way , with leicester 's lion , geoff parling , coming on to the bench along with flanker tom wood - another back from injury - and prop kieran brookes
full back mike brown will also be back when lancaster announces his side on wednesday mike brown takes part in full training at bagshot on tuesday as england prepare for the calcutta cup forwards coach rowntree said : ' lawes is a special player
he 's been good for us
he 's really maturing as a player and as a person
you ca n't hide what he can bring for us physically
i 've watched his last two games for northampton and he 's played well
this time last year , on the summer tour and in the autumn series , he played exceptionally well and he 's back to his best
' we 've got a lot of athletes in the second row
i 've been very pleased with the progress of the guys who have been performing in the absence of lawes and geoff over the last few months
but we have a lot of riches in that area now
' for many years , lawes has been acclaimed for his destructive impact as a tackler and athletic ball - carrier but rowntree insisted he is equally adept at doing the unglamorous duties required from a tight forward
lawes reunites with dave attwood while geoff parling ( pictured ) comes back onto the bench flanker tom wood ( pictured ) also returns from injury , as will prop kieran brookes ' he is capable of the ' grunt ' work , ' he said
' that area of his game has significantly improved , his work - rate
that 's what you get with lawes : high work - rate but also a lot of stand - out moments
' the reshuffle of the impressive lock stocks extends to a recall for geoff parling as a replacement after the first half of his season was disrupted by concussion
he has forged a reputation as a supreme lineout operator but rowntree also paid tribute to his carrying efforts in recent seasons , and his leadership as an experienced figure who was a mainstay of the lions ' success in australia in 2013
forwards coach rowntree describes lawes as ' a special player ' for what he brings physically rowtree expects a high work - rate along with some stand - out moments from lawes on saturday england 's defeat in dublin was notable as a rare off - day for captain chris , who had been leading the side with increasing authority of late
rowntree did n't duck the fact that the skipper needs to raise his game again
' i 've been happy with chris this last six months , ' he said
' he did well in the autumn , against leinster too , injured his shoulder then came back to be outstanding against wales
he played well against italy but , among a lot of other guys , did not have his best game in ireland against a very good outfit in terms of breakdown and set - piece
chris had a rare off day against ireland but rowntree expects the england skipper to bounce back ' we have had frank reviews and i 'm sure we will have a reaction from chris this week
this group are very good at putting their hands up
one of his greatest qualities is his honesty
' robshaw acknowledged the collective need to lift standards back up to where they were in cardiff
he will be hoping wales scupper irish grand slam hopes before trying to deal with the expectation of a resounding home win against scotland
' there are different pressures , ' he said
' we 're favourites going into that game at home
' you want to deliver and set the standard of how you want to play
hopefully we win , but hopefully we do it in the right manner
