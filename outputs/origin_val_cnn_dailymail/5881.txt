an ally of the russian opposition leader who was gunned down in moscow has branded a theory that he was killed by a devout muslim because he defended charlie hebdo 's cartoons of the prophet mohammed as ' absurd '
it emerged earlier today that police in russian investigating the death of nemtsov were looking at theories that he was killed over his support for the french magazine , which published the controversial images
chechen leader kadyrov had said that dadayev , one of the five suspects detained over the killing of nemtsov was a ' deep believer ' and was not happy by mr nemstov 's supporting the magazine
dadayev is a former member of the police in chechen however , ilya yashin , who co-founded the opposition movement solidarnost has now dimissed the theory , saying it was ' politically motivated '
he said : ' the official version of the inquiry is more than absurd
in my opinion it is the result of a political order from the kremlin
he also added how mr nemtsov had ' never negatively spoken about islam ' and had merely criticised the islamist extremists who gunned down 12 people at the offices of charlie hebdo in paris in january
mr ilya yashin 's comments come after chechen leader mr kadyrov wrote on his instagram account : ' all who know zaur ( dadayev ) confirm that he is a deep believer and also that he , like all muslim , was shocked by the activities of charlie hebdo and comments in support of printing the cartoons
' he also confirmed that dadayev had also been a member of the police in chechen and had been decorated for bravery
mr kadyrov is considered by many as one of russian president putin 's most loyal henchmen in the caucasus region
he was installed by putin as leader of chechen and has spoke of his support for russian rebels in eastern ukraine
mr nemtsov , 55 , was shot four times in the back while walking along a bridge in full view of the kremlin with his model girlfriend anna duritskaya , 23

all of the men were escorted from a bus to basmanny district court , in moscow , with their hands bound in front of them and masked men standing either side
once inside they continued to be flanked by armed guards and were forced to speak from a defendant 's cage
the court heard that dadayev , 33 , served for around ten years in the ' sever ' battalion , which is part of the interior ministry of chechen
his sister confirmed that he had won medals for bravery and courage
judge mushnikova added : ' dadayev âs involvement in committing this crime is confirmed by , apart from his own confession , the totality of evidence gathered as part of this criminal case
' anzor gubashev , who worked for a private security company in moscow , was named as another suspect
alexander bortnikov , the head of russian 's federal security service , said dadayev and gubashev were ' suspected of carrying out the crime '
it was not clear if either of the men were believed to have fired the shots that killed mr nemtsov
russian opposition leader nemtsov , who was killed while walking with his girlfriend in red square in full view of the kremlin at the time of his death mr nemtsov had been working on a report about russian military involvement in the eastern ukraine conflict at the time of his death mr nemtsov had been working on a report about russian military involvement in the eastern ukraine conflict
he was also in the midst of organising a march against the war and had written a number of reports in recent years linking putin and other politicians to alleged corruption
the shooting occurred a few hours after he had made a radio appearance denouncing putin for ' mad , aggressive ' policies in ukraine
surveillance footage apparently showed a man climbing into a white getaway car and being driven away
russian officials have denied any involvement , with president putin dubbing the murder a ' provocation ' .
