a slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed the creature 's incredible tongue acrobatics
captured at 1,500 frames per second , the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill
to do this , the panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds
captured at 1,500 frames per second , this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket the video , captured by bbc earth unplugged , reveals how the tongue reaches around 41g - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet
the creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles , along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring
when a muscle called the long accelerator contracts , the retractor muscles relaxes
this causes other muscles to press against collagen springs , giving it incredible power and speed
location : northern parts of madagascar , rã©union and mauritius
size : male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length , with a typical length of around 17 in ( 45 cm )
females are smaller , at about half the size
lifespan : two to five years reproduction : panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months
females usually live only two to three years after giving birth
the tongue âs tip is a bulbous ball of muscle , and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup
with eyes that operate independently like gun turrets , the remarkable reptile also has a full 360 - degree arc of vision around itself
in january , new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion
the south african chameleon species bradypodion thamnobates releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved
previous studies did nât record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons , the brown university study said
when comparing body - size relationship with tongue performance , smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics
