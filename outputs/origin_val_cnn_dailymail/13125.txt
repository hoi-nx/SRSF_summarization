a previously unknown species of catfish has been named for the wide - eyed , puckered - mouth " star wars trilogy " character it resembles
its scientific name is peckoltia greedoi , and it is known for its large , dark eyes , puckered lips and protruding bristles
but you can call him greedo , in honor of the bounty hunter from " new hope : a new hope
" you might remember him from the cantina scene on mos eisley , where he was killed by han solo while attempting to collect on a debt for jabba the hutt
" i think it was the whole package that evoked greedo , but particularly the eyes and the underslung mouth , " said armbruster , biological sciences professor and curator of fishes at the auburn university museum of natural history
armbruster made the connection in september with colleagues david werneke , milton tan and chris hamilton
but , like many things in academia , it took a while to make it official
the specimens were found in 1998 by researchers along the gurupi river in brazil
armbruster obtained them in 2005 from a museum in porto alegre for a manuscript he was preparing on the genus , " thinking they were unusual
" he designated them as another existing species , peckoltia vittata , in a 2008 paper , " although i had not been comfortable with that designation
" he examined them again in september and discovered they were different from peckoltia vittata
after talking it over with his colleagues , they realized he was a clear ringer for greedo
" as a 7 - year - old kid , i watched " star wars trilogy " in the theater , and it was a life - changing experience for me , " said armbruster
" i became a lifelong fan , and i now share that with my son
greedo has always been a personal favorite of mine
" greedo became the object of controversy when lucasfilm re-released the original star wars trilogy in 1997
a reworked scene showed greedo firing a shot at solo before solo fired back
in the 1977 release , han solo is the only one to fire , prompting backlash from fans and giving rise to the phrase " han shot first
