esa 's rosetta spacecraft is getting ready for an adventurous pass through the geysers of comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko
scientists hope to discover more information about the comet âs interior from the jets
and with the comet becoming more active as it approaches the sun , these next few months are providing the best opportunity yet to study the comet - but it is not without risk
esa is preparing to send its rosetta spacecraft within nine miles of comet 67p
the probe will be tasked with studying the jets coming from its surface ( shown in image )
these could reveal what the comet 's interior is composed of
and as the comet gets more active , philae on the surface could wake up â the comet is getting super exciting , â said esa âs rosetta project scientist dr matt taylor in the times
â hundreds of kilos per second of material is flinging off it
we want to a do a fly - by through one of these active regions
â the rosetta probe , which was carrying philae , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p
it chased comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 3.3ft ( one metre ) per second relative to the comet
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude
philae managed to perform more than 90 per cent of its goals before running out of power
rosetta , meanwhile , is continuing to orbit and study the comet
from data collected by the two proves , esa said that water on the comet was different to that on earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet
the probe will be brought within nine miles ( 15km ) of the comet , with its path taking it right through 67p âs geysers
these jets are formed when ice on the surface sublimates - or vapourises - and they become more active as the comet approaches the sun. it is getting closer and closer over the next few months , with its point of closest approach taking place in august
as it becomes more active , rosetta has a fantastic opportunity to sweep through the increasingly large jets and gather data
in so doing , though , the probe can become disorientated
it relies on seeing stars to know where it is , but the jets can obscure its view
this means that , occasionally , the spacecraft has to take evasive actions when it passes through a jet , to get itself into empty space and re-orientate itself relative to the stars
but studying the jets could reveal vital data on how gas and dust flows out from the surface , and it could also reveal the connection between the comet âs atmosphere - its coma - and the surface
as the comet gets closer to the sun , scientists will also be hoping to hear from the philae lander on the surface
the washing machine - sized philae probe gripped the imaginations of the world when it landed on comet 67p on 12 november 2014
but after making two unscheduled bounces on the surface , the probe landed in an unknown location and ran out of power
now , as the comet approaches the sun , it is hoped that solar rays will recharge philae âs batteries and bring it back to life
the rosetta ( illustrated ) , which carried the philae lander , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of earth and mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67p
it chased comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014 comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko completes an orbit around the sun every 6.45 years ( shown in graphic )
the comet rotates once every 12.4 hours
it is about 2.7 miles ( 4.3km ) long and 2.5 mniles ( 4.1km ) wide , and will make its closest approach to the sun on 13 august 2015 after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , rosetta successfully released the philae ( illustrated ) from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 3.3ft ( one metre ) per second relative to the comet
but when it first made contact with the surface it bounced twice before coming to rest earlier in march scientists sent commands to the lander in the hope it would respond , but with no luck
on 14 april they will make another attempt to get in contact - and , if it stirs from its slumber , philae will have a fantastic opportunity to study the comet as it reaches peak activity
speaking about the most recent attempt to find the probe , rosetta mission manager patrick martin told mailonline : â we were trying to see if the lander would wake up and , at the same time , we sent some commands for the lander to better divide its weight and power situation
â we do nât yet know if the commands have gone through - we might have to wait a bit longer - but basically after one week we did not receive a signal from the lander
â now , as the comet approaches the sun , it is hoped that solar rays will recharge philae âs batteries and bring it back to life
shown is one of the first images returned by philae on the surface , showing what appears to be the probe on its side wedged in darkness against a cliff the main issue at the moment is that , for the lander simply to wake up , it needs enough sunlight to produce 5.5 watts of power - a temperature of around -45 Â° c ( -49 â° f )
but to start communicating with rosetta again the temperature needs to raise a few more degrees so it can generate 19 watts of power
it may have already reached the former level , which might mean it is already operational and able to receive signals - but we wo nât hear anything until it boosts its power to the latter
the next few months are certain to be an exciting time , though - not just for philae , but for the orbiting rosetta spacecraft as well .
