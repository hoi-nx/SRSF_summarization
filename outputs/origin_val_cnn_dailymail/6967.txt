rock legends can be a narcissistic bunch
but bowie appears to have taken things to a new level
the star , 68 , has snapped up an entire collection of masks by a british artist which are replicas of his own face
he now plans to add them to an official archive documenting his career
his attention was reportedly drawn to the items by a team he employs to monitor the art world for pieces inspired by his life
iconic : bowie has snapped up an entire collection of masks , pictured left , by a british artist inspired by his face
pictured right : image from bowie 's aladdin sane lp cover some masks had previously been on sale as part of a bowie exhibition at the victoria and albert museum for Â£ 125 , but speculation is the star paid much more for the ones he purchased
the masks were made from an original cast of the glam rock star âs face taken in the seventies to promote his film the man who fell to earth
after lying unused for several decades , the cast was rediscovered by london - based artist mark wardel who began making replicas of bowie âs face for fans , decorating them with designs including the classic lightning bolt look used on the cover of 1973 album aladdin sane
mark wardel was recently contacted by bowie âs agents who said the man himself was interested in purchasing all the others that he had in his collection
he has now bought up a set of six masks for an undisclosed figure
when asked if bowie paid well for the pieces , mark wardel replied : â yep he did
â the artist revealed : â i had a call before christmas from bowie âs agent saying the man himself was interested in buying some of my masks
â i wondered how he knew i had them but i was told bowie employs people to keep a look out for people making images or art work of him
bowie now plans to add the masks to an official archive documenting his career after being alerted to them by a team he employs to monitor the art world for pieces inspired by his life â i was told not to worry as bowie loves the mask and wants to buy them for his archive
â i spent days making two of them and sent them off to new york and got a message back saying bowie loved them and thought they were gorgeous
he now wants to buy the whole set
â because of bowie âs interest i have now had to take them off the market
i am now making more to send to him and i will have a re-launch of them with an exhibition
â a touring exhibition of items from bowie âs archive has been arranged by the victoria and albert museum
the bowie is exhibition brings together more than 400 objects from the david bowie archives for the first time â including handwritten lyrics , original costumes , photography , set designs and album artwork from the last five decades
the pieces are currently being shown in paris .
