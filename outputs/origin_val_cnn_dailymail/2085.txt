going into the game knowing they needed to win by 26 clear points , stuart lancaster 's team produced an incredible show of attacking rugby which saw them finish one of the most remarkable matches in twickenham history broken , but not bowed

for the fourth year running under lancaster , his side must settle for second place in the championship but this was a stunning performance that will see them take enormous confidence into the world cup

* player ratings by chris foy at twickenham they have reason to be proud
twelve tries were scored in total - seven against five - but ultimately england finished six points adrift of the total they needed as ireland claimed the title for the second season running
england could barely have done any more but were punished for a second - half lapse of discipline which saw haskell sin binned for tripping and france scored two tries
' we 're absolutely devastated , ' said man - of - the - match youngs , who scored two tries
' for all our endeavour , we fell short
' ireland 's crushing victory over scotland at murrayfield earlier in the afternoon left england with a huge mountain to climb
england began the game knowing they must win by the unlikely margin of 26 points to win the first championship of stuart lancaster 's tenure
it was always going to be a huge ask against a french side that , for all its faults , had conceded just two tries in four matches leading into this twickenham clash
suddenly , the perceived advantage of playing the final game of the tournament had become a burden of pressure around england 's throat
stuart lancaster had recalled experienced leicester lock geoff parling in place of dave attwood and kept faith with the backline which squandered try after try against scotland last saturday
parling 's leicester team - mate cole led his side out on his 50th cap and england knew they would need a titanic set - piece performance , first and foremost , to stand a realistic chance of pulling off a stunning championship win
and from the very first scrum there were indications they may deliver as england wheeled their opposing eight enough for no8 billy vunipola to put extreme pressure on france scrum half sebastien tillous-borde
the france no9 threw a pass to nowhere with vunipola breathing down his neck and england centre joseph â england 's find of the tournament â gathered and fed the ball down the right to full back brown
brown worked the ball to george ford who flipped a clever pass inside to youngs who pirouetted over the line for a try inside 90 seconds
george ford added the conversion from the right hand touchline to make it 7 - 0 and england were away
only a missed penalty attempt dampened the crowd 's enthusiasm
then , disaster struck as courtney lawes fumbled a pass from youngs down the right and tillous-borde snaffled the ball with only cole covering across and the line at his mercy
the france scrum half sped in from fully 60 metres to silence the twickenham crowd
plisson missed the conversion but moments later france went even further ahead when winger noa nakaitaci broke away down the left to score his side 's second try inside a couple of minutes
but the left winger can consider himself incredibly fortunate after he brainlessly attempted to run around under the posts only to touch the ball down milliseconds before his left foot stepped over the dead ball line
the tmo agonised over the decision and eventually , after countless replays , the try was awarded
england 's jack nowell goes over for his second try of the match but england could not find enough points to jump above ireland france 's noa nakaitaci scores a controversial try after getting away from youngs during the first half noa nakaitaci was deemed to be in control of the ball as he touched it down before falling over the dead ball line england 's joseph ( centre ) is tackled by france duo maxime mermoz ( left ) and vincent debaty england 's players were left to rue some costly mistakes as they missed out on yet another six nations title under lancaster plisson 's conversion made it 15 - 7 after 17 minutes and suddenly england 's task was even greater than at kick off
courtney lawes caused a mini fracas when his huge hit on plisson angered france , although referee nigel owens deemed the tackle was fair
ford then reduced the deficit to five points with a long - range penalty and plisson missed back - to - back penalties to deny france the chance to pull further ahead
now it was england 's turn to get lucky
youngs made a searing 40 metre break down the right and fed inside to ford who was tackled short of the line
haskell dipped for the ball but appeared to knock on in the process before gathering and popping to anthony watson to cross
but this time the tmo ruled in england 's favour and the try was awarded with the ball deemed to have come off haskell 's knee
george ford converted to make it 17 - 15 after 31 minutes
in an astonishing game , joseph then broke from his own line to make 70 metres before chipping ahead for luther burrell
the centre lost out to bernard le roux but earned a penalty which england took quickly and youngs wriggled over for his side 's third try
george ford converted to make it 24 - 15 and england dared to dream again
a ford penalty on the stroke of half time left england 27 - 15 in front after a memorable half but maime memoz crossed two minutes into the second half to leave the home side 21 points away from claiming the title
seven of those came four minutes later when youngs , enjoying his best game in an england shirt , made a searing break down the right and fed inside for ford to canter over for his side 's fourth try
george ford converted his own try to make it 34 - 22
courtney lawes is grabbed by his shirt during the first half as france 's players let their frustrations boil over george ford slides on to his right side as he scores england 's fourth try of the afternoon and first of the second half exeter chiefs ' jack nowell finishes off another flowing england move to score his country 's fifth try against france bath 's anthony watson scores england 's second try of the match during a frantic opening period at twickenham france 's sebastien tillous-borde responded to youngs ' early try with one of his own after a brilliant 40 - yard dash danny cipriani drives forward late on during england 's desperate search for points at twickenham hartley conceded a needless penalty which replacement kockott kicked
it was hartley 's last act as he was replaced by tom youngs on 52 minutes
england struck again when jack nowell crossed after more good work from youngs and ford 's conversion made it 41 - 25 after 53 minutes
but england 's delight was tempered when haskell was sent to the sin bin for a blatant trip on plisson
with haskell off the pitch , france broke again and noa nakaitaci made a searing run down the left
brown looked to have stopped him but the winger flicked a clever pass to the supporting vincent debaty and the prop scored
kockott missed the conversion leaving the deficit at 11 points
danny cipriani was introduced to the fray at full back on 61 minutes with anthony watson going off and brown moving to the wing
within seconds england scored again when vunipola drove over and ford converted , leaving england 18 points in front
it was utterly astonishing stuff
france scored their fifth try when replacement benjamin kayser drove over from a line out but kockott missed again to leave the score 48 - 35
haskell was replaced by tom wood as england began to sense their title hopes were slipping away
but in keeping with this incredible game , jack nowell crossed for his second try after clever work by george ford , who converted , to leave england needing six more points with four minutes left
