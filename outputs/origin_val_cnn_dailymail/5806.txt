a would - be motorist , who has spent more than Â£ 5,000 on 250 lessons over a 14 - year period has been blacklisted from her local driving schools due to her failure to pass the test
janine mars , 31 , has had five different driving instructors only to fail her practical test four times
yet , despite the intensive instruction , ms janine mars is still unable to pull away from a junction without stalling her car
janine mars , pictured , has spent more than Â£ 5,000 on driving lessons over the past 14 years without success ms janine mars , pictured , said she lacks confidence when she gets behind the wheel of a car ms janine mars , left , said her mother radha , right , will give her money towards a car if she passes the driving test she said , now the situation is so bad , she can not find an instructor near her home in chatham , kent , willing to take her because of her poor motoring skills
it is estimated that during her driving lessons , ms janine mars has driven the equivalent of a road trip between london and perth in australia
according to ms janine mars : ' after a few years i stopped counting how much i âd spent
' it âs definitely more than Â£ 5,000 now , which is crazy
i could have bought a brand new car for that ! ' i ca nât give up now though , i âve invested too much to stop
' ms janine mars started driving as soon as she was old enough , but changed instructor after 15 lessons because they did nât get on
when she moved to her second teacher , she had more than 100 lessons before realising he was nât going to put her forward for a test
in 2012 she chose a third instructor , before moving to a fourth expert - even sitting double lessons - without success
eventually she tried a fifth instructor in august last year , but failed her most recent test
ms janine mars said : ' every year since 2001 , passing my driving test has been my new year âs resolution
' i took a break after my last test in october but i want to do an intensive week course
' i reckon that âs the only way i can pass now
' the last time i tried to get an instructor in kent nobody would take me because they know how bad i am
' it âs as if i âve been blacklisted
i do nât blame them though ! ' but ms janine mars , pictured , said she is having difficulty finding a driving instructor willing to take her on radha , left , said her daughter , right , is ' the world 's best backseat driver ' constantly offering advice despite her inability to pass her test , ms janine mars has never had an accident and believes her problem is a lack of confidence
' driving does nât come naturally to me
i ca nât quite master using both legs and hands at different times
i âve had the same problem for the last 14 years
' i âve never had a crash or accident
everything will be going really well , calm driving , and then suddenly i fall to pieces
it might only be a minor thing , like i miss a junction or turn , and i âll be thrown completely off course
' everyone tells me i âll get over that - but 250 lessons later and i âm still waiting
' now ms janine mars plans ahead before each driving lesson , having developed a routine to help get her into the correct frame of mind
she revealed : ' before i get in the car , i eat a big breakfast and drink a mug of tea
' then , without fail , i play happy by pharrell to get myself into a more relaxed mindset
i âve experimented with different music , but some of them would get me too pumped up
even with doing that i still have the same issues
' ms janine mars ' mother radha , 62 , has even tried to encourage her daughter with the offer of cash towards her first car
she said : ' i ca nât wait for her to pass
â she âs a real diva in the car
despite the fact she has nât passed her test she âs the world âs best backseat driver
she âs always saying " mum , do nât do that " or " go here "
' i âm so desperate to stop carting her round , i âve promised i âll go halves on a new car once she passes ! ' ms janine mars said she has not given up her dream of owning her own car
she added : ' maybe i âm just one of those people born to be driven
i âm fed up of planning my life around train and bus timetables too
it takes almost twice as long as driving
my mum has promised to go halves on a new car once i pass so that âs even more of an incentive
' ms janine mars said she might be the type of person who is ' born to be driven ' but still plans to continue trying
