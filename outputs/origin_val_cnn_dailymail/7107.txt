ramsey is relishing his role as semi-permanent qpr manager , regardless of the four - point margin between the west london club and 17th place
ramsey joined qpr as academy manager after 10 years with tottenham , and picked up the managerial reins until at least the end of the season after the departure of harry redknapp in february
the former brighton right back , whose side host everton on sunday , found himself out of work for more than half a year after being relieved of his duties in north london at the end of last season , and admits he was desperate to return to the game â irrespective of the circumstances
ramsey insists he is relishing his role as semi-permanent qpr manager â i had seven months at home watching frasier , jeremy kyle and homes under the hammer ! â said ramsey
â of course i would rather be here in this situation than be out of work and worrying where the next job or paycheque is going to come from
â i 'm in a fantastic situation - i 'm one of 20 managers in the best league in the world
â ramsey has a fight on his hands if qpr are to remain in â the best league in the world â , and while no physical confrontation took place , the 52 - year - old admitted to a â heated exchange â with his players when 3 - 0 down at half - time against crystal palace a week ago
the qpr boss instructs his players during a training session ahead of their clash against everton however , ramsey knows simply rollicking his players each week wo nât be enough to save qpr âs season
â we âve had some strong words before each game to be honest , and sometimes you have to take a different tact because the effect of that speech goes , â ramsey continued
â sometimes you have to look at the game and the situation , and use different strategies to get the players ready to perform
â the players did nât throw the towel in against crystal palace
we talked about making sure the fans were nât embarrassed any more in the second half of the game
â so matty ( phillips ) scores a goal like he âll probably never score again
if he shoots from there again i do nât think i âll be too happy , unless it goes in
â qpr suffered a 3 - 1 defeat at the hands of alan pardew 's crystal palace last weekend
