one of at least four airmen captured by al qaeda militants after their syrian air force helicopter crash - landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric
the pilot , who was captured near jabal al-zawiya in idlib province , is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi abdullah al-muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle
al-muhaysini , who has long been affiliated with al qaeda - linked groups in syrian , suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the syrian regime releases notorious jihadi abu mus'ab as - suri , who is wanted in spain for suspected links to the 1985 el descanso and 2004 madrid bombings
clearly suffering injuries as a result of the helicopter crash , the pilot still has bloodied bandages wrapped around his head
the footage is decidedly amateur , is clearly filmed on either a mobile phone or a cheap recording device - making it look nothing like the slick , professionally edited videos put out by nusra 's rival jihadi group islamic state
nevertheless , the sight of al-muhaysini standing over the pilot and ranting about his possible murder while wielding a large knife has the same chilling impact as any isis release
al-muhaysini 's primary demand is that the syrian regime release abu mus'ab as - suri - a notorious al qaeda linked militant who was arrested in pakistan in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland
aleppo - born as - suri - who holds spain citizenship remains a wanted man in spain on suspicion of taking part in the islamic jihad organization 's 1985 bombing at madrid 's el descanso restaurant , which left 18 dead
he is also wanted as a possible witness to the al qaeda - inspired coordinated bombings on the madrid 's train system , which killed 191 people and left more than 2,000 injured in march 2004

the united nations claims the syrian air force uses helicopters extensively to drop barrel bombs in indiscriminate attacks on residential areas
the improvised munitions are giant canisters packed with hundreds of pounds of explosives and scrap metal
however , syrian president bashar al-assad denied in a bbc interview last february that his forces used barrel bombs .
