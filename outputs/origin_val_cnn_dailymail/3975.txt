a person 's sexual orientation can determine how much money they will earn according to a new report that claims gay men face discrimination from employers
based on the personal information provided by over 10,000 people in the 2012 household in australia ( hilda ) survey , the report states that lesbians earn 33 per cent more than heterosexual women
however the reason for the extra pay is due to the survey sample noting that they work about 20 per cent more hours , the university of melbourne 's wooden said
based on the personal information provided by over 10,000 people in the 2012 household , income and labour dynamics in australia ( hilda ) survey , the report states that lesbians earn 33 per cent more than heterosexual women ' one explanation for the increased earnings and longer work hours of lesbians might be that this group are less likely to have children than heterosexual women , ' he said
the hilda survey recorded that only 22 per cent of lesbian women between the ages of 30 and 49 had children three years ago , compared to almost 60 per cent of straight women
gay men on the other hand , were found to earn about 20 per cent less than heterosexual men due to a lower rate of earnings ' growth
the gap in pay only worsened for those who lived with a partner , despite lesbians living with their significant other recording higher wages than those without
' we found that the wages of gay men are growing at a much slower rate than the wages of heterosexual males , ' prof wooden said
university of melbourne 's ( pictured ) wooden said gay men were found to earn about 20 per cent less than heterosexual men due to a lower rate of earnings ' growth ' gay males who are most likely to be observably gay by employers â those who live with a same - sex partner â face larger earnings penalties than those who are discreet about their sexuality
' the report added that ' gay men are 16 per cent less likely to be employed and are substantially more likely to have several periods of joblessness than heterosexual men '
although admitting that numerous factors contribute to the varying earnings across sexual orientation , professor wooden admitted that ' employer discrimination is likely a major part of the explanation for these wage gaps , especially in the case of gay men '
