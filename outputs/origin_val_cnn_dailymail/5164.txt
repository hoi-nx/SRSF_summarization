new york has spent $ 18 million in five years unclogging ' flushable ' wet wipes from the sewer system
as the products have become increasingly popular , many manufacturers claim to have ' adapted ' them to biodegrade when flushed
but the city 's waste management directors have told the times : that is not the case
' indestructible ' : wet wipes branded as ' flushable ' have been clogging up the system by twisting into knots when the wipes twist into a knot and mix with grease or oil , they are ' really indestructible , ' deputy commissioner vincent sapienza of the department of environmental protection said
worming their way into the pipes of homes , offices and public buildings , the wipes have doubled the amount of solid waste that needs to be extracted from water treatment plants
dave rousse , president of the wipes trade group , insisted to the times that users are not flushing the products properly
outrage : new york 's water waste management has spent $ 18 million on wet wipes in five years his words have been slammed by city officials - and waste water managers around the country - who insist the wipes should be disposed of in the trash
the controversy could be solved by an experiment , backed by mayor bill de blasio , that will test which wipes survive the entire sewage system
if so , under a new bill , the manufacturers would be ordered to remove the term ' flushable ' from its packaging .
