' alonso then posted a picture on twitter of him dining out with ron dennis , the mclaren chairman , and team principal eric boullier
the snap comes after alonso contradicted mclaren 's version of events surrounding the mysterious testing crash which ruled him out of the race in melbourne
â our form today was n't unexpected but i think our performance so far this weekend has maybe been better than i 'd have anticipated before arriving here in malaysia , ' alonso added
â however , the steps we 're taking with the car show a lot of progress , so i 'm optimistic that i wo n't be qualifying in q1 for that much longer
â this is n't an ideal position from which to start the race , but i 'm fully aware that mclaren - honda is a long - term project
we want to beat mercedes , and to do that you need time , and to be prepared to take your chances as they come
â jenson button will start from 17th on the grid , one place ahead of his mclaren team - mate alonso the briton , sporting a moustache in malaysia , believes there are a ' lot of positives ' mclaren can drawn from jenson button , who qualified one place ahead of alonso , echoed his team mate 's sentiments and admitted that the speed at which mclaren have closed the gap on the cars in front was a good sign

â also , i think our race pace and our consistency over a long run look like giving us a little extra
i 'd like to think we could get closer to some of the cars in front tomorrow ; that 'll be something to look forward to
â there are a lot of positives to take from this weekend : we 've made a big step forwards in terms of pace
there 's more to come from the engine and the aero package but we know what to do
