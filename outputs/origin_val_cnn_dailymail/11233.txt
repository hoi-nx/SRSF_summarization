according to transcripts published today , captain sondheimer screamed â open the goddamn door ! â as his killer co-pilot lubitz deliberately flew the aircraft into an alpine ravine after he had left to go to the toilet

dramatic recordings from the germanwings flight âs black box have revealed the captain âs desperate attempts to break into the cockpit to regain control of the plane a french rescue worker inspects the remains of the germanwings airbus a320 at the site of the crash lubitz is believed to have locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck , and used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent , something that can only be done manually - and deliberately
a transcript published in today âs edition of the german newspaper bild , reveals that the chilling recording starts with captain sondheimer apologising to passengers for a 26 - minute delay in barcelona , and promising to make up the time on the flight to dusseldorf
in the next 20 minutes , sondheimer converses with co-pilot lubitz , who tells him he can go to the toilet at any time and he will take over the controls , noting that the pilot did nât go to the lavatory in barcelona
at 10.27am , the airliner reaches its cruising altitude of 38,000ft
the pilot prompts his first officer to prepare for the landing in dusseldorf
the french prosecutors described lubitz âs replies as â laconic â , and he is heard using words such as â hopefully â and â we âll see â
after the checks for landing , lubitz says to sondheimer again : â you can go now
â lubitz was sitting in this cockpit , pictured , when he commanded the jet to crash into the french at 400mph the pilot lets another two minutes elapse , then he says to lubitz : â you can take over
â there is the sound of a seat being pushed back and the snap of a door
at 10.29am the flight radar monitors the plane descending
at 10.30am it is down by 316ft , and just a minute later , it is down 1,800ft
at 10.32am air traffic controllers try to contact the aircraft , but get no response
in the plane , the automatic alarm signal â sink rate â sounds almost at the same time , according to the voice recorder
dramatic recordings from the germanwings flight âs black box have revealed the captain âs desperate attempts to break into the cockpit to regain control of the plane shortly afterwards there is a loud bang , which sounds like someone trying to enter the cockpit
sondheimer yells : â for god âs sake , open the door ! â in the background , passengers can be heard screaming
at 10.35am â loud , metallic banging against the cockpit door â is heard again , according to the french authorities
the jet is still 7,000ft above the ground
about 90 seconds later there is a new warning message â â ground ! pull up ! pull up ! â the pilot is heard shouting : â open the goddamn door ! â at 10.38am , with its engines racing , the aircraft is on a north - east course over the french
the breathing of lubitz can be heard in the cockpit but he says nothing
access to the cockpit door on the germanwings airbus a320 ( like the one above ) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking at 10.40am the aircraft hits the mountainside with its right wing
the last sounds are more screams from passengers
it is believed that sondheimer resorted to using a crowbar to try and get through the armoured panel as the plane plunged fatally towards the french
german newspaper bild yesterday reported that he had attempted to use an axe , and a germanwings spokesman confirmed that such a tool was on board the aircraft
but the only axe on the plane would have been in the cockpit , meaning it was out of reach of the captain
it has emerged that lubitz once planned to marry his long - term girlfriend but she broke off the relationship because his jekyll and hyde personality left her fearing for her safety , it was claimed
the woman , named as teacher kathrin , is understood to have called time on lubitz 's increasingly erratic and controlling behaviour just weeks before the germanwings crash
reports emerged that police searching the pilot 's flat had found a ' small mountain of pills ' and he had apparently been refusing to take his antidepressants medication
miss kathrin still lived with lubitz , 27 , but it is understood she was on the lookout for a flat after being driven away by his need to be in charge
he even tried to tell her what to wear , friends said
while outwardly confident , his hidden insecurity demanded constant attention â which led him to betray kathrin with a five - month fling with a germanwings stewardess conducted in cheap hotels
but she , too , is believed to have ended her relationship after growing fearful of the ' tormented and erratic ' lubitz
at an extraordinary press conference , marseille prosecutor robin gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box
he said lubitz locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck
he said : ' the intention was to destroy the plane
the plane hit the mountain at 700kmh ( 430mph )
' i do n't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds '
referring to lubitz , mr robin said : ' he did this for a reason which we do n't know why , but we can only deduct that he destroyed this plane
we have asked for information from the german investigation on both his profession and personal background '
mr robin said he had no known links with terrorism , adding : ' there is no reason to suspect a terrorist attack
' family members of a victim pause in front of a stele , a stone slab erected as a monument , set up in the area where the germanwings aircraft crashed in the french , in le vernet , france the crash on tuesday killed all 150 people aboard
reports have emerged that police searching the pilot 's flat had found a ' small mountain of pills ' and he had apparently been refusing to take his antidepressant medication two teddy bears dressed in the uniforms of a germanwings pilot and a flight attendant sit in the centre of a wreath outside the germanwings headquarters at bonn airport and asked whether he believed the crash that killed 150 people was the result of suicide , he said : ' people who commit suicide usually do so alone ... i do n't call it a suicide
' mr robin , who had earlier briefed the families of the dead â and separately those of both pilots â said the screams of passengers aware of their fate could be heard in the final seconds of the recording
it also emerged that his parents only discovered that their son was a mass murderer just minutes before the bombshell press conference by prosecutors in marseille
his mother , a piano teacher , and father , a successful businessman , were understood to be in the french city at the time of the announcement , but kept separate from the victims ' relatives
their whereabouts are now unknown , but it is believed they are being questioned by police
the couple 's Â£ 400,00 two - storey detached home in montabaur , a town 40 miles from bonn where lubitz is thought to have grown up , was also searched by detectives
as a child , lubitz is said to have always wanted to be a pilot and covered his bedroom walls with pictures of planes and collected model aircraft
