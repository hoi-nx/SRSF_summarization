judge canavan branded him ' a danger to society '
sentencing him to three years ' imprisonment , judge canavan described him as a â serial , sexual pervert ' and called for him to be removed from the country as soon as possible
she said : â your devotion to your religion is only convenient to you when it gives you an excuse for your sexual misconduct
â you are not a national of this country , and the sooner you are removed from the country the better
the first attack took place on a c2c train going from essex into central london , the court heard
prosecutor masi said : ' the defendant got onto the train and sat down beside [ the first victim ] - even though there were plenty of empty double seats on the carriage
' the victim noticed mr shamsul islam was rubbing his elbow up against her
she tried moving away but the defendant kept moving closer to her
he would look away whenever she tried to look at him
' at one point , after the defendant had got up and sat back down again , the victim felt him touching her stomach and looked down to find his hand under her top
' when she challenged him the defendant got up and moved
' the second assault , on a 15 - year - old girl , happened on a bus in mid-afternoon a few days later , the court was told
the teenager boarded the bus and immediately felt uncomfortable because islam had been staring at her at the bus stop
' there were other double seats available yet the defendant chose to sit next to her , ' mr masi said
' he was staring at her before moving his arm and touching her right leg with his hand
he then tried to get his hand under her top and on top of her leggings
' the third attack , which happened on another bus the same day , left the 16 - year - old victim ' paralysed with fear '
islam sat next to her , before using his fingers to caress the girl 's stomach and moved his hand down to her shorts
attack : one of the assaults took place on a c2c train from essex to london ( file photo ) a few weeks later he boarded a different bus where he sat next to a girl and grabbed her breast
when the girl confronted her attacker he replied : ' i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry , i 'm fasting , i do n't know what i am doing
' mr masi said that all the victims were upset by the assaults and were left in floods of tears
the first victim said she now ' questions how others look at her ' in an impact statement read to the court , while another said she becomes physically sick when using public transport
islam was arrested on september 17 after police used his oyster card to track him down
judge canavan said : â i do nât underestimate the impact this has had on the psychological wellbeing of the victims
' speaking about the first incident , the judge said : ' i have no doubt that you knew she knew you were touching her and indeed the thrill for you in part was the fright that you were causing to that woman
i have no doubt that that fed into your sexual satisfaction
â when subsequently interviewed you said that you could nât remember the incident
you attempted to blame ramadan as causing you to forget
as became plain during the course of the interview that was a lie - you did know what you had done
â she said that the second victim , aged just 15 , was ' very uncomfortable ' , adding : â i have no doubt you targeted her too and i have no doubt that part of the sexual thrill of your offending was the helplessness of the woman who was the subject of your sexual assault
â i say " woman " , but she was in fact a child
she got off the bus and burst into tears and rang her mother
but that was clearly not sexually satisfying enough for you because within 90 minutes you were assaulting another woman
â in relation to the fourth attack , judge canavan said : ' you said you were sorry , and that you did not know what you were doing because you were fasting
' it âs my fervent wish that you will be immediately deported from the uk
