the former owner of a bayswater hotel has been hit with london âs biggest ever fine for an individual for violating fire safety rules
london fire brigade said guests â lives were put in jeopardy due to the shoddy conditions which were discovered inside the radnor hotel during an inspection in 2011
it brought charges against then - owner patel , who was fined Â£ 200,000 this week after a successful prosecution
london fire brigade said fire doors were missing ( right ) or tied open with electrical cords or string ( left ) in addition to the six - figure fine , mr patel was ordered to pay nearly Â£ 30,000 in court costs after pleading guilty to seven offences under the regulatory reform ( fire safety ) order 2005
he was also handed a four - month prison sentence , suspended for 18 months , the london fire brigade said
fire safety officers were stunned when they toured the six - floor , 18 - room hotel , on inverness terrace , to carry out a routine inspection
they discovered numerous fire safety breaches , including inadequate fire detection systems , blocked emergency exits and inadequate emergency lighting
fire doors were missing or tied open with extension cords or string , there was evidence the basement store room was used for sleeping , and the owner had not conducted a fire risk assessment
a spokesman for the london fire brigade said the hotel , on inverness terrace , is under new ownership mr patel was given an enforcement notice , which required him to address the safety concerns to make the hotel safer for guests , but follow - up visits found that no action had been taken , the london fire brigade said
the hotel continued to operate without a working fire detection system , so court proceedings were launched against the hotelier
when mr patel was sentenced judge kennedy said the public expected â absolute attention â to fire safety when occupying sleeping accommodation
the judge told court that mr patel did not provide that protection and , as a business owner , he was where the â buck stopped â , the london fire brigade said in a statement
hotel owner patel received a record Â£ 200,000 fine this week after a successful prosecution neil orbell , head of fire safety regulation , said he hopes the penalty serves as a deterrent for other hoteliers
he said : â our fire safety officers carry out around 16,000 inspections every year to help ensure the capital 's buildings are safe from fire
â this is the biggest fine we have ever secured against an individual for breaking fire safety laws and it should send a message to all business owners that if they are shirking their fire safety responsibilities and putting the public at risk we wo nât hesitate to prosecute
â the size of the fine should also serve as a stark reminder that the court âs take fire safety just as seriously as we do
â a spokesman for the london fire brigade said mr patel no longer runs the hotel and it is under new ownership
guests complained about the conditions in a series of scathing reviews on tripadvisor , where the radnor hotel had a rating of two stars before it closed
of 92 reviews , 59 were filed under â terrible â
helen , from australia , wrote in august 2012 : â we were a little alarmed at the fire emergency plan which was printed straight off the internet and put up without being filled in
we drew comfort from the fact the place has not burned down yet
