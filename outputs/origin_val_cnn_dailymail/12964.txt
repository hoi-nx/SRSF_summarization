after spending much of her 2008 campaign seemingly running away from the fact that she is a woman , hillary clinton is showing signs that 2016 is going to be a different story
it seems that hillary clinton has found her outer woman , which is to say , she 's found the person that she wants to present on the campaign trail , and that person is resolutely female
this time she seems to have decided to fully embrace her womanhood as an asset in her quest for the white house and to trust that the voters will do the same
of course , hillary clinton has n't officially announced that she will be running for president -- and universal studios has not officially announced that there will be a sequel to the blockbuster " 50 shades of grey
" but it 's hard to imagine 2016 happening without both of those things , seeing as how they both have such excellent prospects of success
hillary clinton recently spoke at a silicon valley conference for women in the tech field with the theme of " lead on
" that lent itself nicely to the professional goals of the members of the audience as well as to hillary clinton 's own leadership goals
she spoke of the dearth of women not only in the tech field , but in the ranks of fortune 500 ceo 's
in fact , one recent diversity study found that the major s&p 1500 company boards had more men with the name john , robert , william , or james on them than women of any name combined
left unsaid in her speech was any reference to the complete lack of a female occupant of the oval office thus far , but the thought could not have been far from anyone 's mind , let alone hillary clinton 's
clinton was comfortable talking at length about her own experiences being pregnant and giving birth while working as a partner in a law firm , and using that as a launching pad to discuss the importance of women in the workforce both here and around the world
and from there she highlighted her own work on behalf of the women of the world as secretary of state
she segued into the discussion of the plight of working middle - class families that will be so central to the 2016 race , and the centrality of women 's economic issues to those struggles of the middle - class
from there it was a natural progression to talking about 21st century families and the importance of things such as paid leave
and all of that dovetailed perfectly into closing remarks about the future that revolved naturally around the birth in september of clinton 's first grandchild , charlotte clinton mezvinsky
that brought up hillary clinton 's new role as a grandmother , and the perspective it has given her on the future and what needs to be done to guarantee that it 's the best possible future
the silicon valley address could serve as a template for how clinton intends to approach her career goals from the vantage point of being a woman seeking her own place in the workforce
in the coming weeks , which serendipitously happen to be part of women 's history month , hillary clinton 's speaking schedule is heavy with events and gatherings that center around women
if she 's not running for president , then she could be gearing up to get a talk show on the lifetime network
all of which stands in stark contrast to hillary clinton 's last presidential campaign
in 2008 , she seemed to think that she had to reassure voters that a woman could be president , primarily by not accentuating the fact that she was a woman
this time around , there seems to be a shared assumption that , of course , a woman would make an excellent president , in part simply by virtue of being a woman
in that previous campaign , hillary clinton ran as the most experienced candidate , primarily to draw a distinction between herself and her relatively less experienced challenger , obama
but now , almost eight years later , clinton can let her experience speak for itself
she has more of it -- almost too much , from one perspective : she 'll be 69 by the time the 2016 election takes place
so this time instead of highlighting her experience , she 's highlighting the experiences she has in common with the women , mothers and grandmothers out there
of course , hillary clinton 's message will have to resonate beyond female voters
fortunately , the dynamics of the 21st century economy and the place of the family within it lend themselves to a family - friendly feminism
we live in a society where women are necessary breadwinners whose income is counted upon for families to make it
gender pay equality and supportive work environments benefit spouses , children , extended families and entire communities
today , feminism , family and economic issues intertwine like never before
hillary clinton 's stressing of the importance of women 's workplace issues both to the family and to the struggles of the middle - class puts the republicans on the defensive as they try to co-opt middle - class economic issues
potential republicans presidential candidates are already trying to position themselves to steal the thunder of the democratic nominee when it comes to issues of wage inequality and middle - class stagnation
but how exactly do they propose to reinvigorate a middle - class that is overwhelmingly composed of families with two wage - earners if they do n't fight for women 's workplace issues ? for instance , child care may be thought of as a woman 's issue , but it 's really a family issue , virtually by definition , and an economic issue on top of that
among topics that are sometimes seen as more traditional women 's issues such as family planning , access to birth control and the right to choose , hillary clinton has the advantage in that she can make her stance clear , based on her life experiences as a woman
it 's the republicans with extremist views on these issues who have to dance around their real beliefs and avoid making outrageous and absurd statements such as embarrassing pronouncements about rape and pregnancy
if hillary clinton seems more comfortable running as a woman , it 's partly because society at large seems more comfortable with a populist - tinged feminism than it was in 2008
arquette 's oscar night speech in support of equal pay for women -- although predictably dismissed by right - wing media such as fox news -- was enthusiastically received by the public in general
in fact , far from being thought radical , arquette 's statements backstage were thoroughly deconstructed by the left for not being progressively correct enough
women have been steadily making strides in the years since hillary clinton 's 2008 campaign , and as they did , they smoothed the way for one of their own to run for the highest office in the land without having to play down her gender
hillary clinton is now wisely embracing her gender as a way of capturing the same " hope and change " historical quality of obama 's presidency
voters always want change , and hillary clinton has been a constant on the political stage for decades now
she 's certainly no stranger to washington , or to the west wing of the white house
but electing her president would still represent massive change on a fundamental level
hillary clinton wants 2016 to be the year of the woman
and she wants to be the woman .
