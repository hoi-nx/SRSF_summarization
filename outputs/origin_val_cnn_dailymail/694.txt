if you like the idea of having a conversation with your pet cat then you better look away now
flam , a cat in nashville , tennessee , may well be the first of its kind to have had a conversation with a human being
but sadly , as documented on video , the little chat did n't go down that well with the feline
in the clip is penny , a professional photographer who volunteers her time at the cat shoppe rescue centre
sitting on the floor , she announces to the camera that she is holding a cat - to - human language translator on her phone
penny , who does n't herself know what it is being translated by the app , activates the meowing sound and immediately flam , who sits underneath a table , becomes noticeably intrigued
penny announces to the camera that she is about to use a cat - to - human translator app on her phone jumping up , the feline negotiates a number of dumbbells on the floor before making its way towards penny
with its tail poised , the cat maintains its eye - contact while lifting its paw and climbing up onto her leg
suddenly it lashes out at her â opening its mouth to bare its teeth it strikes her with its paw
intrigued , the cat approaches penny with its tail poised and begins slowly climbing up her leg reacting by blocking the cat with her arm , penny laughs in surprise as the insulted feline continues to bare its teeth before scuttling off
according to penny , she had visited kate framke 's home â flam âs owner â to photograph her other cat waffles for a fundraising calendar for the cat shoppe
after struggling to get waffles â attention with toys and treats , penny used her human - to - cat translator app as a way of getting the cat to look at the camera
the cat , clearly insulted by what the human - to - cat translator app is saying , attacks penny with its paw penny said : â it worked , but it also got an unusual reaction from flam , who proceeded to walk up slowly and pop me in the head
â she added : â who knows what the app was really saying in cat voice , but he sure did n't like it
â the cat shoppe is nashville âs first feline - friendly shop that sells a number of cat - related products and also runs a non-profit cat rescue centre
