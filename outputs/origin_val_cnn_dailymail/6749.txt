the financial details of members of vladimir putin 's inner circle could be published by ministers to expose the rampant corruption and wealth of his henchmen and allies
foreign secretary philip hammond said he was interested in the idea of publicising what is known by the government about the ruling russian elite
such a move would expose how those close to the president were exploiting their positions to obtain enormous wealth , and embarrass them in front of the russian people
asked if there was an argument for the ' interesting ' financial arrangements of members of vladimir putin 's inner circle to be published by ministers , mr philip hammond replied : ' there might be '
philip hammond labelled vladimir putin as potentially the ' single greatest threat ' to britain 's security ' when we talk about having further steps that we can take , increasing the pressure on russian , one the headings that we regularly review is strategic communication : how can we message the russian people and to people that russian is seeking to influence about what is really going on ? ' it is an interesting thought and i will make sure the strategic communications people are thinking precisely about that
' in a speech in westminster yesterday mr philip hammond labelled president vladimir putin as potentially the ' single greatest threat ' to britain 's security
he labelled the russian military 's stance ' increasingly aggressive ' and warned of the ' rapid pace ' of russian 's efforts to modernise her military in a speech to the royal united services institute in london
' we are in familiar territory for anyone over the age of about 50 , with russian 's behaviour a stark reminder that it has the potential to pose the single greatest threat to our security
' hence , continuing to gather intelligence on russian 's capabilities and intentions will remain a vital part of intelligence effort for the foreseeable future
it is no coincidence that all of our agencies are recruiting russian speakers again
' mr philip hammond labelled the russian military 's stance ' increasingly aggressive ' and warned of the ' rapid pace ' of russian 's efforts to modernise her military in a speech in london later mr philip hammond told the foreign affairs select committee britain would consider arming the ukranians if it ' crumbled ' in the face of russian aggression
' if the ukranian army crumbled or if there was clear evidence the ukranian army was under sustained attack and not holding the line because of inadequacy of equipment and weapons we would certainly consider again
' ' the pm made clear we are keeping our options open but we do not think there is a military solution to this conflict
