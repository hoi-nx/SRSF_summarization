pope began praying at a sanctuary in pompeii , before holding a string of events which include an outdoor mass and meetings with young people and the sick before heading back to the vatican this evening
since his election two years ago , the argentine pontiff has led a new and welcoming approach to gay and transgender people
when asked whether a gay man could be a priest , he reportedly replied : ' who am i to judge ? ' and in late january , he had a private meeting in the vatican with a spanish transgender man who wrote to francs about the rejection he was facing at his home parish
on holy thursday next month , he will wash the feet of male and female inmates at a prison near rome as part of his continued public outreach to detainees
