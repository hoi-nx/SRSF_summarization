britain will be saddled with a crippling extra Â£ 148billion of debt if the snp wins a share of power , the treasury warned last night
the official costing of nicola sturgeon 's plans reveals they involve a massive spending spree that would have to be funded by higher taxes or even higher borrowing
the analysis , conducted by treasury officials and signed off by the permanent secretary , show that spending under the snp would be Â£ 148billion higher than forecast in this month 's budget
it came as gordon brown used his valedictory speech in the commons to warn that the ' fragile ' britain is ' potentially at a point of departure ' in the wake of last year 's referendum on scotland independence
a spokesman said taxpayers would be landed with a huge bill if the parties ended up in power
' it is now impossible for miliband to become prime minister without crawling into downing street on the coat tails of the snp â with alex salmond calling the tune , ' he said
' we now know the consequence of that will be Â£ 148billion more borrowing , higher taxes , unlimited welfare , and weaker defence

while the conservatives are promising to identify Â£ 30billion of spending and welfare cuts , miss nicola sturgeon says she would increase real - terms public spending by at least half a per cent a year to allow extra ' investment '
the treasury analysis suggests this would lead to massive additional spending , adding to britain 's Â£ 1.5trillion debt mountain
it suggests the snp 's plans would involve an extra Â£ 20.7billion spending next year , an extra Â£ 39.7billion in 2017 - 18 , an extra Â£ 48.8billion in 2018 - 19 and an extra Â£ 38.3billion in 2019 - 20
the analysis is a blow to the snp , whose economic credibility is already under question , but it is also a setback for labour , which may be forced to do a deal with the nationalists who appear poised to claim dozens of labour seats at the election
former snp leader mr alex salmond , who hopes to return to westminster as kingmaker , says his party will vote down any attempt by the tories to run a minority government after the election
instead , he says his mps will line up with labour to put mr miliband in downing street

the snp 's plans were facing fresh scrutiny last night over claims that the party ' fiddled the figures ' in order to hide a Â£ 4.1billion hole in its bid for scotland to be handed full economic powers
labour called for an inquiry into the proposals , amid fears the collapse in the price of oil makes them unsustainable
a study by leading economist professor brian ashcroft and the scottish parliament information centre , found that the plans now fell more than Â£ 4billion short
labour 's deputy leader in scotland kezia dugdale said the report left the snp 's plans ' in tatters '
but miss nicola sturgeon dismissed the report , saying that taking full control of economic powers was the only way to ' defend ' scotland from westminster cuts .
