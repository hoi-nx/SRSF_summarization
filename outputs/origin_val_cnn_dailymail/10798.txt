romney is well used to going toe - to - toe with america 's political heavyweights , but now he 's going to test his mettle against a heavyweight of a more intimidating nature â holyfield romney , 68 , who recently announced he will not be running for president in 2016 , told the salt lake tribune : ' it will either be a very short fight , or i will be knocked unconscious
it wo n't be much of a fight
we 'll both suit up and get in the ring and spar around a little bit
' he added : ' we just thought it would be a lot better to provide this kind of entertainment rather than just have dinner and listen to speakers
' the bizarre bout is taking place to raise money for charityvision , which provides equipment to doctors in developing countries treating people with curable blindness
