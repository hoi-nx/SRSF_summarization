' but shadow attorney general dreyfus ruled out support for the measure , saying heavy penalties already existed for firearms trafficking
' there is no evidence that mandatory minimum sentences work as a deterrent , ' mr dreyfus said

' tackling gun crime requires a multi-faceted approach , not national security scaremongering
