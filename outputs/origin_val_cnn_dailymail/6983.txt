american apparel is trying to nip their dirty reputation in the bud
the clothing company long been known for their racy ads featuring what critics have said are underage looking girls in barely - there outfits with their nipples and even pubic hair in full view
in an attempt to distance themselves from their ousted ' sex - obsessed ' former ceo charney and their infamous adverts , the company this week has begun photoshopping out some of the models ' exposed nipples and body hair making them look more like plastic mannequins
animal reports that the changes can be seen on the company 's lingerie page in the ' new ' section and a brunette model in translucent lingerie who once had more showing on thursday was edited to be much less exposed
' ' this is an edgy brand and it âs always going to be an edgy brand , and it âs about social commentary , it âs about gay rights , and it âs about immigration reform
it âs about the things millennials care about , ' paula schneider told the new york times in january
while many may welcome the company 's attempt to shave away their previous image , some activists think showing nipple is perfectly fine and empowers women in what otherwise may be a mannequin 's world
lytle , co-founder of the nipple printed bikini line tata top thinks that by censoring women and making them look like mannequins or dolls , the company is actually taking power away from women who should not feel ashamed of their bodies
lytle told animal that american apparel has tried to reach out to diverse audiences by coming out with t - shirts that say ' legalize gay ' and ' legalize la ' but have very little to comment on women 's equality
' to see them taking a strong stance on those issues but not on women âs equality is disappointing , ' said lytle who runs the feminist clothing line with her partner robyn
' this is a company that is clearly trying to distance themselves from their founder , ' she continued
nip no nip : the model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right ' it âs kind of laughable for them to think that removing nipples from their images of their sheer lingerie is the best way to do this considering their questionable ad choices in recent years
this is a step in the wrong direction and is contributing to the sexualisation of a woman âs body at a time where there is a large and growing movement for equality
' the clothing company has a tab on their website dedicated to political activism and they offer a stance on gay rights and immigration reform
' as a company , we have certain resources that individual activists do not
we try to use that special ability to support political causes that need help
american apparel regularly uses its billboards , advertisements , press contacts and even printed t - shirts to speak out about important issues
our two biggest issues have been immigration reform and gay rights , ' says their website
the company 's female ceo has yet to comment on women 's sexuality and empowerment and the company 's choice to airbrush out nipples and pubic hair
it may be that the company needs to focus their opinion on the difference between what sexusualises women and what censors them if there is a difference at all
will american apparel decide to free the nipple along with their old image ? seeing change ( but no nipples ) : this model is clearly wearing a transparent nightgown but her nipples have been airbrushed out of the advertisement fired : former ceo charney was fired after he was accused of sexual harassment by former employees
