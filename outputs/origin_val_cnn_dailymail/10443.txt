compelling : this picture , taken minutes after mh17 blew up , ' shows a buk rocket trail ' an image of a vapour trail taken minutes after a passenger jet crashed in ukraine has been hailed as proof it was shot down by a russian missile
official investigators believe the picture , first published by the mail on sunday last year , holds the key to the fate of malaysia airlines flight mh17 , which was blown apart in mid-air , killing all 298 on board
afterwards , ukraine and russian blamed each other , and still do , and the incident fuelled an increasingly bloody civil war which has seen large parts of ukraine taken over by military forces loyal to russian president vladimir putin
netherlands and australian investigators now believe the image represents evidence that the malaysian boeing was hit by a russian - made buk rocket
they travelled to ukraine to interview the photographer who took the picture from the roof of his block of flats in torez , some 12 miles from the site where the missile was launched , and took away the camera as evidence
they believe the image and others taken by the photographer offer clear evidence of the buk missile attack from a position on the edge of the town of snizhne in pro-russian rebel - held eastern ukraine
amid fears for his safety he was relocated to a safe house and has been under the protection of ukraine âs secret service ever since
analysis by investigators has found the picture was taken at 16.25.48 seconds on july 17
the plane âs data records stopped functioning â as a result of a catastrophic explosion , it is thought â at 16.21.28
the photographer was questioned in detail by investigators about the time and location of his pictures
speaking on condition of anonymity , he told the mail on sunday : â i was in my flat in a suburb of torez , and heard a loud noise â far louder than artillery or grenades
â i ran to the window and saw how the wind was spreading the smoke trail above the horizon
defenceless : all 298 passengers on board malaysia airlines flight mh17 , which was blown apart in mid-air on july 17 , last year , were killed â my camera was near the window
i grabbed it and ran upstairs to the roof to take a picture
i took my first picture but saw i had electric cables right in the middle , so then maximized the zoom and took the second
' then i turned round and on the other side , to the north , saw a trail of dark blue smoke
i decided that the missile must have hit a petrol station
i climbed to another other part of the roof to take a picture from there
' it took me three minutes , and i took the third picture
i had no idea that my third picture was the smoke from the just crashed plane
â i did not see any plane
so i did not take any more pictures
if only i had known more about what happened then of course i would have taken more
but it was only two hours later when i found out
â he immediately sent the pictures to a friend , who posted them on twitter
this fact is seen as decisive because it allowed no time for manipulation of the image
at the time , fake pictures were appearing on the web
among the dead : evie , mo , and otis maslin were on board flight mh17 with their grandfather nick when it was shot down leaks from the netherlands probe indicate that investigators believe it likely the buk was fired not by rebels but by russian soldiers
these troops â might have changed their identities or even been executed by russian secret service in order to hide everything â , according to robert bas , a journalist with netherlands state broadcaster nos , citing anonymous sources in the investigation
last week a reporter with rtl , another broadcaster in the netherlands , said shrapnel he collected from the crash site was tested by forensic experts , including defence analysts ihs jane âs in london , who said it matched the explosive charge of a buk
a fragment from the warhead showed a cyrillic letter , apparently part of a serial number
the combined weight of evidence undermines claims from russian that the plane was downed by a ukrainian warplane
in the past there have been claims from moscow that mh17 was shot down by a ukrainian air force su-25
lethal : a buk missile system on display during a russian air show
investigators say the image and others taken by the photographer offer clear evidence of the buk missile attack but babak â the su-25 âs chief designer â disputed this in an intervention that was acutely embarrassing to moscow
â the su-25 could attack a boeing at a height of three or four thousand metres , but it can not shoot down a plane flying at an altitude of 10,500 metres , â said babak , president of the company which designs su-25 attack aircraft
â our team designed this plane so that it can be used only at low and medium altitudes
â the kiev - born aviation expert insisted : â i believe that all allegations of the su-25 involvement in the tragedy are an attempt to cover tracks
