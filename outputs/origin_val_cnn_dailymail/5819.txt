almost half of savers who chose to cash in their pensions as part of the biggest reforms in a century will be making an ' irrational decision ' , according a financial watchdog

next month over- 55s will be allowed to cash in all or part of their pension - but experts are predicting chaos when the changes come in as the treasury advice service is not yet up and running however , the financial conduct authority is warning that up to 40 per cent of savers who cash in their pensions will be ' irreversibly worse off '
and in some cases they even say people who cash in will be left destitute as they enter old age
christopher woolard , director of strategy and competition at the financial conduct authority , told the telegraph : ' in many cases it may not be in the member 's best interests
' we need to ensure that those who are considering it are fully aware of the potential benefits they are giving up
' the warning comes amid concern that some savers still can not book an appointment with the government âs pension guidance service â despite just one month to go before the reforms

â we have had customers calling since the start of the year who want to talk to the government about what they want to do in april but they ca nât
thousands of customers who are trying to figure out what to do and can not even book an appointment yet
