a woman who was told she may never walk again after having a stroke aged 22 defied doctors to walk down the aisle to marry the love of her life
it was thanks to the quick thinking of her husband , iain , that kathryn grainger was given the treatment she needed right away to survive having a stroke at such a young age
he spotted the signs her health was in serious danger when she woke up with a headache at 4am in july 2008
kathryn grainger had made enough of a recovery to walk down the aisle in 2012 to tie the knot with iain kathryn grainger , now 29 , from durham , recalls : ' i woke up thinking i was having a bad headache but iain said , " you 're having a stroke "
' to be honest i did n't know what a stroke was until i had mine
i was very confused and did n't know what was going on
' the fashion university student was taken to hospital and put into an induced coma to undergo surgery to remove her skull and reduce the swelling on her brain
but doctors warned her devastated boyfriend , then aged 24 , and her parents leslie and miriam , that they could not be sure if she would be permanently brain damaged - and warned them she may never walk or talk again

' i could just about write with my right hand and could n't see properly in my left eye
' although i was in shock i kept thinking i 'd be okay to go back to university in september
' i had no idea how bad i was
iain knew though because he saw me with tubes and wires coming out of my head
he ca n't talk about it because he gets upset
' kathryn grainger 's parents and iain , who she had met through friends two years before her stroke , were determined to support her and nurse her back to health

they did n't think i would get out of my chair , but i proved them wrong
' i had physiotherapy , occupational and speech therapy
slowly i re-learnt how to do things
i was really frustrated , as i 'd lost the use of my left arm , as a fashion student that was n't easy but the university did everything they could to help me and i graduated

' walking down the aisle with my dad on my wedding day , i felt so many different emotions
it 's hard to describe the feeling but all i can really say is that it was one of the happiest moments of my entire life

he said : " after kathryn grainger had her stroke , most young lads would have left because she was so poorly but iain stuck by my daughter and looked after her throughout
" ' iain has really has supported me throughout everything ; marrying him was the best day of my life
' the signs and symptoms of a stroke vary from person to person but usually begin suddenly
as different parts of your brain control different parts of your body , your symptoms will depend on the part of your brain affected and the extent of the damage
the main stroke symptoms can be remembered with the word fast : face-arms-speech-time
the couple have now moved into their own home in durham
despite having to deal with having a stroke at such a young age , kathryn grainger says she does n't feel sorry for herself
' i 'm a pretty positive person
i have n't let it get me down
it could have been so much worse , ' she said
as well as the support of iain and her family , she said different strokes made a huge contribution to her recovery so now she 's urging people to support red nose day on 13 march to raise money for such worthwhile projects
' i found a different strokes group on facebook and decided to go along
it was the first time i had spoken to people who had had a stroke
it was really helpful and i got some good advice from a physio and took part in gentle group exercises , ' kathryn grainger said
' six years on i still have some things to improve on , like my speech
i 'd love to be able to raise public awareness about strokes
' it 's the leading cause of disabilities but i did n't have a clue and you have to deal with it so quickly
