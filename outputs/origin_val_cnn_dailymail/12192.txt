madonna , saying something controversial ? perish the thought
the object of her scorn fighting back ? of course
the mayor of rochester , michigan , has written an open letter to the venerable pop star , taking her to task for saying she never wanted to go back the town where she went to high school
" i ca n't be around basic , provincial - thinking people , " she told howard stern last week on his siriusxm satellite radio program
you could almost hear the steam coming out of mayor barnett 's ears
" it 's like someone calling one of your kids ugly , " the free press quoted barnett as saying
" you 're not going to let that go by without a response
" in his letter , published monday in the free press , barnett said the city 's recent achievements are anything but provincial
" our school district is one of the top performing in the state and boasts two blue ribbon schools , the most in michigan
our universities are among the fastest growing in the midwest and are rich with cultural and ethnic diversity , " he wrote
buying madonna 's house : a tale of fame and misfortune " we design and build more robots than any other city in north america , and rochester hills residents and businesses have been granted over 900 patents , nearly one a day , over the last three years
not a typical achievement you would associate with ' simple or basic ' people , " he wrote
he also noted the city was also named one of the 10 best places to live by money magazine
" we are many things , madonna , but basic and provincial minded we are not ! " barnett wrote
" i invite you back to rochester hills to see who we are and what we believe in
while we certainly do n't need your stamp of approval , i am quite confident we would earn it
" not surprisingly , some rochester hills citizens were n't thrilled with madonna 's comments
" makes me proud to live in rochester hills after reading this letter to madonna by @ mayorbarnett , " twitter user loganbrown97 wrote
and although madonna has n't responded to the fracas , she of course found some defenders on social media
" why is everyone mad madonna said rochester was basic ? " twitter user itsleah wrote
i thought that was the appeal ? small towns are n't for everyone , dummies
" of course , madonna is no stranger to controversy , and she 's angered organizations a lot bigger and more powerful than rochester city hall
remember the 1980s , when her " like a prayer " video angered the catholic church ? or the 1990s , when it seemed a camera could n't turn her direction without capturing simulated masturbation ? then there was last year , when she had to backtrack after posting an instagram photo of her son boxing , captioned with a take on the n - word
and in january , some took offense after she posted photos of civil rights icons altered to appear like the cover of her new album
heck , this is n't even the the first time the singer has dissed a place where she grew up
in a 1987 interview with jane pauley , she called bay city , michigan , where she was born , a " little smelly town in northern michigan
" a few moments later , madonna followed up by saying she had " great affection " for the place
so far , no such love for rochester hills
nor has the pop icon accepted the mayor 's invite to return to her hometown for a visit .
