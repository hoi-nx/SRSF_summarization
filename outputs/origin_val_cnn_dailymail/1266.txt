a new and unlikely fashion trend has emerged in colorado for sporting jewelry in the shape of iuds - birth control implants otherwise known as intrauterine devices
wearing the glittery , brightly - colored objects as earrings or , in the case of men , lapel pins , is a show of support for a new bill which would plunge $ 5million in state funding into a program which supplies this form of birth control to low - income women
the jewelry has been purchased by more than 200 lobbyists and lawmakers in favor of the colorado family planning initiative , from web retailer etsy , and is crafted out of resin by dr virginia smith , an ob-gyn based in ohio
trending : wearing these iud replicas is a show of support for a new bill which would allocate $ 5million in state funding into a program which supplies this form of birth control to low - income women in colorado iuds are small t - shaped implants which , when inserted into the uterus , prevent pregnancy from occurring for between three and 12 years , or simply until removed
iuds ( intrauterine devices ) are small t - shaped implants which are fitted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy
they work by interfering with the way sperm usually fertilize an egg , and are more than 99 % effective
iud last anywhere between two and 12 years , depending on the type
the implants must be fitted and removed by licensed healthcare providers
once they are removed , a woman can generally become pregnant straight away
the colorado family planning initiative has handed out an estimated 30,000 of these contraceptives since its inception in 2009 , and up until now , has been grant - funded
according to thinkprogress , this program has contributed to a 40per cent drop in teen births over the past five years
the new legislation , expected to be introduced on friday , would allocate $ 5million of state funds to the cause , allowing iud to be fitted for free or at little cost in 68 clinics across colorado
some conservatives and anti-choice lawmakers , however , stand against the program , with some - including republican senator republican - even incorrectly claiming iuds cause abortions
dr jennifer hyer , a denver - based ob-gyn , dismissed these claims as neither ' medically ' nor ' scientifically ' accurate , in a statement distributed by colorado
' they are among the most effective forms of contraception , especially for at - risk women , because they automatically prevent pregnancy , ' she said

' seriously though , i think this is one of the most important bills we are looking at
' dr virginia smith , who has seen business for her iud jewelry go through the roof recently , told abc 's 7news denver : ' i think women should have access to options and so if this promotes access to options then i think that is a good thing
