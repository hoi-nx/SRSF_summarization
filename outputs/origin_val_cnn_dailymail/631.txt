' it was a very tough match , he 's playing very well this year and he 's got a very tricky game , ' murray told sky sports
' he 's a lefty but he has a very flat backhand and a short take - back on his forehand so it 's hard to read
' he moves well and he has good hands around the net - in both sets though he played one or two loose games which helped me and i stayed solid throughout
' i was frustrated to get broken in the first set , i thought i started well but he came out firing
' i tried to make a lot of balls and he did n't play a great game in the next game and that stopped his momentum
' i started to feel more comfortable after that and went for my shots more
' on equalling tim henman 's record , murray joked : ' that 's one of the few records tim still had over me
' i was n't actually aware of the record so that 's nice
hopefully i can get through the next round and get past him
