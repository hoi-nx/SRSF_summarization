things usually end badly for england in turin
italia 90 culminated in a tear - jerker in this city , as did the euros in 1980 , and david beckham âs first game as captain was another defeat at the turn of the century
it was 1948 when england last won here and even michael caine âs cliff - hanger in the italian job , a heist film based around an england game in turin , did not go to plan â and that was not even real
roy hodgson , too , admits his personal record playing juventus when he was coaching in italy was not up to much either , so there was no surprise when he and his captain rooney insisted they were much keener to talk about the future than the past
england manager roy hodgson looks on during a press conference ahead of the match against italy harry kane poses just days after grabbing his first international goal on his england debut here is the first real test for roy hodgson âs new wave , playing away against one of the major european nations , even if both teams have something of an experimental feel to them
roy hodgson chose to take a young squad to the world cup in the hope that experience would pay off in the long run and he can go some way to claiming that it already has with seven wins out of seven , while others including germany , holland and italy have stuttered amid the complacent environment that is the euro 2016 qualifying campaign

â i âm always frightened to say those things , â said roy hodgson , but he is quietly satisfied with almost everything that has happened since his team returned from brazilian
â you never know , â he added
â certainly , there seems to be a group and a talent pool that is growing all the time
some of the talent that âs already been with us for a couple of years , i see signs of them becoming more comfortable , assured in their play not only with their clubs but with england
the teams we select have a lot of energy and pace around them
these are good qualities a team badly needs
pace and energy mean you cause teams problems when you attack and when you defend it helps prevent any damage
â if we can keep this group of 20 - odd players together , they âll get more international experience and hopefully in a year âs time we might be stronger than we are today
â but i do nât feel we âre lagging any more
or that other teams are moving forward faster than us
by the finals in france , hopefully we âll be closer to that
â perhaps they will if harry kane tackles the challenge of his first start as he did his first appearance
or if another player emerges to demand a place in the team
even then , the usual fear that england have qualified stylishly in the past only to malfunction during the tournaments , will remain
one of the reasons they have struggled when stepping up a level in recent tournaments has been because they lack the depth of players in defensive areas , including defensive midfield , to give the team a healthy balance
so it will be interesting to see how phil jones performs if he is deployed in midfield as expected

england will play france and spain in november , assuming they all avoid the need to play off
they are away in germany in march next year and are in talks for a friendly against holland
â it will be much more relevant when we qualify , â said roy hodgson , who always seems to come over all misty - eyed when he returns to italy and spoke with touching fondness of the moment he was invited by massimo moratti to coach inter milan
conte was also emotional as he discussed his first return to the juventus arena , although the italy boss has more immediate problems amid suggestions that he regrets his decision to swap club football for the chance to lead the italy to euro 2016

conte , new to international management , has been swamped by controversies around an injury to claudio marchisio , which prompted a death - threat , but turned out not to be as bad as first feared and his decision to call - up brazilian - born eder , who will start tonight , and argentina - born franco vazquez
â what am i missing , what am i lacking ? â said conte
â i do nât know if i âm missing anything
regardless of what âs going on i will keep working and moving forward
sometimes i ask myself questions and do nât know the answers

â there âs been a big turnover in terms of players and experience at every level and whenever that happens you need a minimum level of patience , â said conte
â you need to allow the players to grow without being critical at every opportunity
i do nât think this is helpful
â when i say we have to be left to work it âs because we have to work
we do nât have a lot of time because the european championship is next year
all i can promise is that we can work very hard
â the two teams are in different places
you would rather be roy hodgson than conte and yet we have heard this before
there were similar noises from both camps before they met in manaus , nine months ago
even if england prefer to look forward , history is against them in more ways than one
