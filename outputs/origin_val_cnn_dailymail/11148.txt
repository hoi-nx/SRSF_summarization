model , tv presenter and homeware designer ... is there anything that holly ca n't do ? the national sweetheart , who wakes up the nation on this morning , has added another string to her bow by designing a range of vintage - inspired clothes for babies
speaking to femail about her latest project with bhs , holly , 34 , said : ' it âs something i have been passionate about for quite some time ; this project has been about 18 months in the making
' i have a style that i have tried to bring into this range , which i hope feels fresh and blends the modern with vintage
' holly , 34 , has extended her homeware range with bhs and has now ventured into designing a range of baby clothes inspired by vintage pieces and her own childhood memories the range , which lands in stores next week , has a strong vintage feel running throughout and each piece has an element that is reminiscent of a bygone era , from delicate frills to smart pinstripes
the mother - of - three , who created pinterest boards to garner inspiration , said she worked extremely hard to ensure her range was full of great pieces that accounted for the practical needs of a mother and baby
to ensure the very best quality and comfort , holly used only natural fibres to create breathable garments that she says will keep little ones cool throughout the summer months
' my main desire was for the collection to conjure up nostalgic memories from childhood such as swimming in the sea or trying ice cream for the very first time , ' she said
holly , who says a good night 's sleep is her fail - safe beauty tip , shows off her new homeware range the range , which lands in stores next week , has a strong vintage feel running throughout and each piece has an element that is reminiscent of a bygone era , from delicate frills to smart pinstripes
holly says she loves the ditsy dresses , which cost Â£ 10 , and would dress her daughter in one if she were younger holly , who is mother to harry , belle and chester , certainly has experience when it comes to dressing little ones - and said she designed her new range with her own offspring in mind
' i love the vintage florals , the soft tones and the fresh cotton dresses , ' she said
' i definitely like that look of soft colours , nothing too fussy or busy
my favourite pieces for girls are the ditsy floral dress and the grey woven romper ; if belle was a bit younger i would love to see her in those
' i am very excited to see chester in the boy 's pieces , i have ordered the whole range ! '
if that was n't keeping her busy enough , the presenter managed to find time to extend her home range with sir philip green 's high street store , too
speaking about the additions to her homeware range , which has a similar vintage theme to her baby range , holly said : ' we have added quite a few things ! we have thought about accent things for each room that you can layer in and build on your own look
' there are some incredible statement lights that you could pop into any room
it âs not about chucking everything out and creating a brand new look in your house , i do nât think that is practical or right
a home is what you build over years and years
' i like collecting things along the way and making them work within what i already have ; i guess that is why i have chosen such a mix of pieces but i think that they do all sit well together
' holly says she is very excited to see her little son chester in the boy 's pieces as well as designing a baby range , the presenter managed to find time to extend her home range with sir philip green 's high street store , too holly says she has thought about accent things for each room that you can layer in and build on your own look the range has a vintage theme - much like her baby range - and holly says decorating her bedroom to help her feel calm and relaxed is essential holly , who says her bedroom is her ' favourite place ' in the house , added : ' my sleep is very precious to me so i do treat it like it is a sanctuary
i simply swear by trying to get a good night âs sleep every night ... not that it 's always easy when you have a young family ! ' candles are very important , it just instantly makes a room nice so you feel calm and relaxed
' the new mother may have been keeping busy with her bhs projects but she 's not putting her feet up just yet
' there is lots more i want to do , ' revealed the ambitious celebrity juice presenter
' both of these projects have been a long - standing passion and i would love to keep building on this
i have lots and lots of ideas that i keep as pinterest boards and i have stacks of magazines i love to look through for inspiration
' i just feel so lucky i got this chance to see ideas come to life and be able to finally buy the things i have had trouble finding in the past
i just hope that everyone else likes it too and i ca nât wait to see it in store
