we 've all been there
faced with netflix or the gym , we reach for the remote while promising to work out tomorrow
but what if we could see what the impact of our actions today would have on the future ? that 's what one london - based company is hoping to find out with its concept apple watch face , life clock , which counts down the minutes to your death
rehabstudio 's design , which has been created with the apple in mind , adds time to your life for healthful activity and subtracts time when you give in to bad habits the user âs apple healthkit data is taken into the phone app , which then converts the user âs activities into time
this is then displayed on the apple
the app can then make recommendations that can improve the user âs health and help them live longer , whether it be eating better , exercising or seeing friends and loved ones
the goal of the app is simple : to make life better
the app combines different data sets to recommend healthy lifestyle choices
rehabstudio 's design , which has been created with the apple in mind , adds time to your life for healthful activity and subtracts time when you give in to bad habits
the idea came to rehabstudio owner le bree following the announcement for the apple
' we saw an opportunity , ' le bree told wired
' we thought , ' ok , if time is really a human construct , how can we play with it ? '' while apple says there will be nine official faces available when the watch launches next month , none are unusual in the way their approach time
le bree started thinking about a concept called temporal discounting which is the idea that you can discount the future in favour of the present
' tomorrow , i 'm the guy that goes to the gym , quits smoking , and stops eating fatty foods
but today i 'm going to have one last cigarette , ' le bree says
the app works by linking up with a user âs apple healthkit data , which then converts the user âs activities into time
this is then displayed on the apple
it can then make recommendations that can improve the user âs health and help them live longer , whether it be eating better , exercising or seeing friends and loved ones
apple has n't yet said if it will allow owners to use third party faces with the watch.in the meantime , rehabstudio plans to continue working on the project
it is also considering creating a version for android wear
pictured is apple ceo cook talking about the apple watch edition for instance , if you only got five hours sleep , life clock subtracts 26 minutes and recommends you sleep sleep the recommended eight hours a night
while he admits the science is n't accurate , le bree said that by reminding us of the future , apple could help make healthier decisions
apple was revealed last week and comes in three models : the apple , apple watch sport and apple watch edition , and all models are sold in either 1.4 - inch ( 38mm ) or 1.7 - inch ( 42mm ) versions
this is n't the first time that someone has come up with the concept of a watch that counts down to your death
last year , a swedish inventor unveiled a watch that apparently calculates a person 's life expectancy - and even counts down to the time they will die
dubbed the ' death watch ' , tikker was created by colting
but far from being morbid , mr colting calls it ' the happiness watch ' and claims it has been designed to help people make the most of their life and cherish the time they have left
to set up tikker , the wearer fills out a questionnaire by entering information about their medical history , including allergies or illnesses
they are also asked whether they drink or smoke and if there are any instances of cancer , diabetes and other diseases in their family
wearers are additionally asked about how much exercise they do , as well as how much they weigh before receiving a score
their age is deducted from the results to predict a death date and the tikker - which also works as a regular watch - begins the countdown
rowdfunding campaign , the gadget is available to buy online Â£ 49.99 ( $ 70 )
connecting to the iphone , the apple is designed as a wrist device for messaging and calls and for a variety of health tracking applications
' with the built in speaker and microphone you can receive calls on your watch
i have been wanting to do this since i was five years old , ' cook said
the watch is also integrated with apple pay 's mobile wallet , and can be used to view pictures and monitor news , and also connect to social media
it can use other apps ranging from uber ride - sharing to music to home automation
apple , however , has n't yet said if it will allow owners to use third party faces with the watch
in the meantime , rehabstudio plans to continue working on the project and may create a version for android wear .
