rhiannon was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work in a few seconds of mindless vandalism this is the shocking moment a gang of bullies set fire to a schoolgirl 's gcse coursework - before sending her a video of the cruel prank
rhiannon was left in tears after her classmates poured lighter fuel over her precious notes and set them ablaze - destroying years of hard work
the 15 - year - old had not realised the work was missing until she was sent the video by her tormentors - who were suspended for just three days after the act of mindless vandalism
the footage shows the teenage bullies laughing and joking as they poured lighter fluid over the pile of papers on a picnic bench and set it alight
one boy even attempted to fan the flames by spraying it with a deodorant can while another threw in a lighter which eventually caused the notes to explode
a pupil then climbed onto the bench to trample over the cindered books
police yesterday were investigating after the footage was posted online , but confirmed there had been no arrests so far
rhiannon said she has been the victim of a campaign of bullying at easthampstead park community school in bracknell , berkshire , since last september and suffered from anxiety and depression as a result
she now fears the stunt may put her entry to college in jeopardy
she said : ' i was shocked and disgusted when i was sent the video by one of the pupils involved
none of them seems to be sorry for what they have done or show any regret
i am just very upset and tearful that all my hard work has gone to waste
' i have always wanted to work with children and it is what i had set my heart on doing for the rest of my life
i am not even sure if i can get a place on my course at the college anymore
i ca n't understand why anyone would do this
' the teenager , who dreams of a career as a nursery nurse , was just two weeks away from submitting the coursework when the bullies destroyed her work
one of the bullies shouts ' put a lighter on it ' as another prepares to set fire to rhiannon 's coursework two boys reel away as the flaming pile of notes explodes thanks to a lighter that had been thrown on them her mother , debbie groom , said : ' i am so angry
these pupils have ruined my daughter 's life
i would be mortified if that was my child carrying out that sort of behaviour
' this incident is going to scar rhiannon for life
she has been very stressed and upset but the reaction to the video being posted online has been amazing - it just shows that people do not like bullies
' another pupil , 15 - year - old kayleigh from hanworth , also had her child development coursework destroyed in the pile
her uncle neil holloway said : ' i am disgusted by what has happened
i do n't think the three days suspension given to the children involved was not enough punishment
' they have all probably seen it as a nice holiday
even though the school has said her grades wo n't be affected that is not the answer or what we want to hear
' kayleigh was very upset when she found out - she has got enough going on in her life without all of this
' rihannon 's mother debbie groom ( pictured with rhiannon 's family , l - r : aunt anne yates , mother debbie groom , rhiannon and her sister katie blair ) said the incident had scarred her daughter for life headteacher liz cook said letters had been sent out to everybody involved in the incident and assured the victims that their grades would not be affected
she said : ' the school has investigated the incident at length and its origins were a falling out between girls , property was taken as a spiteful act designed to disrupt the victim 's lesson the following day
' on reflection students have realised this act was a huge error of judgement on their part and have been shocked that their act has attracted a social media storm
' this has been a steep learning curve for them all
the victims of the theft are also being supported as we make every effort to make sure their hard work and studies are not compromised
' i hope for our students ' sake that we will be able to put this incident behind us
