perhaps we 're associating it with only the extreme example of rape , when it encompasses so much more than unwanted physical touching , ' dr witt said

' sexual harassment is every time you call me ' blondie ' or ' barbie ' , every time you make a joke about my choice to wear a skirt not pants , every time you comment on my appearance rather than my skillset , every time you call me a ' lady doctor ' instead of a ' doctor '
' sexual harassment is two weeks ago when i lead a code blue which saved a woman on the labour ward and my male colleague arrived after the fact and said ' they should n't send you up here , you 're too clucky '
' it 's the consultant who commented that i 'd ' obviously gotten to where i was at a young age because i was pretty '
' it 's the surgical registrar who told me if i wanted to be taken seriously i needed to dye my hair dark
' ms wit wrote in her blog that a surgical registrar told her if she wanted to be taken seriously she should dye her hair dark
