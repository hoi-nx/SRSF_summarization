it could be football 's greatest ever dynasty â zidane as real madrid 's head coach and his four sons out on the pitch in the famous white shirts playing for him
it sounds far - fetched , but then so does the idea that zidane could be real madrid 's b - team coach and that his offspring would be at various levels of the club 's youth system â which is already a reality
sportsmail looks at the chances of things going to the next level
videos scroll down to watch theo prove he 's a chip off the old block zidane is currently real madrid 's b - team coach and could replace carlo ancelotti at the bernabeu zidane enjoyed a glittering career as a player at real madrid and his sons are all currently at the academy the coach zidane has spent three days in munich this week under the tutelage of guardiola and real madrid are hoping that what the teacher did for barcelona the pupil will one day do for them
club president florentino perez has decided he wants the former player to lead the side one day and zidane is preparing for the possibility that it could come as soon as next season
he is one of seven french coaches spending this week at bayern munich 's training facilities where along with former real madrid team - mate claude makelele he is seeing first hand how guardiola works
next season he could be in the same position guardiola was in 2008 â having graduated from his club 's youth system to take charge of the first team
he will cut the same sharp - suited imposing figure on the touchline and he will command the same respect among rivals , players and media , but will he be as prolifically successful ? zidane visited bayern munich 's training ground with bernard diomede ( left ) and claude makelele ( right ) this week real hope zidane can emulate guardiola 's transition from a player to boss with barcelona and bayern munich zidane currently coaches real madrid 's second team , castilla , in one of spain 's four regional third - tier divisions
if castilla win their division they will go into a play - off for a place in the second division next season
but by then carlo ancelotti may have moved on and zidane may have stepped up to replace him
there is no question a career as a coach is what the former ballon d'or and world cup winner wants
as well as this week 's masterclass with guardiola he has also been to marseille to watch marcelo bielsa work
he wants to coach the france team one day and if their 2016 campaign on home soil were to end in tears there would be calls for him to take charge of the national side he once lead to the biggest prize in football
the real madrid job will probably come before the national team however
those who have seen him at close quarters on the training pitch say he 's inspirational and has none of that haughtiness that sometimes prevents great players from being able to improve lesser mortals
zidane lead france to world cup glory in 1998 and is touted as a future national team coach with zidane in charge , real madrid 's castilla team are in one of spain 's four regional third - tier divisions zidane fights for the ball with manchester united 's roy keane during a champions league tie in 2003 he 's tough and media - savvy after years of coping with the intense spotlight shone on him in france where he is adored far more than michel platini â his rival as the country 's greatest ever player , but one who never won the world cup
ultimately expecting him to emulate guardiola might be asking too much â the bayern munich coach 's tactical brain and obsessive character make him unique
he also has the baggage of having been so good as a player
maradona and pele never made it as managers , but alfredo di stefano and johan did , so there are precedents
johan was a fine player and also excelled as a manager at barcelona and the sons â¦ enzo star of real madrid c , enzo , wears the enzo zidane fernandez name on his back , the family name of the zidane boys ' mother veronique fernandez â a dancer who he met in 1988 playing for cannes
it perhaps weighs less heavily on the shoulders of the young prodigies
already a spain under 19 international enzo , just like his siblings , has the choice of three countries
playing for france would please his father ; and so might playing for algeria , which is his third possibility because of his grandfather
he is the player who most resembles his father in playing style
he plays as a no 10 and is one rung on the ladder below castilla
enzo zidane fernandez is the star of real madrid c and is already a spain under 19 international enzo 's style as a gifted no 10 with real madrid 's lower ranks most resembles that of his father luca enzo is very much the french romantics ' choice to make it â being named after uruguayan playmaker enzo francescoli and playing in zidane 's position
but many in france believe it will be goalkeeper luca â born just before his father won the world cup in 1998 â who will go further
he currently plays for real madrid 's under 17s juvenil b team and is impressing everyone at the club
luca zidane fernandez has impressed at real madrid as a goalkeeper while iker casillas ( right ) struggles zidane watches a thai boxing match with son luca in bangkok in 2007 theo and elyaz zidane 's youngest sons have both grown up in spain
elyaz has recently turned 10 and is a midfielder and theo is also a midfielder who will be 13 in may
they are both in real madrid boys ' teams and in theory they would both also have the option of playing for spain , france or algeria if they reached international levels
if all four sons made it to international football and did n't pick the same country , they could even replicate the situation at the last world cup when the boateng brothers kevin-prince and jerome faced each other for ghana and germany
elyaz ( left , 10 ) and theo ( right , 12 ) are both in real madrid boys ' teams and could play for spain , france or algeria theo fernandez ( right , ) scored a superb goal real madrid 's youth side after a wonderful left - footed touch he placed the ball past the goalkeeper as three defenders tried to close down the space around him will the zidane dynasty become a reality at the santiago bernabeu ? it 's impossible to say how the youngest two will develop but the eldest are well on their way to becoming professionals
can they do it at real madrid with zidane as their footballing as well as natural father ? well zidane has to get the big job first , then the boys are in the realms of ' famous footballers with famous footbaling fathers as manager ' syndrome
nigel clough and jordi cruyff did n't match the achievements of their coaching dads but did make good careers for themselves
it is always tough for the sons of great players
pele 's son , edinho , served santos as a goalkeeper but also served time for drugs and money - laundering offences
maradona is one of the world 's greatest ever players but son diego sinagria ( right ) failed to impress jordi cruyff ( right ) tried to emulate father johan and briefly featured for manchester united and when maradona 's son , diego sinagra , was playing youth football at napoli , an italian journalist was overheard assessing the boy 's chances of emulating his father and saying : ' if you threw maradona an orange he 'd catch it on his foot , juggle it and balance it on his head
if you threw his son an orange he 'd catch it in his hands , peel it and eat it
' zidane 's children clearly have the talent to follow their father 's footsteps and with their dad on the verge of a managerial career at real madrid the possibilities of a ' zizou dynasty ' can not be ruled out
