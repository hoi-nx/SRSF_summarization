trekking through the dunes of the sahara in 40 degree heat can be thirsty work even for camels
and one for one of the animals taking a long swig from a beer bottle was just what they needed to refresh themselves
the herd of camels were on a trek across the erg chebbi dunes in morocco , where one of the group was snapped having a refreshing drink
a camel takes a swig from a beer bottle on a short refreshment stop while trekking across the sahara desert tour guides filled the beer bottles with water for the camels to drink as temperatures reached as high as 40 degrees but rather than swigging down beer the bottles had actually been filled with water by the guides for the camels to drink
photographer bolan , who captured the image , said : ' the picture where a camel drinks from a bottle , it was obviously just for fun
' they do n't usually drink too often and while we were there , i had n't seen any camel drinking
' we only made a short stop - i would say not more than 15 minutes - but judging by how fast they drank it , i guess they were thirsty
' mr bolan travelled over 370 miles across the high atlas mountain range from the morocco city of marrakech to reach the sand dunes
the pictures were snapped by photographer joao bolan , who spent time trekking across the erg chebbi dunes in morocco the 26 - year - old travelled with a guide and a friend and when they reached the dunes , they hired a total of six camels to help them explore the area
and while there , they experienced extreme temperatures ranging from soaring heat during the day to freezing temperatures around minus five late at night
mr bolan , from sao paulo , brazil added : ' i was photographing the route from marrakech to erg chebbi through the high atlas region
the group experienced extreme temperatures on their trek ranging from soaring hear during the day to freezing temperatures at night ' we stopped at a base camp for the dunes where we spent the night
' like any other desert , it was incredibly hot during the day and cold at night
' riding the camels was a little uncomfortable to be honest
' after two hours , your back really starts to hurt but i would say that was a nice experience because it 's a huge animal that goes on a paced rhythm in a majestic environment
