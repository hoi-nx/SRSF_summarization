during an address to the meeting in edinburgh on saturday , mr hamilton said the party â has got to change â in scottish
speaking about the general election campaign , he said : â we âve got to go out there and not just be negative about the snp because that âs very easy to do when you see the wee lass with the tin helmet on
â he finished the speech , which he said would be his last to the party âs conference as an mp , by saying : â let âs stick it to the snp
â snp politicians immediately demanded that mr hamilton be disciplined
scottish health secretary shona robison wrote to miss dugdale on twitter : â not impressed with david hamilton mps sexist comments today , were you ? â scottish labour deputy leader kezia dugdale later ' pulled up ' mr hamilton for his controversial remark miss kezia dugdale replied : â no and he was pulled up about it at the women âs reception â
she added that mr hamilton had attended the event to â hear the feedback â
owen thompson , the snp candidate who is hoping to become the mp in mr hamilton âs midlothian seat , said : â this sexist comment - and the reaction in the hall at labour conference - proves that the dinosaurs are sadly still roaming the scottish labour in scottish
â a spokesman for miss sturgeon added : â it âs disappointing to see scottish labour are stuck in the past - no wonder more and more scottish women are planning to vote snp on may 7
â mr hamilton worked as a miner for 19 years after leaving school and spent two months behind bars during the 1984 - 85 strike before being cleared
he was one of 206 workers sacked during the dispute that left him unemployed and blacklisted
in january he announced that he would be stepping down at the election from his seat in midlothian where he has been the mp since 2001
in his resignation letter , he wrote : â i believe that it is the right time for me to stand aside to allow the scottish labour in midlothian to select a younger member , with fresh ideas and the hunger to meet the challenges of this changed landscape
â he also said that he wanted to spend more time with his wife , children and grandchildren
miss nicola sturgeon , who is thought to be around 5ft 4in , became scottish first minister last year after alex salmond stepped down following the independence referendum last night a scottish labour spokesman said : â hamilton acknowledged his comment was inappropriate immediately after he made it .
