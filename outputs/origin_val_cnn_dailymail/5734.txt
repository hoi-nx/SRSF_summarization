the labour leadership blocked karie murphy , a unite candidate , from the labour shortlist for the marginal seat of halifax the tweet about harriet harman from a senior unnamed official at unite , britain âs most powerful trade union , was short and menacing : â she will have to answer for her actions in due course
â the threat this week was made in response to the labour leadership blocking karie murphy , a unite candidate , from the labour shortlist for the marginal seat of halifax
and the reason for their fury at the deputy leader of the labour party ? the list was agreed by an ad - hoc three - strong committee chaired by harman
and that committee was given a clear instruction by miliband : block karie murphy at all costs
relations between miliband and the union were put under further strain when linda riordan , the retiring labour mp , accused the party leadership of dirty tricks
she has made a formal protest to iain mcnicol , labour âs general secretary
but the heavyweight the front bench should be really worried about is len mccluskey , the general secretary of unite , who is enraged by the actions of miliband and harman
for he is the most powerful left - wing union boss since miners â leader arthur scargill
the snub to flame - haired karie murphy , a comprehensive school - educated nhs nurse , is deeply personal to len mccluskey - who was married but is no longer with his wife
len mccluskey and karie murphy - who is separated from her husband - are very close friends
indeed , some people in the labour movement have asked - rightly or wrongly - if they are more than just friends
it âs also personal for len mccluskey because harman is a member of unite , and she presided over the blocking of their candidate
so why was the usually clueless miliband so determined to stop karie murphy ? the answer is to be found far to the north of halifax , in falkirk , where karie murphy âs candidacy in the labour selection process in 2013 triggered a vote - rigging scandal so serious the police were called in by miliband
the result then was virtual open warfare in the party
now , the animus is erupting again
karie murphy was cleared of any wrongdoing in an internal inquiry but withdrew from the selection race
in the end , the police took no action over allegations the union had packed the local party with its own supporters , and even signed people up to vote for her without their knowledge
but the damage was done , and her parliamentary ambitions were thwarted
after the falkirk row , miliband - who pointedly refused to apologise to karie murphy â announced reforms to the party âs links with the unions
furious : len mccluskey ( pictured ) , the general secretary of unite , is enraged by the actions of miliband and harman but that attempt at firm leadership came at a price , and the response from unite was swift and damaging
it withheld Â£ 1.5 million from the labour party , which has debts of Â£ 11 million
now , miliband has crossed len mccluskey again and â only weeks before the general election â senior unite officials are privately plotting how to wreak their revenge for the latest rebuff to karie murphy âs parliamentary ambitions
miliband can ill - afford to make an enemy of len mccluskey and unite , for no other modern labour leader has had to rely so heavily on one union to ensure the financial survival of the party
since miliband became leader , unite has given labour an astonishing Â£ 14.3 million
the union has pledged a further Â£ 1.5 million for the election campaign , but may now withdraw that offer
it could also inflict huge logistical damage on the campaign
in october , the union set up unite activists for labour â to support getting labour back into power to prevent the tory - led coalition from wreaking any more damage upon the economy
and further attacking trade union and workers â rights â
they are ready to launch operations in the key marginals of cambridge , chelmsford , luton , great yarmouth â where ukip is battling labour to try to overturn a 4,000 tory majority â ipswich , which the tories held last time with a 2,000 majority , and norwich south , where the lib dems are defending a wafer - thin 300 majority from labour
the unite activists will help with telephone and door - to - door canvassing , fundraising , transporting voters to polling stations and , crucially , ensuring that their fellow union members vote
one senior labour figure said : â it will just take the word from len mccluskey for the activists to stay at home , and then our marginal seats operation is in big trouble
our membership has slumped , which means we do nât have the foot soldiers we had before
â we need union members , which is why this argument with len mccluskey could not come at a worse time
â unite , whose block vote swung the leadership for miliband over his brother david in 2010 , has an enormous , and some labour mps say â unhealthy â , sway over the party
in 403 seats where new candidates have been chosen , 129 will be flying the unite flag - more than one third of the total
the candidates have either worked for the union or received financial sponsorship
more than 50 are in key target seats where labour is confident of victory in may
in the current parliament , 147 of the 257 labour mps have received directly , or for their constituency parties , donations ranging from Â£ 250 to almost Â£ 200,000
miliband ( pictured ) can ill - afford to make an enemy of len mccluskey and unite , for no other modern labour leader has had to rely so heavily on one union to ensure the financial survival of the party unite has also handed Â£ 428,000 directly to shadow cabinet members
the biggest beneficiary is jon cruddas , the mp for dagenham , who has received Â£ 157,000 , which is more than one third of the total
cruddas , significantly , is in charge of miliband âs stuttering policy review
he has received a further Â£ 55,000 from other trade unions
miliband âs private office also benefited to the tune of Â£ 120,000 , and there was a further Â£ 148,000 for his leadership campaign
since he became general secretary of unite in january 2011 , len mccluskey , according to the union âs own data , has had 11 official meetings with the labour leader - though it is not known how often they talk on the telephone or meet in private
the millions of pounds handed over by the union also come with strings
it âs why len mccluskey has also had meetings with cruddas and ed balls , the shadow chancellor
unite âs paw prints can be seen on a number of policies which miliband has announced
in june 2012 , len mccluskey , in a tub - thumping speech to his union , demanded a â tax on the family home â
eight months later , miliband announced a â mansion tax â on properties worth Â£ 2 million or more
the policy has been disowned by leading blairites such as lord mandelson , major labour donors , and just about every labour mp hoping to secure the party âs nomination to be london mayoral candidate next year
the following summer , len mccluskey called for the abolition of the spare room subsidy , or so - called bedroom tax , which is saving Â£ 465 million a year
the matter is personal for len mccluskey because harman ( pictured9 is a member of unite , and she presided over the blocking of their candidate
two months later , in his party conference speech , miliband pledged to do just that
the pattern goes on : in july 2011 , len mccluskey demanded a rise in corporation tax for medium and large - sized businesses
two years later it duly became official labour party policy
but despite the agreements on left - wing policy , the row over karie murphy threatens to overshadow labour âs election campaign
the quarrel is also a personal matter for harriet harman
in 1995 , her husband jack , now a labour mp , ran for the leadership of the then powerful transport & general workers union
jack had the backing of the new labour machine from tony blair down
but he was heavily beaten , and the transport union was eventually absorbed into unite
one senior source said : â harriet harman lobbied everyone to try to get jack that job , and was bitterly disappointed when he failed
she has been nursing a grudge ever since
â harriet harman insisted on an all - women shortlist for halifax , but was adamant karie murphy was nât on it
the sisterhood it seems only extends to the sort of women that harman approves of , and they are clearly not certain working - class nhs nurses
â the halifax labour party is due to choose a candidate from a six - strong shortlist on saturday , at which point the party leadership will be hoping the rancour over the latest campaign selection battle will fade away
but if that ominous tweet is anything to go by , the overweeningly powerful unite union is already plotting its revenge .
