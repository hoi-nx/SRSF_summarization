lewis hamilton tweeted his pride for his brother after he made the announcement on his official facebook cerebral palsy is the general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination
specifically , cerebral palsy is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles
the condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before , during or shortly after birth
about one in 400 british children is thought to have cp
the more premature the baby , the higher the risk and , according to the charity scope , around 1,800 children are diagnosed every year
the symptoms of cp vary between individuals , but include muscle stiffness or floppiness , muscle weakness , random and uncontrolled body movements , balance and co-ordination problems
some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties , although intelligence is often unaffected
some have problems walking while others are profoundly disabled and require lifelong care
those with cerebral palsy often have other related conditions or problems , including epilepsy , learning difficulties , visual and hearing impairment , difficulties speaking or understanding other people speak , and delayed growth
