there will be no germany grand prix this year , hockenheim circuit boss georg seiler said on tuesday in a decision that ended months of uncertainty over the country 's formula one race
the absence of germany , home of reigning world champions mercedes , for the first time since 1960 leaves the calendar with 19 races
' we have no hope any more of having a formula one race here ( this year ) , ' georg seiler told bild newspaper
' we did everything in the last few years to keep the fans happy

' we had declared ourselves willing to step in for nurburgring , something we were contractually not obliged to do , ' he said
' there were talks with third parties over taking over the risk but they were not successful
' ecclestone said that hockenheim was the only option for the july 19 race despite it being the nurburgring 's turn under an alternation agreement
hockenheim hosted last year 's grand prix , and is also due to host it in 2016 , but the circuit has made heavy losses due to poor attendances and is unwilling to shoulder the burden for three years in a row
attendances have dwindled at the germany race since legend michael schumacher retired in 2012 the seven - time champion is pictured celebrating his triumph at his home race back in 2006 the nurburgring , one of the sport 's most historic venues with the original track dating from the pre-world war two years , also has financial troubles and has changed ownership since it last appeared on the calendar
germany drivers have been among the most successful in formula one , with michael schumacher winning a record seven world titles and 91 races while sebastian vettel is a four times champion
however attendances dwindled after michael schumacher , who won five of his titles for ferrari , retired in 2012 after an unsuccesful comeback with mercedes
only 52,000 fans turned up on race day at hockenheim last year to see germany 's nico rosberg win the race for mercedes
the victory was the first by a germany driver in a germany car on home soil since the 1930s
