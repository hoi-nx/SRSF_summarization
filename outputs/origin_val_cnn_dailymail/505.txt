lewis hamilton wants to replicate the scenes that followed after his second world championship title lewis hamilton ( left ) has been pictured alongside kanye west and kim kardashian since his triumph lewis hamilton is adamant his growing profile will not distract him from matters on the racing track lewis hamilton has never hidden his passion for music , posting instagram snaps playing guitar is that â brand â something lewis hamilton wants to replicate ? â at the moment , it âs winning championships that counts , â he said
â i do nât wish to stop racing but i âm conscious i âm halfway through my career , or maybe gone past halfway , and that the next six , seven or however many years i get will come and go
whatever steps i take now will determine what i do after
â i do nât want to be a commentator , although i think i âd be ok at it because i obviously know a lot about the sport , but there are other things i would like to try
so it âs exploring those and building a foundation
â does that mean music ? â i âm continuing to plod along and enjoy my music when i get time , â said lewis hamilton
â but i have nât been in the studio since january , and just for a couple of days
that âs the least music i âve done during a winter for some time
â music is more of my life than people are aware of
when you âre doing music you have a choice of how much you want to show and how vulnerable you want to be
i approach it just as a hobby , something i enjoy
â i like to have feedback from people who are experienced
i âve never been tempted to release anything but i âve not had the worst of comments about my songs , either

â there are things i âm really quite creative at , so i âm going to see where that takes me
i am good at designing
i did my whole house
i have done my steering wheel for some time
i might indulge in trying to design clothes or something
just do my own stuff
i âd like to do something with cars
â which brings us from hobbies back to business and a year in which lewis hamilton âs mercedes team will again dominate , according to the crushing figures from pre-season testing

their relationship became rancorous last season but ended with a hug in abu dhabi
it was a magnanimous gesture from the vanquished nico
â an honourable , respectful man , â was lewis hamilton âs verdict at mercedes â factory in brackley last week
â my relationship with nico is as good as 12 months ago , â he added
â it seems quite good , to be honest
but it âs when you get in the heat of the moment and there âs ... you know , you have to assume there âs going to be moments where there âs going to be bits of tension , but that âs because we âre fierce competitors
lewis hamilton insisted he is unfazed by nico 's efforts to beat him in the upcoming season lewis hamilton is confident that he will be able to defend his title in the season that starts in melbourne â you are conflicted because you are trying to get the team to win , but you also want to win yourself
we managed it well , particularly at the end of last season
â nico , whose wife vivian is expecting their first baby in august ( classic german efficiency â a birth in the sport âs summer break , as one of his lieutenants observed ) , has said publicly he can win the title
â you have to assume each driver is going to get better , â he said
â i âm sure nico is training harder
i âm sure he is studying more and trying everything under the sun to make sure he finishes ahead of me
that âs what i âve been facing since i was 10 so it âs no different , really
