video top four still possible - mauricio pochettino adebayor has fallen out of favour with tottenham hotspur boss mauricio pochettino and had been criticised by fans adebayor had not featured for tottenham hotspur since the end of january in the 2 - 1 fa cup defeat by leicester tottenham hotspur 's defeat by manchester united left them six points adrift of the top four places ' if he keeps scoring two goals every weekend , he can help us into the top four
but do n't get me wrong , now people are starting to get to know him and what he can do and what he can not do , his positives and negatives on the pitch
' but he is an intelligent lad and he just has to find his way again and bounce back
we all have a huge faith and believe in him
hopefully , he will drag us out of the top seven and put us in the top four
' and for me , sitting on the bench , as a player , i have been there before
i just have to work hard on the pitch and come back and play football
football is a fun game
today , you are zero
tomorrow , you are a hero and the most important thing is you , what makes you happy , keep believing , keep doing your thing on the pitch
' adebayor was in demand on transfer deadline day in january , when he rejected a move to qpr but almost joined west ham before tottenham hotspur chairman daniel levy blocked the loan transfer
' that is already behind me , ' said adebayor
' i am still at tottenham hotspur so for me , the most important thing is now tottenham hotspur and help the team achieve our target which is to finish in the top four
do n't get me wrong , it 's going to be hard but at the moment , just let me focus on my game and how i can help the team
adebayor was given the captain 's armband for the second leg of the captial one cup semi-final against sheffield united in january adebayor posted this picture to instagram days before the manchester united match , with a message saying it is not important what people think of you , but who you are ' why not ? i am part of the squad
and for me , the most important thing â¦ i 'm not 21 years old any more
i am 31 and i look at things differently
as i said , i am available
we have a lot of fantastic players in the squad and the manager has a choice to make
' if i am in , like when i came in for ten minutes i run around , i did what i can do and whenever i am selected , i just have to help my team and show respect for them and show respect for the club
' the summer is a long way to go
we 've got what , nine games to go ? which is almost two months
so we 've got plenty of time
at the moment , i 'm a footballer , i 'm a professional ... keep doing my work , keep doing my job as professional as i can
at the beginning of the last season , everyone wanted me out ; at the end of the season , they wanted me to stay
i just have to keep believing in myself , keeping doing my thing
' i travelled to europe to be a footballer and today , i am a footballer
already , i am very glad because obviously in my country , only god knows how many people would love to wear the tottenham hotspur shirt today and play for tottenham hotspur
so whenever i have a chance to wake up and be alive , i always thank god for that and for me , all the rest is a bonus
keep enjoying my life , keep enjoying myself
' adebayor was booed onto the pitch at old trafford by travelling tottenham hotspur fans , upset with what they consider a casual attitude and comments made earlier in the season that the team would rather play away than at white hart lane
adebayor came close to leaving tottenham hotspur in january but chairman daniel levy blocked a move to west ham the striker returned to favour under tim sherwood last season and scored 11 goals after january he added : ' i do n't know if i have been punished or not but what i know is , i 'm me , i 'm being me , and if i have to say it and correct the future for the club , i will do it
do n't get me wrong , this club has given me the chance to play again in london and i 'm so grateful
' if tottenham hotspur won the cup a few weeks ago , i 'm part of the club that won the capital one cup in 2015
tottenham hotspur did n't win it
me and the fans are in the same boat
so today , obviously , i am very disappointed and i think the fans are disappointed as well
at the end of the day , somebody will say something that people will misunderstand and take the wrong way but i have nothing against the fans , i always love the fans
' i do n't want to get involved in that any more
it 's behind and for me now , it 's just play football and enjoy my life again
as a togo boy , who has suffered a lot and today he 's in europe
as i tell you before , my junior brother , my senior brother , my uncle , i think they would love to be in my position today , being a footballer , being a striker for tottenham hotspur , trust me
even just travelling with the team , a lot of my family members , a lot of my countrymen , would love to do that
for me , let me just enjoy it and embrace it
