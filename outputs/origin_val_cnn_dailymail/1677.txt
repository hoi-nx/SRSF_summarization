robert jason owens , 36 , a construction worker from north carolina , was booked on two counts of first - degree murder , the murder of an unborn child , larceny and breaking and entering on tuesday
his charges are in relation to the supposed murder of his leicester neighbors , celebrity chef codd , 38 , a season 8 finalist on food network star , and her husband codd , 45
the couple , whose bodies have not been found , were likely killed on thursday , according to police
owens allegedly returned to their home on sunday and stole their laptop , jewelry and a handgun
now , it has emerged that owens was a ' primary suspect ' in the 2000 disappearance of zebb , 18 , who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in asheville with owens , then 21
the pair then drove away separately
but they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a mitsubishi for sale that zebb was interested in buying , police told fox carolina
owens later told police that a short while later , zebb flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over
zebb then went off to return a page , before returning in a ' frantic ' state , owens said
cancelling the pair 's plans to see the mitsubishi , zebb reportedly told owens he needed to leave and drove off , bumping into his friend 's truck on his way
since that moment , he has been missing
on january 3 , zebb 's mother , vlahakis , filed a missing person 's report
two weeks later , the alleged victim 's car , a 1990 mazda protã©gã© , appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant
bizarrely , a live puppy was inside the vehicle , which was situated at the little pigs barbecue near a hospital where vlahakis worked
a pair of lips were also drawn on the car 's back windshield
