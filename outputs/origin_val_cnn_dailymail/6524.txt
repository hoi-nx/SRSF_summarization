growing numbers of pets are being fed antidepressants to reduce their stress while left home alone all day , vets have warned
an estimated 80 per cent of britain âs pet dogs suffer from behavioural conditions , with many linked to being cooped up in an empty house for hours at a time
long periods of separation from their owners can lead to hyperactivity , obsessive - compulsive behaviour and anxiety , vets say
growing numbers of pets are being fed antidepressants to reduce their stress while left home alone all day , vets have warned but with people living busier lives than ever before , many pet owners are turning to drugs to quell the problems
experts are worried people are feeding dogs and cats their own supplies of human antidepressants , or getting a prescription from their vet for animal - specific medication
knight , professor of animal welfare and ethics at the university of winchester , told the sunday telegraph : â the number of behavioural problems in dogs and cats , and even other pets , such as birds , seen by veterinarians is huge
â we âre constantly seeing animals that are aggressive , unduly fearful , or barely under control when they visit , although my colleagues and i do our best to put them at ease with gentle handling and tasty treats
â instead of attempting to calm or even sedate our stressed pets with pharmaceuticals , it âs about time we started giving our pets the care and attention they really deserve
only then might we truly be eligible to call ourselves a nation of animal lovers
â an estimated 80 per cent of britain âs pet dogs suffer from behavioural conditions , with many linked to being cooped up in an empty house for hours at a time there are several licenced antidepressants for animals on the market , including clomipramine , selegiline , reconcile , which each work in a similar way to fluoxetine - the human antidepressant which goes under the trade name prozac
a recent report by the pdsa ( pdsa ) found that more than a quarter of dog owners leave their pet alone in the house for five hours or more during a weekday and that 250,000 dogs are never walked â leading to serious behavioural problems
dr knight said dogs need love and attention
â dogs need to be walked , every day , yet too many are left at home with little to do while owners go to work , â he said
â it âs hardly surprising many resort to barking and demolishing the furniture , in their desperation for attention and stimulation
such problems are widespread within our pet population , and constitute a major , under - recognised animal welfare problem
â the british small animal veterinary association said that medication should only be used after diagnosis by a vet .
