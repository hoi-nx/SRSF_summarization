' absolutely no peas ! ' booms luis as he dispatches me to the market
i 'm in valencia , spain 's third largest city
not for the las fallas festival ( a huge affair every march when giant papier - mache figures of politicians are burned amid lively street celebrations ) , but for its other claim to fame - it is the home of paella
luis is a top chef who leads paella - making classes
but first i have to get the ingredients
dinner is served : paella originated in valencia , using ingredients which could be sourced cheaply and locally the central market is in a glorious art nouveau building in the old quarter , with more than 500 stalls selling every spain food imaginable
i buy an ' arrangement ' of rabbit and chicken portions from a butcher
then i choose three different types of beans
paella valenciana was created from what was easily available to local farmers
this meant rice from the local paddy fields , and beans , rabbit and chicken from their land
it 's wrong to add peas , as we brits do , apparently
under luis 's watchful eye , i learn how to chop the meat and cook it and the beans in different parts of the pan
i sieve fresh tomato and dabble in smoked pimento for flavour
the secret is about how to put the rice into the water
luis tells me to add it in two straight lines in the form of a cross ( seemingly , for perfect absorption )
i add fresh rosemary , remembering to remove it after ten minutes
it seems to work and in around 20 minutes my glossy , golden rice dish is complete
delicious , though i say so myself
luis awards me my diploma : i am now a ' paella ambassador '
if you want to know more about this famous dish and its variations , contact patrick waller
originally from bromley , he moved to valencia 23 years ago when he fell in love with a local , julia espin
a real mixed bag : true paella can contain seafood and rabbit - but should never feature peas they run the paella project , taking in all aspects of buying fresh produce at the market , cooking classes , wine tastings and a visit to xativa in the hills with lessons and meal preparation outdoors
you can also explore the famous rice fields of the albufera national park , just 15 minutes outside valencia
you can take a boat trip on the vast lagoon or enjoy the pine - fringed , wild beaches and restaurants of nearby el saler village
valencia has fantastic white beaches , too , just five minutes from the city centre
there are endless orange tree patios ( proper orange juice everywhere ) ; walks along the former turia riverbed ; the unesco listed lonja ( silk hall ) , which dates to1548 ; and superb shopping , including five el corte ingles department stores
balconies of intricate metal designs and specialist cafes called horchaterias , with marble - topped tables serving a traditional valencian drink made from tiger nuts and sugar , remind me this is the real spain
