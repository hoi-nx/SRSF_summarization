the song is straightforward and carries the usual expletive , for semi-rhyme as well as effect
gabby agbonlahor , cry aston villa fans to the tune of karma chameleon , is rather fast
that âs the clean version
the frequency with which the words are heard from now until the end of the season will prove largely correlative to aston villa âs chances of remaining a premier league team
they have not been sounded all too often this campaign
but at villa park on tuesday night , especially during the first half , gabby agbonlahor produced a performance to warrant adulation
gabby agbonlahor salutes the villa park crowd in celebration after opening the scoring against west brom gabby agbonlahor threads the ball through ben foster 's legs to give the hosts the lead in the midlands derby it was arguably his best display in years , a return to those days when his speed and strength shot him into the england set - up
gabby agbonlahor consistently harried gareth mcauley and joleon lescott , chasing down balls he had no obligation to reach , using his stocky physique to keep hold of possession when under threat
benteke got the headlines for his late winning goal , but it was gabby agbonlahor who set the tone
his goal was a classic case of pace proving the difference
he latched onto benteke âs nodded flick and finished while making statues of the west brom central defenders
he did similar when creating a pass out ashley westwood âs hopeful ball , sprinting to startle the opposition backline and only being denied a second by joleon lescott âs goalline clearance
boy george âs ditty rang loud
gabby agbonlahor beat ben foster again shortly after but joleon lescott raced back to clear the ball off the line gabby agbonlahor reacts after west brom keeper ben foster almost dropped the ball over his own goal line ben foster initially caught the shot from gabby agbonlahor but it then slipped through his legs and he had to react quickly in all , he had three shots on target â including the badly fumbled effort by ben foster than nearly trickled over the line â which is a significant uplift of recent matches
in this statistic , the sequence of his last 12 games reads : 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1
fantastic figures should jimmy anderson be bowling a couple of overs at the death in the world cup
as shots on target for a premier league striker ? not so much
gabby agbonlahor failed to test the goalkeepers of newcastle , chelsea , arsenal ( admittedly as a substitute ) , liverpool , leicester , crystal palace , manchester united ( albeit sent off unjustly after 65 minutes ) and west brom
his inability in that period to make a difference in opponents â penalty areas is symptomatic of aston villa âs wider attacking paralysis , stymied by a style that ranked possession over purpose to an adverse extent
aston villa manager tim sherwood ran down the touchline and celebrated vigorously after gabby agbonlahor 's goal benteke sends the goalkeeper the wrong way to score a dramatic late penalty and seal the win for aston villa it is hard as a centre - forward to strike for goal if the ball is rarely within 30 yards of the target
gabby agbonlahor would often operate on the wings under paul lambert too
this is not to absolve the 28 - year - old
as one of the club âs senior figures his form has been disappointing , particularly since he signed a new four - year contract last september
born locally and graduating from aston villa âs youth set up he is a supporter of the club and the depth of his feeling has been clear in his commitment since he broke through to the first team nine years ago
so it has been odd to see his on - field demeanour at certain times this season , exhibiting none of the vim aston villa fans know well
benteke celebrates his goal with aston villa team - mates jack grealish and andreas weimann brad guzan looked on in horror as saido berahino equalised for the visitors before benteke 's winner that was back with a bang against west brom
tim sherwood restored gabby agbonlahor up front alongside benteke and allowed for the direct style that suits their attributes
gabby agbonlahor found the net for the first time in 14 matches and it proved valuable
each one of his four premier league goals has counted for something : a draw against southampton and wins against liverpool and hull , accompanying the west brom victory
seven extra points in total
tim sherwood knows the worth of the player whose speed is celebrated in chant
the aston villa manager needs to continue utilising his talents for the final 10 premier league matches to make sure this spark of brilliance does not fizzle out
gabby agbonlahor on song means aston villa should stay up .
