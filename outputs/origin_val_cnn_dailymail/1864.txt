a beach hut that was described by a luxury lifestyle magazine as ' too lush for words ' has gone on sale for Â£ 1.25million , despite attracting bitter complaints from local residents
the property , which is located in coldingham bay in the scottish borders comes with four double bedrooms with sea views and terraces , an entrance hallway and open plan kitchen , dining and living area with sliding doors
since it was constructed it has received praise from fans of modern architecture , with luxe magazine calling it ' too lush for words ' in a july review
one tripadvisor review of the area by sandra l reads : ' this lovely spot is overlooked by an absolute monstrosity of a building - a carbuncle is the only suitable description
' how this ever got planning permission is a mystery ! my memory is of the chalet belonging to the haven , a wooden building with a corrugated iron roof
i know we must move with the times , but i think this building is a big mistake and spoils the whole beach area
' however , spokesperson for property management company sanderson young , who are dealing with all enquiries called the property â one of the most unique , rare and impressive beach houses available within the united kingdom â
the home is set into landscaped grounds which extend up and down the hillside
the property can also be rented out for Â£ 3,000 for seven nights during peak holiday season
pricey : according to the estate agents handling the sale , at peak season the owners of this house could collect Â£ 3,000 per week in rent problems : one tripadvisor review of the bay brands the property a ' carbuncle ' , adding : ' how this ever got planning permission is a mystery ' anger : the building used to be on the site of an old wooden hut that served as accommodation for staff at a nearby haven hotel holiday rental website coastalretreats.co.uk still have the property advertised to rent and describe it as : ' an extraordinary piece of landmark architecture using glass , steel , welsh slate and iroko wood in a stunning location '
a local business owner added : ' just generally i hear that most people do nât like it
it âs totally different to everything else in the bay
a lot of tourists come in and say they do nât like it but there are a small group who say it âs stunning
' it used to be an old wooden hut , i believe it was the living quarters for the maids at the haven hotel
now it âs an invasive piece of modern architecture
' i believe that a gentleman owns it and it is on the market , though i âm not sure if it was built to sell or to let
it sits empty for much of the time but every now and then guests do come to stay
' fury : sandra l left this review of the bay on tripadvisor with a three star rating , the lowest rating the location has ever received , saying the property ' spoils the whole beach area ' complaints : others have protested the new addition to the sea front by saying it is out of keeping with the other buildings
