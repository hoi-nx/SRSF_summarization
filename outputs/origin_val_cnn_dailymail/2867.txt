ince says son tom ince would love to play for england in the future and insists the decision to make himself unavailable for the under 21s was taken for the good of his career
in an exclusive interview with sportsmail , the former england captain â who has 53 caps â has hit back at claims tom ince â snubbed â his country and that his international career is in ruins
gareth southgate revealed on thursday that the hull winger â currently on loan at derby county â had told him he did not want to be considered for this summer âs european championships
tom ince has been left out of the latest england under 21 squad by gareth southgate at his own request ince ( right ) is currently on loan from hull at championship side derby county the england boss said he was â surprised and disappointed â following conversations with the 23 - year - old and his father , his former england team - mate
but ince snr says his son needs a period of rest if he is to get his career in the premier league back on track â and that is their prime focus heading into next season
â tom ince has played 18 times for the under 21s and really enjoyed it and found it beneficial â so this is not a snub , that âs rubbish , â said ince , who was england â s first black skipper
â he is 23 years of age and has already played in the euros in israel
he has experienced that , which was great
â if he was 20 years old we would not be having this conversation , he would be going to the euros , no doubt about it
â but the last year or so from a club point of view has been difficult for him
he âs been all over the place
he went to hull last summer and has then been on loan at forest and derby county , where he âs doing well now
â we forget that he had three years at blackpool pretty much playing by himself at a young age , and that had an effect
â he needs to get a good rest and make sure he is ready to go next season
he needs to start finding some stability
he needs to get himself in a position to play regular football in the premier league
â england captain ince has his head bandaged and shirt covered in blood during a world cup qualifier against italy in rome in 1997 ince ( right ) played under his father paul while at blackpool in the championship the aim , then , is to make an impact at the kc stadium next season before bidding for a senior call - up with england
â listen , tom ince has not snubbed his country
it is the pinnacle of a player âs career to represent your country , â ince added
â i was captain and am immensely proud of my 53 caps
â gareth southgate said we should be aware of the repercussions
if tom ince is playing regularly next year for hull and scoring goals like he is for derby county , then he would love to get an england call - up
â and if he is doing that i see no reason why roy hodgson should nât call him up
he âs got a good young squad and tom ince would love to be part of it in the future
â but first of all he needs to get his club career in order
we have looked at the bigger picture
he needs a steady period and he needs to hit the ground running next season

â so there is no way i âm saying to tom ince , â do nât play for england â
as a father i would love my son to do what i did and play for his country
â there are other kids coming through who are 20 and 21 and they will be at the tournament - tom ince is 23
â and do nât forget he could also be in the play - offs with derby county , as he was with blackpool
there would be no time for rest
â we have to be careful and think about the future
