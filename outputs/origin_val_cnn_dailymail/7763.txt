the mp husband of selfie - loving danczuk was spotted favouriting hard - core porn on twitter - but blamed it on a fault with his iphone
a constituent flagged up the blunder after realising the labour mp had favourited a tweet linked to an account described as ' an 18 + erotic account for posting sexy pictures of sexy women '
the rochdale mp does not follow the account , which features dozens of pornographic pictures of women
he says a glitch with his smartphone caused it to favourite the image and he was unaware of what had happened until friday
the howler came after his selfie - queen wife , karen , was invited to host the uk porn awards , although she has apparently turned down the opportunity
the screen starts flickering and jumping about and i 've no idea how this happened
' the picture was initially posted on march 22
two days later a twitter user calling himself neil nw-hoopz tweeted next to the account : ' have a look at what my mp @ simondanczuk is favouriting on twitter , # oops
' it 's understood mr simon danczuk was out canvassing in rochdale when the slip - up happened
mp , who has campaigned against child sexual exploitation , hit the headlines last week when he said in an interview in the new statesman that miliband was considered more of a ' toff ' by voters than david cameron
the interview was brought up by jeremy paxman during thursday 's live tv debate with mr miliband and david cameron
mr simon danczuk also clashed with controversial columnist hopkins on twitter over race relations
hopkins has criticised him for posting a picture of himself in rochdale next to a pakistani flag
a constituent in rochdale flagged up the blunder by tweeting the mp , pictured above she linked it to the child sex grooming scandal in the town , which led to jailing of a gang of asian men for 77 years in 2012
but mr simon danczuk accused her of spreading ' vitriol ' and of ' racist generalisation '
mrs dancuk , known as the queen of the selfies , is a former rochdale councillor who announced she was stepping down earlier this year to pursue other career opportunities , including media work
she became known for posting a series of racy images of herself on twitter and revealed in february she had been sexually abused as a child .
