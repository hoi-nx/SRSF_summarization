he was sacked for punching a junior tv producer after not getting a hot dinner
and judging by the extensive list of backstage luxuries demanded by jeremy clarkson and his top gear live co presenters , it seems a miracle he had nât previously lashed out
the three - page catalogue was revealed after bbc producer tymon , who felt jeremy clarkson âs wrath , said he did not want to press charges
also required is chateau leoube rosÃ© or equivalent which â at jeremy clarkson âs insistence - must be â pale dry â¦ preferably southern france

their drinks must be served on linen covered tables , while a sofa must be provided with â enough room to seat six people , one of whom is 6ft 3in and likes to lie down â
the stars also insist on a nespresso coffee machine with a milk frothing gadget , balsamic vinegar , dove deodorant , hair wax , â nice rubbish bins â and a coat stand â â not a rail ! â in all , there are about 120 different items listed for the green room which jeremy clarkson , richard hammond and james may use to relax in during breaks from hosting the top gear live events , which take place at arenas in the uk and abroad , and are separate from the bbc tv show
the rooms â often the size of a hotel suite â must be fitted with a rug if there are no carpets , soft lighting , a tv with good speaker system and sky sports and movies , an array of films on dvd and green plants - ideally bamboo
smoker clarkson insists on a carton of marlboro lights and as well as packets of camels and marlboro menthol lights
in all , there are about 120 different items listed for the green room which jeremy clarkson , richard hammond and james may use to relax in during breaks from hosting the top gear live events and in a move which might have pre-empted the attack that ended jeremy clarkson âs bbc career , the list also insists the green room must be located near a mcdonald âs , stating : â they will ask for this â
a source from top gear live told the mail : â all three presenters have their eclectic tastes and they certainly know what they want
â jeremy clarkson is very into his rosÃ© and very particular about getting exactly the right type of wine
â he also likes to be driven around in a range rover during these events
â it âs fair to say he can be a little bit of a prima donna at times
â jeremy clarkson is alleged to have been drinking rose for three hours before he hit tv producer tymon , who had told him that he was nât able to have steak and chips at simonstone hall in north yorkshire following a day âs filming

the source added : â some of the items are brought over by his team from venue to venue around the globe but others they get people on the ground to buy ready for their arrival
â they do nât always need everything or eat and drink everything on the list , but they like to have them there just in case
â the green rooms vary in size depending on the venue , but are often the equivalent of a hotel suite
during most top gear live events the presenters â and anyone they invite to join them â spend a few hours in the room during rehearsals on friday and before and after shows on saturday and sundays
they usually stay in hotels or private houses overnight
the rider was put together by pr firm r  and events , which worked on the top gear live shows
one of the firm âs directors , emma stonier , was unavailable for comment , while another , rebecca banks , declined to answer questions at her oxfordshire home when she was shown the document
but a former business associate of the pair , who did not wish to be named , said : â i know there were lists like this for top gear with very specific requests
â tymon âs solicitor , daniels , indicated the producer wanted to draw a line under the affair
mr daniels said : â mr tymon does nât want to press charges
the matter has taken a great toll on tymon , his family and his friends
â quite simply , mr tymon just wishes to return now to the job at the bbc he loves , as soon as possible
