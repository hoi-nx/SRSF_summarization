thames valley police confirmed today that both the man and woman 's next of kin had been informed of the discovery
a spokesman for berkshire coroner 's office said the names of the couple could not be released as they were yet to be formally identified
it is understood paramedics were called to the grade ii listed hotel yesterday afternoon when a chambermaid discovered the bodies after the pair failed to check out
the door to their room remained locked and after the worker gained entry , she raised the alarm
the manager of the hotel refused to discuss the incident when contacted by mailonline today
it is believed the pair may have hatched a plan to kill themselves and may have taken an overdose
guests at the hotel told how the pair , who checked into the hotel on sunday evening and booked a double room for the night , may have been suffering severe illness
it was believed the couple , who are said to live in a nearby town , decided to splash out on some luxury where they could spend their final hours
one hotel guest , who asked not to be named , said : ' apparently it was quite obvious to the paramedics and police who were called that they intended to commit suicide
' we have been told that they were a fairly local couple and that both were very ill - the woman more seriously so than the man
' we were told that there was a lot of paraphernalia around in the room and also a note explaining what they were doing
' i guess all the details will come out in the inquest into their deaths
' other guests checking out of the five - star hotel today spoke of their shock at the incident
a man aged in his 50s , who was staying at the hotel while in reading on business , said : ' it is just shocking and so sad
i only checked in last night , so i missed the emergency services but i read about what happened
' i really feel for them , it is just tragic that they felt they could not go on
' the luxury hotel boasts of ' an indulgent and relaxing experience ' on its website ( pictured )
rooms cost up to Â£ 350 - a - night and each comes complete with egyptian cotton sheets and complementary branded toiletries a 35 - year - old man , who works in the area , added : ' i saw all the police cars and ambulances here yesterday as i only work around the corner
i actually thought someone had been murdered
' you just never expect something like that to happen around here and at such an upmarket hotel
i guess perhaps if it was a double suicide , they wanted to go out in style in nice surroundings , it is a lovely hotel - not to sound insensitive at all , but it is known for being among the best in the area
' i just hope the staff who found them are okay , that must have been very traumatic
' a woman aged in her 30s , who was at the hotel with her mother , said : ' it is such a sad tale
it is devastating to think they felt they had nothing left to live for
' the hotel has 23 rooms and a series of 16 apartments , which it lets out
each room has egyptian cotton sheets on all king size beds , with complementary molton brown toiletries and nespresso coffee machines in every bedroom
