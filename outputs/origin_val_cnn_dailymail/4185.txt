a 35 - year - old graphic designer , who would only like to be known as dan , has distributed ' girlfriend wanted ' posters around melbourne dan told daily mail australia he 's been single for three months and decided to distribute his posters as other methods did n't work out
' i had heard of other stories of people doing similar things so i thought " why not " , ' he said
' i was not meeting anyone at bars and clubs
i had tried online and speed dating with mixed results and now i 'm bored of it
it 's also hard to meet people in general
everyone is so busy with their face stuck to their phone
so i felt like i had to do something different
' basically i like to take chances and just give things a go
hoping there 's a girl out there who has a similar outlook on life and also thinks " why not "
' so far dan has received 60 emails from interested women from his poster but not one who ticks all the boxes
' some write just out of curiosity
others are not what i 'm asking for or are girls from interstate or overseas
some write on behalf of friends
some flake when it comes to meeting up , ' he said
' girls appear to be wary of the poster
it 's understandable but i also think of it as a bit of test
is she willing to take a chance like me ? those that do , stand out to me and am thankful for it
' and this is a method dan has tried before
' did it late last year
i met one girl and we dated twice but she only wanted to be friends after that
so i decided to try a second time this year with the poster , ' he said
although he admits he wants to ' settle down ' , dan is still undecided about marriage and kids
' i 'm wanting a relationship so one step at a time , ' he said .
