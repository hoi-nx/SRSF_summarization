a debut at carnegie hall meant to showcase a young composer was abruptly canceled after management realized it featured a snippet of a nazi germany anthem
the new york youth symphony was set to premiere the orchestral work on sunday at the prestigious concert hall but the orchestra 's management removed it , saying that such an explosive musical reference required a longer conversation
no one has suggested any nazi sympathy by composer tarm , a 21 - year - old estonian american , who intended for the work to deplore war including recent bloodshed in ukraine
composer : the new york youth symphony canceled tarm 's ' marsh u nebuttya ' after management realized it featured a snippet of a nazi germany anthem piece : tarm uploaded this photograph of his work ' marsh u nebuttya , ' which is ukraine for ' march to oblivion
' it featured both a portion from the nazi song ' horst-wessel-lied ' and the anthem of soviet - ruled ukraine but the controversy raised a broader question -- how explicitly do artists need to state that allusions to history 's darkest chapters are meant to condemn rather than condone ? the new york youth symphony , which recognizes performers and composers under age 22 , said tarm only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of ' horst-wessel-lied , ' one of the nazis ' main anthems which is banned in modern germany and austria
the symphony said that the nine - minute piece could have been ' an important teaching moment for our students ' but that tarm refused to lay out his reasons for using ' horst-wessel-lied
' ' without this information , and given the lack of transparency and lack of parental consent to engage with this music , we could not continue to feature his work on the program , ' the symphony said in a statement
' we believe deeply in a free creative process
but along with freedom comes responsibility , even more so when young people are involved , ' it said
tarm had entitled his work ' marsh u nebuttya , ' which is ukraine for ' march to oblivion , ' and it also incorporated the anthem of soviet - ruled ukraine
he initially explained his work only with a dedication in the program ' to the victims of hunger and fire ' and an excerpt from eliot 's post-world war i poem ' the hollow men
' ' between the conception and the creation / between the emotion and the response / falls the shadow , ' runs the verse from eliot , who is often considered the premier 20th century english - language poet but also faced accusations of anti-semitism
disclosure : the new york youth symphony said tarm only informed the management last week that his piece included 45 seconds of ' horst-wessel-lied , ' one of the nazis ' main anthems
the song is banned in modern germany and austria upset : after tarm 's carnegie hall ( pictured ) debut was cancelled , tarm spoke more at length , saying he was ' disappointed and confused ' by the rejection of a piece ' not meant to provoke , but to evoke intent : tarm has said the piece is ' devoted to the victims who have suffered from cruelty and hatred of war , totalitarianism , polarizing nationalism -- in the past and today ' music speaks for itself ? after the cancelation , tarm spoke more at length , saying he was ' disappointed and confused ' by the rejection of a piece ' not meant to provoke , but to evoke
' the piece '' s devoted to the victims who have suffered from cruelty and hatred of war , totalitarianism , polarizing nationalism -- in the past and today , ' he said in a statement
' the old joke about how do you get to carnegie hall -- you practice
apparently , you also have to self - censor
i 'm disappointed that this work will no longer have the ability to speak for itself , ' he said
tarm , who is studying at the new england conservatory in boston , said that the orchestra had been practicing the piece for weeks without any complaints
the controversy has echoes of a furor last year at the metropolitan opera which staged adams ' ' the death of jewish american leon klinghoffer , ' about the wheelchair - bound jewish american leon klinghoffer who was killed by palestinian hijackers of a cruise ship in 1985
protesters rallied outside and several disrupted performances in part because palestinian characters in the opera make anti-semitic remarks as adams tries to set the context for the killing
ken jacobson , deputy national director of the anti-defamation league , which fights anti-semitism and racism , said that he could not judge the canceled carnegie hall piece without listening to it but urged reflection before banning artwork that cites offensive material
' i assume that the new york youth symphony did what it did out of good motives
but i would also say that in works of art , one has to be thoughtful and careful before one wants to censor , ' he told afp
the orchestra went ahead sunday with a performance that featured rising violinist elena urioste , who performed beethoven 's violin concerto and nikolai rimsky-korsakov 's ' scheherazade
