a young woman lies in a pool of blood alongside her newborn baby on the dusty floor of an ebola treatment centre in sierra leone
the makeni unit is where west africans believe they go to die , not ' to be born or to live ' , said british doctor james , who found the new mother
but in a place that 's notorious for death and suffering , dr james 's quick - thinking paid off and both mother and baby have survived
and the newborn 's name ? doctor james , of course
he is an infectious diseases trainee at royal hallamshire hospital in sheffield , but spent five weeks as an international medical corps volunteer at the makeni treatment unit between february 6 and march 15
the centre was built by the british army , funded by the british government , and has so far screened more than 385 patients - 105 of whom tested positive for the virus
tragically , just 32 of those recovered
dr james has described in detail the morning of little doctor james ' birth after a ' fairly brutal ' night shift earlier this month
' there had been seven deaths in the day and two more overnight , ' he said
' that was my purpose for being in the red zone
' confirming death is one of the least enjoyable aspects of a doctor 's responsibility
here , confirming death is increasingly harrowing
' patients prefer to lie directly on the concrete floor , maybe it is cooler , which then involves continuously washing off not only layers of dust , but dust caked in their own bloody body fluids
' mother and baby : memunatu and her newborn tested negative for ebola and were discharged earlier this month dr james dons his personal protective equipment before entering the high risk area of the international medical corps ' ebola treatment unit he added : ' they lie , rigor mortis already setting in , in whatever position they happened to be in prior to passing
' this particular morning my grim responsibility was thankfully complete
shortly after this however , an employed ebola survivor came running out of the suspect ward
' the eight - month - pregnant lady was no longer pregnant
' dressed in personal protective equipment ( ppe ) , dr james re-entered the high - risk zone and found the young woman , memunatu , on the ground under a blanket
concealed under the simple piece of fabric was her newborn baby in an increasing puddle of blood
' with my own heart rate rapidly increasing i was blessed by the imminent arrival of a far more competent national nurse carrying a birthing pack , ' he said
' with some hastily shouted orders over the fence , i scooped up baby and deposited him on to mum
' baby was quiet and a little blue
now , i had seen on television that if you give them a rather firm rub they start to shriek ; which he did right on cue
' without any prior experience of what i was about to undertake , i clamped the cord , cut it , delivered the placenta , checked it was all intact , gave her some oxytocin and massaged her tummy
' lucky : a young woman was found on the ground under a blanket , which concealed this beautiful newborn baby medical staff wait to be disinfected after leaving a high - risk zone at an ebola treatment centre in sierra leone soon the baby was wrapped up , the bleeding stopped and the woman was taken away to be cleaned up
' the whole experience actually went just as it should have done , ' dr james said
' just as it has done for millenia , across the world , thousands upon thousands of times
' except this , of course , was not like all those other times because unbeknownst to this little bundle of joy , he had arrived into the world in the middle of an ebola ward
' international medical corps is one of a handful of international non-governmental organisations that is treating ebola patients in west africa
it is currently operating four ebola treatment centres â two in liberia and two in sierra leone â which provide not only isolation and care for ebola patients , but also psychosocial support
to expand the pool of health workers capable of managing and working in emergency treatment units across the region , international medical corps is providing high - quality training for local staff , other partners and organisations in liberia and sierra leone
ebola management training centres have been opened
to date , international medical corps has trained more than 620 local and international staff who are now helping combat this outbreak in west africa
in addition , it is working to find ways to strengthen local non-ebola health care capacity
' this is where people believe they come to die , not to be born or to live , ' he added
' his cord was cut by the double - gloved hand of a nervous british medic in a suffocating yellow suit
' the reality is that mum was a suspected ebola patient and if positive , then he was almost certainly positive too
' after the ordeal , dr james joked with the mother that she could call the baby james
to his surprise , memunatu gave her newborn the title of doctor james bangura
the centre was built by the british army , funded by the british government , and has so far screen more than 385 patients - 105 of whom tested positive for the virus
tragically , just 32 of those recovered and were discharged hope : the survivor wall at the makeni treatment unit
each hand print represents a life saved by the medical team subsequently , both mother and baby tested negative for ebola and were discharged soon after
' having begun his existence in such desperate surroundings you might think that things can only get better , ' mr james added
one of the deadliest viruses known to man , ebola is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of the recently deceased or an infected person showing symptoms
the world health organization said ebola can still be transmitted in sperm 82 days after a patient carrying the virus is cured
ebola causes hemorrhagic fever and induces internal and external bleeding , profuse vomiting and diarrhoea
the world 's worst ebola epidemic has killed more than 10,200 people in total in the three most affected countries of guinea , liberia and sierra leone since march 2014 when it was first confirmed in the forest region of guinea
ebola cases in sierra leone have dropped sharply from a peak of more than 500 in december to around 50 cases a week , helped by british military assistance
from tomorrow , the entire population will stay at home for three days on the order of president ernest koroma in a bid to stop the spread of the virus
it comes as a goal is set for cutting off the spread of the disease in guinea , liberia and sierra leone by april 16
liberia previously reported that it had reached an end to the epidemic but a new case appeared in its capital monrovia last week
the infected woman is the wife of a man already cured of the disease , it has been reported
thousands of people still remain at risk of ebola in sierra leone and international medical corps is on the ground treating patients
