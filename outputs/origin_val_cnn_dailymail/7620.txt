after months of defending gaye 's work , the late motown singer 's family breathed a sigh of relief in court on tuesday as a jury decided that the thicke song ' blurred lines ' ripped off gaye 's 1977 hit ' got to give it up '
following the decision , gaye 's ex-wife and children sat down for interviews to describe the emotional legal battle to stand up for his music and how they hold no ill - feelings towards the song 's producer , pharrell
' it 's gratifying , i just felt filled , ' ex-wife gaye told abc news
from left to right : gaye 's son marvin gaye iii , daughter nona , and ex-wife gaye overcome with emotion : tears welled in nona 's eyes as she reflected on the multi-million dollar lawsuit the success of the family 's lawsuit in court is also sparking discussion online as to whether some of pharrell 's other work infringed on gaye , with many drawing comparisons between his 2013 hit ' happy ' and gaye 's ' ai n't that peculiar '
' i 'm not going to lie
i do think they sound alike , ' gaye 's 40 - year - old daughter nona told entertainment tonight
while the family hears the similarities , they say they are not interested in going back to court anytime soon
' we 're not in that space , ' nona added
furthermore , the gayes are open to mending ties with pharrell , and said they would be willing to include him in a tribute show to the late r&b star
in court on tuesday , nona cried in court as a jury decided to award her family $ 4million in damages and $ 3.4 million in profits from the song
thicke will be forced to pay $ 1.7million from his own pocket and pharrell $ 1.6million

they were not present when the decision was read on thursday ' i feel free , free from ... pharrell â & thicke âs chains , ' said nona in an emotional statement outside the courtroom following the verdict on tuesday the verdict could tarnish the legacy of pharrell , a reliable hit - maker who has won grammys and appears on nbc 's music competition show the voice
it was previously revealed that the song had made a staggering $ 16million for pharrell , thicke , rapper t.i. and the record company , though t.i. and various record and music companies had previously been cleared of copyright infringement charges
an attorney for thicke and pharrell has said a decision in favor of gaye 's heirs could have a chilling effect on musicians who try to emulate an era or another artist 's sound
all three later released a statement , saying ; ' while we respect the judicial process , we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today , which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward
' blurred lines â was created from the heart and minds of pharrell , thicke and t.i. and not taken from anyone or anywhere else
we are reviewing the decision , considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter
' ' right now , i feel free , ' an emotional nona said after the verdict
' free from ... pharrell and thicke 's chains and what they tried to keep on us and the lies that were told
' tragic death : gaye , best known for such classics as sexual healing , i heard it through the grapevine and how sweet it is ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father when he was just 44 - years - old this was no doubt in response to the fact that pharrell and thicke had filed a lawsuit against gaye 's estate back in august 2013 in an attempt to stop his family from suing them for copyright infringement
' plaintiffs , who have the utmost respect for and admiration of gaye , funkadelic and their musical legacies , reluctantly file this action in the face of multiple adverse claims from alleged successors in interest to those artists
defendants continue to insist that plaintiffs ' massively successful composition , ' blurred lines , ' copies ' their ' compositions , ' read the suit
this suit however was thrown out in october of that year , when a judge ruled that the family had made a sufficient showing that the two songs were similar
' we did not start this fight â¦ pharrell and thicke started this lawsuit , â busch said outside of the courthouse
' we fought this fight with one arm tied behind our back
' victory speech : nona ( second from left ) , daughter of late singer gaye , and her lawyer busch ( front right ) speak to the media following the verdict on tuesday the gayes ' lawyer branded pharrell and thicke liars who went beyond trying to emulate the sound of gaye 's late - 1970s music and copied the r&b legend 's hit got to give it up outright
he also brought up the fact after the verdict that the defense 's legal team did everything they could to stop the jury from hearing gaye 's song during the proceedings , allowing them to just listen to certain snippets of the music
for this reason the infringement charge only applied to the sheet music for the two songs , making the case against thicke and pharrell that much more difficult for the gaye family
busch however pointed out during his argument that thicke said in interviews while promoting the single that he and pharrell were trying to write something like gaye 's got to give it up
thicke told jurors he did n't write blurred lines , which pharrell testified he crafted in about an hour in mid- 2012 , as he was too high on painkillers and alcohol
' the biggest hit of my career was written by somebody else , and i was jealous and wanted credit , ' said thicke
he also took time on the stand to play a variety of songs that sound similar in music and tone in an attempt to strengthen his case pharrell told jurors that gaye 's music was part of the soundtrack of his youth , but the seven - time grammys winner said he did n't use any of it to create blurred lines and that the songs were alike in genre only
the pair 's lawyer maintained their innocence even after the verdict , saying ; ' they 're unwavering in their absolute conviction that they wrote this song independently
' heads held high : busch , far left , walks with the late singer , gaye 's family members , from left , daughter , nona , ex-wife , jan , and son , frankie , on tuesday according to the los angeles times , he song brought in $ 5.6 million for thicke , $ 5.2 million for pharrell and another $ 5 million to $ 6 million for the record company , as well as an additional $ 8 million in publishing revenue gaye 's children - nona , frankie and marvin gaye iii - sued the singers in 2013 and were present when the verdict was read
the family had initially asked for $ 40million in damages , but later lowered that number to $ 25million
this was based on the amount of money they believed gaye would have been paid had he signed off on the rights to his song
gaye 's ex-wife janis testified that as soon as she heard the song she recognized the similarities and was thrilled thinking that this would introduce the music of her late husband to a new generation of music lovers
that quickly turned to anger however when she learned the rights to gaye 's song had not been licensed
sales of the 2013 song , which has already sold 7.3million copies in the united states alone , are still going strong too , and have seen a drastic increase over the course of the trial this past few weeks
gaye , best known for such classics as sexual healing , i heard it through the grapevine and how sweet it is ( to be loved by you ) , was tragically murdered by his father as he tried to break up a fight between his parents and protect his mother in 1984
the singer , just 44 - years - old at the time , had been nominated for 14 grammys at that point over the course of his brilliant but all too brief career , and left the rights to all his music to his three children
an appeal of the ruling is already being considered by pharrell and thicke 's lawyer
petty vs. petty : petty 's monster hit stay with me , a song which earned him three grammys at this year 's ceremony while also contributing to his best new artist victory , sounded a little to similar to the petty classic i wo n't back down , something the latter 's lawyers picked up on and took to court
the two settled the entire thing like gentlemen however , coming to an agreement out of court that gives petty and composer jeff lynne a writing credit on the track and 12.5 % of the royalties
the rolling stones vs. the verve : the the verve became one of the biggest bands of 1999 thanks to their hit bittersweet symphony , a song which sampled strings from the rolling stone 's the last time
the band however was told they could only use a five - note sample , and once they song was released were accused of breaking their promise and using more
as a result , mick jagger and keith richards were given writing credits for the track alongside the verve 's richard ashcroft , and the group had to relinquish all royalties they received for the song
queen and bowie : while bowie remains a one - hit wonder , that hit , ice ice baby , still receives massive play over 20 years after it was released by the rapper
the song clearly borrowed however from the bowie and queen tune under pressure , something the rapper initially denied
the case was eventually settled out of court , and the details of the settlement were never revealed , though it is known that freddie mercury , brian may , roger taylor , john deacon and bowie all now have songwriting credits
bright tunes vs. george harrison : in the biggest copyright infringement case prior to tuesday 's ruling , harrison was accused of using the ronnie mack song he 's so fine in creating his solo song my sweet lord
the case dragged on for five years , ultimately making its way to a united states federal court , where harrison lost and was forced to pay $ 1,599,987 , a staggering amount at the time
isley brothers vs. michael bolton : bolton used elements of the isley brothers song love is a wonderful thing in his song of the same name , and as a result ended up having to pay $ 5.4million , when the case went to court , which before tuesday was the largest amount ever awarded in a copyright infringement case .
