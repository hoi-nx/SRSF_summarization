britain car - maker jaguar has launched its new xf compact sports saloon in spectacular fashion with the world 's first dramatic ' high - wire drive ' over water on cables just an inch thick
in a stunt worthy of the latest james bond movie spectre â for which the firm is supplying many of the cars â the new xf was revealed during a dramatic ' high - wire ' water crossing in the heart of london 's business district
the feat took place high over the royal dock in london 's canary wharf today
jim dowdell drove the all - new xf 240metres across a high - wire to demonstrate the new xf 's lightweight aluminium - intensive construction and agility
a jaguar spokesman said : ' the dramatic drive across two 34mm - diameter wires suspended high above water , highlights the lightweight and agile credentials of the new xf
' the high - wire feat is also a fitting symbol for the sort of high - wire act britain 's jaguar is performing for real to take on far bigger german rivals bmw and mercedes-benz
the company 's new xf sport saloon promises ' business class ' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines
it is being built at jaguar land rover 's castle bromwich factory in birmingham
following its high - wire reveal , it makes its official global debut at the new york motor show on april 1 before going on - sale from autumn 2015
jaguar says the new xf is 80kgs lighter than its closest competitor thanks to its aluminium - intensive construction
this has helped create fuel efficiency of more than 70mpg with co2 emissions of 104g/km : ' this is the lowest co2 emissions of any non-hybrid model in the segment
' engines include a frugal new 2.0litre 163 horse - power ingenium diesel to a 380 horse - power v6 supercharged petrol

the firm said : ' the next generation xf is completely new from the ground up and will be the second jaguar model to use the brand 's advanced aluminium - intensive architecture
the all - new xf will set new business segment benchmarks for weight and efficiency , resulting in class leading fuel economy figures of over 70mpg
' they added : ' the all - new xf retains its predecessor 's core attributes but uses jaguar 's advanced aluminium - intensive architecture to elevate them to a completely new level '

so although the new car is 7mm shorter and 3mm lower than the car it replaces , the new xf has a 51mm longer wheelbase â the gap between the wheels - which means more rear seat space with more legroom , knee - room and headroom
