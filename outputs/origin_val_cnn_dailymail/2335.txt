italy has reopened one of the most famous ruins of pompeii , following threats the site might lose its world heritage list listing and millions in eu funding unless it is restored
the villa dei misteri ( villa of mysteries ) , an estate on the outskirts of pompeii 's city centre that features some of the best - preserved frescoes of the site , is now open to the public after one of many restoration projects ordered by the eu
the historic roman city , which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 ad , has been accused of mismanagement and neglect , and the eu has given the italy government until the end of 2015 to fix its problems
italy has been ordered to spend 105 million euros ( Â£ 78million ) in eu funds by the end of the year for maintenance and restoration projects , or lose its funding
while only three projects have been completed , 13 are underway and some 65 million euros has been awarded in contracts , officials said
in addition , 85 people have been hired to work on the site and visitor numbers last year were 200,000 more than in 2013
more than 80 people have worked on the pompeii site to restore the artwork in a bid to boost visitor numbers italy had been ordered to restore the works of art by the eu in a programme , which cost the country 105million euros the historic roman city , which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 79 ad , has been accused of mismanagement and neglect ' we know well that the world looks with great attention at everything that happens at pompeii , ' franceschini said as he stood before a fresco of dionysius and aphrodite in the villa 's main salon
' today , italy is proud to say to the world that we have turned a page
' pompeii , a busy commercial city overlooking the mediterranean , was destroyed in a.d. 79 by an eruption of mount vesuvius that killed thousands of people and buried the city in 20 feet of volcanic ash
unesco threatened to take the ancient city of pompeii off its world heritage site list unless the artwork was restored two of the frescos , which are now available to view in the ancient city of pompeii , after it opened up to the public once again the mold of a victim of the volcanic eruption , which destroyed the ancient city of pompeii in a.d. 79 but the ash also helped preserve pompeii 's treasures , providing precious information about life in the ancient world
the first excavations began in the 18th century , but even today only two - thirds of the site 's 60 hectares ( 150 acres ) have been uncovered
in recent years , pompeii has been bedeviled by neglect and mismanagement characteristic of italy 's underdeveloped south , as well as brushes with the corruption that has infected some other important public works in italy , including its expo 2015 world 's fair in milan and the moses water barrier project in venice

the 2010 collapse of the villa of gladiators , and further collapses at pompeii the following year , caused such international alarm that the eu stepped forward with funding and italy created a mini-administration to govern the restoration project and make sure it was n't infiltrated by the mafia
among other things , the eu project called for the site to be shored up and for a drainage system to be built
meeting targets : culture minister franceschini said that while problems still remain at pompeii , italy is on schedule to meet their eu deadline

at the same time , unesco threatened to take pompeii off its world heritage list â a coveted designation that inspires many of the site 's more than 2 million visitors each year
a unesco inspection in november , however , acknowledged that progress had been made
franceschini quoted from the unesco report , which said any question about pompeii 's place on the list had been ' overcome ' and that there had been a ' profound change in the behaviour ' of its administration .
