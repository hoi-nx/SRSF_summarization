the rumbling discontent among everton fans towards manager roberto martinez is gathering momentum after wednesday night 's dismal 2 - 0 defeat at stoke city left last season 's champions league challengers just six points above the relegation zone
after one win in 12 games and only one clean sheet away from goodison since september , it is becoming common to hear fans complain that the spaniard is ' turning us into wigan '
the statistics actually bear out their worst fears
in roberto martinez 's last season at wigan , he had 30 points from 30 games â and went down
everton currently have 28 points from 28 matches
everton manager roberto martinez and his team look lost in the barclays premier league of late everton 's underperforming stars now just sit six points above the relegation zone in the barclays premier league victor moses ( left ) scored in stoke city 's 2 - 0 win over everton at the britannia stadium on wednesday night the europa league , the source of so much pride earlier in the season , is now looking like an unwanted distraction
everton face dynamo kyiv at goodison on thursday before their now - crucial next league match against newcastle on sunday
the following week they have to contend with a 3,000 - mile round trip to ukraine for the second leg
the players may not get into their beds until 4am on the friday morning , just 60 hours before they take to the pitch at loftus road for what , inconceivably , could be billed a relegation six - pointer against qpr
so what has gone wrong at everton â a club who finished fifth last season and were tipped to be fighting it out with chelsea , manchester city , arsenal , manchester united and liverpool at the top
here are eight reasons why everton are fighting to stay in the top flight , where they 've been since 1954
the Â£ 28million non-talisman in retrospect , romelu lukaku was foolish to declare he wanted to become the world 's best player when he hit a purple patch on loan last season
everton smashed their transfer record to make a Â£ 28million move from chelsea permanent in the summer , a deal that now makes jose mourinho look a genius
romelu lukaku has scored just seven barclays premier league goals , fewer than west ham 's diafra sakho who cost less than a quarter that amount
romelu lukaku 's notorious first touch looks as if it is getting worse , not better , and he has complained everton 's style is not direct enough to get the best out of him
romelu lukaku declared he wanted to be the world 's best player last season but he has been far from it roberto martinez must be desperate to find a way to help re-find his Â£ 28million centre forward 's best form romelu lukaku 's first touch has always had a bad reputation but it has proved even more of a problem this season martinez too soft roberto martinez believes in filling his players with confidence and it makes him look a great man - manager when things are going well
but salty old professionals like sylvain distin , with whom he has fallen out , phil jagielka and tony hibbert have been around long enough to realise that a good old - fashioned rollocking is needed at times
david moyes was n't always popular with the everton players but roberto martinez could do with handing out a few home truths like the scot did
phil jagielka ( left ) and tony hibbert ( right ) have been at everton for years and understand the way things work roberto martinez has fallen out with sylvain distin but the defender knows that on occasion players need a rollocking the disappearing ross barkley valued at Â£ 60million not so long ago and feted by roberto martinez as potentially the best english player of all time , 21 - year - old ross barkley has started just over half of the club 's barclays premier league games this season , 15 of 28
at stoke city when roberto martinez had one last substitution to use to try and salvage a result , he turned to kevin mirallas , rather than the supposed heir to paul gascogine
ross barkley has played in so many different positions this season â holding midfield , out wide , no10 â he looks confused
ross barkley was left on the bench on wednesday night , even when everton were searching for a goal ross barkley was lauded by roberto martinez as potentially the best english player of all - time but he has n't progressed injuries one of the reasons everton are ultimately likely to get out of trouble is that important members of the old guard are heading back
leon osman tasted his first barclays premier league action since early december on wednesday night after a serious foot injury and his knowhow will be vital
even more importantly , leighton baines â the best left back in the barclays premier league â is pencilled in to face newcastle having missed six games with a knee injury
aiden mcgeady and steven pienaar are also out while darron gibson 's midweek appearance was his first barclays premier league start for nearly two years
leighton baines - the best left back in the barclays premier league - will be a huge boost on return from injury leon osman is also returning to the first - team fold and could be a key man in everton 's run - in loan problems traditionally , roberto martinez has one of the best records in the loan market
tom cleverley enjoyed the best spell of his career at wigan and last season gareth barry and romelu lukaku were big hits at goodison
but the midas touch seems to have deserted him
christian atsu has hardly had a kick since he joined from chelsea and aaron lennon was woeful and substituted after an hour at stoke city
tom cleverley ( left ) was well managed by roberto martinez during his loan spell at wigan which saw him hit top form by contrast , christian atsu has hardly had a kick since signing a season - long loan deal from chelsea aaron lennon came in on loan from tottenham but he was woeful at the britannia stadium on wednesday it 's all attack , and no defence roberto martinez earned a reputation for concentrating too much on his attacking play at wigan and history is in danger of repeating itself at everton
despite inheriting a strong back - five from david moyes , everton have looked less and less certain at the back , and the collywobbles have effected goalkeeper tim howard , who has gone from world cup superstar to dodgy keeper this season
the repetitive defensive drills under david moyes were boring but they did serve a purpose
tim howard was brilliant at the world cup but he has had troubles in the everton goal this season david moyes employed repetitive defensive drills at everton - but they did the trick for his side euro distraction getting the balance right between europe and the barclays premier league has foxed a lot of managers over the years
roberto martinez seemed to be on a winner earlier in the season with his fondness for team rotation helping the club qualify for the knock - out stages in europe while holding head above water in the league
but the regular changes have affected rhythm in recent weeks and the league form has dropped alarmingly
everton were flying high when they won away in wolfsburg but the rotation for europe has had an effect barry gamble has backfired gareth barry has been one of the barclays premier league 's most consistent midfield players over the last 15 years but at the age of 34 , he is becoming to look a liability
everton decided to sign him on a permanent basis last summer but his most notable contribution this season is to have broken the all - time barclays premier league record for yellow cards
his caution at stoke city on wednesday â number 106 â has earned him a two - match ban and that might prove a blessing in disguise
gareth barry has been a consistent performer for 15 years but now looks like a liability in midfield gareth barry 's caution on wednesday night was his 106th in the barclays premier league - an all - time record for any player
