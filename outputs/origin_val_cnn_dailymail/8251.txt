from burnley to barcelona , the signposts all point to trouble ahead for city and their beleaguered manager manuel pellegrini
it will require his best win as city boss against barcelona at the nou camp on wednesday for manuel pellegrini to save the club âs champions league dream and , possibly , his job
but city set out for spain on monday on the back of a dismal defeat at turf moor and a withering assessment of their shortcomings from burnley âs match - winner george boyd
george boyd celebrates his sweet strike that saw burnley upset city on saturday burnley 's ben mee tackles pablo zabaleta with the kind of physical presence he says helped them win the scot accused the premier league champions of lacking both the appetite for a physical battle and willingness to track back and defend
it was something burnley detected when they recovered to draw 2 - 2 at the etihad in december and exploited again after analysing city âs defeat at anfield earlier this month
â you saw it recently against liverpool , they do nât track back as well as they go forward so we knew we could exploit that and we did , â said george boyd , who scored with the sweetest of strikes after an hour
â i think it was playing to our strengths and getting in their faces that got us the win
you find with the bigger teams if you get in amongst them , press them hard and tackle they do nât really like it , and we did that
â i do nât think barcelona will be in their faces as much as us and playing the long balls we play , but i thought we fully deserved the victory
â we did nât think they would play as strong a team with wednesday in mind , but obviously they came here to win and we were better than them
â george boyd drills home his left - footed shot for the famous win against a side that goes to barcelona on wednesday city boss manuel pellegrini is under pressure although his future will be decided at the close of the season it is not the first time city âs work ethic has been questioned this season , but there appeared to be a deeper malaise
it was as bad as anything in the post-title slump under roberto mancini
they were flat , dull and at times almost uninterested
everything that burnley were nât
sportsmail âs jamie redknapp said it was the kind of performance that gets a manager the sack
no wonder manuel pellegrini âs agent was touting him to napoli last week
there wo nât be any knee - jerk reactions from city , however , manuel pellegrini âs performance will be assessed at the end of the season
city prepare to kick off after conceding the first goal at turf moor that they were unable to peg back edin dzeko 's attempt on goal is blocked by some desperate burnley defence the chilean could yet mastermind a recovery in barcelona and take city into the quarter - finals of the champions league for the first time , having emerged from the first leg only 2 - 1 down
but apart from samir nasri and aleksandar kolarov this was close to the team that manuel pellegrini is expected to put out at the nou camp and they lost to a side battling relegation
instead of making up ground on chelsea in the title race , city are now in danger of getting swallowed up in the chase for places in next season âs champions league and that would test the patience of manuel pellegrini âs employers
he maintains that the situation is not as bad as the corresponding period last season when city went out of the fa cup and champions league in the space of four days , losing at home to wigan and away to barcelona
the 61 - year - old said : â it âs always the case before a big game that maybe the minds are not completely on this game , â he said
â but i do nât think it was a case of them not trying
i do nât think burnley had any chances to score apart from the free - kick which led to the beautiful goal
â of course we are not doing well
you can see that from the amount of points we have dropped
the only thing i can tell you is that it âs not down to the effort of the players
they want , but maybe they ca nât at the moment
