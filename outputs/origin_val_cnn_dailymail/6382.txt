caretaker boss kenny mcdowall fears rangers could be run out of the play - offs entirely â after they threw away a late lead against queen of the south to draw 1 - 1
on a night when john greig , walter smith and john brown returned to sit in the main stand alongside the new board - following the suspension of their predecessors earlier in the day - the team could nât match the renewed sense of optimism around ibrox
dropping another two points not only means hearts can win the scottish championship title before the month is out , it also keeps rangers in third place behind hibernian - with last night âs visitors only six points adrift
kenny mcdowall issues instructions to his layers during the 1 - 1 draw with queen of the south kenny mcdowall says his side must be wary of queen of the south in fourth and falkirk in fifth asked if he thought that either the dumfries side or falkirk could pip his team to the final play - off spot , kenny mcdowall said : â there is every chance
they are playing for the play - offs as much as we are
so we ca nât be disrespectful of them
â queen of the south are a good side , as are falkirk
they are looking to win games like we âre looking to win games
we âve got to work harder to turn it about
â i think it âs going to go right to the wire , the play - off places , without a shadow of a doubt
we have to find a formula to get winning again , we are stuttering along
â we âre not doing enough in front of goal and obviously not doing well enough to defend our goal
it âs nothing other than hard work until we get back to winning games
â kenny mcdowall , who has won only three of his 10 games in charge since stepping in for ally mccoist , said he had nât yet been told if the new board had accepted the resignation he handed to the previous regime
rangers midfielder vuckic , on loan from newcastle , celebrates putting the home side ahead at ibrox young queen of the south striker aidan ( centre ) wheels away to celebrate after scoring a late leveller â no - i would expect them to come to me , as opposed me going to them , â he said
â i âve got games to concentrate on with the team , i âm here to do that
i âm sure if the board want to keep me they âll come and speak to me
â a cool vuckic finish following a goalmouth scramble with 13 minutes remaining should have been enough to give rangers an ill - deserved three points from a bitty performance
but queen of the south equalised three minutes from time , 17 - year - old sub aidan on the spot â and granted plenty of time - to bury the rebound from a michael paton shot following a defensive mistake by home sub bilel moshni
the home team left the field to a smattering of boos from the second biggest ibrox crowd of the season
kenny mcdowall said : â it âs very disappointing , when supporters had come out , the new board is in place and the stadium is full
you get the lead and you are hoping to see it out â and do nât do it through poor , poor defending
â rangers legend john greig was in the stands at ibrox for tuesday night 's scottish championship clash vuckic celebrates hos goal with substitute bilel mohsni ( left ) , nicky clark and darren mcgregor queens moved a point clear in the fourth and final play - off spot , although boss james fowler believed his team could have won , declaring : â it would have been a travesty had we not got anything out of it
we were the better team and had the better chances
â but the boys reacted well after going behind and we are delighted young aidan got the goal
â rangers came out fast but we then controlled the game and some of our passing was excellent
we are happy with the point but , being greedy , i âd have liked the three
it âs still going to be difficult to make the play - offs
there are a few clubs in there but we will keep going
â goalscorer smith , making just his second appearance for the club , said : â it âs the best feeling ever
the ball just fell at my feet and i managed to lift it over the keeper
i actually thought michael paton was going to score before i did
my dad was in the crowd tonight but i have nât yet had a chance to speak to him
my mum was due to be here but she cancelled and she âll be gutted about that now ! â
