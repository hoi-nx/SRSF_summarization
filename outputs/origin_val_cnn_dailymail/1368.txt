landmarks by macfarlane at university college london in the sixties , one door in the english department was marked the english place name society
during my three years as a student i never saw anyone enter or leave that room , and imagined mountains of dusty books and documents , rambled by spiders , forgotten maps of a dead world
a ciste : gaelic for burial chamber
because the original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills , streams and bogs have fallen out of use , macfarlane performs a miracle of resurrection in his new book
reviving a fascinating archive of old terms from anglo-saxon to old norse , he dances through the closed door of the past â a labour of love as well as learning
original meanings of place names are largely forgotten and ancient local names for hills , streams and bogs have fallen out of use for years he âs been passionately engaged with the work of men and women who have written about the natural world , such as richard jefferies , barry lopez , jacquetta hawkes and roger deakin
these are his spiritual guides to the landscape he loves
for , as well as the milestones of the mind ( those books and encounters which shape us ) , there are the landmarks all around us : from the smallest tussock to trees , rocks , beaches and hidden valleys
all of these were named by our ancestors with particular , peculiar and poetic terms which probably fell out of common use in the last 100 years
so , each chapter describes the work of one or two writers who have shaped macfarlane âs thinking , and takes us on an imaginary walk into their worlds
and then comes a â glossary â , lists of names for things specific to one aspect of landscape
for example , eit : a tiny word from the isle of lewis with a huge meaning : â the practice of placing quartz stones in moorland streams so they would sparkle in the moonlight and thereby attract salmon to them in the late summer and autumn
â people in essex used to call you â watery - headed â if you were anxious about rain
and how about the glorious list of words for icicle : aquabob ( kent ) , clinkerbell and conkerbell ( dorset ) , daggler and dagglet ( hampshire ) , ickle ( yorkshire ) and shuckle ( cumbria )
macfarlane says : â this is a book about the power of language â strong style , simple words â to shape our sense of place
â he begins and ends this impressive and unusual book with children â which is as it should be
for who else will inherit the earth ? like many of us , he was deeply shocked when the new edition of the oxford junior dictionary left out words no longer seen as â relevant â to modern childhood , including acorn , bluebell , buttercup , catkin , conker , dandelion , fern , heather , heron , ivy , lark , mistletoe , newt , otter , pasture and willow
that âs why macfarlane ends by describing a thrilling project with primary school children given free access to explore a park in winter
their writing about this experience , over months , turned the ordinary park into a place of wonder where â new stories seethed from its soil â
to deprive children of that natural birthright macfarlane celebrates in all his work is to cut out an essential part of their hearts .
