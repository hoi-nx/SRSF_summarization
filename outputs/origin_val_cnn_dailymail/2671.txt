the ' secret ' teenage daughter of a late mining baron who successfully fought for $ 25 million from her father 's estate is now set to have her multi-million dollar inheritance challenged by her half sisters
mead was left $ 3 million in a trust fund when her iron ore magnate father wright died in 2012
the 19 - year - old , who is the third and youngest of mr wright 's daughters , challenged his will in the west australian supreme court in january claiming the amount left to her from her father 's estimated worth of $ 1 billion was insufficient
but the matter is due to return to court this week after the wright family signalled their intent to challenge the ruling
the $ 25 million was to be paid in a lump sum within 60 days of the february 26 judgement , but the wright family has since sought clarity from the court about the drafting of orders - there 's a 21 - day appeal period after those orders are drafted
the battle over mr wright 's estate made headlines earlier this year when lawyers pressed ms mead for details about why the $ 3 million sum was insufficient and what she expected she would need for the rest of her life
mr wright was estimated to be worth $ 1.5 billion when he died at 74 in 2012
he was the son of peter wright , who co-founded hancock prospecting and wright prospecting with lang hancock the court ruled last month that ms mead , the product of mr wright 's relationship with elizabeth anne mead after he divorced three women , should be handed $ 25 million from his estate the battle over mr wright 's estate made headlines earlier this year when lawyers pressed ms mead for details about why the $ 3 million sum was insufficient ms mead told the court she needed a home five times the perth median price ( $ 2.5 million ) , $ 10,000 each year for fashion accessories including tiffany and co sunglasses and $ 100,000 for a wedding when she ties the knot
her initial list of claims also included an audi a4 and a toyota tarago for when she has children , as well as a diamond - encrusted bass guitar worth $ 250,000 and a limited Â­ edition kuhn bosendorfer grand piano
in a summons filed in december 2012 , ms mead also claimed to have been left without adequate funds for her proper maintenance , support , education and advancement in life from her father 's estate in the bequeath to be held in trust until she was 30
her wish list amounted to about $ 20 million but supreme court master craig sanderson ruled ms mead was ' in no sense ... spoilt by her father ' and deserved far more than she had been left
' the deceased had a vast fortune and he was in the fortunate position of being able to provide for all of the parties who had a claim on his bounty , ' master sanderson said
many in perth had little idea mr wright had a fourth child until ms mead 's case went to trial

while ms mead had been included in his trust it was subject to onerous conditions , which meant that she might have received very little she would have been deemed exempt from the funds if she ' had any association or involvement whatsoever to illegal drugs ' was convicted of any felony within the 10 years prior to his death , of if she had ' converted to buddhism or islam '
the matter will return to court this week
