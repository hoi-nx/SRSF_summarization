the eerie remains of a japanese warship that lay undiscovered on the ocean floor for more than 70 years have been captured on film
musashi was attacked by the navy in 1944 and went down with more than 1,000 members of crew on board
despite numerous witness accounts its exact location remained a mystery for decades
but the ship was discovered earlier this month after microsoft 's billionaire co-founder paul allen spent eight years searching for it with his personal submarine
he is hoping the discovery ' brings closure ' to those who lost relatives aboard the ship , according to his website
his yacht , the octopus , has a remote operated probe octo rov that initially located the musashi at the beginning of march
the octopus is also outfitted with an exploration submarine
paul allen and his research team used the historical records of four different countries in order to pinpoint the location of the ship
musashi was attacked by the navy in 1944 and went down with more than 1,000 members of crew on board
despite witness accounts it was never found or disturbed the amazing footage shows coral and barnacles growing on the huge warship , which was the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleship ever constructed the inside of the ship can only be glimpsed at throughout the video

he wrote in a tweet : ' rip ( rest in peace ) crew of musashi , approximately 1,023 ( lives ) lost
' he promised that he would soon post video of the ship 's catapult and valve areas
the sibuyan sea - at the heart of the philippines ' central visayas islands - now covers busy shipping lanes and lies on the path of most tropical storms that cross the country from the ocean
but in 1944 , it was the scene for a battle considered the largest naval encounter of the world war ii - a battle which would be the musashi 's last
paul allen , one of microsoft 's co-founders , was able to find the ship using his private yacht and sub the octopus

' since my youth , i have been fascinated with world war ii history , inspired by my father âs service in the u.s. army , ' paul allen said
' the musashi is truly an engineering marvel and , as an engineer at heart , i have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction
' i am honoured to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honouring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her

luxury : the remote operated probe of the octupus ( pictured ) located the musashi on monday submarine : director james cameron has also used paul allen 's submarine , to dive to the depths of the ocean parties : paul allen 's yacht is not just for exploring , however , it is also luxurious enough to entertain his friends - pictured here leaving the boat for the olympic opening ceremony in 2012 , paul allen loaned the same ship that located the musashi to the british government to locate hms hood bell from the bottom of the denmark strait
the search was eventually called off due to bad weather
the octopus has also collaborated on google earth âs ' explore the ocean ' feature , and has helped the discovery science channel capture footage for a documentary to study the effects of nuclear detonation on the marine environment
director james cameron has also used it , for a seven - hour solo journey to the earth 's deepest point back in 2012
but paul allen is not confined to undersea exploration , either
glamour : the octopus also hosted parties in cannes
paul allen pictured here with george lucas in 2005 the u.s. is also working on a project called stratolaunch , which aims to put ' cost - effective ' cargo and manned missions into space
he launched spaceshipone , the first privately built craft into suborbital space in 2004
spokespersons for the philippines ' navy and coast guard told afp they were not informed of the discovery
for four days in october 1944 , the seas around the island of leyte bore witness to what some believe is the biggest battle in naval history
the second battle of the philippine sea , formerly known as the second battle of the philippine sea , began on october 23 , pitting the combined force of the u.s. and australian forces against the imperial japanese navy
three days earlier , the u.s. had launched an attack on leyte ; the japanese responded with sho-go - an operation designed to lure u.s. forces away from the san bernardino strait
but the japanese navy was attacked by u.s. submarines as it moved into position on october 23 - the first of four major encounters over the battle
the musashi survived this first encounter , but the next day , as it passed through the sibuyan sea , came under bombardment from the u.s. warplanes
it was first hit at 10.30am , and then again in a second wave
however , the ship did not finally disappear under the waves until 7.30pm that evening
it had been struck by at least 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes during the battle
by october 26 - the end of the battle - the japanese lost 26 battleships , but only sank six of the u.s. 's ships
the japanese had also suffered huge numbers of casualties : more than 10,000 men are believed to have died
the allied forces , on the other hand , lost around 1,500
