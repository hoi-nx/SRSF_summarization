if rollerskates are too retro and skateboarding too restrictive , there âs a new hydrid vehicle to master
the post modern skateboard is a cross between a skateboard and inline skates , and allows riders to perform effortless - looking spins ... with a lot of practice
it comprises two 10 - inch wheels , which riders position their feet inside , instead of balancing on a conventional board
the wheels can be joined together with a pole , to make the experience more like skateboarding , or kept separate , to be used more like in - line skates
â the annular skates â¦ are propelled by leaning side to side , allowing you to skateboard without having to push off the ground , â according to the entry in the hammacher schlemmer catalogue
â riders simply place their feet on the two platforms and lean side - to - side to rotate the rubber wheels around the feet , propelling riders forward in a serpentine motion similar to longboard skateboarding
â the wheels can be joined together with a pole ( pictured ) , to make the experience more like skateboarding , or kept separate , to be used more like in - line skates when the wheels are connected by a metal pole , the toy is most similar to a casterboard ( pictured ) , which is a narrow , flexible skateboard with a metal ' spine ' and two wheels that can travel in any direction composition : two 10 - inch wheels , which riders position their feet inside
the wheels can be used independently as skates , or joined with a metal bar to form a ' board '
how to use it : annular skates are propelled by leaning side to side , to let a user skateboard without pushing off the ground - like using a casterboard
tricks : when the toy is used like inline skates , riders can perform 720 Â° spins
price : $ 100 ( Â£ 67 ) when the wheels are connected by a metal pole , the toy is most similar to a casterboard , which is a skateboard with two wheels that can travel in any direction
â the included extendable rod can be connected to both wheels , providing stability to novices and hastening the learning period , â the catalogue says
when the wheels are not connected and work more like inline skates , â riders can easily perform 720 Â° spins and turn on a dime â
riders stop by placing their toes on the ground
the wheels of the â board â measure 10 inches in diameter ( 25cm ) so that it can be used on uneven road surfaces and grass
it costs $ 100 ( Â£ 67 ) and is designed to be used by ages eight and upwards
â riders simply place their feet on the two platforms and lean side - to - side to rotate the rubber wheels around the feet , propelling riders forward in a serpentine motion similar to skateboarding , â the catalogue says a motorised skateboard with just one wheel has been created by a firm in san francisco
called the onewheel , the $ 1300 gadget has a single air filled tyre taken from a go - kart
it can reach speeds on 12mph ( 19km/h ) , and turn 360 degrees within the length of the board - all while balancing itself using the same motion sensing technology found in a smartphone
a motorised skateboard with just one wheel has been created by a firm in san francisco
called the onewheel , the $ 1300 gadget ( pictured ) has a single air filled tyre taken from a go - kart the firm behind it , future motion says it ' lets you fly over pavement on only a single wheel '
' onewheel represents a huge shift in the typically stagnant , technology starved world of boardsports , ' said doerksen , who invented the board
riders can accelerate up to 12mph ( 19km/h ) by leaning towards their front foot
leaning back slows down , or even reverses , and regenerative braking recharges the battery during deceleration
mr doerksen says riding one is like flying
' the first thing you 'll notice when you get on onewheel is that it 's simultaneously familiar and unlike anything you 've ever ridden
' the technology enables it to ride much more smoothly than a skateboard and carve turns like on snow or a surfboard
