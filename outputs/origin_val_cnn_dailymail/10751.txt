a volcano that erupted on the moon 3.5 billion years ago has been mapped in detail , showing it was much more explosive than thought
the research reveals that the eruption would have sent debris across an area the size of scotland on the lunar surface
and the team are going to use their same technique to map the eruption of the largest known volcano in the solar system : olympus mons on mars
research led by durham university studied a lunar volcanic eruption
the team found that the eruption was much bigger than was thought
it erupted 3.5 billion years ago ( illustration of earth from around this time with the moon shown ) and covered a scotland - sized area in debris
this was thanks to the low gravity of the moon the findings were led by experts in the institute for computational cosmology and department of earth sciences at durham university , uk
they found that the eruption threw rock five times further than the flow of rock and gas that buried the roman city of pompeii
although the moon was already known to be volcanically active during this time , the size and scale of this particular eruption was surprising
scientists believe there is a huge network of tunnels that exist beneath the lunar surface
the volcanic structures , known as ' lava tubes ' , have previously been proposed as sites for human colonies on the moon
now a study by purdue university has claimed that tubes 0.6 miles ( 1km ) in diameter could be stable enough to house permanent bases beneath the surface
researchers believe that these lava tubes could help protect future astronauts against the challenges of the harsh lunar environment , which lacks a thick atmosphere
the volcano is located between two craters on the far side of the moon , bel'kovich - which is 133 miles ( 214km ) wide - and compton - which is 101 miles ( 162km ) wide
with the help of the moon 's low gravity , debris from the eruption spread over an area of 27,000 square miles ( 70,000 square kilometres )
nasa 's lunar prospector spacecraft first spotted the volcanic site in 1999 by detecting an isolated deposit of thorium - which is associated with volcanic activity
since its discovery , the deposit had been hard to study because it is hidden beneath debris from meteorite impacts
but the lunar prospector was also able to detect gamma rays emitted by the thorium that can pass through up to 3.3 feet ( one metre ) of rock
based on this information , the durham - led team used a ' pixon ' image enhancement technique , originally designed to peer into the distant universe , to sharpen the map and reveal the enormous size of the thorium deposit from the volcanic eruption
in this artist 's impression , the red region is the volcanic complex , and measures 22 miles ( 35km ) in diameter
the green area shows where debris from the eruption went , spreading 185 miles ( 300km ) east nasa 's lunar prospector spacecraft ( illustrated ) first spotted the volcanic site in 1999 by detecting an isolated deposit of thorium - which is associated with volcanic activity
the spacecraft was launched on 7 january 1998 , and remained in operation until 31 july 1999 this map of the moon shows gamma - spectrometric data collected by nasa 's lunar prospector spacecraft , specifically thorium in surface rocks
on the left is the near side , and the right is the far side of the moon jack wilson , a phd student in durham university 's institute for computational cosmology , said he was surprised by the gigantic scale of the explosion
' volcanoes were common in the early life of the moon and in fact the dark " seas " you can observe on the lunar surface were created by runny , iron - rich , lava that flooded large areas , filling in impact craters and low - lying ground , ' he said
' eruption of viscous , light - coloured , iron - poor , lava , which creates steep - sided volcanic cones , was rare and observed only at a handful of sites such as this one
' the explosive eruption of such lava is unknown elsewhere on the moon , making this volcano unique
' by mapping the radioactive content of the lava from this volcano we have been able to show that molten , radioactive rock was thrown far beyond the slopes of the volcano , reaching several hundred miles in one direction
' the research team is now planning to apply its mapping technique to the largest known volcano in the solar system , olympus mons on mars
rather than the radioactive element thorium , the researchers will be looking for hydrogen and the possible remnants of water ice from glaciers on the high slopes of the red planet
