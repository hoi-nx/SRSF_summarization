no stranger to courting controversy , rush has suggested rapper kanye west would have a hit record if he recorded the same racist chant that cost the sae fraternity its university of oklahoma house
speaking about sigma alpha epsilon 's slurs on wednesday 's show , rush dragged the grammys - winning rapper into his monologue and claimed hip - hop shared the blame for capitalizing on the n - word in so many lyrics
' if this had been a song by kim kardashian 's husband , and they 'd sung this song at the grammys , this would be a hit
can we all agree with that ? ' he asked
rush believes a racist chant that cost a fraternity its university of oklahoma campus house ' would be a hit ' if it was a kanye west record rush told his audience : ' if this had been a song by kim kardashian 's husband , and they 'd sung this song at the grammys , this would be a hit
can we all agree with that ? ' as the daily news notes , rush 's rant came after mentioning msnbc 's mika brzezinski 's controversial twitter post that wondered if the fraternity had learned the word from listening to hip - hop
' i 'm telling you that this stuff gets awards and the people that sing it are portrayed as american royalty in terms of celebrity
you ca n't deny that , ' rush said
but on twitter few thought rush was right
' ... sickened by joe scarborough and rush thinking hip - hop the cause of already - racist frat boys , ' wrote twitter user terry mccarty in los angeles
' we do nât even like kanye right now so what are you saying , ' joked blogger xavier d'leau
twitter users mocked rush 's claim after the show aired some were even outraged over his insinuation as news broke of the sae freshman chanting ' there will never be a n * * * * * in sae ' on a bus from the campus in norman to the oklahoma city golf & country club , the university 's president david boren closed the campus fraternity
following a swift investigation , he expelled the two ringleaders behind the song and said : ' i have emphasized that there is zero tolerance for this kind of threatening racist behavior at the university of oklahoma
i hope that the entire nation will join us in having zero tolerance of such racism when it raises its ugly head in other situations across our country
' privately educated freshman parker rice , 19 , and his sophomore friend levi pettit , 20 , both from dallas , expressed regret in the respective apologies as they accepted the expulsion but refused to explain who taught them the racist chant .
