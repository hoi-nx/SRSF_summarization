when her family failed to rouse the classroom assistant , they called an ambulance
despite the best efforts of the paramedics called , mrs nicola tweedy died
a post-mortem examination later confirmed she had suffered a pulmonary embolism , a blood clot which reached her lungs

the postman , who lives with the couple 's two children , said : ' they were required to avoid harming her and , tragically , in my opinion , they did not
' norfolk mp richard bacon said the case was a ' tragedy ' which should prompt improvements
he added : ' it is clear to me that more could and should have been done to mitigate the risks of what was deemed to be appropriate surgery for tweedy , most crucially to place mrs nicola tweedy and her family in a position to make a fully informed choice about whether to proceed with the operation
' any hospital treating over half a million people each year will occasionally not do everything perfectly
' but in the post-mid staffs world , when things have been less than perfect , patients and families now expect - and frankly are entitled to expect - much greater openness
' consultant vascular surgeon robert brightwell admitted to the inquest in norwich that a thrombosis risk assessment had not been completed
that meant the 54 - year - old was not fully informed about the dangers of the surgery , including the increased risk for those with a high body mass index

' she was someone who loved , cared for , guided , supported and helped so many people throughout her life
' in my opinion , the norfolk and norwich would have done nothing to learn the lessons from my wife 's death , and to materially revise their protocols and procedures , which they have subsequently done , without my formal complaint and , even after that , without the very considerable pressure i have placed upon them , both personally and through other organisations
' in the united kingdom thousands of patients die a preventable death every year from hospital acquired venous thromboembolism

' that , in my opinion , is a national scandal

she added : ' mrs nicola tweedy died of a rare but recognised complication of surgery , estimated to occur in approximately 0.01 per cent of cases , in other words one in 10,000 patients
