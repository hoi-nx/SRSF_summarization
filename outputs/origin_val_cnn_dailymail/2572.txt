the legal battle between sauber and giedo van der garde will continue on thursday , just 27 hours before the start of first practice for the season - opening australia grand prix
van der garde was axed from his role as test driver at the end of last season as sauber instead employed marcus ericsson and nasr , both of whom brought considerable sponsorship
van der giedo van der garde , though , claimed to have proof he was offered a race seat for 2015 and so took his case initially to an arbitration panel in switzerland which recently ordered sauber ' to refrain from taking action ' that would deny him a drive
giedo van der garde pictured outside the supreme court of victoria in melbourne on wednesday there followed a hearing at the supreme court in victoria , australia , on monday , with mr justice croft announcing at 10am local time on wednesday he found in favour of the 29 - year - old dutchman
sauber immediately appealed , and by 3.15pm three different judges in justices simon whelan , david beach and anne ferguson heard the case
that lasted just 45 minutes , however , with the appeal to be reheard from 9.30am local time on thursday , allowing them the opportunity to weigh up overnight the merits of the case
notably there is the fact ericsson and nasr have contracts with the team for this year , and are expecting to be in the cockpit on friday , with the first practice session due to commence at 12.30pm local time
following the initial verdict , and prior to the appeal , team principal kaltenborn was left stunned by the decision , but vowing to do what was right for her two current drivers
van der giedo van der garde leaves the court after a judge ruled that sauber must let the driver compete in melbourne kaltenborn said : ' we are disappointed with this decision and now need to take time to understand what it means and the impact it will have on the start of our season
' what we can not do is jeopardise the safety of our team , or any other driver on the track , by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers
' by contrast , van der giedo van der garde was naturally happy to have won the initial decision , although faces an anxious wait to see if it will be upheld on appeal
' i 'm looking forward to going back to the team and we 'll work hard to do our best for this weekend , ' he said
van der garde driving for sauber at the italian grand prix last september ' i 'm the fittest ever
i 've been training the last three months flat out
' i still have a very good relation with the team , and i 'm looking forward to racing this weekend
' asked as to the other drivers , he replied : ' it 's up to them what they are going to do , and up to the team
it 's not my thing
' i 'm happy we won the case
now i 'm looking forward to getting back to business
