a security guard shone a laser pen at the cockpits of passenger planes and a police helicopter while bored on coffee breaks at work
savage , 27 , targeted aircrafts coming in to land at southampton airport but claims he was ' was just mucking around ' and ' was n't thinking '
twice he aimed the beam at passenger planes , one of which was carrying 28 people - but despite risking lives with his reckless behaviour , savage , of hants , walked free from court today
spared jail : savage said he ' was just mucking around ' when he shone a laser pen into the cockpits of passenger planes and was spared a prison sentence after a judge heard how he had mental health problems sparing him jail , a judge warned how his actions could have caused a crash and stated he ' could not think of anything more dangerous ' to do
recorder michael vere-hodge qc made the decision after southampton crown court heard how savage had mental health problems
he shone a beam at a cockpit of a bombardier q400 plane on a flight from jersey that was preparing to land at southampton airport just before 9pm on september 9 last year , the court heard prosecutor phillips told the court co-pilot edward jarman was reaching a critical point in the landing stage when he saw a light reflecting off the plane 's window
dangerous : savage aimed the laser beam at several aircrafts including a flybe plane , which was carrying 28 passengers , forcing the captain to switch off his external lights to land mr phillips said : ' fortunately the light was n't in his eyes
he recognised the potential danger but was able to land the plane safely
' a similar flybe plane behind , captained by donnellan , was carrying 28 passengers and three other crew members and was coming in from paris , france
mr phillips said captain donnellan had previously suffered temporary blindness and disorientation after a beam had been shone into his eyes so was considerably concerned when he spotted the light from savage 's pen
he made the decision to switch off his external lights , a call he would not usually make , but he considered it less of a risk than being blinded by the laser and was able to land safely
he shone a beam ( like the one pictured ) at a cockpit of a bombardier q400 plane on a flight from jersey that was preparing to land at southampton airport an image from a previous unrelated incident , in which a laser pen was shone at a helicopter , demonstrates the blinding effect the device can have on pilots mr phillips said the matter was reported to police , who launched the force helicopter and found the source of light was coming from a compound near the itchen bridge in southampton
the pen was discovered under a rock and savage was arrested and taken to the police station where he admitted being responsible
savage said he was ' just mucking around ' and ' was n't thinking ' and accepted shining it at four or five planes on coffee breaks
savage , from totton , hants , admitted three charges of negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger aircraft
he received a six month suspended sentence with 12 months supervision
storry , defending , said his autism and lack of understanding of consequences explains why he shone the light at planes
he said : ' a reasonable person would know the potential consequences of what he was doing
he did n't think through the consequences of his actions and carried on doing it
also targeted : a hampshire police helicopter ( like the one above ) was called out and officers traced the source of the light and were able to arrest savage , who admitted responsibility ' one of his problems is that he gets bored very easily , lacks concentration and acts impulsively
' he fully understands the case against him
the difficulty is the lack of understanding of the implications of his actions
' urging the court to impose a suspended sentence , mr storry said : ' he is vulnerable and would n't take well to a prison regime
he would be a fish out of water
' recorder vere-hodge qc said : ' they were flying over urban areas and if the planes had crash landed , there would have a likely high level number of injuries and damage
' i can not think of anything more dangerous in our modern world than shining a beam into the eyes of people flying aircraft
' i hope you have got it into your head the amount of damage you nearly did and you will never , never put yourself into this kind of situation again
