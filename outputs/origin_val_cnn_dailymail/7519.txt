scientists are virtually certain that california will be rocked by a strong earthquake in the next 30 years
now they say the risk of a mega-quake is more likely than previously thought
the chance of a magnitude - 8 quake striking the state in the next three decades jumped to 7 per cent from 4.7 per cent , mainly because scientists took into account the possibility that several faults can shake at once , releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction
while the risk of a mega-quake is higher than past estimates , it 's more likely - greater than 99 per cent chance - that california will be rattled by a magnitude - 6.7 jolt similar in size to the 1994 northridge disaster
brace : a new u.s. geological survey report has increased the likelihood of a magnitude - 8 earthquake hitting california over the next 30 years
above , a photo of an overpass that collapsed in the 1994 magnitude - 6.7 northridge earthquake the chance of a northridge - size quake was slightly higher in california than southern california - 95 per cent versus 93 per cent , according to a report released tuesday by the u.s. geological survey
' california is earthquake country , and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one , ' u.s. geological survey geophysicist and lead author field said
the latest seismic calculations largely mirror previous findings issued by the u.s. geological survey in 2008
back then , scientists also determined that california faced an almost certain risk of experiencing a northridge - size quake
the new report included newly discovered fault zones and the possibility that a quake can jump from fault to fault
because of this knowledge , the odds of a catastrophic quake - magnitude 8 or larger - in the next 30 years increased
there is a 93 per cent chance of a magnitude 7 or larger occurring over the same period and a 48 per cent chance of a magnitude 7.5 - similar to previous estimates
thousands of quakes every year hit california , sandwiched between two of earth 's major tectonic plates , the pacific and north american plates
most are too small to be felt
of the more than 300 faults that crisscross the state , the southern segment of the san andreas - which runs from central california to the salton sea near the u.s. - mexico border - remains the greatest threat because it has n't ruptured in more than three centuries
the report found there is a 19 per cent chance in the next 30 years that a northridge - size quake will unzip the southern section compared to a 6.4 per cent chance for the northern section , partly because it last broke in 1906
the southern san andreas is ' ready to have an earthquake because it 's really locked and loaded , ' field said
the report is a forecast , but it is not a prediction
experts still can not predict exactly where or when a quake will hit anywhere in the world
in recent years , the u.s. geological survey and several universities have been testing an early warning system designed to detect the first waves of a jolt and send out an alert before the slower - moving damaging waves
proponents have said a few seconds of notice can allow trains to slow down , utilities to shut off gas lines and people to duck for cover
the public alert system - still in pilot phrase - needs more funding before it can be rolled out statewide .
