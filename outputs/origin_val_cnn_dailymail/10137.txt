british scientist david nutt has claimed the terminally ill should take hallucinogenic drug lsd
he said that the way we currently deal with death is to ' poison people with opiates ' a british scientist has claimed the terminally ill should be given hallucinogenic drug lsd
david nutt , a former government drug tsar , thinks that psychedelic trips might be able to lead to long - term benefits in a person âs thinking
the 63 - year - old said that using the drug is the ' great unanswered question in neuroscience '
professor david nutt was sacked from his job as the government 's chief adviser on drugs in 2009 after saying ecstasy and lsd were less harmful than alcohol
but he maintains that psychedelic trips might help terminally ill patients feel at one with the world
' the way we deal with death is to poison people with opiates so that they ca nât think , ' the independent reported him saying
' but on lsd it âs as if they have died , as if they âve gone out to another place
they exist beyond their body
' that experience can give them a sense of perpetuity , of permanence , of being part of the cycle of life
' at a briefing in london this week , he spoke out against restrictions on research on recreational drugs which he called ' the worst censorship in the history of science '
but having been turned down by ' classic funders ' , he raised the more than Â£ 32,000 on crowdfunding site walacea.com
in the controversial study 20 british volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on lsd
early results are said to be ' exciting ' but the full findings must wait until more funding can be found to complete the research
he compared current attitudes to studying recreational drugs with the catholic church 's clampdown on pioneering italian astronomer galileo galilei in the 17th century
he said : ' the only comparable example is when the catholic church banned the telescope in 1616
' we 've banned research on psychedelic drugs and other drugs like cannabis for 50 years
' truly in terms of the amount of wasted opportunity , it 's way greater than the banning of the telescope
this is a truly appalling level of censorship
' in the controversial study , 20 british volunteers will be the first in the world to have their brains scanned while high on lsd the lsd study involved giving the volunteers injections of a 75 microgram dose of lsd before probing the activity of their brains
two kinds of scans were used , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) and magnetoencephalography ( meg ) , which measures small magnetic fields generated in the brain
none of the participants reported having a bad experience , but three described some anxiety and temporary paranoia
dr carhart-harris , also from the imperial college team , said the dose of lsd given to the volunteers was a ' tiny speck '
but he added : ' the effects are quite profound
it would be described as a moderate dose , but a moderate dose of lsd can still produce a profound state of consciousness
' i would n't say that it 's a dangerous experiment , but i would say that lsd has potential negative effects
' probably the crucial one is a bad trip
it 's not uncommon for people to have anxiety during a psychedelic drug experience
. the experience can be nightmarish at times
' what 's especially intriguing
. is that people can have a very challenging experience yet afterwards they seem to be somehow psychologically refreshed by the experience
that 's how they describe it
' he said there had been no evidence of psychedelic drugs such as lsd triggering psychosis in research studies , although there were anecdotal reports of this occurring through recreational use
professor david nutt said lsd was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating ' many conditions ' , in particular alcoholism
since it was made illegal in 1967 it had only been the subject of one clinical study in switzerland and two neuroscience studies
' that is an absurd amount of censorship , ' professor david nutt added
he stood by the claim that got him into trouble with the government - that psychoactive drugs such as ecstasy and lsd were considerably less harmful than alcohol
' interesting drugs that we 've been researching like mdna ( ecstasy ) and lsd , are relatively low in terms of harms , considerably less even than cannabis and very much less than alcohol , ' he said
' but no research is done on them
' the law is actually wrong
the law is supposed to be based on evidence of harm but is n't
' he maintained that the risks of taking lsd had been ' massively exaggerated ' by the cia and us drug enforcement administration
initial funding for the lsd study came from imperial college and the beckley foundation , which promotes drug policy reform and research into the medical benefits of psychoactive substances
professor david nutt said lsd ( a molecule of the drug is pictured ) was widely studied in the 1950s and 1960s and shown to be therapeutically useful in treating ' many conditions ' , in particular alcoholism professor david nutt said he approached the medical research council and wellcome trust for the outstanding funding to no avail
' the issue always comes ' well look , these are recreational drugs ' , and the recreational label is so powerful i think it scares people off , ' he said
' i personally think the neuroscience that 's been uncovered by these drugs is revolutionary
' this research is so important it should be funded to the tune of millions
' dr carhart-harris said : ' this is the first lsd brain imaging study that 's ever been conducted
' we think it 's essentially important to understand how these drugs that are widely used and seem to have this therapeutic potential work in the brain
once we 've done that , we want to look at how these drugs can be put to good use
' a previous brain scanning study was carried out by the same team on volunteers under the influence of the magic mushroom active ingredient psilocybin
it showed that the drug affected the brain 's ' hub structure ' and led to more connections between regions that are not normally linked
this , it is thought , may have a bearing on creative thinking
in may , the team is planning a study , funded by the medical research council , looking at how psilocybin might be helpful in treating depression .
