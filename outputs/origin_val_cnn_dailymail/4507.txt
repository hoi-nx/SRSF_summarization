where there is muck there really is brass with scientists claiming that millions can be made by extracting gold from human waste
in fact as well as gold , faeces contains platinum , silver and other metals along with rare elements such as palladium and vanadium
researchers now hope to ' mine ' sewage reducing the need to mine raw metals from the ground , while reducing pollution by recycling human waste
scientists have discovered a literal goldmine of precious metals in human poo.the americans researchers are investigating ways of flushing out the valuable minerals , including gold , silver and rare elements such as palladium and vanadium
pictured are microscopic gold - rich and lead - rich particles in human waste taking a lesson from industrial mining , the scientists are experimenting with chemicals called leachates that are used to pull metals out of rock
some of these chemicals have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment
but in controlled conditions , they could safely be used to recover metals from treated solid waste , dr smith claims
in the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum , silver and gold observing microscopic - sized metal particles in biosolids
previous research estimated the waste from one million americans could contain as much as $ 12 million ( Â£ 8.7 million ) worth of metals
in 1999 the britain produced over 1,130,000 tonnes of sludge dry solids , which averages to about 20kg generated by each person
if britain 's waste was mined it could be worth $ 762 million ( Â£ 510 million ) a year
dr smith of the geological survey said : ' if you can get rid of some of the nuisance metals that currently limit how much of these biosolids we can use on fields and forests , and at the same time recover valuable metals and other elements , that 's a win - win
' there are metals everywhere
they are in your hair care products , detergents , even nanoparticles that are put in socks to prevent bad odours
' yet all end up at the sewage works and many metals end up in the leftover solid waste
at treatment plants , wastewater goes through a series of physical , biological and chemical processes and the end products are treated water and biosolids
in the americans alone seven million tons are leftover each year with half used as fertiliser on fields and in forests and the other half incinerated or sent to landfills
dr smith added : ' we have a two - pronged approach
' in one part of the study , we are looking at removing some regulated metals from the biosolids that limit their use for land application
if britain 's waste was mined it could be worth $ 762 million ( Â£ 510 million ) a year
previous research estimated the waste from one million americans could contain as much as $ 12 million ( Â£ 8.7 million ) worth of metals
' in the other part of the project , we 're interested in collecting valuable metals that could be sold , including some of the more technologically important metals , such as vanadium and copper that are in cell phones , computers and alloys
' the study aims to use the same chemicals , called leachates , which the mining industry uses to pull metals out of rock
while some of these leachates have a bad reputation for damaging ecosystems when they leak or spill into the environment , in a controlled setting , they could safely be used to recover metals in treated solid waste
in the treated waste researchers already started to discover metals like platinum , silver and gold observing microscopic - sized metal particles in biosolids using a scanning electron microscope
' the gold we found was at the level of a minimal mineral deposit ' meaning if that amount were in rock , it might be commercially viable to mine it
dr smith added that ' the economic and technical feasibility of metal recovery from biosolids needs to be evaluated on a case - by - case basis
' the study presented at the 249th national meeting & exposition of the acs ( acs ) involved collecting samples from small towns in the rocky mountains , rural communities and big cities
for a more comprehensive picture , they plan to combine their information with many years ' worth of existing data collected by the environmental protection agency and other groups at the geological survey .
