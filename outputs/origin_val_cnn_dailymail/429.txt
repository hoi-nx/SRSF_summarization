when kyesha smith wood dropped her daughters off at a cinderella screening , she trusted they would be on their best behavior
but when they returned , her 16 - year - old son admitted his sisters had been rude and obnoxious to a mother inside the theater
he explained how the woman approached the girls at the end of the screening in bessemer , alabama , and told them her husband had just been laid off and it was the last time she would be taking her daughter to the movies for a while - and they had ruined it
a devastated wood tried to track down the woman , by sending out an apology on facebook and offered to pay for her next trip out of her children 's allowance
since the message was uploaded , her husband has received job offers and others have offered to fund the next visit
wood told al.com she was ' devastated and ashamed ' after learning of the way her girls behaved after boy tried to correct their behavior
so she took to social media in a bid to track her down
the lengthy facebook post read : ' this is a long shot , but i 'm looking for a woman that was at tannehill premier tonight seeing cinderella at 7pm
i dropped my teenage daughter , step daughter , and son off at the movie
' my son later told me , much to my humiliation and embarrassment , that my girls were rude and obnoxious during the movie
the woman i 'm looking for addressed them and asked them to be quiet and they were disrespectful
the woman in question rebecca boyd ( left and right ) got in touch with wood and said she was ' touched ' by how she cared about her children 's behavior
her husband has also received job offers following the publicity ' after the movie she approached my girls and told them that her husband had been laid off and this was the last movie she would be able to take her daughter to for a while and my girls ruined that for her
if you are this woman , please message me
' i can assure you that these girls are being strongly dealt with and appropriately punished
this rude , disrespectful , and awful behavior is unacceptable and they owe you an apology
' my husband and i are having them write your apology letter tonight and we would like to pay for your next movie and snacks out of their allowance
please message me if this is you
i apologize profusely for their disrespect
' after seeing the post , boyd said : ' i was touched that she cared how her kids behaved
you do n't see that a lot these days
despite all the attention wood insists the ' real hero ' in the situation is boyd , who she calls a ' great mom
' boyd added : ' [ i 've learned ] that as parents we need to support each other
the girls are not bad , they made bad choices
' i am overwhelmed by all the love and support ! this is something my daughter ashley and i will never forget
