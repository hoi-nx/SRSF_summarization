france has rejected imposing a ban on super-skinny fashion models - beause a law would risk discriminating against ' thin people ' in the workplace
left - wing mps had demanded six - month prison terms or fines of Â£ 60,000 for fashion bosses who ' glorify anorexia ' by hiring underweight girls
they had called for models to carry medical certificates showing their body mass index - calculated by dividing one 's weight in kilogrammes by the square of one 's height in metres
the ban was called for by a socialist politician who said prison sentences to be handed out to fashion bosses who employ them socialist politician olivier veran told france daily le parisien : ' it 's intolerable to promote malnutrition and to commercially exploit people who are endangering their own health
' a level of acceptable body mass index should be set and enforced
websites encouraging young girls to lose weight should also be banned
' but the nation 's parliament yesterday rejected the socialist mps amendment to france 's new health bill on the grounds that it would ' discriminate against jobseekers on the grounds of their weight '
mr olivier veran and fellow mps said they would now re-write their amendment in the hope of incorporating it into the bill , which will be debated again later this year
thin : olivier veran had demanded that all models be forced to present a certificate of good health before being allowed on the catwalk
france said such rules would risk discriminating against ' thin people ' there are now 40,000 people in france suffering from anorexia , around 90 per cent of whom are adolescents , according to the latest health ministry figures
france socialist politician olivier veran had led calls for a change in the rules over super-skinny models in norwegian , mps have proposed that images of airbrushed fashion models should come with a ' cigarette - packet ' style health warning in a bid to tackle eating disorders
one suggested text for the norwegian warning would read : ' this advertisement has been altered and presents an inaccurate image of how this model really looks
' spain has already barred models below a certain body mass index from the madrid fashion shows
italy has insisted on health certificates for fashion show participants
and brazil is considering demands to ban underage , underweight models from its catwalks
medical experts around the world have warned against the dangers of ultra-skinny catwalk models , and images airbrushed to make girls look thinner , which they say encourage anorexia in girls as young as six
fashion guru giorgio armani said two years ago that the fashion industry had a duty to ' work together against anorexia '
he added at the time : ' the industry has to recognise the link between its preference for abnormally thin models and the growth in eating disorders among young women
