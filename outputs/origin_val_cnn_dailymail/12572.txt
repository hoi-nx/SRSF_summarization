thanks to a rare quirk of nature , lucy is the alabaster - skinned redhead , and maria has their part - jamaican mother 's dark skin and hair
images of the lucy aylmer sisters of gloucester , uk , rocketed around the internet this week when a uk newspaper carried their story
" i ca n't stop crying ! this is all so amazing , " lucy aylmer posted on facebook
the girls were born to a white father and a biracial mom in 1997 , according to the daily mail story that started all the fuss
' no one ever believes we are twins , " the newspaper quoted lucy aylmer as saying
" even when we dress alike , we still do n't look like sisters , let alone twins
" appearing tuesday on " good morning britain , " the sisters said they 're always facing doubters who ca n't believe they are related , much less twin sisters
some even asked whether lucy was adopted , she told the show
" it was pretty hard , " she said
" it went on in secondary school as well , and it was n't very nice
" maria said they 've been told the chances of such an occurrence are " one in a million
" the bbc , reporting on a similar case in 2011 , said it was more like 1 in 500
no matter the odds , the sisters say they 're happy with how they look
" maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin -- and i 'm very proud of having a black twin , " lucy told the daily mail
" my family is beautiful , " she posted on facebook .
