cameron was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell - by date on his premiership yesterday as senior tories accused him of trying to anoint george osborne as his successor
downing street was struggling to contain the fallout from the prime minister âs extraordinary announcement that may âs general election will be his last
friends dismissed rumours that mr cameron âs wife , samantha , had asked him to make clear he would not seek a third term if re-elected , while mr cameron insisted he had simply given a â straight answer to a straight question â and that most people would think that was a â sensible â thing to do
â my entire focus is on the next 44 days and the general election that will decide which team runs the country for the next five years , â mr cameron said
but senior mps warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in no 10
it came as mr cameron was reminded of his comments to blair when the former premier announced he was handing over the reins to then - chancellor gordon brown mid-term
â your authority is draining away , â he told mr blair in the commons in january 2007
â the government ca nât plan
they are all waiting for the chancellor and not listening to you
â one former shadow minister said that by indicating he will depart in the next parliament , mr cameron appeared to be seeking to head off moves to oust him on may 8 if he falls short of a commons majority and tries to lead another coalition or a minority government
cameron has revealed he will stand down as prime minister before 2020 if he wins the next election senior mps warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in no 10

â the truth is he wo nât last five minutes , let alone five years , if he loses again
â there was particular consternation that mr cameron effectively fired the starting gun on a leadership contest by naming three potential successors : home secretary theresa may , london mayor boris johnson and mr george osborne , the chancellor
mrs may and mr boris johnson have long been seen the leading rivals to be the next tory leader , but mr cameron sparked frenzied speculation at westminster by including his name of mr george osborne , his closest ally
since his unpopular budget of 2012 , mr george osborne âs leadership prospects have been discounted by many
boris johnson boris johnson is the favourite among voters to succeed cameron , a poll reveals today
but the london mayor repeatedly refused to say whether he would join a leadership contest
chancellor george osborne is thought to be the prime minister âs preference to be his successor
but in a comres survey for the daily mail , mr boris johnson was backed by 31 per cent of voters , ahead of theresa may on 17 per cent and mr george osborne on 12 per cent
support for the mayor among tory voters was particularly strong â 36 per cent said he would make the best prime minister , mr george osborne was on 25 per cent and mrs may on 18 per cent
mr boris johnson âs strongest backing was among ukip supporters , at 44 per cent â suggesting he would do the best job of regaining support from the eurosceptic party
he was also backed by 32 per cent of labour voters , ahead of mrs may on 19 per cent , and the chancellor on 7 per cent
but in an lbc radio interview yesterday , mr boris johnson dodged questions about his ambitions more than a dozen times
he is bidding to return as an mp in may in the safe seat of uxbridge , but claimed mr cameron âs intervention was â no big deal â
â all he âs saying is i think obvious and common sense â¦ he does nât want to go on and on and on like mrs thatcher , â the mayor said
â to say he âs arrogant or presumptuous to rule [ out ] a third term seems to be totally bizarre because actually he âs being rather humble and rather straightforward and telling it like it is
â asked repeatedly if he would go for the party leadership , mr boris johnson said : â i ca nât possibly answer that because it âs a long way off
we probably do nât even know the identity of the next leader â¦ it is some baby , unborn
â mr george osborne praised mr cameron for giving â a direct answer â
mrs may is yet to comment
but the recent turnaround in his popularity as the economy improves has led many mps to reconsider
polls suggest mr george osborne has become the most popular conservative treasury spokesman since nigel lawson in 1987
â cameron has propelled george osborne into the top three , quite deliberately , â said one senior mp
â whether that helps george osborne or not remains to be seen
â another former minister said : â it âs not what he has said about timing â it âs the list of names
the parliamentary party does nât really want any of them
theresa may is a cold loner with a following of about two
george osborne has been a good chancellor of the exchequer , but people resent his coterie of apparatchiks and think he is ultimately unelectable
boris johnson is another bullingdon club boy who ignored parliament when he was last in it and lots of people think would be too risky
â mps also questioned how mr cameron could promise to serve a â full second term â when a new leader would need at least six months to establish themselves before the 2020 election
some allies of the prime minister , however , suggest he could step down as party leader , allowing a contest to take place some months before , while remaining prime minister right up until polling day
while this would be unprecedented in modern british political history , it would mirror the american system , where a president serves a fixed second term
former tory minister michael portillo described mr cameron âs announcement as â bizarre â
he told the bbc : â when you play chess you have to consider the next two moves , and i do nât think he did
there is no point setting off on this wild goose chase in the middle of an election campaign
â but defence secretary michael fallon defended the prime minister
â he made very clear he is standing for a full second term
what happens in 2020 really , i think , does nât bother a lot of people , â he said
â if he had said exactly the opposite â that he wanted to go on and on and he was nât prepared to answer the question when he was likely to finish â you âd have accused him , quite rightly , of arrogance and wanting term after term
â a snap poll by comres for the daily mail found voters are divided over mr cameron âs announcement
some 70 per cent believe mr cameron was â just being honest â , while 80 per cent say ten years is long enough for any prime minister to achieve their plans
four in ten said he had made himself a lame duck , but the majority â 59 per cent â disagreed
however , 70 per cent said he should be focusing on voters rather than his own job
four in ten think the next government would be destabilised by a tory leadership election .
