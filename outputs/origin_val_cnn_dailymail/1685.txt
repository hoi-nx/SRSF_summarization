a 20 - year - old air force satellite has exploded in space , adding 43 pieces of space junk to earth âs orbit , reports have claimed
the explosion happened on 3 february due to a sudden temperature spike , although the event has only just come to light
however , talking to mailonline , nasa and esa said the catastrophic event posed no significant risk to other satellites in earth orbit
a us air force satellite has exploded 500 miles above earth 's surface
an unknown ' temperature spike ' caused the explosion of the defense meteorologicalsatellite program flight 13 ( dmsp )
one of the series of satellites is illustrated here
this has resulted in 43 new pieces of debris in earth orbit the previously unknown incident was revealed by space news , after posing questions to air force space command
known as the defense meteorological satellite program flight 13 ( dmsp ) , it was launched back in 1995 and had remained in operation until now
since the first object , sputnik 1 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and hundreds of thousands more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites
one major source of debris in the past was a chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere
accidental events have also contributed to the problem
in 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a us communications satellite and a defunct russian military probe over siberia
some tentative solutions to clear up space junk have been suggested - such as using nets to scoop some up - but nothing has been tried so far
this made it the oldest continuously operational satellite in this particular series of satellites
exactly what has happened to the satellite , though , is still not clear , with the temperature spike remaining a mystery
air force space command said the power subsystem experienced ' a sudden spike in temperature '
this was followed by ' an unrecoverable loss of altitude control ' , before pieces of debris were then spotted in the vicinity of the satellite - suggesting it had partially exploded
part of the satellite still seems to be intact , however , as it is sending and receiving signals - although mailonline said it was ' unrecoverable '
speaking to mailonline , roake , chief of the current operations division at air force space command , said the fault was likely due to the satellite reaching the end of its operational life time
â a thermal spike can be caused by a variety of things from on board anomaly to space environment changes , â he said
â in this case we believe the satellite was wearing down
the satellite had already exceeded its design life three times over providing thousands of hours of weather imagery
â prior to the power failure , the satellite had already lost its primary mission capability and so it provided limited operational capability
â in addition , the satellite was still sufficiently intact to be sending and receiving signals from earth , although â operators determined that dmsp flight 13 had suffered damage to the power system rendering the satellite unrecoverable
' air force space command said the power subsystem experienced ' a sudden spike in temperature '
this was followed by ' an unrecoverable loss of altitude control ' , before pieces of debris were then spotted in the vicinity of the satellite - suggesting it had partially , or completely , exploded ( stock illustration shown ) six other dmsp satellites are in orbit , while a seventh is scheduled to launch in 2016
the air force played down the significance of the event , and said that the loss of the satellite - which had been retired to a back - up role - would not be detrimental to any of their operations
â because this satellite was no longer used by the national weather service or the air force weather agency , the impact of the loss of this satellite is minimal , â the air force told space news
â we anticipate real - time weather data for tactical users will be slightly reduced without this satellite , but its data was not being used for weather forecast modelling
â however , the main fear from such an event is the increase in the amount of debris into earth orbit
previous explosions in orbit , most notably the accidental collision of a us iridium satellite and a defunct cosmos satellite in 2009 , have released hundreds of pieces of debris into orbit
another notable event was a chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 , when they blew up one of their own satellites , which was widely condemned
this raises the risk of a collision in future , and even the iss occasionally has to perform manoeuvres to avoid space debris
there are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track ( illustration shown ) and hundreds of thousands more smaller ones that could do damage to human - carrying spaceships and valuable satellites
this latest explosion is not thought to pose a significant risk , though but speaking to mailonline , nasa and esa played down the risk of any potential issue
â if the reported fragment numbers are stable , then the event is not considered major , â said dr krag , head of esa âs space debris office
â what makes this event special is that the break - up obviously happened while the satellite was still operational
' dr krag noted that the explosion occurred above 500 miles ( 800km ) , where few other satellites were in orbit
indeed , esa âs closest mission is cryosat-2 , at an altitude of 450 miles ( 720km ) , so dr krag said they â do not expect any meaningful risk increase due to this event
â the dmsp programme is used to monitor meteorological , oceanographic and solar - terrestrial physics for the us department of defense
it is managed by air force space command , with on - orbit operarions provided by noaa

â we have collected additional measurements to more fully characterize the event , but the data has not been processed yet
â depending on what size you go down to , there are many thousands to millions of debris in orbit
this is a small increase to an existing risk to other spacecraft
â and mr roake noted that the satellite would gradually decay from its current orbit until it re-entered the atmosphere , so was unlikely to significantly contribute to the space junk problem .
