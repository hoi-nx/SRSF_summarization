speaking to abc news , kinlaw said ' it hit my heart ' when he found out his friend had been involved in the bloody arrest outside the trinity irish pub in charlottesville early on wednesday

he added that contrary to the officers ' suspicions , johnson did not have a fake id and had presented his real identification when a bar employee asked to see it
' now because the age on that id shows him to be 20 years old , i think that 's when dispute and discrepancies came in
' after being turned away from the bar and questioned by police , johnson was forced to the ground and pinned down
