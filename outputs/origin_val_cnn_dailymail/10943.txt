eight - time grand slam champion agassi believes usa men 's tennis has to ' regroup at grass roots level ' if it ever wants to boast a world number one again
the usa take on great britain in the davis cup in glasgow this weekend , hoping to avenge last year 's 3 - 1 defeat in san diego
world number five murray will lead the charge for great britain and goes into the first - round davis cup tie as the stand - out singles player , with usa 's isner and donald young ranked only 20th and 47th respectively
usa legend agassi ( pictured in 2009 ) says usa must ' regroup ' its grass roots tennis set - up world number five murray will lead the line for great britain at the davis cup this coming weekend usa 's donald young stretches to return a shot to ivo karlovic during the delray beach open on february 22 isner of the usa plays a backhand during his third - round match at the australian open 2015 it is a far cry from the days of agassi , who lifted the davis cup in 1990 , 1992 and 1995 alongside the likes of seven - time wimbledon champion pete sampras and four - time major winner jim courier
the last time usa produced a male grand slam winner was 2003 , when agassi won the australian open and andy roddick triumphed in flushing meadows
' being the next andy roddick or the next agassi will still leave you shy of winning tournaments these days
that 's the truth , ' agassi told press association sport
' will we ever have a number one player again ? that 's achievable , of course it is , but the four guys at the top now - roger federer , rafael nadal , novak djokovic and murray - they have redefined what this sport is all about over the last 10 years
' you need something unique these days to make inroads , especially growing up in a country that does n't have red clay courts
usa tennis great pete sampras won the wimbledon championship seven times during his career agassi has singled out switzerland 's roger federer as one of the ' four guys at the top now ' he has also placed serbia 's novak djokovic on that list , pictured here at the dubaio duty free championships spain 's rafael nadal returns a ball against argentine juan monaco during the final of the atp buenos aires ' i do n't know where murray spent his childhood playing ( he spent time in spain as a teenager ) but he plays the game like he was n't just playing indoors
' we do n't have that in usa
we have a lot of fast court players and the ones who do shine are the ones who bring a different equation
' isner , for example , is a monster , he 's 6ft 10 plus with a huge game , so we have to regroup at a grass roots level
' despite a shock defeat to 18 - year - old borna coric in dubai last week , murray will be expected to win both his singles matches in glasgow
that means the tie could depend on the doubles rubber , where murray and jamie are set to face usa twins bob and mike bryan , the most successful duo of all time
usa duo bob ( left ) and mike bryan are set to come up against great britain 's jamie and murray ' it 's a tough ask for both teams because there 's very little that separates it , ' agassi said
' we have a big advantage in our doubles but you guys have a huge advantage with murray
' people think he 's coming off a bad loss but i 've got news for you ; he 's going to be ready to go in a week and he 's going to be playing his best tennis in front of a home crowd
' i hope we can get over the finishing line and i 'll have my fingers crossed like the rest of us
' agassi has previously admitted an interest in a coaching career and is even considered a potential mentor for murray , who idolised the usa as a junior
' i enjoy the idea of coaching but i would n't physically , emotionally and mentally be able to do the job that i would want to do , ' agassi said
' you ca n't just step in and give advice
coaching is n't talking , it 's learning
' the things i say about murray are not going to be a surprise to him
' it 's finding out what that switch is , it 's getting them to see something a different way and you ca n't do that until you spend time and learn with them
' i ca n't commit the time now , even if i wanted to , i have too many responsibilities
' that does n't mean there would n't be a time in the future , but i ca n't do it at the moment
' agassi is tipping murray to recover from his shock loss to borna coric and perform well at the davis cup
