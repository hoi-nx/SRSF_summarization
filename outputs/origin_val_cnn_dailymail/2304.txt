president obama ordered the federal government on thursday to cut its emissions of greenhouse gases by 40 percent , as the u.s. seeks to spur other nations to get serious about climate change
obama 's executive order also directs the government to ramp up use of renewable energy sources to 30 percent of the federal government 's consumption
the white house said u.s. taxpayers could save up to $ 18 billion in electricity costs by reducing greenhouse gases 40 percent over the next decade , compared to 2008 levels
' these are ambitious goals , but we know they 're achievable goals , ' obama said at the energy department on thursday , where he toured a rooftop solar panel installation after signing the executive order at the white house
' these are ambitious goals , but we know they 're achievable goals , ' president obama said at the energy department on thursday after signing the executive order at the white house the white house said u.s. taxpayers could save up to $ 18 billion in electricity costs by reducing greenhouse gases 40 percent over the next decade , compared to 2008 levels
obama is pictured her giving the order major companies that sell to the federal government like ge , hp , northrup grumman and honeywell will also announce voluntary commitments to cut their own emissions of the heat - trapping gases blamed for global warming , the white house said
ibm , for example , said it will cut its energy consumption 35 percent by 2020 and buy at least 20 percent of its power from renewably sources by that year
the operator of an estimated 360,000 buildings and 650,000 vehicles , the federal government is the country 's single largest energy consumer
the department of defense alone is responsible for roughly half of that consumption , a senior administration official said
all told , the government pollution cuts along with industry contributions will have the effect of keeping 26 million metric tons of greenhouse gases out of the air by 2025 , or the equivalent of what about 5.5 million cars would pump out through their tailpipes in an average year , the white house said
deese , a senior adviser to obama , told reporters that the president 's mandate is a ' triple win ' for the environment , the economy , and the taxpayer
yet it was unclear exactly how either the government or private companies planned to meet its targets
' the potential from this announcement , ' deese said during a call with reporters , ' is significant both because we can drive substantial reductions across the entire federal footprint and because our efforts to do that leverage both innovation and investment in the private sector
' while at the energy department , obama also discussed the new emissions targets at a roundtable with federal suppliers that do more than $ 1 billion per year in business with the government
the u.s. government is responsible for only a small portion of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions , but the obama administration is hoping that taking aggressive steps at home will increase the political pressure on other countries to do the same
' certainly our hope is that we are laying forth template that other countries could also learn from and look at as well , ' deese noted

a major global climate treaty , in the works for years , is supposed to be finalized in december at a summit in paris , but most countries have yet to announce what their national contributions to the pact will be
earlier this month the european union unveiled its contribution , vowing to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent by 2030 , compared to 1990
the u.s. has yet to announce its contribution to the treaty
but in a bid to build momentum last year , obama set a u.s. goal to cut emissions up to 28 percent by 2025 â compared to 2005 levels â in a joint announcement with china that boosted hopes that an aggressive climate treaty may come to fruition
the president has n't fully explained how he 'll meet that goal , but his aides have suggested that unprecedented pollution limits he 's imposing on power plants will get the u.s. much of the way there
obama 's executive order directs the federal government to cut energy use in federal buildings 2.5 percent every year between 2015 and 2025 and reduce the amount of water used in federal buildings 2 percent every year through 2025
it also advises federal agencies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from government - owned vehicles by 30 percent per mile by 2025 , compared to the levels in 2014 , and put more hybrid and zero - emission vehicles in their fleets
additionally , it seeks to ensure federal agencies are getting 25 percent of their energy â both heat and electricity â from clean sources by 2025 .
