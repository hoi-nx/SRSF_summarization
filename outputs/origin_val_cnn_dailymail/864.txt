it was seen as one google 's highest profile failures , and forced the firm stop selling itsprototype wearable computer in a pair of glasses
however , google boss schmidt has confirmed that in fact the project is still going strong - and remains ' a big and very fundamental platform for google '
schmidt told wsj that it has been put under the control of fadell ' to make it ready for users
google dubbed the first set of several thousand glass users as ' explorers
' but , as the explorers hit the streets , they drew stares and jokes
some people viewed the device , capable of surreptitious video recording , as an obnoxious privacy intrusion , deriding the once - proud explorers as ' glassholes
' ' it looks super nerdy , ' said shevetank shah , a washington , dc - based consultant , whose glass now gathers dust in a drawer
' i 'm a card carrying nerd , but this was one card too many
' google stopped selling the first version of glass and shut its explorer in january , moving the project out of its google x research lab into a standalone unit
ivy remained head of the glass team but fadell , head of google 's nest connected home division , now oversees strategy for the project
cources claim fadell wants to redesign the headset from ' scratch ' and wo n't release it until ' it 's perfect '
' it is a big and very fundamental platform for google , ' schmidt told the wsj
' we ended the explorer program and the press conflated this into us canceling the whole project , which is n't true
' google is about taking risks and there 's nothing about adjusting glass that suggests we 're ending it
' he said glass , like google 's self - driving car , is a long - term project
' that 's like saying the self - driving car is a disappointment because it 's not driving me around now , ' he said
' these things take time

' an unnamed source added mr fadell ' is a product guy and he 's not going to release something until it 's perfect
' the previous glass headset was launched in a beta version under the firm 's explorer programme

' it 's hard to believe glass started as little more than a scuba mask attached to a laptop , ' the glass team said in a post on google+ last month
' we kept on it , and when it started to come together , we began the glass explorer program as a kind of ' open beta ' to hear what people had to say
' ' glass was in its infancy , and you took those very first steps and taught us how to walk
' well , we still have some work to do , but now we 're ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run

since the headset was unveiled in 2013 , the 41 - year - old was rarely seen without them
this fuelled rumours that google was looking to abandon the headset
