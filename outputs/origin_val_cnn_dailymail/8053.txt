if you 've ever wanted to have daniel craig 's steely gaze or angelina jolie 's sultry stare , a new laser treatment could be the answer
a californian company says it hopes to offer a $ 5,000 ( Â£ 3,400 ) medical procedure that can transform any eye colour to blue , permanently
the technique , which is currently undergoing clinical trials , works by using something known as ' scavenger cells ' to digest and remove the pigment from the iris surface
a specific laser frequency passes through the clear cornea of the eye , before it is selectively absorbed by the dark pigment covering the iris the procedure applies a computer - guided , low - energy laser to the iris to disrupt the brown pigment

this causes the body to ' initiate a natural and gradual tissue - removal process
once the tissue is removed , the patient 's natural blue eye is revealed , ' explains the website by removing the pigment , light can enter small fibres in the eye
when the light scatters , it only reflects back the shortest wavelengths , which appears blue
' under every brown eye is a blue eye , ' dr homer , chairman and chief scientific officer at stråma medical said
' the only difference between them is that a brown eye has a thin layer of pigment covering the blue iris

according to stråma medical , the process takes 30 seconds , and around two weeks eyes become blue
so far , 17 patients in mexico and 20 in costa rica have undergone the treatment
the company hopes to trial a total of 100 patients over the next few years

a californian company says it will soon be offering a $ 5,000 ( Â£ 3,400 ) medical procedure that can transform any eye colour to blue , permanently saj khan , an ophthalmologist at the london eye hospital , told cnn that the procedure could clog up the eye 's normal drainage channels
this can in turn cause the pressure inside the eye to go up , ' he said
' if that happens significantly enough , for long enough , it 's how patients develop glaucoma , ' he said
' we were concerned about this issue right from the start , so it was the first issue we tested and measured in our initial pre-clinical and clinical studies , ' the company wrote on their site
' thus far , pigmentary glaucoma has not proved to be a problem in our pre-clinical or clinical studies
' dr mark korolkiewicz , an optometrist and clinical services director at ultralase , a nationwide laser vision correction specialist , says that there are fundamental differences between the stroma laser procedure and corrective laser eye surgery

when the light scatters , it only reflects back the shortest wavelengths , which appears blue the basic rule of thumb is that as soon as you go inside the eye with a laser , you can cause more damage , â he says
â we only use lasers on the cornea , the surface of the eye
this new treatment involves using a laser inside the eye
â ' our procedure is limited to the treatment of stromal pigment , ' dr homer told dailymail.com
' it does not dislodge or even contact any of the the " iris pigment epithelium " or ipe on the back side of the iris
' in addition , our procedure does not actually remove any pigment
' the proof , as they say , is in the pudding
we are now well into our clinical trials , and thus far , there has been no intraocular pressure increase in any subject
' but it may be the moral question which gives people most pause for thought
dr homer , who has jewish roots himself , rejects he is promoting blue eyes over brown
â i âve heard the eugenics remark a few times , but i do nât understand it
is the charge that there is something racist about giving people the option to have blue eyes ? â
