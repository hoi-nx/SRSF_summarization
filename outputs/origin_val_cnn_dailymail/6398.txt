a left - wing â super-union â with almost 1.8million members could be created by a controversial merger of labour âs biggest donor unite and the biggest civil service union after the election , senior conservatives fear
they warn that a merger between the public and commercial services union ( pcs ) and the unite union would threaten the impartiality of whitehall
half of all civil servants are members of the pcs , which is not currently politically affiliated
if the two unions merged , they would effectively be subsumed into a union which is labour âs biggest financial supporter
unite , which has donated millions to labour since ed miliband became leader of the party , could be set to merge with the public and commercial services union unite is at least five times larger than pcs , which claims a membership of 270,000
unite , which has made Â£ 14.3million in donations to labour since ed miliband became leader in 2010 , has 1.42million members
a conservative source said : â a takeover of pcs by labour âs biggest donor , unite , would make over half of all civil servants members of a labour - affiliated union
â pcs and unite must come clean about their secret plans
no takeover can be permitted to imperil the perceived impartiality of the civil service
â the pcs has been in financial difficulty following cuts to the civil service , as well as an end to a system where government departments automatically deducted union dues from the payroll
a leaked document suggests it plans to sell its headquarters to a private equity fund and suspend national elections for this year
the union blames its financial crisis on the downsizing of the civil service , now a fifth smaller than it was in 2010
the end of the â check off system â , which saw union fees deducted automatically from salaries by many government departments has also squeezed the pcs mps have warned a left - wing merger between the pcs ( unite protest pictured ) would threaten the impartiality of whitehall cabinet office minister francis maude has overseen the closure of this scheme at the home office , department for work and pensions , hmrc , the ministry of justice and the ministry of defence
in addition , the government has clamped down on so - called â facility time â , whereby union officials are paid by the taxpayer to work for a union
the overall cost of such taxpayer - subsidised union officials has fallen by more than two - thirds , while the number of full - time union officials paid for by the public purse has fallen from over 200 to fewer than ten
last year , the pcs discussed the possibility of a merger with unite at its annual conference , but the idea was shelved
a source at the pcs played down the prospect of the deal with unite being revived , saying : â it âs no secret that we had informal discussions
these proposals were never driven by finances
our conference voted against a motion from the national executive saying we should carry on exploring it , and said we should set more formal conditions
so it âs not on the horizon
â unite âs general secretary len mccluskey suggested last year there would be â no further progress â on merger talks with the pcs unless it changed its membership rules
hinting at the reasons for the breakdown of talks , he told delegates â our rules do nât change , our structures do nât change â
pcs members apparently insisted they would not back a new relationship with unite if their union membership fees contributed to labour coffers .
