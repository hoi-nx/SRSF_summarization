consumers may be eager to get their hands on samsung âs galaxy s6 edge with its curved screen
but a report hints that the south korean firm is already working on its next - level displays for a fully foldable smartphone
unlike the curved models available now , such as the s6 edge and lg âs flex 2 , samsung 's galaxy s7 could be flexible and bendy
a report hints that a fully foldable smartphone by samsung could be ready as soon as next year
this image shows prototype curved screens unveiled last year a spokesman for samsung display told business korea : â the industry believes that the commercialisation of foldable smartphones will be possible in 2016
â a number of the curved screens , including those created by lg and samsung , use high molecular substance - based polyimide film
this forms the backplane of the flexible panel and is used as an alternative to plastic
the material makes it possible to achieve the maximum curvature radius , which in semiconductor energy laboratroy 's display is 0.7 - inches ( 2mm )
polyimide film also helped reduce the thickness of the panel to significantly improve its flexibility
however , until other components such as batteries and processors are made to be flexible too , the dream of a roll - up smartphone will remain on the horizon
it is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment , as bendy displays could have many uses , such as in smartbands and laptops , for example
a spokesman from the industry said : â when flexible display technology is being used in e-books and laptops , which are substituted for publications , the concept of tiny portable pcs and e-books will be realised in reality
â rumours that samsung was working on a bendable and virtually unbreakable version of its galaxy handset first surfaced in 2012
the false rumour said that the handset , codenamed ' project j ' could be released in april 2013
last year , lg demonstrated a 5.9 - inch display that can be bent more than 100,000 times without being damaged , at an exhibition in tokyo
it is not only smartphones set to get the flexible treatment , as bendy displays could have many uses , such as in smartbands ( illustrated ) and laptops , for example the foldable display is made of layers of lights using organic light emitting diodes ( oled )
it features touch sensors , meaning it works as a touchscreen at all angles and curvatures , and was demonstrated at the display innovation exhibition in yokohama
in july , lg unveiled an 18 - inch screen that can be rolled up and it hopes to expand the technology to work with 60 - inch displays in the future
earlier this month , samsung revealed its next generation of galaxy phones , including the galaxy s6 edge , which features a curved 5.1 inch display
on the s6 edge , notifications appear on either the right or left - hand side , depending on which hand the owner uses
up to five contacts can be programmed to appear on this edge , and each contact is assigned a colour
earlier this month , samsung revealed its next generation of galaxy phones , including the galaxy s6 edge ( pictured ) , which features a curved 5.1 inch display to access a contact , users swipe the relevant colour and this reveals recent interactions and details about that person
conversely , swiping the long edge of the screen shows the time , weather or other customised notifications
and when the phone is placed face down , the edge glows to show a phone call , text or email has been received
if these messages are from a saved contact , the edge will glow the relevant colour
plus the curved screen increases the viewing width and height of videos and photos to make them appear 3d
both the 6 edge and the galaxy 6 have metal cases and are the first to feature dual - standard wireless charging technology built inside the handsets
people will need to pay extra for a samsung non-slip wireless charger , but because it supports other standards both phones will work with any compatible charging dock
this image also shows the curvature of the phone 's screen david kang , vice president of online at samsung mobile , told mailonline : ' we 've created not only what 's next for the industry but set a new standard for smartphones
' ' we believe consumers and business alike will be impressed by the design but equally they 'll be taken by the power and performance
' what we 've accomplished is an elegant balance between design and technology
' the s6 edge and s6 edge will be available from 10 april in colours white pearl , black sapphire
the s6 edge will additionally be available in green emerald .
