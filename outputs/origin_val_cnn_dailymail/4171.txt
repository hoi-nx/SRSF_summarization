it is a measure of arsenal âs progress that fixtures like these no longer end in boos and angry recrimination
as the final whistle approached , the crowd at the emirates were unusually vocal , anticipating trips to wembley and singing praise of their team
earlier it had the feel of one of the afternoons with which we have become so familiar in recent years , one of those days when arsenal break world records for possessions stats but come up against an inspired goalkeeper and end the day with fans furious at their manager , the board of directors and life in general
but with giroud in exceptional form , aaron ramsey also outstanding and ozil thriving against the kind of opposition he relishes , arsenal eventually cantered to victory in some style
giroud leaps in the air after opening the scoring in arsenal 's 3 - 0 premier league victory over west ham the france international gives arsenal the lead on the stroke of half time with his sixth goal in his last seven games aaron ramsey is chased by santi cazorla after doubling arsenal 's lead in the closing stages of the second half giroud gives substitute mathieu flamini a pat on the back after the frenchman seals victory with a late strike arsenal : ospina 6.5 , chambers 7 , per mertesacker 6.5 , koscielny 6.5 , monreal 7 , aaron ramsey 7 , coquelin 7 , walcott 6 ( santi cazorla 6.5 ) , ozil 7 ( mathieu flamini 6.5 ) , sanchez 6 ( danny welbeck 6.5 ) , giroud 8.5 subs : szczesny , gibbs , akpom , bellerin scorers : giroud 45 , aaron ramsey 81 , mathieu flamini 84 booked : sanchez west ham : arian 8 , joey o'brien 6.5 , kouyate 6.5 , cresswell 7 , stewart downing 6 , mark noble 6 ( nene 6 ) , song 6.5 , kevin nolan 6 , matt jarvis 6.5 ( amalfitano 6 ) , diafra sakho 6.5 subs : demel , jã¤ã¤skelã¤inen , poyet , cullen , onariase booked : diafra sakho man of the match : giroud referee : chris foy / anthony taylor click here for all the stats , including giroud 's heat map from our superb match zone better measures of their real progress remain , of course
on tuesday night they visit monaco where you might anticipate another glorious comeback which ultimately ends in failure
then there will be the league table at the end of the season which will likely tell the tale of an opportunity missed to challenge for the title
arsene wenger conceded that , even with chelsea still to come to the emirates , arsenal are not yet in the title race
â not at the moment , â he said
â but we can just keep going
we won eight of the last nine
we are stronger today than we were at the start of the season
â we suffered a lot from the world cup , where the players came back
what is for sure is that they understand each other much better than six or seven months ago and that makes everyone more dangerous
â at least arsenal are not going backwards these days ; the problem may be that they are nât moving forwards fast enough but they are at least pointing in the right direction
west ham defender collins ( left ) was fortunate not to concede an early penalty after brining down walcott the arsenal winger crashes to the turf under collins ' challenge but was not awarded a spot kick west ham forward diafra sakho ( centre ) tries to evade arsenal defenders koscielny and per mertesacker ( left ) arsenal playmaker ozil ( left ) uses his silky skills to bring the ball down in front of stewart downing ( centre ) and mark noble arsenal 's leading scorer sanchez ( centre ) uses his trickery to escape the attentions of joey o'brien west ham keeper adrian threatened to spoil arsenal 's afternoon with a succession of fine first half saves west ham manager sam allardyce looked as though he understood as much and had settled for one of those afternoons when he aims to â out - tactic â the opposition
you could hardly blame him given the resources at his disposal , with enner valencia and james tomkins the latest additions to his injury list and carl jenkinson ineligible
kevin nolan almost shocked arsenal with a clean strike on 23 minutes but at half - time , arsenal had 74 per cent of the possession
at times it looked as if west ham goalkeeper adrian was has having one of those inspired afternoon
it was later revealed he was playing with a dislocated finger sustained in the warm up , a fact which made his performance truly heroic
â he âs been a brave lad , â said assistant manager neil mcdonald
walcott was having a less satisfactory time
thrust back in for his first start in more than a month , he did little to help his ongoing contract talks
three times he was presented with the opportunity to open the scoring ; three times he spurned the chances
gunners defender calum chambers closes down west ham winger matt jarvis as arsenal take control song and koscielny compete for the ball in an aerial duel as the sun shines at the emirates west ham manager sam allardyce lets his feelings of frustration be known from the sidelines he could plead mitigation for the first effort on six minutes
a delightful back heel from giroud set him up with just adrian to beat , but collins came through the man and the ball to prevent him scoring
it might have been a penalty but it was walcott âs own hesitation in front of goal which had presented collins with the chance to launch his saving tackle
adrian would then make excellent saves from sanchez âs header on 16 minutes and from an improvised touch of the knee from aaron ramsey on 32 minutes , before walcott received his next chance
played in by a delightful aaron ramsey pass , he took a touch , looked up and struck his shot directly at the goalkeeper.adrian denied sanchez from a half volley and on 44 minutes he pushed away a strike from ozil , which landed at walcott âs feet , yards from goal but he skewed the ball high and wide , appearing to lose his balance
ozil reacts after west ham keeper adrian pulls off one of a succession of first half saves frenchman giroud gets his shot away despite being surrounded by four west ham players the gunners centre forward watches as the ball sails towards the left corner of west ham 's goal adrian , who had previously kept west ham in the game with a series of fine saves , dives in vain towards giroud 's shot giroud was on hand to provide deliverance just before half - time
aaron ramsey and ozil exchanged a delicate one - two , but such is the frenchman âs confidence these days , he nicked it off aaron ramsey âs foot , took a touch and drove a fine finish into the far corner of the net
â it was fantastic because of the combination and the finishing
it was the kind of goal we loved to score , â said arsene wenger
it was his 14th goal of the season in 24 games
that monaco game aside , he is having an excellent season and since that dismal night , he has responded incredibly well
after being criticised for missing chances against monaco , giroud holds his hands to his ears to soak up the applause giroud strikes a pose midway through his celebration as arsenal take the lead at the emirates walcott , who had several chances to open the first half scoring himself , leaps on giroud 's back in celebration â it âs one of his strengths , â said arsene wenger , who called his performance â outstanding â
having set out to defend in numbers , a change of strategy was necessary for west ham and they were equal to the challenge
they came out in the second - half with an entirely different mindset , pushing arsenal back into their half and searching for an equaliser
in terms of clear - cut chances there was still little â matt jarvis â curling cross which ospina spilled and almost let in sakho was one unsettling moment
but arsenal were no longer able to play as they wished
still , their time would come
on 80 minutes , giroud dummied a throw - in to let in aaron ramsey , who played in the frenchman
he returned the ball to aaron ramsey , who drove it past adrian to cap a fine a performance of growing authority
three minutes later santi cazorla , on as a substitute , exchanged passes with giroud and planted a cross almost on the foot of mathieu flamini , who had the simplest task of converting from close range for the third goal
