mcilroy fired three successive bogeys late in his third round at the arnold palmer invitational here at bay hill on saturday to ruin a charge through the field
world no 1 mcilroy had closed to within one of the lead when he dropped shots at the 14th , 15th and 16th to finish the day seven adrift of tournament pace - setter henrik stenson
mcilroy said afterwards he still hoped to push himself into contention with a fast start on sunday but admitted victory in his final tune - up before the masters was now unlikely
mcilroy plays out of a bunker on the 11th hole during the third round of the arnold palmer invitational the world no 1 , pictured playing his approach to the green on the sixth , carded a one - under - par 71 mcilroy is seven shots behind leader henrik stenson after bogeying three holes in a row on the back nine ' everything was going really well for 13 holes , ' mcilroy said , ' and i got myself right into the tournament
then i had a messy three holes
it would have been nice to have been a little bit closer to the lead
' mcilroy was not too dismayed by his late hiccup
he has worn the air this week of a man intent on saving his best for the masters , which starts at augusta in less than three weeks
so mcilroy chatted a little about ireland 's win in the six nations and opened his eyes wide when he heard how close england had come to getting the final try they needed
he will try to close the gap to henrik stenson and then spend the next fortnight honing his game in private
henrik stenson sits on top of the leaderboard after a second consecutive round of 66 on saturday henrik stenson , pictured after hit his drive on the eighth hole , has a two - shot advantage heading into the final round everything is about the build - up to augusta where mcilroy will attempt to join a select group of the greats of the game by winning the only major that has eluded him
victory would lift him into the company of gene sarazen , ben hogan , gary player , jack nicklaus , and tiger woods who all won the masters , the us open , the open and the uspga at least once in their careers
' i have pretty much got what i wanted out of the week so far , ' mcilroy said
' it has highlighted a couple of things i need to work on and that 's what i will do in the next couple of weeks
' mcilroy , pictured lining up a putt on the 10th green , will prepare for the masters in the coming weeks the 25 - year - old is looking to complete a career grand slam with victory at augusta next month one of the reasons mcilroy played bay hill was because he wanted to replicate his routine from 2011 when he had a fortnight off before the masters and led the field before collapsing on the back nine
' it worked pretty well at augusta , at least for 63 holes , ' he said
mcilroy dined with palmer , 85 , on thursday night , soaking up his wisdom and listening to tales of the way golf used to be
at the start of next month , he will be seeking to make some history of his own .
