' stephen espinoza says tyson-lewis , mayweather-canelo did not generate anywhere near the excitement that mayweather-pacquiao has done so far
he says that pacquiao has been always been high on mayweather 's list and that the first fight did n't happen in 2009 because of the infamous drug - testing clause
bob arum talking about the importance of this fight - which he says the whole world will be watching
he says ' it is a credit to the sport of boxing ' that this fight is happening

mayweather now walking on to the stage to join pacquiao ... and he 's walking out to ' we will rock you ' it is pacquiao to come first on to the stage ... ladies and gentleman , boys and girls , let 's get ready to rumble
after all the talk and hype , finally the two fighters are about to come on stage
apparently , mayweather made Â£ 2,500 in his first pro-fight when he beat roberto apodaca
on may 2 he will earn a little bit more than that
no wonder he is smiling ... the reel of highlights continues , with the audience now treated to pacquiao 's dominant performance against oscar de la hoya in 2008 - a fight that turned pacquiao into a superstar
ok , now we are back to mayweather and his unanimous points win over juan manual marques back in 2009
the money man knocked down his opponent in the second round and dominated the fight from start to end
ok , now it is the turn to relive one of pacquiao 's greatest moments
his destruction of miguel cotto in 2009
as we wait for the fighters , we are treated to re-run of mayweather 's 2001 fight with diego corrales and specifically the seventh round , when mayweather knocked down his opponent three times in a fight he would go to win with a tko in round 10
ken hersham , the head of hbo , who will also be showing the fight in the states , says this fight will ' transcend boxing ' and that may 2 ' will be very special ' and worth the wait
let 's hope so ... stephen espinoza , the head of show time , who will be showing the fight in the states , says he knew the fight would happen when mayweather and pacquiao meet at the miami heat basketball game and cleared the air

pacquiao , bob arum and freddie roach are deep in discussion on the red carpet
i wonder if bob arum is asking over pacquiao and freddie roach plan to stop the undefeated mayweather on may 2 ? pacquiao , as is his way , looks relaxed and calm
may be because his training seems to be going so well
the 36 - year - old has been keeping his fans up to date with his progress

pacquiao has certainly made the effort for today - shades and all ! pacquiao and freddie roach have been full of confidence ahead of the may 2 fight - maybe it is because they 've got a secret sparring partner from mayweather 's camp - and they certainly look relaxed as they pose for pictures
