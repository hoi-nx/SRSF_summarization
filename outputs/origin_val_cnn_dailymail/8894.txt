england have been beaten by italy at the last two major tournaments but benitez , who has worked in serie a. for the past two seasons , insists english players are not inferior
wayne rooney celebrates after scoring against lithuania in the euro 2016 qualifier at wembley on friday roy hodgson watches on as his side made it five wins from five in group e ' i can see from outside that you have enough quality and enough potential to do well , ' the former liverpool and chelsea boss was quoted as saying in the mirror
' i am convinced you can do well
england will be contenders at euro 2016 because of the level of the players
' england have very good players â a lot of them could play in serie a. it is just about finding a way that they can stick together
napoli manager benitez ( right ) thinks england will be contenders to win euro 2016 in france benitez spent six years managing liverpool ( above ) and had a short spell in charge of chelsea ' the understanding between them can be much better
but if you talk about potential , if you talk about quality , you have enough quality in england
' meanwhile , benitez , who won the champions league with liverpool and europa league with chelsea , has backed premier league clubs to bounce back from their disappointing campaigns in europe this season , but claims italian sides are tactically better
for me it is cyclical - they will be there next year , ' he said
' some europe clubs are getting stronger , like psg and atletico madrid , but the premier league will be also stronger in the years to come
england were beaten by italy at the world cup last summer thanks to a mario balotelli header england were also knocked out of euro 2012 by the italian on penalties ' the italian clubs know how to compete , that is the reason why they progress in europe this year
they are quite aware of the tactics
they work together with different tactics and different systems so they know what to do
' but i do n't see england or the english players worse than them technically
' physically and technically they are at the same level
tactically , obviously , the advantage of italy is that they have been for years doing a tactical game
