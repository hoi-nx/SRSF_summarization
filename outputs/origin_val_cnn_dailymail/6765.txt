the husband of a critically ill grandmother who died after being plunged into the icy north sea during a bungled cruise ship rescue has hit out at the justice system after he was paid less than Â£ 13,000 compensation
richardson , 72 , was tipped into the water wearing just her nightdress as crew members tried to transfer her to a lifeboat on a stretcher during the rescue
passengers shrieked in horror as the pensioner fought to stay afloat for up to eight minutes without a life jacket as crew tried to save her from the icy 2c waters
richardson , 72 , ( picture left with husband george ) died three weeks after being accidentally tipped into icy water as crew members onboard a cruise ship tried to transfer her to a lifeboat after she was taken ill passengers shrieked in horror as the pensioner fought to stay afloat for eight minutes without a life jacket she was eventually pulled to safety using a long pole but died in hospital three weeks later from complications
now widower george , 82 , has condemned the justice system after he was paid just Â£ 12,980 plus Â£ 7,000 other payments for the tragedy
and he says he has never received an apology from the cruise operators for the catastophe which was a â significant contributory factor ' in the death of his wife
mr richardson , a retired farmer , said : â it âs a disgrace i have never received any apology
' the whole so - called rescue was a fiasco
' they should never have used a lifeboat in those conditions , instead they should have used a helicopter , even experts agree
â and then not to tether the boats together in those seas was simply ridiculous
i just ca nât believe they did nât take simple precautions
â mrs richardson ( pictured in water ) was eventually pulled to safety but died in hospital three weeks later mr richardson , of penrith , who was married to richardson for 30 years , said : â i received less than Â£ 20,000 in total because my wife had pre-existing health problems but the trauma of being plunged into icy water definitely hastened her death
â justice has not been served
the penalty for those that did this is tiny compared to the nightmare i have suffered
â mrs richardson and her husband had been on a cruise to see the northern lights on board ocean countess when she suffered a gastro - intestinal haemorrhage in march 2011
the liner was off the coast of norwegian and the captain decided she was so ill she would need to be transferred to a hospital immediately
crew members strapped her to a stretcher with a blanket and tried to pass her to a team on a lifeboat which had pulled up beside the ship
but the two boats , which were travelling side - by - side at 10 knots , were not tethered together and began to move apart at the crucial moment , plunging mrs richardson into the sea
one witness , colin prescott , told a later inquest : â i saw the stretcher hit the side of the vessel
mrs richardson went one way and the stretcher went the other
â mrs richardson was treated in norwegian before being airlifted back to the uk
her husband kept a bedside vigil until her death on april 21
mrs richardson was being moved from the cruise ship to a rescue boat on a stretcher when she was dropped because mrs richardson suffered from cirrhosis of the liver , high blood pressure and was an insulin - dependent diabetic prior to the cruise and because she later died of natural causes the compensation payment was restricted
the grandmother of eight was 18st and had a history of ill - health but her inquest heard that fighting for her life in freezing temperatures may have significantly contributed to her death
the ocean countess was owned by cruise and maritime voyages ( cmv ) at the time but caught fire near greece in 2013 and has since been sold for scrap
joanne berry , solicitor at slater and gordon , said mr richardson had received the maximum bereavement damages of Â£ 12,980 plus added payments
she said : â the current law is not fair to families and we fully support a national campaign to review the level of bereavement damages for families in these situations
â chris coates of cmv said a full and final settlement was offered to mr richardson by the ship âs owners and insurer âs for the norwegian search and rescue service
he said : â the company maintained close contact with mr richardson following the incident conveying our sympathies and offering support
