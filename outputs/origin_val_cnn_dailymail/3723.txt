suspended : dr adam osborne was suspended by the general medical council two weeks ago amid sex with patient allegations , and has now stepped down as director of the company he owns with his wife the psychiatrist brother of chancellor george osborne has resigned from his private medical company , leaving it with assets of just Â£ 551
dr adam osborne , 38 , was suspended by the general medical council two weeks ago pending an investigation into allegations he had a two - year sexual affair with a vulnerable woman patient â a married mother of two with psychiatric issues
now he has stepped down as a director of elitemed , the private company he co-owns with his wife noor , a plastic surgeon
the company recently filed accounts which showed it was worth just Â£ 551 , had Â£ 71 in the bank and owed creditors Â£ 7,337
documents also revealed noor , 37 , who was previously secretary of the company , took over as the sole director
the couple each own 50 per cent of the company , but general medical council rules mean adam osborne can not practise as a doctor until an investigation into the allegations is concluded
if they are upheld he could be struck off , although the general medical council says the current suspension is not an indication of guilt
another firm called devonport psychiatry , which was registered to adam osborne âs west london home , appears to have had its 0845 number disconnected since the mail on sunday revealed he had been suspended by the general medical council
he has also taken down his personal website
elitemed was set up in 2010 shortly after adam osborne was suspended over earlier claims which centred on his relationship with a cocaine - addicted prostitute
at the time , the general medical council said his â relationship â with the woman had â clouded his judgment â and led him to prescribe anti-psychotic drugs , dishonestly use a false name and fail to inform her gp
the doctor was also disciplined for prescribing contraceptive pills to noor â who was then his girlfriend â and an anti-smoking drug to a family member
adam osborne married noor in a muslim ceremony in 2009 after he had converted to islam and changed his first name to mohammed
a news report about his conversion was last year hidden by google after a request from an unknown person following a controversial â right to be forgotten â ruling in the european court of justice
this gave people the right to have â no longer relevant â items removed from internet searches
probe : george osborne 's brother can not practise as a doctor until the investigation is concluded adam osborne is the youngest brother of the chancellor and one of four sons born to sir peter osborne â who co-founded wallpaper company osborne & little
after studying medicine at manchester university , he became a junior doctor at the city âs wythenshawe hospital , a job he was forced to quit after the allegations of handing out falsified prescriptions
he went on to practise as a private psychiatrist in marylebone , central london .
