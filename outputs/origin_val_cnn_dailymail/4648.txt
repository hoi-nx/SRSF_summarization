' i loved sunbathing all my life and now i am so worried about sun damage so i always wear a tinted moisturiser with an spf in and some cream bronzer and pastel eyeshadow for a natural sunkissed look
' aside from fashion and beauty , fitness is one of millie 's passions and she 's a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle she preaches
whilst she 's confident enough posting videos of her squatting , boxing and participating in the oh - so - fashionable but gruelling sbc class , there 's one class millie is afraid of trying
' i really want to try this music video dance class at frame studios but i am too embarrassed

if that was n't enough , she 's hoping to expand her eyelash range next year , is already working on her autumn / winter 15 collection and has some exciting health and fitness projects in the pipeline
