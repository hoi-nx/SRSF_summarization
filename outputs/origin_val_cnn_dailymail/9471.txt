it seems tattoos on models no longer carry the stigma they once did
in fact , a tattooed model is becoming the norm for high fashion both on the catwalks and in front of the camera
and fashion photographer christian believes the tattooed model will reign supreme in the future
he set his sites on the tattoo community , using his experience as a successful photographer to help bring ' alternative ' to the mainstream and his new book tattoo super models celebrates this alternative kind of beauty
the compendium documents his work from 2007 - 2015 , what he describes as his seminal years as a tattoo photographer
the women featured have incredible bodies , but it is the intricate artwork etched onto them that makes them interesting
a brunette shows off her head - to - toe designs as she poses in a cut - out swimsuit and striped sun hat
and a pouty blonde displays dozens of colourful designs on her arms , stomach and thighs whilst a vampy redhead shows off two ' sleeves ' of sketches

pictured here , hattie watson his book tattoo super models , featuring women like seventy jane , celebrates an alternative kind of beauty christian told the mailonline : ' there âs something about tattoos that remind me of beautiful lingerie , the way the beautiful artwork hugs the human form
' i think people are realising that tattoos are not that different from fashion itself
their artwork is as much of who they are as the clothes they wear
' i first started in 1993 , while working on a personal project
but it was difficult finding tattooed models back then
' all of these models [ cara , kate , jordan ] have tattoos but are not â tattoo models â
they are hired in spite of their tattoos not because of them
rick genest , on the other hand , has made a career in the fashion industry from his tattoos
christian told the mailonline : ' there âs something about tattoos that remind me of beautiful lingerie , the way the beautiful artwork hugs the human form ' i hope tattooed models wo n't completely take over the runways
diversity is what makes the world interesting
i do hope that one day everyone can be who they want to be without prejudice or labels , ' he added
' in my book , ironically enough , i wanted to use my skills in advertising , celebrity and fashion photography to bring the tattoo sub culture to forefront , creating super models from women that were once viewed as â alternative â
