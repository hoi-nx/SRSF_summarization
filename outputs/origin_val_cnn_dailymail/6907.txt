a single house peeks out of a swirl of mist , soft morning sunlight bathes a hillside in pink and orange light , heavy fog turns the landscape ghostly green
in these ethereal images poland photographer marcin sobas captures the unreal world of early morning in two of europe 's most beautiful regions

this mountain glade in the beskid mountains in poland is bathed in ethereal greenish light in marcin sobas 's picture every single picture tells a different story where the light and conditions are the main characters such as these rolling tuscany hills shrounded in mist the first rays of sunlight turns the clouds pink and the land orange in marcin sobas 's image of this village in the beskid mountains in poland the top of a hillside emerges like an island from a sea of mist from this picture taken in poland 's beskid mountains he said : ' it âs a compilation of pictures which were taken in poland and italy during several sunrises
the main themes are the houses , huts and villages because i am fascinated by such views and landscapes

people who live in these houses slept tight in the darkness of mists
' marcin sobas , who lives in silesia in poland , works in it but his real passion is landscape photography and capturing the charms of nature

his favourite themes are light and weather and the way in which they interplay to make familiar landscapes seem strange and unreal
he said : ' ever since i can remember i have always been sensitive for the charms of nature
i believe this is originating from my father who was also the one who gifted me a compact camera
a wooden hut peaks out of a grey landscape in this photograph from the beskid mountains his favourite themes are light and weather and the way in which they interplay to make familiar landscapes seem strange and unreal ' this was the very moment that have initiated my adventure with photography
the next key milestone was the purchase of a professional dslr camera , from that moment on i started to take photography for serious â and in a much more conscious way
it has become my greatest passion
' i specialise in landscape photography
my favorite themes are rolling farmlands , foggy mornings in the mountains and by the lakes
when he was taking these pictures he stood higher than these poland houses and was enjoying the sunlight
people who live in these houses slept tight in the darkness of mists the red windows of this tiny poland cottage stand out against the sea of grey and white ' i do my best to have every single picture to tell a different story where the light and conditions are the main characters
# ' these two factors make the world look extreme and unreal at various times of a day and year
in the future i plan to check myself also in other areas like birds and wildlife photography which i find fascinating
' i hope that at some point of time i will manage to fulfill my greatest dream which is visiting all earth âs continents
