this is where the election will be won for labour and that is why i am making a donation to all 106 campaigns
' as one of our key seat candidates you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face , but i have every confidence that with your drive , determination and organisational skills , you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government
