louis van gaal arrived at his press conference on thursday apologising for still being in what he called his ' work clothes '
that , however , transpired to the least of his worries
soon after , he was embroiled in what we can politely describe as a lively exchange about the nature of his relationship with his assistant ryan giggs
pictures of a rather underwhelmed ryan giggs at st james ' park on wednesday and some quotes from his old friend paul scholes had given weight earlier in the day to some recent chatter about the manchester united icon 's thoughts on van gaal 's style of play and indeed his own future
louis van gaal was not best pleased after his relationship with ryan giggs was questioned ryan giggs did not respond to van gaal 's in - your - face celebrations after manchester united 's late win against newcastle the manchester united boss gave a tetchy press conference ahead of monday 's fa cup clash with arsenal and then there was the jonny evans issue
caught on film spitting towards the ground during a clash with newcastle centre forward papiss cisse , the manchester united central defender now stands accused â rightly or wrongly - of one of the most frowned upon acts in sport
all in all , it was another challenging day at the office for manchester united 's manager
no wonder his mood was rather spiky
' no , we have a very bad relationship , ' said van gaal of ryan giggs , rather sarcastically
' i 'm very irritated because of this question
' everyone can see we have a very good relationship and work very hard together , not only ryan giggs but all the staff and players
' this [ your question ] is a way of suggesting things
' so now i am very irritated and i take my message against the media
' i think 90 per cent [ of everything you say ] is not happening
' van gaal and ryan giggs share their views during the premier league clash with the magpies on wednesday ashley young wheels away after scoring a late winner to keep manchester united in the chase for a top four finish the former holland manager laughs from the dugout at st james ' park while his no 2 remains stony faced ryan giggs ( 2nd left ) did not appear to join in his manager 's celebrations after manchester united 's late victory at newcastle images of ryan giggs failing to join van gaal 's celebrations after ashley young 's 89th minute goal at st james park on wednesday were certainly peculiar
so , too , were quotes from paul scholes on tv before kick - off
' there 's no doubt , he had that little taste of it for the last three weeks of last year and he definitely wants to be a manager , ' paul scholes told bt sport
' you can see that
over the next two or three years , will he have the patience to be a no 2 for that long ? i 'm not sure he will
' ryan giggs is reportedly angry after former team - mate paul scholes ( right ) questioned his contentment at manchester united ryan giggs is understood to have been non-plussed by moyes ' style of play at manchester united the manchester united icon took charge at old trafford for the final games of last season following moyes ' sacking ryan giggs and paul scholes worked together at manchester united when the former was handed the reins last season in the wake of moyes ' sacking
former team - mates , they know each other very well
nevertheless , it is understood that ryan giggs views his friend 's comments as unhelpful and is furious that anyone should voice doubts about his relationship with van gaal
it is not hard to wonder , though , what ryan giggs does make of the dutch coach 's style
ryan giggs grew frustrated at moyes ' reluctance to play on the front foot last season and immediately sought to change it during his spell as interim manager last april and may
ryan giggs instinctively went back to what he emotively called ' the manchester united way '
so have things improved that much this season ? it is hard to say that they have
for now , though , manchester united fans will listen to van gaal 's words and learn of ryan giggs ' irritation and perhaps be soothed
if performances pick up - starting with a home fa cup tie with arsenal on monday - then the subject will be allowed to melt away
manchester united defender jonny evans ( left ) and papiss cisse have been charged with spitting during the game â having woken up this morning i am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night âs match
i would like to make it clear that i did not spit at papiss cisse
â i was totally unaware of any spitting incident and had assumed that the issue at the time was with the challenge and his attempted retaliation to the tackle from the floor
during the game papiss cisse and i spoke about the incident and it is clear by my reaction in the television footage that i was totally surprised by any suggestion of spitting
â it is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something i have ever done or would ever do
it is certainly not something that i did last night
â the games he could miss for united : arsenal ( h ) , monday ; tottenham ( h ) , march 15 ; liverpool ( a ) , march 22 ; aston villa ( h ) , april 4 ; man city ( h ) april 12 ; chelsea ( a ) april 18
jonny evans and papiss cisse were both caught on camera appearing to spit at each other on wednesday night â i have apologies to make to a lot of people today
firstly to my team - mates and to our supporters , secondly to jonny evans , and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and jonny evans
â i reacted to something i found very unpleasant
sometimes it is hard not to react , particularly in the heat of the moment
i have always tried hard to be a positive role model , especially for our young fans , and yesterday i let you down
â i hope children out there playing football for their clubs and schools this weekend will know better than to retaliate when they are angry
perhaps when they see the problem it now causes me and my team they will be able to learn from my mistake , not copy it
â the games he âll miss for newcastle : everton ( a ) , march 15 ; arsenal ( h ) , march 21 ; sunderland ( a ) , april 5 ; liverpool ( a ) , april 13 ; tottenham ( h ) , april 19 ; swansea ( h ) , april 25 ; leicester ( a ) , may 2
papiss cisse has accepted a possible seven - game ban while jonny evans has until 6pm on friday february 6 to respond as for jonny evans , he will clearly tell the fa cup that he did n't mean to spit at cisse on wednesday but may still be fortunate to escape a ban of six games
footage would appear to be inconclusive and it is easy to sympathise with the irishman 's claim in a statement on thursday that he was not spitting at his opponent
his manager clearly believes him , too , but whether the fa cup will feel they can prove the case against one player - papiss cisse - and not the other will perhaps worry van gaal as he contemplates playing much of the remainder of the season without his centre half
' of course i 've spoken with jonny evans , ' said the manchester united manager
' it is like what i said in the press conference after match that he was not aware he was spitting
' and when he was spitting on the ground , maybe it 's a natural thing from a human being
' i think it was not his intention and that i said already
' i can not imagine that jonny evans could do that
' and he has said this also so i believe him
' so for me the matter has done
' manchester united will renew their rivalry with arsenal when van gaal takes on arsene wenger in the fa cup quarter - final with monday 's game at old trafford so important to manchester united in terms of their chances of not only winning a trophy but also of finding the required confidence to take in to some tough premier league fixtures , van gaal may have hoped for a rather less eventful build - up
amid it all , at least he can cling to results
manchester united remain fourth in the premier league and , somehow , on course for the champions league qualification that was stated as a pre-requisite at the start of the season
criticism has been a constant companion throughout his time in england and , indeed , during previous spells in holland and spain
it is partly because of this that it was surprising to see him so irked
he is usually a little more phlegmatic
one imagines that passage to the last four of the fa cup on monday night would put much of it right .
