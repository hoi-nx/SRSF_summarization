kevin streelman , ernst , ryan moore and henrik stenson were also on five under , ernst having got to eight under at one point with a run of five birdies before dropping three shots in his final five holes
brendon de jonge posted a solid round of 69 to take the lead on the second day at the valspar championship de jonge began on the 10th and dropped a shot on the par - five 14th where he had holed from 126 - yards for eagle on thursday , before a birdie on 18 saw him turn level
another birdie followed on the first before a bogey on the sixth and two further birdies on the seventh and ninth , with de jonge admitting the wind was making life difficult
' it 's tricky out there , ' he told www.pgatour.com
' it 's one of those golf courses where it 's tough enough to get it on the fairway when it 's still and when the wind blows it 's added difficulty
' it 's difficult to pick it out there
it gets in these tress and swirls around so you 've got to try and stay patient as best you can
' jordan spieth registered seven birdies and three bogeys on his way round , while henrik stenson opened with an eagle but could not maintain his momentum as he signed for a 70
jordan spieth shot the lowest round of the day , a 67 , in difficult conditions , to sit in joint second place ian poulter was then in the group at four under alongside ricky barnes , lucas glover and sean o'hair
ian poulter started on the back nine and got himself to six under at the turn with birdies on 12,14 and 18 before back - to - back bogeys at five and six saw him slip back into the pack
but the englishman is feeling confident for the weekend and believes the layout at copperhead suits his game
' solid play , ' he told sky sports 4
' this golf course is a good golf course for me - it 's short , it 's tricky
it 's not about hitting driver off every tee - it 's about positional play
' he added : ' it 's about putting it in to play to set up your second shot
the greens are small but undulating
' the wind has now picked up and that 's playing tricky and i 've done a good job putting it in play and giving myself plenty of chances
' ian poulter was reasonably pleased with his performance which saw him two off the lead after two rounds another englishman who is feeling better about his game is luke donald after shooting a 68 on friday which left him two under
the former world number one has seen his form desert him in the past couple of years and his last pga tour win came here in 2012 but , after finishing in a tie for seventh at the honda , he feels he is getting closer to his best
' it 's been a while , ' he said
' i had a chance at honda a couple of weeks ago
i need to keep giving myself chances and keep putting myself back into contention again
' i think once i keep doing that and getting the juices flowing and feeling it again then hopefully the results will come
