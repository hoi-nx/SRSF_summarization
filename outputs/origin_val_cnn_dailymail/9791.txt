running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past
ford has unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining , it bases its predictions on your unique driving style
the myford mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house
the app was announced at mobile world congress in barcelona and currently works with a selection of ford âs electric and hybrid cars
smart car : to check their driving range , drivers open the app and add their location and destination it specifically suits electric cars because the app can directly link to the battery to see a status level and accurate mileage
but ford spokesman abraham phillip told mailonline the team is working on developing the software for petrol and diesel range
however , he could nât give a timeframe for this because it depends on the technology being integrated , and legislation in individual markets
for example , due to emission restrictions in the eu users ca nât use the myford mobile app to remotely start their car , but they can in the us
similar restrictions may apply for the fuel management feature
cos : the myford mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house ( ford 's focus electric , pictured ) the app uses a traffic light system to show if the journey is possible , or at least how far the driver can travel before needing to charge their car using a map ( screenshots of app pictured ) to check their driving range , drivers open the app and add their location and destination
the app uses a traffic light system to show if the journey is possible , or at least how far the driver can travel before needing to charge their car using a map
this map also shows the nearest charging stations , including their price
the first vehicles to offer myford mobile in europe will be the focus electric , available in spring 2015
now available in europe , the focus electric is powered by an electric motor and lithium - ion battery powertrain that achieves a top speed of 85mph ( 137 km / h )
the 6.6 kw onboard charger has a driving range of 62 miles ( 100km ) with two to three hours charging , and around 93 miles ( 150 km ) driving range with three to four hours charging from a 32 a charging station
* it additionally has sync 2 voice control with touchscreen to let drivers programme charging times , and set a chosen cabin temperature for when they start the journey , from within the car
myford mobile is also available for the c-max energi plug - in electric hybrid vehicle
to learn a driver âs habits the app determines how far they have travelled within a certain time to gauge speed but also how often they braked , based on distances travelled , and when they accelerated significantly
the driver is then rated on a scale from â zippy â to â zen â
to be more fuel efficient , the driver needs to be at the latter end of the scale
but if they âre not , the app offers tips such as releasing the accelerator or braking less heavily
the trends screen additionally shows miles , or kilometres driven , and how much co2 has been saved
taking inspiration from gaming and personal fitness apps , myford mobile shows co2 savings as exercise balls , or hot - air balloons to reflect how much could be used to fill each
in terms of the â remote preparation â features , the driver can set the cabin to warm up or cool down at a set time each day , or set the precise temperature
as well as informing drivers when they have made co2 savings , alerts also let drivers know when they have reached certain zero - emission distance benchmarks , such as covering a distance equivalent to one round - the - world trip
this is shown as an achievement figure
and if the driver ca nât remember where they parked the car , the app will pinpoint its location on a map
the first vehicles to offer myford mobile in europe will be the focus electric , which also has sync 2 voice - activated controls , available in spring 2015
myford mobile is also available for the c-max energi plug - in electric hybrid vehicle
more vehicles will be announced later this year
