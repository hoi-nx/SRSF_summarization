of all the players manchester city might have expected to drive the final nail into their champions league coffin rakitic was a long way down the list , but it was the former sevilla midfielder who got the goal on wednesday night
here mailsport takes a closer look at the croatian midfielder more than proving his worth in his first season at the nou camp
rakitic superbly lifts the ball over the on - rushing hart to give barcelona the lead against manchester city rakitic loops the ball over hart and past vincent kompany to earn barcelona a 1 - 0 lead at the nou camp when he signed in the summer what was the reaction ? there was no hysteria but it was considered a welcome addition for two reasons â firstly they need midfielders after selling cesc fabregas to chelsea and thiago to bayern munich , and second rakitic was , along with his fellow countryman modric , the best midfielder in la liga last season
is he an improvement on the aforementioned cesc fabregas and thiago ? thiago has the potential to be the best of the three but appalling luck with injuries has stalled his career
is rakitic better than cesc fabregas ? probably not but he has many of the same characteristics so that has made him a worthy replacement
the croatia international challenges for the ball with manchester city midfielder james milner rakitic was brought to barcelona from sevilla for Â£ 14million to replace cesc fabregas , who joined chelsea and those characteristics are ? he is versatile in as much as he can play behind the striker and score goals as he did regularly for his former club sevilla and he can play deep in front of the centre - back as he also did , although less so for his former team , and as he did for barcelona last saturday away at eibar
much like his compatriot at real madrid modric , he can tackle , pass , and shoot
he âs a very complete midfielder
who brought him to spain ? sevilla signed him from schalke for â¬ 2.5m
it was another work of genius from the club âs sporting director monchi because within a very short space of time it was clear rakitic was destined for bigger things and would make the club a tidy profit
rakitic ( laying down on left of trophy ) captained sevilla to europa league glory in 2014 rakitic was born in swiss but plays international football for croatia did he consider england ? his wife , raquel mauri , is a hairdresser from sevilla , and so he preferred to stay in spain
when barcelona came calling it was a no - brainer
he was close to going to chelsea as a 16 - year - old but his father advised him to move to schalke instead
the language was not going to be a problem wherever he went because the swiss born croatian international speaks five languages
and his battle with modric will be one to look out for on sunday ? it will
and even more so because rakitic was denied the chance to face his international team - mate in the first clasico of the season because he was left out of the starting eleven
rakitic is mobbed by his barcelona team - mates after opening the scoring against manchester city on wednesday midfielder rakitic is joined in celebration by lionel messi , luis suarez and neymar jnr how did that work out for luis enrique ? badly
many had tipped the coach to resist the temptation of giving luis suarez his debut after so long out , move andres iniesta forward to the front three and bring in xavi alongside rakitic
instead luis enrique dropped rakitic despite the fact that he had been playing well and lined xavi up alongside andres iniesta
â they are great players but they are not getting any younger , â paul clement told me after the game
barcelona started well but lost control of midfielder and ultimately the match
without rakitic they were completely out - run in the middle of the park
when he is at his best , he is their engine
now he âs back in the team for good ? he did nât start against malaga and barcelona lost 1 - 0
he then played and scored against granada
he is becoming a leader on the pitch and has bought into the ideas of sacrifice and generosity at barcelona having been very much the talisman of the team at sevilla
when he scored against grandada he approached the bench to dedicate the goal to his best pal in the dressing room â the german keeper marc-andre ter stegen and he even said of luis enrique : â he knows what he is doing , we have to trust in him
