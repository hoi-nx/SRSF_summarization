the end of " jinx , " the six - part hbo documentary about real estate heir durst , has launched a debate about whether some potentially incriminating statements durst made while in the bathroom to a microphone may be used in his criminal prosecution
durst , as you probably heard , is charged with murder in a killing in california 15 years ago , and he has been suspected , but never charged , in the disappearance of his first wife in new york
whether or not the taped words of an accused person will be admissible against him involves a look at the rules of evidence and the u.s. constitution , as well as our fast - evolving ideas about privacy
while durst 's attorneys can make a number of arguments to suppress these statements and bar their admission at trial , the bathroom confessions will likely be factored in
let 's go over three main reasons why : 1
is this inadmissible hearsay ? probably not
hearsay is defined as a statement made outside of court that is offered in court for its truth
it really just means a witness ca n't testify at trial about someone else 's version of the facts
if a sentence starts with " he told me " or " she said that , " it 's probably hearsay
as general proposition , hearsay is supposed to be inadmissible , but the exceptions nearly swallow the rule itself -- so much so that many commentators have suggested abolishment of the exception - riddled rule itself
perhaps the largest and best known category of hearsay exceptions is admissions and confessions
these can be admitted against a defendant
why ? well , the idea is that these statements are reliable
the thinking is that people do n't ordinarily confess to something unless they did it
is this a violation of durst 's constitutional privilege against self - incrimination ? again , probably not
the rules of the u.s. constitution are a different matter
the fifth amendment 's self - incrimination clause states that " [ n ] o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ... " by definition then , compulsory self - incrimination requires , well , " compulsion
" and not just any compulsion
the kind of compulsion targeted by the fifth amendment is governmental coercion
durst may still contend that his " confession " was n't voluntary
it 's true that confessions deemed " involuntary " are often excluded at trial under the due process clause of the 14th amendment
however , a confession will only be considered involuntary if it is the product of police activity
voluntariness is not an issue when admissions are made to a private person , such as a journalist
what of durst 's likely claim that the filmmakers were essentially acting as an arm of the police ? sometimes law enforcement exercises so much control over a civilian that his private actions become police action , constitutionally speaking
this is not an easy case for a defendant to make , though
durst would have to establish that the hbo interviewers were direct agents of the police and that the interview was coerced by police
the police undoubtedly benefited from the work of these citizen documentarians
but the police frequently benefit from the work of good samaritans or citizens volunteering information , photos or iphone videos
the television show " america 's most wanted " has been premised on this idea for decades
given the defendant 's burden here , it 's unlikely that he can convince a judge that , in light of all the circumstances , filmmakers acted as an instrument or agent of police
the bottom line is this : a voluntary confession must be the product of a rational intellect and a free will , not physical intimidation or psychological pressure
how was durst " pressured " when alone in the bathroom ? however , his attorneys might argue that some mental impairment rendered him incapable of the necessary rational intellect and free will
can durst argue for some " reasonable expectation of privacy " that was violated by his being taped in the bathroom ? not in our modern world , and not in this case
perhaps in decades past , a court might be offended at an audio recording of someone in the bathroom , but things have changed
subjects of documentaries and reality tv stars alike routinely sign contracts allowing camera crews to pin a microphone to their lapels and follow them around 24 hours a day
moreover , everyone in the television news business has a story about some famous correspondent going to the bathroom and forgetting about their " hot " mic
in this brave new media world , the rule appears to be : you wear a lavalier microphone at your own risk
this is why defense attorneys tell clients to not give interviews
no matter how good an interviewee a client may be , audio and video editors have an uncanny knack for isolating the less than flattering sound bites
admitting to killing " them all " would fall into this category
when it comes to giving interviews , it 's probably better for defendants such as durst to keep silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt , especially doubt of the reasonable kind .
