' the club will also cooperate fully with the fa
there will be no further comment until all inquiries are complete
â the national lead officer for football policing questioned the scheduling of the match , which kicked off at 5.30pm
' saturday night football is here to stay , we appreciate that , friday night football is due to be coming in , ' he told bbc
' when you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play
all games have potential ( for crowd trouble ) but clearly some games have more potential than others
' they are big clubs , not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture , late on a weekend in particular , alcohol is a factor
' if you give people four , five , six hours more drinking time , do n't be surprised if in a highly - charged atmosphere , their behaviour is n't good
villa fans leap over hoardings at full - time , and the decision to play the game at 5.30pm is being questioned west brom goalkeeper boaz myhill is mocked by an aston villa fan following the home side 's second goal ' if you 're looking at whether alcohol was a factor , there was disorder at a public house near the ground before the game , people being arrested coming into the ground for being drunk and disorderly , being drunk seeking entry to a football ground
' if you looked at the people who came onto the pitch , a few of them looked like they were worse for wear from some substance and i do n't think there is any coincidence that where there 's alcohol involved , people 's behaviour tends to deteriorate
' he added : ' i do think there is an issue here for the broadcasters because that game was scheduled for a 5.30 kick - off to meet the bbc 's scheduling
' broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously
' what we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately
if you look at the four games for the fa cup quarter - finals this week , you could n't probably have picked a worse one to have on a saturday tea - time than a local derby between two big clubs
' the west brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full - time whistle scorer scott sinclair ( second left ) is mobbed by a fan and team - mates ashley westwood and jack grealish aston villa issued an apology for their fans ' behaviour while west brom vowed to take a ' zero tolerance ' approach after promising to co-operate fully with the fa inquiry
and west brom boss pulis has called for a lifetime ban for any of the club 's fans who were found to be responsible for throwing seats
' if that was the situation , and they 've got cctv cameras up there , those supporters should never come into another football ground
it is like people coming into someone else 's house - you have to show respect
' west brom forward callum mcmanaman is escorted off the field after a row with an aston villa fan the pitch at villa park can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass pulis was also concerned about the ease with which spectators were able to get on to the pitch
he added : ' i am old enough to have seen isolated incidents happen like that
i do n't want to have a go and take anything away from what happened on the pitch and what happened in the game
' if one thing , aston villa should look at the stewarding because with a game at this time of night , 5.30pm , you need to police it properly , and i am sure aston villa will look at it
