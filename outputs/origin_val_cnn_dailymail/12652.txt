" women , poor people , people of color , people with disabilities , immigrants , gay men , lesbians , bisexuals , trans people , intersex people : we have been pitted against each other and made to feel like there are limited seats at the table for those of us who fall into the category of ' other , ' " she said
" as others , we are taught that to be successful , we must reject those other others , or we will never belong
" she also challenged black people who do n't support gay marriage to resist " messages of hate
" " we ca n't say that we believe in each other 's fundamental humanity and then turn a blind eye to the reality of each others ' existence and the truth of each other 's hearts
and we must be allies in this business because to be represented is to be humanized
and as long as anyone , anywhere is being made to feel less human , our very definition of humanity is at stake and we are all vulnerable
