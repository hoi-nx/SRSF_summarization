one is a former high school cornerback who also loves baseball
the other is a football fan who also played competitive golf
the two university of oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common
they 're both under fire since the nine - second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks
in it , students at the now - disbanded sigma alpha epsilon fraternity clap , pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching
school officials have expelled parker rice and levi pettit because of their alleged " leadership role " in the racist chant
here 's what we know about the two students : parker rice , 19 , was raised in dallas , where he recently graduated from jesuit college preparatory school
in high school , he was an avid sportsman , and he played cornerback on the football team , in addition to baseball , the dallas morning news reported
his father , bob rice , is a real estate agent in dallas , where he volunteers for various organizations , including a baseball league and the local ymca , according to the newspaper
earlier this year , a sibling of the younger parker rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper
in the article , the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together
parker rice has apologized for the video , calling his actions wrong and reckless
" i made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same , " he said in a statement tuesday
his family has fled their home , where protesters gathered wednesday
they 've also wiped out their social media accounts
as the university tries to heal after days of controversy , some are rallying to parker rice 's defense
lopez , a friend and fellow student at the university , said the video is not a reflection of who he is
" that video does not represent his core personality , " lopez said
" unfortunately though , as things are , that might define him for a while
but it does not define him personally , i feel
" lopez described him as a " charismatic , good person , with a good soul and a good spirit " who experienced a lapse in judgment
" his behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times , when the fraternity was made , which obviously were n't the most tolerant times , " lopez said
the second student expelled , levi pettit does not have much of a digital footprint
what appears to be his now deleted twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football
levi pettit played golf at his alma mater , highland park high school , the dallas morning news reported
in a statement , his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to african - americans , students and university faculty
" he is a good boy , but what we saw in those videos is disgusting , " brody and susan pettit said
" while it may be difficult for those who only know levi pettit from the video to understand , we know his heart , and he is not a racist
" cnn has reached out to both students but has not heard back from parker rice
a spokesman for the levi pettit family declined cnn 's request for an interview .
