the gunman was later shot to death by the sergeant - at - arms of the house of commons just steps from where canadian 's prime minister and members of parliament were meeting prime minister harper called it a terror attack and the bloodshed raised fears canadian was suffering reprisals for joining the us - led air campaign against islamic state extremists in iraq
rcmp commissioner paulson said he believes zehaf-bibeau was influenced by others and that the investigation is ongoing
he said : ' i would n't characterize it as network as it is commonly understood but i am persuaded that he was influenced by other individuals toward these crimes so in that sense i am of the view that others were involved
' paulson said anybody who aided zehaf-bibeau in the attack will be charged with terrorism offenses , according to the cbc
he said : ' it 's not relevant to us , or our investigation , what kind of terrorist zehaf-bibeau was , or if he was a particularly intelligent , sophisticated , influential or personally disciplined terrorist
' to us , it all turns on the evidence we collect which we compare against the statute
' what was he doing and why was he doing it ? ' rcmp commissioner paulson said zehaf-bibeau was likely influenced by others a photo released by the rcmp shows the .30 - 30 winchester model 94 rifle used by zehaf-bibeau in october more than 130 full - time investigators and staff from the rcmp are working on the case
other details from the investigation were also made public
police revealed zehaf-bibeau used the internet and payphones to stay in contact with people in ottawa and in british columbia
police have identified some of these individuals
the autopsy toxicology report showed zehaf-bibeau , who struggled with crack addiction , was n't under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack
the evidence also ' does not speak to any mental health issues '
the gunman , who also held libyan citizenship , became increasingly aligned with terrorist ideology in recent years while living in british columbia and alberta
rcmp intervention teams responded to the shooting after gunfire was heard zehaf-bibeau , who had a crack problem , was n't under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack zehaf-bibeau was involved with shootings at the war memorial and at the parliament
police initially thought there was a shooting at the rideau centre mall , but have since said that was not the case when zehaf-bibeau was killed in parliament , he had a long knife tied to his wrist
he had toured the main parliament building while posing as a tourist a couple of weeks before the attack
the attack in ottawa came two days after a man described as an ' isil - inspired terrorist ' ran over two soldiers in a parking lot in quebec , killing one and injuring the other before being shot to death by police
the man had been under surveillance by canadian authorities , who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to turkey
unlike the attacker in the quebec case , zehaf-bibeau was not being watched by authorities
