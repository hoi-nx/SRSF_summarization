nicky morgan said young people were facing ' unimaginable ' pressure from threats such as revenge porn and cyberbullying teachers are to be issued new guidance this week to help children cope with the â unimaginable â pressures of the modern digital age , including cyberbullying , sexting and â revenge porn â
education secretary nicky morgan said last night that personal , social and health ( pshe ) lessons needed to be improved â and placed at the heart of the curriculum â to give young people the tools to cope with these growing demands
children will also be taught about consensual sex to help vulnerable girls â spot , report and tackle abuse â
mrs morgan , addressing the conservative think - tank , bright blue , said the new guidance will be published later this week , in conjunction with the pshe association
she added : â let âs be clear , the internet and advance of the digital age are things to celebrate and to embrace
but let us not deny they bring new pressures that require new responses
â the pressures young people face today were unimaginable to my generation
â mrs morgan highlighted research that showed two in three 11 to 16 - year - olds reported having friends who had been bullied online
she said the bullying can take many forms but there were increasing incidents of abuse , sexting and so - called â revenge porn â
she added : â the evidence base is still small but in a survey conducted last year , just eight police forces reported 150 allegations relating to revenge porn over a two - year period
â explaining the focus on teaching about sexual consent , mrs morgan said : â in this modern world where many young women , and for that matter many young men , are exposed to so many pressures day in and day out , surely we have a duty to make sure they know they can say no and know how to do it
â it does mean telling young people the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship , about when something crosses the line , what they can do about it
â ms morgan said lessons on how to deal with these new online threats , in addition to teching on safe realtionships , needed to be made ' central ' to the curriculum ( file image ) â if the revelations of recent weeks have shown us anything it âs that the stakes are too high to let our young people leave school without this knowledge
â i do nât pretend for one minute that lessons on consent would have been enough to stop the horrific abuse in rotherham or oxford
' but i will not rest until i know that we have done everything we can to arm young women and particularly the most vulnerable young women with the information they need to spot , report and tackle abuse
â mrs morgan said she was concerned that children were growing up in a world that places â huge value on style and arguably not always as much value on substance â
she added : â the democratisation of communications opens the world up but brought its own pressures too
' in research conducted at the start of this year , a third of 11 to 16 - year - olds said they felt the pressure to update their social media profiles with pictures or postings that make them look good
â it has already been revealed that schools are to teach pupils as young as 11 about rape and consensual sex .
