miller claims she was told women should ' stay at home in the kitchen ' during her time working at tonbridge school , kent a school lab technician claims she was verbally abused and humiliated while working at one of the country 's top boarding schools where she overheard a pupil say women should ' stay at home in the kitchen '
miller , 38 , worked as a laboratory technician in the tonbridge school physics department from january 2005 to june 2014
in one instance , she said a pupil 's comment that ' women should n't be in science , they should stay at home in the kitchen ' was laughed off by another teacher
she also claims to have been left feeling isolated and was paid less than a male counterpart during her nine years in the job
the Â£ 35,000 - a - year private boarding school in kent , whose former pupils include members of the band keane and author frederick forsythe , caters for 780 boys aged between 13 and 18 years
at an employment tribunal in ashford , kent , miss miller spoke of an incident on september 24 , 2013
in her statement she said : ' on walking into a classroom taught by one of the physics masters i overheard the comment that " women should n't be in science , they should stay at home in the kitchen "
' i thought initially that it was the master , dr chalk , who had said this although he told me later that it was a pupil
' dr chalk tried to laugh the comment off but the class clearly enjoyed this comment which seemed to be at my expense and acted in an unruly manner
' i felt absolutely humiliated and isolated
dr chalk did not appear to be disappointed in his class for their behaviour
' the pupil was asked to apologise to me at a later date but this was not an isolated incident
pupils would trip me up , slam doors in my face and behave in an abusive and aggressive manner toward me
' i have been shouted at in front of pupils and told to f * * * off by students
i have never witnessed this sort of behaviour toward any male member of staff
' she added in the statement that some years ago , a physics teacher stated in her presence in his classroom ' you should never have women in physics , i would never hire one '
miss miller added she made complaints which fell on deaf ears and was worried she was being ' over sensitive ' and taking ' banter ' too seriously
the technician said she felt ' insulted and bullied ' by the bursar after he declared her stress was down to her personal life and financial difficulties , which was not true
she added : ' since leaving my job at tonbridge school and despite my income dropping considerably i have not been suffering with stress at all and have not needed to visit the doctor or take any medication for stress
' it is clear that my stress was caused by my work at tonbridge school
' she claims another technician in the same role as her , mr newlands , received more money than her despite doing the same jobs and joining the school months after she did
but tonbridge school said mr newlands was more qualified and started his job as a qualified technician whereas miss miller started as a trainee technician
tonbridge school ( pictured ) , in kent , is one of the country 's top boarding schools and commands Â£ 35,000 - a - year fees headteacher timothy haynes said it was ' unfortunate ' miss miller felt she had to resign from her position it was also stated that miss miller was only working on a part - time basis , therefore receiving less money
miss miller received Â£ 14.50per hour and cancelled her contract on june 4 last year
mr newlands ' salary was not heard
he stated that his relationship with miss miller was good and they were ' comfortable around each other in work and in social settings '
in a statement , headteacher timothy haynes said : ' it was unfortunate that the claimant felt she had to resign from her position and i know that the bursar and other colleagues had been hoping to resolve the situation with her so that she could return to her role
' whilst i did not know her well and had not had any dealing of substance with her i was aware that she had been a valued member of the sciences team and would have been welcomed back had she not resigned
' miss miller is claiming sexual discrimination , constructive dismissal and equal pay
the tribunal , which is expected to last two days , continues .
