man city had long since been knocked out of the champions league by the time the decision was taken to sack mancini in the spring of 2013
european football was not the italian âs speciality
however , as manuel pellegrini looks for a result to save his team âs season , other similarities between the reign of man city âs current coach and the final , faltering weeks of his predecessor âs are strikingly relevant
certainly the two men are different
manuel pellegrini is placid , mancini explosive
manuel pellegrini is considered by some at man city to be rather too nice while mancini made enemies at every level
but , although manuel pellegrini may beg to differ , the warnings for the chilean are to be found using football âs most fundamental barometer : results
manuel pellegrini is fighting to save his man city job and needs a good result in barcelona man city are looking to overturn a 2 - 1 first - leg deficit in the nou camp mancini âs final year at man city saw a premier league title win , a summer of faltering efforts in the transfer market and a subsequent championship defence in which his team âs levels dropped to the extent that they ended the 2012 - 13 season some way short of a rival â united â who did not have to be imperious to beat them into second
sound familiar ? two years on and again man city have failed to build on success
they have bought modestly , played well only sporadically and look destined to trail another less - than - convincing rival â this time it âs chelsea â by some distance by the time they reach the finishing post
did united win the title two years ago or did man city simply fail to defend it properly ? perhaps a bit of both
can we say the same again this time round ? almost certainly
talk to people at man city and they will stress that mancini was not sacked because he failed to win a second league title
he was dismissed because man city had failed to move forwards in europe and because his style of management was , they feared , about to rip holes in the fabric of the club
nevertheless , the similarities between what should have been mancini âs consolidation season and this one are clear and that is why manuel pellegrini has every reason to feel anxious ahead of a mammoth task at the nou camp
on tuesday at man city âs hotel by the port , manuel pellegrini was in denial mode once again
â i do nât think my seat is in danger , â he said
man city 's premier league title challenge suffered a further blow with defeat at burnley manuel pellegrini finds himself in a similar position to mancini before the italian was sacked mancini left man city after a failed premier league title defence and another dismal season in europe nevertheless , in the first leg of this tie at the etihad stadium three weeks ago we saw far too much of what is wrong with the modern man city and not enough of what is right
haphazard at the back , weak in midfield and mentally suspect by their own admission , manuel pellegrini âs team were overrun for 45 minutes
only their own spirit , the excellence of sergio aguero and a rare moment of fallibility from lionel messi at the death kept man city in touch
as such , if they are to overcome a 2 - 1 deficit they simply must show us something we have not yet seen from them at this level , under either manager
those who point to wins at home against bayern munich and away at roma as evidence that man city are learning are clutching desperately at straws
video pellegrini does n't fear for man city job yaya toure and manuel pellegrini speak from their hotel in barcelona on the eve of the second leg yaya toure knows his team must improve if they are to stand any chance of progressing to the quarter - finals joe hart 's penalty save from lionel messi at the end of the first leg has given man city a glimmer of hope man city were on the ropes for much of both games
certainly they controlled neither and were aided by some good fortune
on wednesday it must be different , something the returning yaya toure seemed to agree with when he spoke on tuesday
â last year everybody said we were a top team in europe , â said the ivorian
â now we have lost a couple of games and everybody says we are the worst
we can deal with that
the players know what they have to do
â during their own media gathering earlier in the day , barcelona coach enrique and midfielder andres iniesta spoke diplomatically
city remain a feared opponent , was the message
the truth , however , is that man city have not remotely troubled the catalan club in successive champions league meetings , and given that barcelona have won 16 of their last 17 games and are yet to be shut out in europe this season , the size of the english club âs task is clear
barcelona train at their joan gamper base on the eve of the second leg against man city luis suarez scored both barcelona goals in the first leg at the etihad stadium there was one item of good news for man city on tuesday when enrique confirmed that his central midfield totem , sergio busquets , will not play
the great spaniard is injured and that may offer the likes of yaya toure and david silva some hope as they look to attack barcelona âs back four
nevertheless , manuel pellegrini must hope for a considerable improvement
man city simply must find it from somewhere
there is absolutely no desire at man city to sack manuel pellegrini
what would that say about the judgment of those who hired him ? like every manager , however , he will live or die by his results
currently his win ratio at man city is 62 per cent
mancini âs was 59 per cent
this is game number 99 of manuel pellegrini âs reign
by the time he reaches his century at home to west bromwich on saturday , he will hope to have something significant to reflect upon .
