tragic : five - month - old leo died on june 4 2010 , hours after his mother phoned for help a baby died from meningitis after the on - call doctor asked to examine him failed to turn up and instead left his worried parents a phone message to say he was â very busy â , an inquest heard
leo âs mother had rung nhs direct after the five - month - old boy was taken ill overnight with a high temperature and heavy breathing
a call handler from the privately run go-to - doc. scheme passed the call to duty gp dr tahghighi with a message saying he needed to visit the family because they had no transport to get to hospital or money for a taxi
instead of instructing his driver to take him to their address , however , he left two voicemail messages on leo âs mother âs mobile phone asking her to contact him
when she failed to answer , he assumed the family were asleep and that leo was ok , made a â likely diagnosis â of a viral illness and concluded that a visit was â not necessary â , the hearing was told
but four hours later , leo developed a tell - tale rash on his forehead , and although his parents called an ambulance he died later in hospital
after being challenged over what happened , dr tahghighi initially lied about having attended the house and claimed the lights were switched off when he arrived
he even described the street and area , claiming it was â dark â and â scruffy â before coming clean
his mother , corry , now 23 , told the hearing in manchester that in the hours before he died in june 2010 , leo had become unsettled and started making a â whimpering noise â while out in his pram
back at their home in chadderton , oldham , he refused food , and she and leo âs father kaine radcliffe , 25 , a labourer , noticed a rise in his temperature
she gave him baby paracetamol , but he continued to struggle and was breathing heavily , although there was no sign of a rash
shortly before midnight she rang the nhs direct helpline , which has since been replaced by the non-emergency 111 service , and then told a health adviser from go-to-doc about leo âs condition
miss corry said leo felt â really , really hot , like boiling hot â
his case was referred to the on - call doctor with the message in capital letters : â no money no transport , visit
left , leo 's parents corry and kaine radcliffe leo âs exhausted parents then fell asleep , and when miss corry woke up four hours later she realised she had two voicemails
â leo was beside me and i saw a purple rash on his forehead , â she said
â i got a glass and put it on the rash because i knew it was meningitis
â symptoms : leo , pictured , had been suffering a high temperature and heavy breathing her partner called an ambulance but leo died later that day at royal manchester children âs hospital
his family has since received an apology from go-to - doc. dr tahghighi , 47 , from wilmslow , cheshire , was later suspended for 12 months for misconduct by the medical practitioners tribunal service
his first voicemail message said : â we are very busy with visits
maybe he can wait until the morning
â the second said : â as you have nât called back i âm assuming that your son leo is doing ok and settled down
i would suggest a follow - up with your gp some time during open hours
however , i would like you to phone us back with any concerns
â dr tahghighi said that at the time he had been working an â excessive number of shifts â , including six that required him to cover if a doctor rang in sick as well as seven days at his surgery in bramhall and five overnight shifts lasting from 11pm to 7am
when asked if he had been â too busy â to see leo , he said : â i do nât know the reason i did nât visit
i had the four visits come in at once
â i felt with no call back , i just assumed that everything was fine and settled
i should have attended but i was under a considerable amount of stress at the time
i admit working an excessive number of hours
meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection , but they are not yet available for all forms
so it 's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia
symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia : other signs in babies : septicaemia can occur with or without meningitis
not everyone gets all the symptoms and they can appear in any order
