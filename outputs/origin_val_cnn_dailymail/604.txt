the 37 - year - old instead he scoured the cctv system of the gym he was training at when the robbery happened
former ufc middleweight jensen had his car broken into when he was training at the gym the video recordings showed a man and a woman breaking in to the car before speeding off in a black car just minutes later
and rather than cancelling all his cards the fighter , who has been in the octagon alongside the likes of thales leites , demian maia and mark munoz , kept track of their spending
his detective work eventually led him to a nearby walmart store as payment history showed that was the last place his cards had been used

one of the crafty duo ran into the store , but luckily police were on hand to apprehend the crooks
