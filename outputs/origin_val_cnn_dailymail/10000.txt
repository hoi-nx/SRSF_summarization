a daredevil swiss wingsuit flyer has jumped off the side of a mountain in pitch darkness and flown down past huge pillars of rock using only the light from two bright red flares
and the amazing night - time flight by patrick kerber , 33 , was not only captured on video , but also on a slow shutter speed photo taken by photographer meier
in the picture patrick kerber 's route appears as a glowing red line running down from the top of the 10,000 - foot titlis mountain in the resort town of engelberg in central swiss to the bottom
he said : ' i wanted to do a wingsuit base flight at night during winter for a very long time
but somehow i never really managed to do it
' the idea became reality when they decided to try and do a single photograph on a slow shutter speed and at the same time fit a light to the jumper so that the flight down the mountain could be recorded
the first problem was that it was difficult to find a light that was bright enough to be seen from a distance of one mile away , where the camera needed to be placed
they solved it , though , by using two superheated emergency flares
these also provided some light to help illuminate the way , although the intense heat also posed a risk that they might set the suit on fire
patrick kerber said : ' we used flares exactly like the ones used for rescue missions or emergencies
but flares burn very , very hot and my biggest fear was burning holes or melting the suit
that would have been super dangerous
to show how dangerous the jump was , patrick kerber did a trial run in daylight a slight mistake would have sent patrick kerber crashing into craggy rocks the wingsuit jump produced a dramatic video , with patrick kerber zooming down the mountain at breakneck speed ' there definitely was a lot of pressure
even though we did intense testing before , i did not know for sure how it would turn out
having fire really close to you on a wingsuit base flight leaves no margin for error
everything has to be worked out
' the two photographers , fabian wyss and meier , stood on the other side of the valley on the furrenalp to take the snap
patrick kerber also had to wait until the torches burned out before he could open the parachute
he said : ' i definitely did not want to open up my parachute with fire still around me , as this could be very dangerous
i only have one single parachute attached to me
if this one burns or melts , it 's over ! ' patrick kerber decided to use two torches
the first one he ignited before he took off and held in his right hand so it would be visible to the photographer
when the torch burned out , he opened up his parachute and when it was safely in the air , ignited a second torch attached to his foot
he said : ' i only had 20 seconds to ignite the second one as it also burned for one minute and i only had 1 minute and 15 seconds to the landing area
' patrick kerber has jumped at night before , but not in winter and only at full moon
he said : ' the feeling was very intense and amazing
it is much harder to orientate yourself , as you ca n't see as well
it feels much more intense because you fly with more feeling and awareness of your body and movements
