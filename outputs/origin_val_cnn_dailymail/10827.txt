' he was a brilliant kid , ' said dustin oâbryant , who hired the teenager to write for his site coin brief
' his english was nât perfect , but i was willing to overlook that because the content was great
' o'bryant said he hired the teenager for the site , which covers bitcoin and other digital currencies , after being impressed by a chemistry paper the boy wrote
he ' had a really strong understanding of the technology behind digital currency in general and even more advanced systems , ' o'bryant said
