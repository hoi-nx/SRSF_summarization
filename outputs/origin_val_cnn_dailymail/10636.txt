every transfer window , clubs scramble to pick up the best bargains , and fans argue over who their side really need
but , seven months after last summer 's window swung shut , which of those deals have proved to be value for money ? as we reach the business end of the season , now is the time for the men brought in to start really showing their worth
but who have been the best signings of the season so far ? sportsmail takes a look ... 10 - ander herrera athletic bilbao to manchester united well , he finally became a hit after being allowed to play consistently
makes manchester united tick , has an eye for a pass and gets himself involved in the final third , making sure the main striker does nât have to come searching for possession
it âs a mystery why louis van gaal did nât fancy the former athletic bilbao midfielder to begin with , but he has really made his mark since enjoying a real run in the team
they do love a classy caresser of a ball at old trafford , which clearly works in his favour
ander herrera has finally begun to show his class at old trafford after a slow start under louis van gaal the spaniard has become a key part of manchester united 's midfield , allowing the likes of juan mata to flourish 9 - janmaat feyenoord to newcastle mr dependable , which is a name you do not normally associate with newcastle defenders
it is baffling that van gaal - who must have known he needed a right back on arriving at manchester united - did not feel the need to sign a player he started in every world cup fixture for holland
cheap and pleased for the opportunity in the premier league , alan pardew and graham carr did their homework on this signing and it âs helped no end at the back for the magpies
janmaat has proved excellent value for newcastle , becoming a regular at right back in his first season janmaat is a dutch international star , and newcastle did well to pick him up for such a small fee last summer 8 - toby alderweireld atletico madrid to southampton ( loan ) nine clean sheets for southampton with the belgian defender in the team and - despite him making noises that he probably wo nât be around next season - they have easily coped with the loss od dejan lovren to liverpool
quick enough for the premier league , he âs kept up with the best and added a touch of class at the back for southampton
toby alderweireld has shown the pace and class needed in the premier league since joining southampton on loan 7 - ryan bertrand chelsea to southampton ( loan and then permanent ) luke shaw âs boots may be small in a literal sense , but figuratively ryan bertrand had a job on
southampton were smarting at losing their teenage sensation who careered down the left last season , but it âs as if he was never really there as the former chelsea man carries equal threat going forward and has actually appeared more comfortable defensively
what good business it was then to get ryan bertrand snapped up on a permanent deal in january
ryan bertrand and nathaniel clyne have been inspirational at full backs for southampton this season after signing him on loan in the summer , securing ryan bertrand permanently looks like a masterstroke 6 - graziano pelle feyenoord to southampton a fairly unknown quantity on signing from feyenoord for Â£ 8m , graziano pelle âs physical presence and deftness of touch has made him a huge hit on the south coast
important goals and some panache to go with it , the italian has earned his first international call - up while on ronald koeman âs watch and carries a severe threat inside the 18 - yard box
even after his goals have dried up somewhat , graziano pelle ' strength and quality have been a major asset graziano pelle 's goalscoring start to the season earned him his first italian caps , and he scored on his debut 5 - diouf free agent to stoke a deceptively effective forward , and terrific value for money for free
diouf struggled at blackburn but redefined himself in the bundesliga with hannover and has taken that goalscoring form to the potteries
scoring more than one in every three starts , the senegalese has chipped in with crucial goals for stoke and has been a relatively unsung hero this year
edges out southampton âs mane in this list based on the respective transfer fees ( mane cost Â£ 11.8m ) and amount of chances their sides create
diouf has chipped in with vital goals for stoke at an impressive record since joining for free despite a tough time in his previous spell in english , the senegalese star has proved his worth this season diouf launches into his trademark celebration after scoring one of his nine stoke gaols this season 4 - diafra sakho metz to west ham has suffered a couple of injuries , but that has nât had any lasting effect on his impact at upton park in a debut season
sniffs out goals from nowhere and has that low centre of gravity which has defenders quaking
strong in the air and with his back to goal , diafra sakho brings others into play as well as netting on a regular basis
had he not come back from international duty injured , the senegalese might have been pushing harry kane and diego costa for the golden boot
diafra sakho 's goals were a big part of west ham 's brilliant start to this season , after signing from metz the senegalese striker has shown he can score with his head as well as his feet , and has proved great value 3 - diego costa atletico madrid to chelsea that blistering start to the season means diego costa will be in every list similar to this from now until may
his 19 premier league goals are one of the chief reasons why chelsea look like winning the title
but it âs not all about hitting the back of the net - fans at stamford bridge have also bought into his style of play
the spain international bullies defenders , shakes their confidence and is fairly nasty
diego costa has endeared himself to chelsea fans with his nasty side , showing aggression as well as quality diego costa 's 19 premier league goals already have fired chelsea to the brink of the title 2 - cesc fabregas barcelona to chelsea where would diego costa have been without fabregas ? back in the capital , albeit over the other side , his campaign got off to a similarly stunning start , assisting almost at will as chelsea battered all those put in front of them
yes , there is an argument to suggest his form has dipped , but cesc fabregas is worthy of making the list because of that reintroduction to english football
you get the sense he could move through the gears if necessary , too
providing more assists than any other player by far , cesc fabregas ' premier league return has been superb his form may have dropped off since the turn of the year , but cesc fabregas has still been a stand - out star offering more defensively than at previous clubs , cesc fabregas has become the complete midfielder this season 1 - alexis sanchez barcelona to arsenal a game - changer
someone who is capable of turning no points into three and putting opposition to the sword
fierce in possession , his burst of pace can unlock defences in a flash
not happy playing second fiddle to neymar and lionel messi at barcelona , alexis sanchez has proven this term that he is one of the premier forwards in world football and shown to arsene wenger why it âs probably wise to shell out on quality every now and again
alexis sanchez 's pace and skill have proved to be a match - winning combination since he joined arsenal the chilean forward has provided superb goals and stunning displays since leaving barcelona this summer no signing has had as great an impact on their new side this season as arsenal 's chilean superstar
