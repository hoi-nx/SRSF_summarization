if you ca n't stand the heat , get out of your second kitchen
miliband today sought to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements , insisting he prefers the ' functional kitchenette ' where he was seen posing for tv cameras
the labour party leader , who has repeatedly insisted he is not interested in photo opportunities , was filmed sipping tea at home with his wife justine in a modest kitchen at his Â£ 2million north london home
now it has emerged that the image of the labour leader as a man of the people with a run - of - the - mill home was not all it appeared
for mr miliband actually lives in a house with two kitchens
the godmother to one of mr miliband 's children tonight revealed that the kitchen miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a ' functional kitchenette ' next to the family 's sitting room jenni russell , a newspaper columnist , said the kitchen mr miliband was pictured in was used for ' tea and quick snacks ' and insisted the family 's main kitchen was ' lovely ' the poky room the couple were pictured in , albeit with an oven and hob , was revealed last night by a family friend to be a ' functional kitchenette ' for ' tea and quick snacks '
the revelation opened up the labour party leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is , even though his home is reputed to be worth Â£ 2.5million
and ' two kitchens ' miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over john prescott for having ' two jags '
today mr miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing
' the house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it , ' he told the birmingham mail ' and it is not the one we use
we use the small one upstairs
' pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen , mr miliband added : ' this is the kitchen justine and i use
' he joked : ' i think justine would probably say she wishes i 'd spend more time in the kitchen
' daily mail columnist sarah vine , the wife of tory chief whip michael gove , wrote an article in yesterday 's paper sympathising over the ' forlorn ' kitchen as depicted on bbc news on tuesday evening
she wrote : ' very rarely do i feel sorry for miliband , but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen , staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue - and - white mug , part of me wanted to rush home from work , sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home - made brownies
' surely that ca n't really be miliband and justine 's kitchen ? all that lovely huge , fancy house , and that is where they do their cooking ? ' i hope for their sake that it 's actually their utility room , and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their Â£ 2million - plus townhouse in north london 's trendy kentish town look less fabulous and to bolster miliband 's man - o ' - the - people image
' in his christmas card last year , mr miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen mrs miliband , a child actress - turned - barrister , is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run - up to polling day yesterday this prompted jenni russell , the times political commentator and family friend , to come to the labour leader 's defence â by revealing his actual kitchen is ' lovely '
she tweeted : ' miliband 's kitchen is lovely
daily mail pix : the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks
' mr miliband is godfather to her child
when a twitter user expressed surprise , she replied : ' it 's not 2 kitchens ! more like times ' tea prep area
ca n't even sit in it
' last night tory mp nigel adams said : ' clearly there 's no cost of living crisis for ' two kitchens ' miliband
' it 's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his Â£ 2million mansion
miliband can try as much as he likes to portray himself as a man of the people but the only people he 's in touch with are the north london metropolitan elite
' last night a labour party spokesman declined to comment .
