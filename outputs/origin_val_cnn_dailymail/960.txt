a new alzheimer âs drug that reverses the damage the disease causes in patients â brains could â change the landscape â of future treatment , according to researchers
it has already performed so well at early - stage trials involving people living with the disease in the united states that scientists are now in talks aimed at leapfrogging the usual second stage and fast - tracking it for larger trials
pharmaceutical firm biogen , which developed the drug , called aduncanumab , wants to recruit at least 1,000 patients for tests by the end of the year
it is not yet known if this will include any from the uk
a new alzheimer âs drug that reverses the damage the disease causes in patients â brains could â change the landscape â of future treatment ( file picture ) there are currently half a million people in the uk living with alzheimer âs , and as yet there is no cure
â a lot of potential alzheimer âs drugs never quite make it , â says biogen spokesman kate niazo-sai
â but the results we have seen in a relatively small patient sample are very hopeful
if this was replicated in a further trial , then it could change the landscape for treatment of alzheimer âs
â pharmaceutical firm biogen , which developed the drug , called aduncanumab , wants to recruit at least 1,000 patients for tests ( picture posed by model ) the trial shows that aduncanumab significantly reduces amyloid plaque â clumps of protein typically found in the brains of alzheimer âs patients
this plaque can lead to the death of nerve cells and loss of brain tissue , causing devastating symptoms such as memory loss and personality changes
dr eric karran , director of research at alzheimer âs research uk , says the drug could prove an effective â and safe â treatment
he adds : â these are very promising early results
it will be important to see results from much larger trials before we can understand how effective this treatment may be
â the year - long early - stage trial saw 166 patients with mild or early symptoms of alzheimer âs given either aduncanumab in varying doses , or a placebo
brain scans revealed that those patients on the strongest dose showed the most significant improvement in amyloid plaque by the end of the trial
patients were also given a number of ability tests and it was found that those on the highest dose had a â significant slowing â of mental decline , while those taking the placebo declined the most
the findings were unveiled at the 12th international conference on alzheimer and parkinson âs diseases held in the french city of nice last week .
