a ' mystery pooper ' has reportedly soiled a new zealand swimming pool for five friday nights in a row
the frustrated administrators of invercargill 's splash palace complex have lost thousands of dollars of business cleaning up after a patron 's foul play , stuff.co.nz reported

splash palace , pictured , describes itself as one of new zealand 's premier pools
unfortunately , a so - called ' mystery pooper ' has reportedly soiled the waters five times , requiring six hours of cleaning manager thompson told fairfax : ' they did one in the leisure pool and we moved the kids to the learners ' pool , and they did one in the learners ' pool and we moved the kids to the main pool , and one appeared in the main pool , so we had to shut the whole thing down
' in one of those pools was diarrhoea ... that was unfortunate
' mr thompson said the incidents occurred after 5pm on friday evenings
it is unclear whether one person or more is behind the incident , with a local councillor quoted saying : ' we have a mystery pooper '
it wo n't help invercargill 's sometimes battered reputation
according to local folklore , a member of the rolling stones once dubbed the city the ' a * * * hole of the world '
