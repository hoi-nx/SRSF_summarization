the parents of murdered black teenager michael brown have announced their plan to file a civil suit against the city of ferguson
it comes a day after the justice department refused to prosecute wilson despite compiling a 350,000 - page report on racial profiling in the missouri city that ' led to ' michael brown 's fatal shooting at the hands of a white police officer on august 9 , 2014
' he did not have to kill michael brown , ' attorney parks said of ferguson police officer wilson

' he did not say specifically when the suit would be filed
he said only that , ' soon means soon
' the announcement is a reaction to the news on wednesday that federal investigators found a pattern of discriminatory and illegal actions against african - americans by the ferguson police department
the report said police in the st. louis county suburb of ferguson overwhelmingly arrested and issued citations to blacks to boost city revenues through fines and court fees , creating a culture of distrust that exploded on august 9 when wilson killed michael brown
attorney general holder said the report showed police created a ' highly toxic environment ' in ferguson
catalyst : the justice department began the civil rights investigation following the august shooting of michael brown ( left ) , an unarmed black 18 - year - old , by white police officer wilson ( right ) justice department staff interviewed hundreds of average citizens as part of the six - month probe , concluding that a large portion of ferguson 's population mistrusts the local police force and considers it illegitimate report will show that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were african americans ' let me be clear , this type of behavior will not be tolerated in the ferguson police department or in any department in the city of ferguson , ' the city 's mayor james knowles said at the conference
seven emails included in the report showed police and court officials making racist jokes , including one that said barack obama would n't remain president long , remarking ' what black man holds a steady job for four years
' the mayor did not take any questions at the presser , and though ferguson police chief tom jackson had been expected to attend , no explanation was given for his absence
the justice department investigation into ferguson police began immediately after michael brown 's killing in august
analysis of more than 35,000 pages of police records found racist comments from officers as well as statistics that showed african - americans make up 93 percent of arrests while accounting for only 67 percent of the population in ferguson , an unnamed department official said
the justice department report also found that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were black
not tolerated : ferguson mayor james knowles announced the firing of one police department employee identified among those who sent racist emails according to figures recorded between 2012 and 2014 , blacks were also twice as likely to be searched than whites during traffic stops , though contraband showed up more during searches of white drivers
holder also said that charges for minor violations such as ' manner of walking in roadway ' disproportionately affected black residents and were used ' not as a public service , but as a tool for raising revenue
' nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of african americans in ferguson , new york and cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what president barack obama called ' simmering distrust ' between police and communities
black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops , compared to their white counterparts
the justice department plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with ferguson officials and enter a consent decree , or to sue the city to force change
michael brown was unarmed when he was shot multiple times by wilson , who told investigators he and michael brown had an angry and violent encounter , causing him to fear for his life when he shot michael brown
a st. louis county grand jury declined to indict wilson , who has since left the police department .
