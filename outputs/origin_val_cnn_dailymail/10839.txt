team sky rider porte reeled in a 36 - second gap to win the paris-nice title for the second time in three years

porte stands top of the podium having won his second paris-nice title on sunday with tony gallopin 's challenge expiring , michal kwiatowski finished second overall and third on the day
welshman geraint , one of porte 's team sky colleagues , was seventh fastest in the time - trial to claim fifth place in front of tony gallopin
porte said : ' it means a lot to me to be a two - time winner of an iconic race like paris-nice , and this one feels even sweeter than the last one because it was so hard
the australian dominated the stage seven time - trial to steal the title from tony gallopin on the final day ' they threw everything at us on saturday , and to win on the top of the col d'eze this year , like i did in 2013 , is incredible
' i was a little bit nervous going into the day
geraint and i threw time away yesterday ( saturday ) - we were in a fantastic position , and for both of us to crash like we did was n't ideal
to win today though , is a fantastic feeling
' porte , who won the paris-nice title in 2013 , crosses the line after dominating the time - trial on sunday
