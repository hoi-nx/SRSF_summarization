england will kick off saturday 's game knowing precisely what they need to do to win the six nations and take huge momentum into the world cup
they had a similar chance a year ago â although they did nât play last â but blew it badly in rome
the common language of coaches in this position is â let âs win the game first , â but that is nonsense
this is not about beating france , it is about winning the title
they need a clear game plan to maximise points difference
nobody remembers who comes second
chris robshaw 's england will know exactly what they have to do to win the six nations when they kick off luther burrell breaks with the ball during the england captain 's run at twickenham it is tempting to think england must throw caution to the wind and play a wild , attacking game
but if they get ahead of themselves and try to run up a big score early they could come horribly unstuck
this is not a bad french team â in fact i have never really seen a bad french team as they do have so much talent available
they do nât look comfortable on or off the field but the french have a habit of performing under pressure and they âre capable of beating england
throughout this week , i would have gone through match scenarios with my captain , the scrum - halves and the fly - halves , discussing what decision we âd make depending on how many points we need in the match
that would then be presented to the whole team so everyone is on message
england 's players gather as head coach lancaster looks on during the captain 's run joseph passes the ball during the england captain 's run ahead of the game with france lancaster must make it clear to his players exactly what they need to do to win the title if england need a big score , chris robshaw and the half - backs will face big decisions from the first minute
i hope lancaster has made it clear to the players this week exactly how the day will pan out in terms of timings
as soon as the early games finish , the results should be up on the changing - room wall
the amount of points they need to win by should be printed in big , bold type
this is the day for real detail and no surprises , and finding out which players can really perform under pressure
england should be very pleased with the situation they find themselves in , especially after the hiding they received in dublin
with the games falling as they do , i would nât set out any directives for the team about watching them or not â it should be every individual âs decision
personally , i would like to watch as much as possible ; if nothing else , it takes your mind off our game for a few minutes
some of the players may want to watch the wales v italy game while others wo nât
they âll be warming up while the scotland v ireland game is being played so there âs no question of them watching that , but i âd let the players know i would be putting the score from the ireland game up on the board in the changing room at 4.30pm so they know precisely what âs required of them
that can be broken down into six very clear areas
1 build the score it sounds easy , but it âs critical
france are more susceptible than any international side if they are put under pressure and they have lost on their last three visits to twickenham
the best way to create pressure is to lead throughout
so england must try to ensure they take the lead early and force france to chase the game
they must take every penalty that is offered â if the referee , say , gives an advantage , decline it and take the points
take three points from drop - goal opportunities â never leave their 22 without points
joseph scores england 's first try against scotland and they must build a score against france this game is crying out for three drop goals in the first 20 minutes , even if you do nât score tries until later in the game
if opportunities arise , we must take them , something we failed to do against scotland
2 maintain discipline england must be squeaky clean and aim to concede no more than four penalties in each half
the contact area and scrum will be key and england can not afford to gift france easy points
scrum - half youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee nigel owens and england must not allow france to have the ball at the breakdown
yellow or red cards must be seen as a total disaster , and every player must take full responsibility to control himself in every aspect of the game
scrum half youngs needs to establish a running dialogue with referee nigel owens 3 keep the ball in play the speed of the ball and the speed and variety of the restarts are absolutely critical
i want to see quick , pre-called line - outs and the ball in and out of the scrum quickly to avoid the risk of giving penalties away at the back of it
if the line - out is nât secure , there âs nothing wrong with taking the tap penalty
keep the tempo up because this massive french side will not want to be moved around
ford passes the ball and england must keep the ball in play as much as possible also , to score maximum points , you need the ball in play for the maximum amount of time
every time the ball âs out of play , it is not only time but points ticking away
england must also employ an exciting restart policy
every kick - off must be done with the aim of getting the ball back
we need variety so we can kick left , right or down the middle but we must get it back
4 kick well , chase hard this is a huge test of england âs tactical kicking game , which i âm not sure is as good as it needs to be yet
in the 2003 world cup semi-final , i picked mike catt at no 12 ahead of mike tindall because he had a superior kicking game
france will believe they can get at ford so brown needs to support his kicking game
brown needs to support ford 's kicking game and limit the up - and - unders i âd limit the up - and - unders and box kicks , too , as they are too much of a lottery
ford , youngs and brown need to look deep and hit the green stuff
field position gave jonny wilkinson the opportunity to get three drop goals as england won that semi 24 - 7 against a french team who were favourites to beat us
5 half - time the message needs to be that this is now a game of 40 minutes
you ca nât change what âs happened in the first half but you can learn
they âll know exactly what is needed and the team and tactics can change if needs be
the bench can then be used to identify areas of french weakness and attack them
england must make sure the second half is played as a game of 40 minutes understand , france are currently the best defensive team in the tournament , having only conceded two tries
patience will be a key word , but tries will come as long as we are playing the game at real pace
6 keep your best men on matches are won in the last 30 minutes , not the first 30 , and i âd always look to have my strongest side on the field at the end of the game
the key is not to bring any player on unless he is going to improve the team
i still believe danny cipriani can be a trump card
will lancaster dare opt for a ford - danny cipriani - joseph combination if the game calls for it ? you can score two tries in the last five minutes ; it only takes 20 seconds to score
danny cipriani can be england 's trump card coming off the bench i âd expect england to win â then it becomes about by how much
i just feel this french side is better than everyone is giving them credit for , and i âm very surprised lancaster has not picked a specialist second - row on the bench
it âs a massive gamble as courtney lawes and geoff parling have a history of injuries , potentially leaving nick easter to play the majority of the match out of position in the second row
this is a hugely exciting day of rugby
people have questioned the staggered kick - off times but for me it makes the day unbelievably exciting and is brilliant for fans watching at home
it is a massive day for lancaster and his team
they need this championship more than the others
they ca nât afford another bad day at the office .
