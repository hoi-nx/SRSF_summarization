routledge 's son , corporal liam riley , was just 21 when he was killed by an ied whilst serving with the coldstream guards battle group in 2010

corporal liam riley ( pictured left , with prince harry ) was just 21 when he was killed by an ied in aghanistan
his mother was comforted as she grieved by a ' beautiful ' letter from harry , who she thanked today although they had not met since , the pair were said to have bonded during their three month posting
liam riley , was killed in february 2010 after trying to rescue a colleague who had also stepped on an ied during a patrol near gereshk
he was second in command of a base security foot patrol when the device was detonated , leaving him with catastrophic injuries
his funeral in sheffield , yorkshire , was attended by 500 mourners with some 1,000 more gathering in the street outside
in the aftermath of his death , as mrs routledge struggled to cope with her grief , she was comforted by a letter written by harry personally
she has chosen not to make the contents public out of respect for the prince but said today : ' harry said that although they had not known each other for long , some three months or so , he knew instantly that liam riley was ' a legend ' and what a great bloke he was
they said some fantastic times together in canada
' he told me that he had an unforgettable smile , in fact he said he never stopped smiling the whole time he knew him
' he talked to me about the pain he felt after his own mother died and how he came to terms with his grief
' it was a beautiful letter , written from the heart , and something that touched me and brought me enormous comfort at the time
it is something i will always treasure
' mrs routledge was first introduced to harry 's father , prince charles , at a reception at london 's guildhall today following the service of commemoration for those who had served in afghanistan at st. paul 's cathedral
liam riley 's funeral ( pictured ) in sheffield , yorkshire , was attended by 500 mourners with some 1,000 more gathering in the street outside charles 's eye was drawn not only to liam riley 's medals that she was wearing , but a badge showing the smiling soldier on his mother 's lapel
when mrs routledge , 50 , from sheffield , yorkshire , explained her son 's link to harry , charles rubbed her affectionately on the arm
the mother - of - three said afterwards : â liam riley was always very discreet about the time he served with prince harry but did tell me that when harry celebrated his birthday out in canada , prince charles sent him a cake and he shared it with them all
â prince charles was very sympathetic and asked me about liam riley
he appeared very touched to hear about the time he had spent with his son
â when royal officials became aware that liam riley had been known to harry personally , they arranged for his mother and grandmother , grace davison , 73 , to meet with the prince in another room at the reception where he was greeting serving soldiers
â how did you find me down here ? â the prince said in shock as he hugged mrs routledge and her mother , before posing for pictures
â it is very good to meet you at last
when i said liam riley was a legend , i meant it
â prince harry , pictured at a service of commemoration at st. paul 's cathedral today , marking 13 years of military operations in afghanistan afterwards mrs routledge said the meeting had meant a great deal to her
â i just wanted to be able to thank him for what he said about liam riley
his words were a huge comfort to us all at a very difficult time , â she said
ironically for his family , liam riley had nât been due for a tour of duty in afghanistan but had pestered his superiors for the chance to be sent there as he â did nât feel worthy of his rank â without having served in a warzone
â he took to the army like a duck to water and was flying up the ranks , â his mother recalled
â there was nothing i could have done to stop him , he was doing what he loved
like all of these parents here you just have to kiss them goodbye and keep your fingers â crossed
sadly for us we were one of those who received a knock on the door
â in all there were close to a thousand family members and servicemen present at the reception , held by the city of london , at which the duchess of cornwall , the duke of gloucester and the duke of kent were also present along with prime minister david cameron
the family of royal marine steven , who died at the age of just 20 after being shot by a sniper as he worked in a military compound in sangin , were also introduced to charles
prince harry , who served in two tours of afghanistan , stands with sister - in - law kate and brother prince william during the commemoration marine birsdall , of 40 commando , was seriously injured in june 2010 and immediately flown back to the queen elizabeth hospital in birmingham but died the following day from his wounds
the death of the â brave and selfless â soldier from warrington , left his family in deep shock
his mother , jenny , described today âs event as a â very fitting memorial â
â we will never forget steven and still have our good and bad days , â she said
â he was only two and a half years out of his training but he loved what he was doing
he was very selfless , brave and fearless
â it has been a long and difficult road even getting to the point that we can talk about what has happened so publically
â but prince charles was wonderful
he told me how much prince harry had loved his service in afghanistan and would have gone out there in a heartbeat again if he had been able to
â it meant a great deal to us to be able to share steven âs story with him
â in a short speech before the reception , the lord mayor of london , alan yarrow , said it was impossible for anyone to imagine what the families of those who lost loved ones in afghanistan had lived through in order to get to this day
â but we can remember and respect , â he said .
