sergeant williams has been left penniless and jobless after being repeatedly hounded by ' ambulance - chasing ' lawyers over the death of an iraqi man 12 years ago he went on to be praised for his heroism after saving seven lives in afghanistan â but in a worrying display of how lawyers are profiting under the human rights act , mr said 's family could now be awarded compensation
in a blistering attack on the system which has forced the mod to spend millions in british courts defending actions of soldiers on the battlefield , mr williams said : ' i feel like i 've been on trial for 12 years
' it is a disgrace that soldiers are having to explain their actions so ambulance - chasing lawyers can abuse farcical rulings and line their pockets on the death of iraqi civilians
' mr williams , who joined the 2nd royal tank regiment in 1999 aged 16 , said he was angry that mr said 's family could receive compensation after pursuing their case with controversial lawyers leigh day & co it is understood they could receive thousands of pounds
the soldier , then 21 , was cleared by two military investigations only to then face a murder charge in a civilian court , where he was once again cleared , pictured with his partner rachel lord he went on to be praised for his heroism after saving seven lives in afghanistan , but said it feels as though he has been on trial for 12 years waiving his right to anonymity , mr williams said : ' i was just doing my job as a soldier fighting for my country and defending a comrade
it is disgusting and completely unfair that [ mr said 's ] family could now receive compensation and i 've lost two jobs and am struggling to support my family
' mr williams , now 32 , was on a random patrol during his second tour of iraqi in 2003 when he came across up to nine men pushing a cart filled with ammunition
when the soldiers moved to arrest them , mr williams chased one to a nearby village and into his home

but mod says said family could still get compensation mr said refused to leave peacefully and after trying to grab mr williams 's gun , he was shot dead by the young soldier as the iraqi was said to have reached for his colleague 's pistol
mr williams said : ' i was only a young boy and i was very scared
i felt both mine and my colleague 's life were in danger
i did n't think , ' i 'm going to shoot to kill him ' , but i wanted to shoot to stop him
' he was initially subjected to two internal military investigations in 2003 and 2004 , which cleared him of any wrongdoing
but with the civilian police unhappy with the decision , he was arrested on suspicion of murder by officers from the metropolitan police while on leave in burnley where he lives with his partner rachel lord , 29 , and his daughter
after a two - year investigation in which he suffered from depression , his trial collapsed in 2005 when the crown prosecution service eventually accepted there was no realistic prospect of a conviction
the judge said that many people felt mr williams had been ' betrayed '
in 2009 he deployed to afghanistan , saving the lives of seven comrades by pulling them from an armoured vehicle submerged in a river
he was later awarded a joint chief 's commendation after trying to save the life of a colleague when their vehicle was hit by an ied
he left as a teaching sergeant in 2013 and moved back to iraqi to work in private security last year
but then he was told about an official inquiry by ex-high court judge sir george who was investigating the deaths of mr said and another iraqi , abdullah , who died as a result of injuries sustained at a road block in may 2003
seven paratroopers were cleared of murdering mr abdullah in 2005
mr williams lost his security job after the inquiry was announced
but on friday a report by sir george again attributed no blame to mr williams for mr said 's death
however , the mod said it could still be forced to pay compensation to mr said 's family
after a two - year investigation in which he suffered from depression , his trial collapsed in 2005 mr williams , who joined the 2nd royal tank regiment in 1999 aged 16 , said he was angry that mr said 's family could receive compensation they are represented by law firm leigh day & co , who were criticised last year along with phil shiner 's public interest lawyers firm after another inquiry demolished their claims that british soldiers tortured iraqi detainees in may 2004
the icc then announced it examining claims of mistreatment by british troops after being handed a dossier by public interest lawyers
mr williams was told that he could face a war crimes trial in the hague â which usually tries dictators who carry out genocide â over the death of mr abdullah
by this time he had found another security job in iraqi but he lost the post within hours of the icc investigation being announced
he said : ' to possibly be investigated again by the icc , it makes me feel sick
' mr williams said he felt ' abandoned ' by the army , adding : ' i went to war wanting to protect everyone i work with and you expect the army to support you
' an mod spokesman said : ' the government wishes to express its regret at the death of mr abdullah and is prepared to pay appropriate compensation to his family
