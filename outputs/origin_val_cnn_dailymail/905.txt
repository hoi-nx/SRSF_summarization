fined : khan was handed a Â£ 4,000 fine and ordered to pay Â£ 21,869 in costs after one of his workers lost his fingers while working in his birmingham supermarket a food shop owner who was back using a food mincer less than an hour after it had sliced off the fingers of a part - time employee has been ordered to pay out more than Â£ 25,000
khan - who used fairy liquid and hot water to clean the machine - was also handed an eight month suspended sentence after earlier admitting a single breach of health and safety regulations
judge james burbidge qc described khan 's management as ' woeful ' , and said : ' it is beyond belief the machine was still being used even after a man lost his fingers
' birmingham magistrates court had previously heard aston 's ash food fare 's meat slicer had lost its safety guard a month before mr iqbal lost his fingers in october 2012
staff had been using a plunger to insert meat since the breakage , the city 's magistrates ' court heard
fellow workers heard mr iqbal screaming as he placed his right hand inside the machine , which continued to operate as an ambulance crew rushed to the shop
a paramedic only recovered three of mr iqbal 's fingers after the machine was dismantled
but an hour later a police officer arrived to find the machine was back in use and one of the employees said washing liquid had been used to clean it
khan , 57 , then admitted he had used fairy liquid
barry berlin , prosecuting , said : ' mr abdul ( the manager ) said he used fairy liquid and hot water to clean it , which was fairly inadequate
' he then passed vegetables through it before using it
there was no safe system of work here at all
' we have looked and we ca n't find any steps he ( khan ) took to protect his staff from the unguarded mincer
' morgan , defending , maintained khan , of witton , birmingham , knew nothing of the missing hand guard - but said he fully accepted responsibility and ' bitterly regrets the injury caused '
' he is 57 years of age , has no previous convictions , he is very highly regarded , ' mr morgan said
' he has worked extremely hard all his life
' mr morgan said khan had also carried out good work for the benefit of the community spanning two decades
suspended : khan , 57 , was a ' woeful ' manager , according to judge james burbidge qc judge burbidge said : ' you should have been more proactive and should be well attuned , given your position in the community , to follow basic safety procedures
' if you had been , mr iqbal would not have suffered that traumatic amputation
' khan was ordered to pay a Â£ 4,000 fine and Â£ 21,869 in costs .
