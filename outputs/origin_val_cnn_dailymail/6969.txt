from treacherous road conditions to soggy jeans and frizzy hair - nobody enjoys cycling in the rain
but now there âs an â umbrella â for bikes that âs designed to keep riders dry as they cycle along
the leafxpro clip - on windshield , claims to enable cyclists to ride their bikes comfortably in the most miserable conditions , including rain , snow and gusty winds
â leafxpro is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance and can be used in even the most demanding conditions , â he said
the shield ( pictured ) is aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance so it can be used in windy weather â the resistance results showed that the kits can be used also in tougher conditions such as mountain biking as well
â the plastic windshield will stop rain blowing into the face of a cyclist , and it should nât steam up , like other more enclosed canopies
the device is designed to be fitted to any style of bike and can be packed away into a small bag when the weather improves , in just one minute
the kit weighs around 2.2lbs ( 1kg )
it âs available to pre-order from kickstarter in four models - classic , advanced , storm and family
prices range from Â£ 99 ( $ 152 ) for the basic model to Â£ 199 ( Â£ 305 ) for the family kit which also protects a child on a rear bike seat
mr brito , 40 , said : â the idea of leafxpro arose because we love cycling and it âs disappointing to have to use polluting means of transport just because of the bad weather
â we started thinking that there had to be an efficient , versatile and comfortable solution that would provide a sense of freedom for all people who love cycling
â it has taken him years to design and test the product , which is a modular structure that adapts to different weather conditions

â leafxpro kits are designed for the urban cyclist , for anyone who commutes to work by bicycle , for parents wanting to cycle their kids to school or people who want to enjoy bike tours as a tourist during sightseeing
â â the classic model , designed for episodes of snow , cold and light rain , turns easily into the advanced or storm models simply by sliding fasteners to join the modules , ' mr brito said
the storm version covers a rider 's head more as well as their arms last summer , a firm in delft , the netherlands , invented a simple clamp that fixes to a bike 's handlebars to hold a windproof umbrella
the holder can also be used to store the umbrella when the rain stops too
the umbrella 's asymmetric design is said to help it withstand high speed wind gusts of up to 70mph ( 113kph ) , because wind is directed over and around it
while its makers , senz , cautions against riding in high winds , the umbrella design lends itself to coping with the air stream created by cycling
the clamp costs â¬ 39 ( Â£ 31 ) while the umbrellas come in different sizes and are sold separately for â¬ 25 ( Â£ 20 ) and â¬ 50 ( Â£ 40 ) .
