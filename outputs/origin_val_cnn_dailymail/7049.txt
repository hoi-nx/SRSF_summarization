home ownership will become a ' distant ' dream for an entire generation , with just one in five under - 35s able to buy a house by the end of the decade , labour claims today
a dramatic slump in property ownership among the young from 60 per cent to 20 per cent in a generation means a record number of people in their twenties and thirties are still living with their parents
shadow housing minister reynolds warns five more years of the tories ' ' failed plan ' will create a housing gap between those on the property ladder and millions forced to rent
by 2020 , just 21 per cent of under - 35s will own their own home if the current trend continues , according to labour
in 1991 the figure was 60 per cent latest figures show that just 31 per cent of people aged 16 - 35 owned their own home in 2012 - 13 , down from 10 per cent in the year before the last election
labour warns that if the trend continues , it will mean that by 2020 just 21 per cent of young people will be on the property ladder
in a speech today , miss reynolds will say : ' over the past five years , david cameron has presided over the lowest levels of house building in peace time since the 1920s
' for a whole generation of young people and families the aspiration of buying their own home is becoming a distant dream
shadow housing minister reynolds warns five more years of the tories ' ' failed plan ' will create a housing gap between those on the property ladder and millions forced to rent ' a record number of young people are still living at home with their parents in their twenties and thirties because they ca n't get on the housing ladder
' in 2001 more than half of under - 35s ( 55 per cent ) owned their home , and in 1991 it was as high as 60 per cent
at the same time , the proportion of over- 75s owning a property has risen from 53 per cent in 1991 to 76 per cent in 2012 - 13
in a speech to the town and country planning association , miss reynolds will set out how labour would try to reinvigorate the aspiration of home ownership
overall , just 63 per cent of people own their own home , the lowest level since the mid- 1980s
labour claims that if the trend continues it will reach the lowest level for 40 years
' after five years of empty announcements and failed initiatives the tories are offering more of the same , ' miss reynolds will say
' but they ca n't even say how their latest pie - in - the - sky scheme will work or how they will pay for the Â£ 8.6 billion cost of the supposed 20 per cent discounts that are on offer
' five more years of the tories ' failed plan will see a growing housing gap , falling home ownership and unrealised aspiration for the next generation
' she will promise that labour has a plan to build 200,000 homes every year by 2020
a labour government would make tackling the housing crisis a ' national priority ' , giving communities stronger powers to build homes
first time buyers would be given priority access rights in new ' housing growth areas ' while small builders will be given more support
overall , just 63 per cent of people own their own home , the lowest level since the mid- 1980s , according to the english housing survey labour is also promising a new generation of new towns and garden cities
miss reynolds will pledge that labour will recreate the post-war spirit of house building
' labour has developed the first comprehensive plan for a generation to tackle the housing crisis
a labour government will get at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020 but we wo n't stop there
' the next labour government will recapture the post-war spirit for building new homes and match that renewed ambition with a drive to build high quality homes and great places for new communities
' while the tories still believe , despite their failure over the past five years , that the housing crisis will be solved by the market alone , labour is clear that to tackle the housing crisis there must be a much more active role for national and local government
