while having a baby is a joyous time for families , nine months of pregnancy followed by the sleepless nights , the challenges of breast feeding and hormonal changes have their own effect on new mums
as the duchess prepares to have her second child next month , she âll no doubt be prepared for any post-birth eventuality

this is because pregnancy hormones stop womens â usual daily hair - shedding , giving the appearance of extra-thick hair
but once the hormones return to normal about three to six months after birth , the extra hair finally falls out

kate hudson noticed her hair was thinning after having both her children ryder , aged 11 , and bingham , now three
she told redbook magazine in 2012 : â when i had [ first son ] ryder , i was 24 and did nât really experience any changes to my hair or skin
but with my second child , i got acne , all my hair fell out after he was born , and i definitely had to work out to drop the weight

it was brutal ; it âs not for everyone
