the world âs most wanted man avoided a deadly airstrike in iraqi thanks to a bureaucratic dispute , it was claimed today
islamic state leader abu bakr al-baghdadi was attending a nursery school in al-qaim on the iraqi - syria border , with senior aides and dozens of men set to pledge allegiance to him
an elite iraqi intelligence unit known as the â falcons cell â were aware of this thanks to their sources , and the iraqi air force were ordered to strike the school â but the defence ministry did nothing
however by then baghdadi had left the meeting , and iraqi fighter jets were instead forced to target a moving convoy of vehicles â not knowing which vehicle he was inside
one of the cell âs leaders said : â the strike should have killed abu bakr al-baghdadi if it had happened on time , but we were n't able to reveal the target and the fighter jets moved late
â the newspaper âs report , by ali hashem of lebanon tv station al-mayadeen , told how ten vehicles were destroyed - but abu bakr al-baghdadi was injured in the head and stomach before being taken to safety
location : an elite iraqi intelligence unit known as the â falcons cell â were aware of this thanks to their sources , and the iraqi air force were ordered to strike the school in al-qaim , on the iraqi - syria border the strike last november - which was reported by mailonline - saw an aircraft swoop over the meeting of isis figures and kill more than a dozen people , according to local government sources
the falcons intelligence cell is an elite anti-terrorism unit that works under the iraqi prime minister , based in a secret bunker in baghdad
the group is in charge of charge of counter-terrorism activity in iraqi , and is currently targeting a number of isis leaders
a leader from the elite cell - who gave the pseudonym of major bakr - insisted that it was ' very close ' to getting their target , baghdadi
the falcons group was previously in the news in 2013 when its officials issued a letter stating abu mohammed al-golani , the leader of al qaeda group the nusra front in syria , had sought to kidnap united nations workers
another witness said that eight people had died when a bomb hit a market
a nearby hospital was said to be overwhelmed with the volume of patients from the raid - including baghdadi
local isis officials were reportedly roaming the streets ordering residents to donate blood to help the wounded
striking baghdadi would have been a significant blow in the campaign against isis
al-qaim and the neighbouring syria town of albukamal are on a strategic supply route linking territory held by isis in iraqi and syria
abu bakr al-baghdadi , who declared himself leader of all the world 's muslims in a televised speech last year , was formerly a prisoner of the us during their occupation of iraqi
the shady figure was eventually released , and rose through the ranks of the jihadist groups which eventually united to form isis
world âs most - wanted man : abu bakr al-baghdadi the world âs most - wanted man was an impressive footballer known as â maradona â by inmates at a us detention camp
us forces detained abu bakr al-baghdadi at camp bucca in 2005 shortly after the iraqi invasion for four years - and he â amazed â others there with his football skills , an ex-inmate said
baghdadi also used to play for his mosque âs team , with one former acquaintance telling the sunday times : â he was obsessed with scoring goals - he would turn nervous if he did nât
â after his time at camp bucca , baghdadi â who has a phd in islamic history - emerged as one of the most brutal terrorists in the world
us officials put a $ 10million ( Â£ 6.7million ) bounty on his head four years ago when intelligence identified his movements as critically dangerous
this warrant was publicised once more following the beheadings of us nationals james foley and steven sotloff as well as britons david haines and alan henning
he maintained a low profile for months as isis rose to global infamy and even al qaeda denounced them as ' too extreme '
but last july he revealed himself to the public with a speech , filmed and posted on youtube .
