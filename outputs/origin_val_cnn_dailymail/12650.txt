i am atheist -- and i am black
yes , we exist -- even if many in the media sometimes do n't notice us
in a cnn special that aired on tuesday , for example , people of color were not as well - represented as american atheism 's more familiar face : you know , white males
in fact , african - american atheists represent a still small -- though growing -- segment of american atheists at large
does this mean that blacks and other minorities generally just do n't gravitate towards nonbelief , or are there other factors which keep us hidden ? there is a harsh truth to face here
most blacks identify as religious
belief in god is touted with pride , and the church is intricately tied to tradition , history and culture
it is not uncommon to assume that i attend services as a black woman
the question often is n't if i go to church -- it 's where
and even if one does n't go to church , surely they still have faith -- because our people have endured and overcome so much hardship that it had to be the work of a god
all of this makes the words " black " and " atheist " hard for many to imagine in the same sentence
it can be extremely difficult to discuss religion objectively in the black community
many have social , emotional and financial stakes invested in this institution , so for one to even say they have doubts is like committing treason
to openly identify as an atheist in the midst of heavy religious influence can be next to impossible , and good luck finding other blacks who also do n't believe
it is very important to note however , that the internet has made it easier for black atheists to find each other , and there is a large community of us online
though i was raised secular -- a rarity in my community -- i 've had to endure ostracism from family and friends as a result of openly identifying as an atheist
however , my journey is far from tragic
in founding my organization , black nonbelievers , in 2011 , i have been fortunate to connect with others who were either raised secular like myself , or who were brought up extremely religious and left it behind
and they have done so bravely , defying the perception and expectation that all blacks blindly accept religion
the friendly atheists next door my experience in the secular community as a black atheist has ranged from feeling totally welcome to feeling totally isolated , and even ignored
on the one hand , there is common ground shared -- our nonbelief and even discontent with religion unites us
on the other hand , there is a notion that since we share this common ground that there are no other issues to address
the lack of people of color at secular events is a problem -- partly because there is unawareness of such events existing , but also because there is limited effort placed in accommodation and care
we are sometimes treated as if we are invisible , or even as an afterthought -- which does not make the few persons of color feel welcome
fortunately , all is not lost
there are now a number of secular groups that have helped to bring about more diverse representation for people of color , women and children
there is a more concentrated focus on support for the lgbt demographic , as well for others who come from marginalized and disfranchised backgrounds
there are support systems for people who have lost loved ones , yet they have no religious affiliation
moreover , there is a tremendous amount of literary and artistic talent
such representation is now reflected at organized events , in leadership , as well as in media coverage
while the number of visible minority atheists is still small , we are here and we 're here to stay
we will continue to grow , in both the black and secular communities
we can lead the charge for this change
the more we make our presence known , the better our chances of working together to turn around the disparities we face , and bolster the recognition we so rightly deserve
we are not alone .
