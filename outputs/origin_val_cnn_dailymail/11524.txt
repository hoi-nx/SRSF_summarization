weyman has been forced to retire from rugby league after failing to recover from a knee injury ' it has meant a lot to me to play for rovers and i would like to thank the supporters and everybody at the club for making my family and i feel so welcome over the last 18 months , ' said weyman , who was runner - up to josh hodgson as rovers ' player of the year in 2014
' we 've really enjoyed our time here and we 've met some great friends who we 'll continue to stay in touch with after we move back to australia
' it 's a sad way to end my career but unfortunately these things happen and i 've been lucky enough to achieve what i have in the game
it 's now time to look at the bigger picture and think about my family
the prop ( right ) signed for hull kr last season and made only 24 appearances for the club ' my knee is n't responding to treatment and i wanted to do the right thing by the club as well
i do n't want to be sitting in the stands for most of the year
' hull kr coach chris chester said : ' we are disappointed to lose a player of mick 's calibre but he has been a great servant to the club during his time here and he leaves with our best wishes for the future
' he 's been a great leader for this club and this is not the way he would have wanted to end his career , but he 's played at the highest level and can be rightly proud of what he 's achieved in the game
' we 've already begun the search for a replacement for mick and we 're looking both in this country and overseas
we now have a full quota spot to play with but we wo n't be rushing into any decisions
we have a really close - knit squad this year and whoever we bring in will have to fit in both on and off the field
' hull kr are sad to see a player of weyman 's calibre leave the club but wished him well in the future
