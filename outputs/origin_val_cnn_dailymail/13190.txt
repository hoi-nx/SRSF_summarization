wildlife services in california are being pushed to their limits this year
since january 2015 , every month has set a record in sea lion " strandings , " mostly sea lion pups , according to the noaa
" there has been an unusually high number of sea lions stranded since january , " said greenman , assistant stranding coordinator for noaa on the west coast
" stranding does happen , but just to give you perspective , 1,800 [ sea lion ] pups have been responded to this year alone
we responded to 1,600 strandings total during the entire year in 2013 , " he said
stranding is the official term to describe marine life that " swim or float into shore and become beached or stuck , " according to noaa
strandings are taking a toll on the resources available in coastal counties from san diego to santa barbara
local care facilities have taken in more stranded sea lions this year than 2004 - 12 combined , and it is only mid-march
greenman said he expects the problem to continue beyond april , when weaning normally occurs , when the pups are 10 or 11 months old
koontz , director of communications for seaworld san diego , said sea world has rescued nearly 500 sea lions this year
" this is a new record for sea world , " koontz said
" in 1983 we rescued 474
" some of the sea lions responded to have had to be euthanized
" they [ sea lion pups ] have to be able to eat and fish on their own before they can be released back into the wild , and a lot of these pups have n't even been weaned , " greenman said
greenman said california has had warmer weather than usual this year , and , while noaa is still conducting studies on the channel islands to get a more proven explanation , warmer water drives the food source farther out or deeper into the ocean , where the colder water is
when food is farther away , the mothers are away from the pup too long in search of food , and return with little food or too few nutrients for a growing sea lion
" we have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches , " greenman said
however , he said , the species has made a comeback since the marine mammal protection act of 1972
california 's sea lion population has grown to 300,000 from an estimated population of 10,000 in the 1950s , according to the washington department of fish & wildlife
people who observe stranded sea lions are advised not to touch them or attempt to rescue them , because it can be dangerous and it is illegal
instead , call any of the rescue agencies listed on noaa west coast region 's website
if the animal has died , the local dead animal pickup service should be alerted .
