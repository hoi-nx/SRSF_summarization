glasgow could yet host great britain âs glamour davis cup quarter - final with france in july â if gb opt to put atmosphere ahead of a desire to play on grass
andy murray led the home team to victory over usa in front of 7,500 passionate fans at the emirates arena on sunday and , with all three days sold out in a matter of minutes , there is an obvious desire to see scotland âs greatest active sportsman in action again
andy murray himself expressed a preference for facing the france on grass â but said : â i think grass might be a good surface , but we âll have to see , because playing in front of a crowd like this also makes a difference and it helps
andy murray celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over john isner on sunday great britain supporters would relish supporting murray and co in glasgow again in july all three day 's of davis cup action at the emirates arena were sold out in a matter of minutes if we ca nât guarantee that at a grass venue maybe it makes sense to play it somewhere we can get that
â gb captain leon smith , a glaswegian himself , said there was â no chance â of finding or creating a suitably large outdoor venue â a minimum of 600 seats are required â in order to bring a grass - court tie to scotland
but he added : â i say no chance but i âm not a lawn expert
so , if someone can tell me there âs a chance , i âm sure we would explore it
gb captain leon smith doubts the chances of glasgow being able to create a larger grass - court venue leon smith embraces with andy murray after the latter 's straight sets win secured gb 's quarter - final berth andy murray ( middle ) is looked on in envy by his fellow gb team - mates after securing a tie against france ' internally , we âve looked at other options , thinking outside the box
â the first thing i need to do , over the next week or two , is think about the best surface
andy murray said grass there but we need to sit as a group , look at the likely france team and think about what âs best
â then we have to go somewhere with a great atmosphere
if it âs indoor hard , why not here â or somewhere near here ? something like this , it definitely worked in scotland
' you have to look at when the tie lands in the summer , too
â there will have been an awful lot of tennis in certain regions , so you want to put it somewhere people have the hunger for more tennis
we âll be phoning around like mad
â ultimately you go with the surface that gives you the best chance of winning
the atmosphere is great â but it will be even better to be in the semi-finals
â we âve got to pick a surface that all the players agree on
we âll put our heads together over the next week , then go to the suits and ask them to make it happen
