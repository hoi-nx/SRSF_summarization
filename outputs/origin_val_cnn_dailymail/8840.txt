there has always been a great rivalry between these sides , but i never played at old trafford with any fear
i went there as a youngster in 1986 and won with arsenal and during the arsene wenger years we had a team that could go and win anywhere
we were a physical team but we could play , and it was almost a compliment when man utd tried to match our physicality
arsenal defender keown confront ruud following his missed penalty in 2003 keown and his arsenal team - mates taunted the dutchman following his last - minute spot - kick miss keown 's confrontation with ruud was the final act in what is now known as the ' battle of old trafford ' in 1999 , ryan giggs scored that classic fa cup goal and it turned the season
arsenal could have won the double but man utd went on to win the treble
andy cole made a run to drag me out of position , but sometimes you just have to admire moments of genius
the other game people love to remind me of is the â battle of old trafford â in 2003
in the little black book of opposition players , ruud was one not to be trusted
he was a top player and a fighter , but he would look for any reason to go down
perhaps i overreacted , but the whole team was infuriated by him
and i âm still not convinced i deserved to give away the penalty that ruud eventually missed ! keown was part of a physical side that felt they could win anywhere under arsene wenger
