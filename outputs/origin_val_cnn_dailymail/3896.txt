families face a high street easter following evidence some supermarket websites have run out of supplies
the tesco website carries a red letter warning stating : â sorry this product is currently not available â on the vast majority of popular big brand eggs
similarly , the morrisons website is listing many top brands as â out of stock â , while asda âs web store also has only a limited range left
other branded eggs that are apparently sold out include rolo , galaxy , kitkat chunky , toffee crisp , terrys chocolate orange and ferrero rocher
the evidence suggests that the supermarkets have miscalculated demand for the eggs , which have been at the centre of a price war give - away as part of a wider battle to tempt shoppers through the door
industry research suggests the average price of an easter egg is down by 9.7per cent this year following a series of special promotions
morrisons triggered the easter egg crunch by slashing the price of many medium versions of the big brands , such as smarties , rolo and maltesers to just Â£ 1
tesco responded by offering galaxy and minstrel eggs on sale at a half - price Â£ 3 each with more pricey thornton premium eggs for sale with Â£ 2 off
asda and sainsbury âs have been offering their own deals
similarly , the morrisons website ( pictured ) is listing many top brands as â out of stock â , while asda âs web store also has only a limited range left shoppers reported that tesco stopped selling many big brand easter eggs on its website before the weekend and more popular products were added to the list by this morning
all four big brand giant eggs are unavailable , as are six out of eight large eggs and seven out of nine medium eggs
the firm âs website is still offering some more expensive luxury eggs and its own label creations
despite the evidence from tesco âs own website , a spokesman said : â we have a fantastic range of easter eggs available in stores and online , all at great prices and offering some amazing deals for customers
