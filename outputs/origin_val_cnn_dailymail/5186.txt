writer and broadcaster archie macpherson says farewell to mackay on the day football âs legends joined the tynecastle faithful in paying their respects to the former hearts , tottenham and derby county superstar
history is suffused with irony
it will be noted by posterity that on a day when jubilation should have been coursing through the veins of every lover of tynecastle , they were in fact muting the trumpets and draping the halls with black rather than maroon
they came to honour a man who had nât lived long enough to savour the triumphant emergence of his beloved club from near destitution
crowds clap whilst the hearse carrying the coffin of mackay leaves tyncastle stadium for his funeral but the claiming of their new divisional title will now be a permanent reminder of the resilience that mackay bequeathed his club when he strode the turf with a broad - chested imperiousness that was the formidable bridgehead for hearts â triumphs in the 1950s
as they laid him to rest on tuesday you could nât help but think that nature had played a cruel trick in ending his life only several weeks before the confirmation of the end of the struggle for credibility and self - esteem that his first club had been engaged in for so long
mackay must , though , have had an inkling of the course of events which was leading inevitably to that apotheosis
the crowds who thronged the streets as the cortege made its way from tynecastle itself for a remembrance service at mansfield traquair , and who threw their scarves at the procession as if to add sustenance to his last journey , must have believed that even in the later stages of his life he will have been mentally kicking every ball for his former club such was his lasting affection for the gorgie road
the hearse carrying mackay 's coffin was complete with flowers and a football to mark his passing i was a student when i first saw the triumphant hearts side of 1957 - 8 which he captained , when they not only won the title but created a british goal - scoring record of 132 scored and only 29 against
i do nât know particularly why but i do instantly recall a game they played against clyde at the old shawfield where you could be very close to the pitch and , to this day , i will always associate mackay with â glaur
â for there he was yomping his way through the mud like a primeval predator whilst , through his prompting , hearts were playing the kind of slick football that as glasgow boy i thought was simply the preserve of the old firm
and i can not eliminate the image of his sliding into a tackle that took both mackay and the clyde man off the pitch and almost into the dog - track fence which surrounded the playing area
he was nât censured because the ball was what he was after and got
nor was he ever sent off in any game he ever played in from schools football through to the highest senior level , although his reputation for toughness did frankly make some opponents quiver when they saw his name posted on the team - sheet , as sir alex ferguson alluded to , in paying his respects on tuesday
the cortege leaves hearts ' stadium as the city were given the opportunity to pay their final respects â i was playing for queens park reserves against hearts reserves at tynecastle and the great mackay was playing because he was coming back from a broken toe , â said sir alex ferguson
â he tackled me and i thought : â christ ! â but in those days you had to get up no matter what
so i got up and had a look at that big , barrel chest of his and he just said : â are you all right , son ? â that was a great memory - the only time i played against mackay - and i âll never forget it
â nor , when he had gone south to england football , will any of us ever forget the iconic photograph of mackay lifting billy bremner off his feet with a clenched fist , like a boy he had caught picking his pocket
we look at it now with affection
i never saw malice in it
mackay hated the image , as he thought it showed him as a bully
to me , it was like portraying rough - and - ready fatherly instinct
his game never changed with tottenham when , with the likes of the great â white ghost â john white and gilzean , he helped establish a regime at white hart lane with a proud scottish accent which made that ground a fortress and a team feared throughout europe
in that setting it was no surprise that they won the â double â in 1960 - 61 , the fa cup in succeeding years and the european cup winners â cup in 1963
they loved his commitment , his ability to help pull his team back from occasional adversity
the order of service for mackay 's funeral that is why so many notables from the england game travelled to edinburgh yesterday to pay tribute alongside the hearts faithful
his tottenham former colleagues were there
pat jennings , terry medwin , steve perryman , gilzean , mike england , clive allen and cliff jones , who told the congregation : â whenever i hear the bagpipes playing * flower of scotland * i think of mackay - a proud scotsman who never forgot his roots
â gilzean added : â the legacy he leaves is unbelievable for three clubs - hearts , tottenham and derby county
he was a fantastic , inspirational guy
no mountain was too high for mackay to climb
â tuesday âs cross-border representation reflected the fact that they recognised him as one of the best - ever scottish exports to the england game
for some reason we did not see the best of him in a scottish jersey and he did not talk much about being in the side which was devastated 9 - 3 by england at wembley in 1961
within sir alex ferguson âs comments , though , there was also an element of regret about mackay âs record in the sense that he was under - appreciated in certain quarters , pointing to the paucity of caps he earned
â only 22 caps for a player as good as that ? â he lamented
â scotland was picked by a committee with its head in the sand
if matt busby had been manager , he âd have 50 odd caps
â everyone talks about his courage and his bravery , but he was a fantastic footballer
he was skilful , he could play anywhere and he proved that
i think we âve seen the passing of a great legend
â from the master there can be no more fitting epitaph .
