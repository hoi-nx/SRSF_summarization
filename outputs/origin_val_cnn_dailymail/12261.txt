on any other wednesday morning , the steps in front of the joseph-koenig-gymnasium would be packed with kids on their way to class , discussing homework , chattering about last night 's tv shows , or laying out plans for the coming weekend
instead , students approached in silence , carrying photographs and flowers
in small groups , the teenagers lined up to lay tributes to their lost classmates before hugging each other wordlessly , or dissolving into tears
at 10:53 a.m. tuesday morning , this school in the small western german town of haltern was changed forever by events more than 1,000 km ( about 620 miles ) away
a germanwings plane carrying 16 of its pupils and their two teachers home from a school exchange trip to spain crashed in the alps , killing all of those on board
headmaster wessel said when the first reports of a crash came through he was still hopeful , thinking " perhaps they had missed the plane , or perhaps there was a second germanwings flight at the same time
" instead , the worst was confirmed , leaving him " stunned and somewhat speechless , " the community devastated and the classmates of the dead struggling to understand their loss
" a week ago tuesday we sent 16 happy young people and two young colleagues off on a trip , " wessel told reporters
" what was intended as a school exchange ended in tragedy
" of the 16 teenagers killed , 14 were girls , and two boys ; one of the two female teachers who died was a newlywed
in a post on the school 's website , wessel and other school representatives announced the names of the dead , " who will never again return to us , " leaving all those concerned " unutterably sad
" the teenagers who died were : linda bergjurgen , elena bless , lea druppel , selina eils , gina michelle gerdes , ann - christin hahn , julia hermann , marleen koch , paula lutkenhaus , fabio rogge , rabea scheideler , lea schukart , helena siebe , steffen strang , aline venhoff and caja westermann
the two teachers were identified as sonja cercek and stefanie tegethoff
as news of the crash spread , the area at the entrance to the school became a makeshift memorial , filled with red and white candles , notes and swiftly - painted signs
" yesterday we were many , today we are alone , " reads one
" why ? " demands another , with painful simplicity
philippa , a friend of many of those who died , told cnn she was shocked by what had happened : " i knew all of them , they were in my grade
to some i was very close
" we had already planned things for the future , what we were going to do when they returned from their trip
it is very hard to believed that we can not do that
" grief counselors , chaplains and psychologists have been brought in to the school to help all of those involved come to terms with the disaster
" i 've told the students and teachers that we have to accept the sorrow and grieve , " said wessel
" i hope we will all get through it , if we share it
" as the world 's media descend on the town , messages of support have come flooding in too
the local newspaper is running an online book of condolence , in which people can leave messages of sympathy and " light " virtual candles to match the real ones flickering on the steps of the school
" a silent hug says more than many words , " wrote manuela donovang
" wishing the families , friends and relatives strength and comfort in the difficult days and months ahead
" in his message , udo hentschel said the suffering of the parents , friends and families was " incomprehensible , unfathomable " and offered them his condolences : " this , the worst of all fates , will bind us all -- friends and strangers -- closer together
" in an attempt to show that solidarity , schools across the region will share a moment of silence in memory of the dead on friday at 10:53 a.m. , the time the plane crashed
for the classmates of those who will never return , that silence will go on , as the seats they left empty remain unfilled in the weeks and months to come
" our school is no longer what it once was , " said wessel
" in haltern we had 1,283 students
it is horrifying that now we have 16 fewer
