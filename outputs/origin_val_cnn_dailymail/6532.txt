on friday , colorado argued in a filing to the u.s. supreme court that states are free to legalize marijuana following a lawsuit from neighboring states asking the court to shut down its pot law
the filing marks the first time colorado has defended legal marijuana in writing
the federal government did not sue to block the state 's 2012 vote to legalize pot for all adults over 21
colorado said that nebraska and oklahoma should sue the federal government for not enforcing the controlled substances act , not other states
colorado said the states ' ' quarrel is not with colorado but with the federal government 's ' approach to letting states experiment with pot law
' nebraska and oklahoma filed this case in an attempt to reach across their borders and selectively invalidate state laws with which they disagree , ' colorado argued
because federal drug law bans marijuana for any purpose , including medical , colorado argues that blocking recreational pot would also block pot for medical use in 23 states and washington , d.c. the court has not said whether it will hear the challenge
it has no deadline for doing so
the 32 suspects ' charges include violating the colorado organized crime control act , illegal marijuana distribution , money laundering , tax evasion , and attempts to influence public servants
they are all now awaiting trial dates in denver district court .
