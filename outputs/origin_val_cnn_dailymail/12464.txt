pope francis , who succeeded a resigning pontiff exactly two years ago , told a mexican television network friday that he expects his pontificate will be brief
" four or five years , " he told televisa
" i do not know , even two or three
it is a somewhat vague sensation
maybe it 's like the psychology of the gambler who convinces himself he will lose , so he wo n't be disappointed and if he wins , is happy
" francis , who was elected in march 2013 after pope pope stepped down , said his predecessor had reopened a door to more popes emeritus
when asked whether he likes being pope , he enthusiastically responded : " i do not mind
" francis , 78 , said he feels god only wanted him to lead the roman catholic church for a short time " and nothing more
" he said that he would not support putting an age limit on the papacy
he also enjoys calling on the pope emeritus
" it 's like having a wise grandfather at home
one can seek advice , " francis said
francis made similar retirement comments in august when he praised pope for " his beautiful gesture " and said he might do the same thing one day
he told televisa he misses the ability to go out in public without attracting a huge crowd
" i would like ... to go out one day , without being recognized , and go to a pizzeria for a pizza , " he said
also friday , while at a communal penance service at st. peter 's basilica , the pope announced a " jubilee of mercy " will start in december
the theme will end november 26 , 2016 , the vatican said
there have been 26 jubilees since the first in 1300
the most recent was in 2000
