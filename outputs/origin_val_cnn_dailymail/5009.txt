martinez has encouraged toffees âs squad to make history and overcome the problems he believes are preventing english clubs from thriving in europe
toffees âs sole europe trophy came in the 1985 european cup-winners â cup and martinez wants to mark that anniversary by guiding his team to the europa league final
they will reach the last eight by avoiding defeat against dynamo kiev on thursday night
given how wretched their domestic form has been , few would have thought toffees could be the premier league âs last europe representatives and martinez feels they have overcome huge obstacles to get this far
toffees boss martinez has expressed concerns over the quality of dynamo kiev 's pitch toffees players train ahead of their europa league round of 16 second - leg with dynamo kiev toffees currently lead the tie 2 - 1 on aggregate following their win at goodison park in the first - leg premier league sides have won only five of the 28 europe trophies possible since the turn of the millennium and the manager believes the punishing nature of the domestic competition is taking its toll
â our british competition demands every game to be 100 per cent , â said martinez
â teams that play in other leagues in europe , they cruise through games and get through at 50 per cent
it is unfair on british teams
â a break in the winter would enable the players to regenerate and refresh â a key period in the season is february and march so i think the biggest teams are a little bit unfairly treated
the answer is clear â you need to have a bigger squad at this level where you can make five or six changes to keep the team performing at the same level
with the pitch covered up , toffees players are made to train on the running track that surrounds it a cold night in kiev awaits toffees as they look to protect their 2 - 1 lead from the first leg martinez has warned that the poor quality pitch could be a problem for both toffees and dynamo kiev â i find playing thursday and sunday is tough
the europa league teams should play at least at 4pm , and also be given as many home games as possible after they have been away
we should protect our teams a bit more , otherwise we shoot ourselves in the foot
â progress in kiev will not be straightforward
toffees were unable to train on the olympic stadium pitch last night as it was covered in huge white tarpaulins and had heat lamps ready to repair a surface reported to be rain - sodden
martinez , however , is not going to use the pitch as an excuse , as he is far more anxious about the threat dynamo pose

â this experience has been fantastic and we want to progress
â it is an opportunity , something for us to enjoy rather than fear
we want to show everyone what we can do
â there is little doubt the 2 - 1 first - leg win against dynamo , followed by a 3 - 0 dismantling of newcastle , has improved the atmosphere in the squad and helped restore confidence
â it was brilliant to get those two results back to back , â said toffees defender seamus coleman
â we have nât been happy with our league form but it is turning
â we played ever so hard to get into this competition
our goal at the start was to win it
it has been a long time since the club won anything and it would be nice if we could change that
