' the court had previously heard how chau 's parents went with him on the morning of their murder to his friend tse chun kei 's home in tai kok tsui in the west of hong kong
several days after they disappeared , their eldest son chau hoi-ying , wanted to raise the alarm but chau said the pair were visiting mainland china
however , he then sent a whatsapp message to friends admitting that he had killed his parents

the judge described him as ' narcissistic ' and ' preoccupied with fantasies for success ' tse chun-kei ( pictured ) , was cleared of the murder charge but admitted preventing a lawful burial they reported this to police and when officers arrived at a flat belonging to his friend tse , they found his chau 's parents ' heads stored in two large refrigerators
several plastic lunch boxes containing chopped flesh and organs were also found , along with a further three boxes containing salted body parts
the missing body parts are believed to have been cooked and eaten
a pathologist reassembled the skeletons , which had same parts missing
he testified that the couple were stabbed in either their chest or neck before being dismembered
chau told investigators that he wanted to kill himself six months before the attack
police found the heads of chau 's parents inside these refrigerators removed from tse 's apartment police show the weapons used by chau to kill his parents after he invited them round for dinner prosecutors also believe he was angry at his father for refusing to turn the volume down on the tv while he studied and was also annoyed with his mother for forcing him to study the piano
police believe that the couple were murdered and dismembered in tse 's , although he denied taking any part in the killing and was acquitted
however , tse was handed a one - year jail term for the unlawful burial charges but was released from custody due to the length of time he has already spent on remand
prosecutors claimed that chau and tse discussed a range of methods of disposing of the bodies - including mixing the remains with cement and throwing them away as bricks
other plans included cooking the remains and throwing them into the sea
tse said the only reason he helped chau is because he was afraid that his friend would kill his mother
chau first claimed that he did not kill his parents but only helped his friend dismember the remains
he later tried to plead guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility .
