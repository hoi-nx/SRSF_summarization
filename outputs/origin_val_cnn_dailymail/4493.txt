costa may be chelsea 's star striker but he has well and truly misfired in this season 's champions league
chelsea were knocked out of the last - 16 on away goals on wednesday night after the tie against psg finished 3 - 3 on aggregate
and yet again it was another barren night for costa , who has failed to score a single goal in seven champions league appearances - a total of eight hours and 28 minutes of action - this season
costa shows his frustrations during chelsea 's champions league exit on wednesday night psg defender david luiz gestures towards costa during the 2 - 2 champions league draw at stamford bridge costa ( centre ) argues with psg defender thiago silva on a frustrating night for blues fans it pales into comparison with the brazilian - born spain striker 's premier league goalscoring record of 17 goals in 21 appearances
costa has averaged 2.4 shots per game in the premier league , while he could only manage 1.7 in europe 's premier club competition
the 26 - year - old 's domestic shooting accuracy ( shots on target ) is 68 per cent , which beats his european figure of 50 per cent
costa 's failure to score in the competition this season is all the more remarkable when you consider how influential he was in atletico madrid 's run to the final last year
he scored eight goals in nine champions league appearances last season and finished as the competition 's third highest scorer
costa celebrates after chelsea go 2 - 0 up against tottenham hotspur in the capital one cup final - but it was an own goal costa scores chelsea 's third goal in the 5 - 0 win against swansea at the liberty stadium in january in general , costa 's cup record for chelsea has been poor , also failing to score in one fa cup and three capital one cup appearances
some , including the man himself , have argued that he deserves credit for chelsea 's second goal in their 2 - 0 win over tottenham hotspur in the capital one cup final but it was officially given as a kyle walker own goal after a deflection
it aptly sums up his woes for chelsea in the cup competitions this year .
