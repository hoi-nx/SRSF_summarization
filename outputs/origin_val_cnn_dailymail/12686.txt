england 's abject cricket cricket world cup record endures
its team has been eliminated before the group stages of the competition has even finished after a demoralizing defeat to bangladesh , who qualified for the quarterfinals
it means england , who invented the game of cricket but has never won the cricket world cup , still has n't been past the last eight stage of the one - day tournament since 1992
chasing a target of 276 off its 50 overs in adelaide , australia , england slumped to 260 all out , with only jos buttler offering any meaningful resistance
the wicketkeeper struck a brisk 65 after england 's top order failed to lay a platform for victory , before he was dismissed by taskin ahmed
england captain morgan failed again with the bat , lasting just three balls before succumbing to rubel hossain for no score
it marks another miserable display from one of cricket 's supposed powerhouses on the world stage , its only victory in the 2015 competition coming against minnows scotland
whereas other teams in the tournament have taken an aggressive approach , some posting totals of over 400 , england 's modus operandi has looked slovenly and outdated
" pretty poor to be knocked out of a cricket world cup so early , it is very disappointing , " morgan said at the post-match presentation
" i ca n't put my finger on it at the moment
we 've struggled and fought our way since we arrived -- one of our big things was to fight hard and try to get through to the quarterfinals
" our expectations are much higher than this
i 've no idea what happens from here -- it 's a surprise we 're out this early
there will be an inquest over the next few weeks and we 'll go from there
" coach moores is bound to come in for renewed criticism , and the clamor for the return of one of england 's best one - day players -- pietersen -- is sure to grow louder
south african - born pietersen was sacked after the disastrous tour to australia in 2014/15 , the england and wales cricket board saying he was a disruptive dressing room influence
" it 's a hollow feeling at the moment , " moores said after england 's defeat
" you feel like you have let people down
" despite committing a year to prepare for the cricket world cup , england dismissed alastair cook as skipper less than two months before the tournament in australia and new zealand began
mahmudullah was bangladesh 's hero , scoring the country 's first ever century at the cricket world cup , as it recorded one of the biggest wins in its history
