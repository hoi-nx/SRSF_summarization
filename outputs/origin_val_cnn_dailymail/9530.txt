tiffany two , a tortoiseshell feline holds the guinness world record for the oldest living cat and reached another milestone friday when she turned 27 years old
the cat , who was born on march 13 , 1988 in san diego , california has now lived the equivalent of 125 human years
old age : tiffany two , a tortoiseshell feline , pictured , holds the guinness world record for the oldest living cat owner : sharon voorhees , pictured , paid just $ 10 for tiffany two when the cat was just six weeks old and has been caring for her ever since tiffany two 's owner sharon voorhees said she paid just $ 10 for the cat when she bought her from a pet store at six weeks old
she boasts that it was the ' best money she ever spent
' according to the guinness world record the short - haired black and orange tortoiseshell is officially the world 's oldest living cat
sharon voorhees recalls that at the time she bought tiffany two she also purchased two dogs , born around the same time , but they died years ago
meanwhile , she explains that the cat 's unusual name was a tribute to another tortoiseshell cat she owned in the 1970s
and while the 27 - year - old is generally in good health , she does suffer from high blood pressure
tweet : guinness world record tweeted ' this week oldest cat tiffany two turned 27 years old ' but vorhees says she still enjoys roaming around outside and is ' not feeble and still able to go up and down stairs '
years ago , tiffany two had a stint on the open road after she went missing for two years
it 's not known where she went
today , she enjoys staying inside but does venture outdoors sometimes
sharon voorhees said : ' she 's not afraid of anything or anyone
she walks right past the dogs , she 's very feisty ! ' as tiffany two grows old gracefully she still has good sight and hearing and eats both ' wet food and dry food
' however , the record - breaker is not the oldest cat ever recorded throughout history
that achievement belongs to a feline from austin , texas , called creme puff who was born on 3 august 1967 and died on until 6 august 2005 at the ripe old age of 38
milestone : her owner sharon voorhees has kept pictures of her cat 's growth since 1988
