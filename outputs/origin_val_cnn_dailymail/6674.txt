when she was called to ask a question at putin 's press conference , the president chided his press spokesman : ' why did you give her the floor ? ' ms ksenia sobchak told putin : ' i would like to clarify for myself and our audience this fine line between the fifth column and the opposition

' this is the main society talk in good restaurants in moscow
it is either getting citizenship , or residence permits , or the like , ' she said
