but when i looked across , the driver looked in a very bad way
' the impact had ripped off the driver âs door and there were flames in the back of the car
â i tried to make my escape through the passenger door but that was jammed , so i had to clamber over the driver
â the fire was so intense that it was difficult to get to him and on the third attempt i knew it was going to be now or never
â i managed to grab him by his trouser belt and by an arm and with my feet against the vehicle managed to pull him out
â i then managed to carry him 30 metres into the field with the car behind me banging and exploding
