there are no student bathrooms on the school 's lower level , where kaitlin 's classroom is located the grievance 's solution was that kaitlin would have had to go outside and up a flight of stairs to use the student bathroom eighteen female teachers , including two special education teachers , signed a petition that accompanied the grievance against the fourth grader , who has chronic lung disease , pulmonary hypertension and foot problems and is also autistic
the steel valley education association said the contract requires the district to provide ' lavatory facilities exclusively for employees ' , according to the post-gazette
' the bathrooms that have been designated as faculty bathrooms shall be exclusively used by the faculty , ' the grievance said
the student 's mother , tracy montgomery , told the board on thursday that before she got permission to have her daughter use the faculty restroom , school officials said the girl would have to go outside and up a flight of stairs to use a student bathroom , which is what other students have to do

because of her physical disabilities , kaitlin can not walk long distances and her family uses a custom - made stroller for transportation montgomery said that this is just one of kaitlin 's many issues at the school
because there is no elevator from the school 's lower level to the top levels , her daughter is unable to access the music and art rooms for classes montgomery found out about the grievance through a post-gazette article , after which she said she was ' embarrassed for the teachers and appalled
