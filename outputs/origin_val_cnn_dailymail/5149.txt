black cats owner short will decide this week if he needs to sack poyet to keep the club in the premier league
the black cats are one place and one point above the relegation zone following saturday âs humiliating 4 - 0 home defeat against aston villa , in which fans attempted to storm the dugout and thousands more left before half - time
poyet has vowed to fight on despite one win in 12 and no home goal in more than five hours
poyet cuts a lonely figure on saturday as black cats are humiliated 4 - 0 by aston villa fans show their outrage at the stadium of light as the black cats slumped to a record of one win in 12 games striker steven fletcher ( right ) had his head in his hands as black cats crumbled against aston villa however , sportsmail understands that senior figures at the club , including sporting director lee congerton , have told short that poyet is the wrong man to take them forward
there is also concern at poyet âs touchline behaviour - he was sent off against hull and faces an fa charge for kicking the drinks bucket
yet only last year he was hailed a hero after masterminding a dramatic relegation survival
sportsmail looks at the reasons behind the disintegrating relationship
senior club figures , including sporting director lee congerton , say poyet is the wrong man to keep black cats in the premier league duel at the top when black cats sporting director lee congerton set up a deal to bring in atletico madrid âs toby alderweireld in the summer , poyet intervened and let the player âs agent know the defender would not figure if he signed
poyet also blocked a move for manchester city âs micah richards , another congerton target
a source close to the club said : â the relationship between poyet and congerton is as bad as it can possibly be
congerton is doing a good job and is respected within the game but fears his own reputation will be damaged if players he signs are then left on the bench by poyet
â poyet blocked a move set up by congerton for atletico madrid âs toby alderweireld , now at southampton micah richards was also a move that poyet blocked - now he 's at fiorentina on loan from manchester city slim pickings poyet insists he only chooses the team and that transfers are left to congerton
the club hierarchy disagree and point to the arrival of brighton pair will buckley and liam bridcutt , uruguayan sebastian coates and argentine ricky alvarez as players recruited on the say - so of the head coach
all four have failed to impress and have each started fewer than 10 league games this season
then there is the Â£ 3million signing of poyet addition ignacio scocco
the argentine was one of the highest earners at the club but left after just six substitute appearances at a Â£ 1m loss
liam bridcutt ( right ) , along with will buckley , sebastian coates and ricky alvarez , are players signed on the say - so of poyet but who have disappointed ... not to mention the flop signing of ignacio scocco
mixed messages poyet does not know his best team or formation
he started with four central midfielders in the 1 - 1 draw at hull and strikers connor wickham and steven fletcher are regularly on the left wing
players were miffed when he suggested publicly they were not good enough to carry out his instructions
he also upset supporters by claiming they were pining for the â kick and rush â days of kevin phillips and niall quinn
black cats have drawn 14 matches and the football has been dire , one - paced and unimaginative â they have failed to score in 13 of 29 matches
split dressing room poyet believes he retains the support of the players and the likes of lee cattermole speak highly of him , both in public and private
players such as lee cattermole ( left ) speak highly of poyet , but the dressing room is decidedly split but several players and members of the backroom team were shocked when , during the fa cup goalless draw at home to fulham , first - team coach charlie oatway took the team talk

blame game during last month âs 2 - 0 defeat at league one bradford in the fa cup , 4,000 fans sang : â poyet , it âs always our fault
â after that game , poyet claimed that building a â china wall â to keep out journalists would improve his relations with the fans
