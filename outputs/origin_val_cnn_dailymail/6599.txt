details of prices for flights to turkish , visa money , coaches , hotels , taxis and other supplies were found on a diary and planner page in one of the girl âs bedrooms
it also includes sinister tips for how to slip over the turkish border and into is - held territory , scrawled in different handwriting at the bottom of the page
next to each item is one of the initials of the girl âs first name , and appears to show either who was to purchase them or who they were for
below the list of items to buy ahead of the trip is a list of the costs of reaching turkish , and appears to be written in different handwriting
the total cost of the items , which includes Â£ 1,000 plane tickets to turkish and appears to match with an isis online guide for potential recruits , amounts to Â£ 2,190
