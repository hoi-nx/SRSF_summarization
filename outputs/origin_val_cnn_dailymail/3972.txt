while hillary clinton was using a private email address hosted on her own home - based computer server to conduct department business , her agency forced out an ambassador who was doing the same thing overseas
retired air force general gration was us ambassador to kenya for 13 months between 2011 and 2012 , departing after a scathing performance report blasted his leadership style and determined that he created security risks by running his own one - person it department
the report determined that gration ' assumed charge of the mission âs information management operations , ' in embassy nairobi , and ' ordered a commercial internet connection installed in his embassy office bathroom so he could work there on a laptop not connected to the department email system
gration , the department 's office of inspector general wrote , ' continued to use commercial email for official government business ' even when investigators were digging into his conduct
the report noted that he seldom logged on to his official department email account ; the new york times later reported that he ' preferred to use gmail for official business
' clinton , the odds - on favorite to be the democratic party 's presidential nominee in 2016 , came under fire this week for using a private email account â not a department ' state.gov ' address â to conduct government business
her aides , and obama administration colleagues â including white house personnel â reached her at ' hdr22@clintonemail.com ' for the four years she was us 's top diplomat
the revelation has led to accusations that the former secretary failed to turn over all her communications for archiving , as the federal records act requires
additional questions have swirled around potential national security risks posed by having sensitive material flowing through unsecure channels
gration lasted just 13 months as an ambassador before his management style and data security breaches ended his department career clinton helmed the department through the entirety of gration 's tenure as ambassador
the department did not respond to a request for comment about parallels between her case and gration 's
but the 2012 ig report spelled out a policy that it appears clinton herself failed to follow
' it is the department 's general policy that normal day - to - day operations be conducted on an authorized information system , which has the proper level of security controls , ' the report read
' the use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss , phishing , and spoofing of email accounts , as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information
' ' the use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions , ' the inspector general added
' conducting official business on non-department automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies
' secure ? us 's embassy in embassy nairobi , kenya where gration had a commercial internet line installed in his office bathroom so he could communicate out of reach of washington clinton 's emails were never publicly leaked , but some messages sent to her by a close adviser were
the infamous romanian hacker who used the nom - de - hack ' guccifer ' was sentenced to four years in prison for , among other things , breaching the email account of sidney blumenthal , a former clinton aide who later joined mrs. hillary clinton 's 2008 presidential campaign
some of the messages consisted of intelligence reports , sent in late 2012 to clinton 's private address , and covered matters in libya â including the aftermath of the september 11 , 2012 terror attack in benghazi
among the recommendations at the close of the report that ended gration 's career , the ig urged : ' embassy nairobi should cease using commercial email to process department information and use authorized department automated information systems for conducting official business
