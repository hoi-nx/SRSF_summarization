the 26 - year - old made in chelsea star showed off his impressive six - pack while out hiking at the no 1 boot camp in marrakech
former lothario spencer was determined to get toned for the next series of the e4 reality show which starts again on april 13
and it has clearly paid off by the looks of his rippling pecs , biceps and abs. spencer took his girlfriend of five months , lauren frazer-hutton , on the trip - and in the mornings the couple would work - out with a group of 12 other campers staying at the luxury villa
they would take part in grueling sessions of cardio workouts , weights and circuits
in the afternoons they would often go on long romantic hikes together in the foot - hills of the atlas mountains only coming back to the villa for the evening meal
temperatures in morocco got up to 20c and so spencer was often seen walking around with his top off , whilst lauren frazer-hutton wore a pretty pink crop top
spencer looked on a little bemused as lauren frazer-hutton did some stretches on the side of the road spencer stopped to do a few press ups on some rocks , it certainly beats going to the gym ! the good - looking couple spent some time laying in the sunshine as the showed off their impressive tans spencer and lauren frazer-hutton flew out to morocco last week and stayed at the boot camp âs luxury five - star villa just outside marrakech
every morning they were woken at 6am and had an hour of exercise before breakfast
at 8.30am they would have an hour and a half of cardio training â boxing or spinning , followed by a snack at 10am , then circuit training at 10.30am until 12
lunch would be an hour and then they would have long hikes , followed by team games and then yoga and stretching exercise
the evening meal would follow at 7.30pm
spencer and lauren frazer-hutton covered up for part of the walk - the couple have been dating for around five months now despite their tiring work outs spencer still found time to have a bit of a laugh on the mouthain all the meals were prepared fresh on site each day and were all local produce and organic
breakfast would consist of eggs , fresh fruit salad , with a small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice
a typical lunch would be fish or chicken brochettes cooked on the bbq and a selection of salads , and dinner would be a soup and a chicken tagine , all served by the villa âs waiting staff
the calorie intake for each day would be limited to around 1,200 kcal and the output of exercise around 2,000 kcal , and generally most camper lose around 9lbs over the week
