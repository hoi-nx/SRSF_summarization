the 32 - year - old , who spent Â£ 500 on four girls aloud tickets , has now been jailed for 16 months after a judge told her she had ' let her employers and victim down '
the court heard how weare was a carer for fylde community link when the crimes took place over an eight - month period between july 2012 and march 2013
slack , prosecuting , said the victim was unable to read or write , had no concept of the value of money and needed extensive help for day - to - day living
part of her care was provided by weare
he told the court that the victim , who has not been named , had two bank accounts and a locked tin that money would be placed into
there was supposed to be a clear audit trail where any movement of money in or out of the accounts or the tin would be recorded in a cash book and dated
however , one of the victim 's three sisters noted small inconsistencies with the movement of the money , which she raised with the company and also at a safeguarding meeting towards the end of 2012
mr slack said that in february of the following year a community manager at the company noticed a number of discrepancies regarding the bank accounts
he said money withdrawn had not been recorded in the cash book , or on occasions a lower sum had been entered in the book , compared to the amount actually withdrawn
he said it became clear weare had been responsible for the bank withdrawals and she was suspended
further transactions were later discovered
mr slack said : ' the defendant bid Â£ 500 to buy four girls aloud concert tickets
this was in october of 2012
she paid for them in march , three days after she had been suspended
' again , the victim 's bank card had been used
' mr slack added that a textile firm had been paid Â£ 175 , using the victim 's bank card , for 50 metres of organza cloth and there were also payments for mobile phone bills of Â£ 929
in total , Â£ 6,254 was withdrawn from the bank accounts over the eight - month period , the court heard
weare admitted theft and three counts of fraud at the hearing today
the judge was told that the victim had been having nightmares about ' horrible things ' since the incident and no longer felt safe when she went to sleep
weare , 32 , used some of the money she stole to bid on four concert tickets for pop band girls aloud ( pictured ) weare was jailed at court ( pictured ) for 16 months after admitting theft and three counts of fraud
the court heard she had saved up Â£ 3,700 in the hope of compensating the victim for every penny daniel harman , defending , said weare had lost her good character in the most catastrophic way
he said : ' she accrued a large amount of personal debt , run up following difficulties in the marriage and getting in the pocket of pay day lenders
' secondly , there was a significant increase in her alcohol intake and catastrophic errors of judgment , where she took from somebody she had worked for over many years
' he added the defendant was remorseful and apologised wholeheartedly
the court heard she had saved up Â£ 3,700 in the hope of compensating the victim for every penny
jailing her at court , judge simon newell told her : ' this case is n't just about Â£ 6,000
' it is n't just about a substantial breach of trust by a young woman who has no previous convictions , but has used this money for her own purposes
' this is about the distress and devastation of a very vulnerable person
that ca n't be measured in monetary terms because feelings , emotions and life difficulties are something which are immeasurable
' he told weare : ' your employers trusted you , her family trusted you and the woman trusted you
you let all of them down
' referring to the three examples of where the money went , he said : ' none of honest payments are for basic materials you might need in your life , that someone under stress or financial difficulty might require
' the victim has had to wait the best part of two years for justice to be done because in that very long period of time there has been avoidance , evasion and denial
