as the scorer of gilbraltar âs first - ever competitive goal , it was little wonder that history - maker casciaro felt like a rock star when he left hampden park on sunday night
however , as the 33 - year - old ministry of defence policeman would later reveal , he was not the first man from the tiny british overseas territory to make an arresting impact at the national stadium
if the outstanding memory of the 2002 champions league final for most people remains zidane âs exquisite volleyed goal , in gilbraltar it was the sight of local businessman beriro invading the park clad in a kilt and a madrid strip
gilbraltar 's players celebrate after casciaro scored their first ever competitive goal on sunday beriro would later appear on gilbraltar âs version of strictly come dancing , before eventually falling foul of the law and out of the public eye
his place as the most famous man in gilbraltar now passes to casciaro after criminal defending by scotland allowed the cop to race clear , fire low past david marshall and utterly stun hampden park
for the striker , all the years spent pounding the hard yards on pavements and playing in sub-standard facilities were worth it as he followed in the famous footsteps of zidane by scoring a goal to remember in mount florida
casciaro ( centre ) celebrates the goal that will have made him the most famous man in gilbraltar â it was a gibraltarian who jumped out of the stand and onto the park in his kilt and his madrid shirt in that champions league final in 2002
i remember that well , â he beamed
â it was just a dream come true for me to score that goal
it âs unimaginable to get the first competitive goal for gilbraltar
â i do nât think i will get a hero âs reception when i get home
we still lost the game â but it is still an achievement to get the goal
gilbraltar goalkeeper jamie robba celebrates the goal at hampden park , which levelled the score at 1 - 1 â we have only just joined uefa and started to train on a football pitch
all my life , we âve been training wherever we can , running on the road , or for 90 minutes a week on a seven - a - side pitch
â even two or three years ago i did nât think i would be playing for gilbraltar because i did nât think we would get into uefa
everything has happened so fast and we are learning every day
â this goal is something that i will cherish for the rest of my life
i knew it was going in as soon as i hit it
it was a great feeling
â i swapped my second shirt with ikechi anya but i kept my shirt from the first half
i am going to put it up in my house ! but i âm hoping there are more goals to come for me in future
â casciaro ( right ) vies for the ball with scotland 's ikechi anya , who he later swapped shirts with despite ultimately losing 6 - 1 to gordon strachan âs side , casciaro hopes that his own stunning effort will alter perceptions of those who have labelled the minnows little more than a pub team
â i would think we have shown that we are not , â he said
â we are improving and we do try to play football , which is not bad considering we have only just started and were drawn in the most difficult group
we try to create a good game for the spectators to watch
â last june , the first - ever winning goal scored by the british overseas territory - with a 30,000 - population comparable with wishaw - was slotted home in a 1 - 0 friendly win over malta in portugal
that night the history - maker was kyle casciaro , casciaro âs brother , who was an unused substitute on sunday
a third brother , ryan , played in defence for gilbraltar at hampden park in front of proud parents henry and helen
casciaro 's brother ryan , who also plays for the national team , shares a joke with steven fletcher â i âm keeping it in the family , â smiled casciaro
â my mum and dad watch us home and away and they were here today
we have to go to faro in portugal to play our home games , but they have always been there for us
it is thanks to them that we are here
it is a dream for them to have three sons playing at a high level
i do nât think that happens very often in the world of football to have three brothers in an international squad
â with the benefit of having played all the group d teams now , casciaro feels that scotland and ireland â who meet in dublin in june - will be in a battle for third place behind poland and germany
â germany are the world champions and poland are a very strong and physical team , â said casciaro , who jetted off to paris on holiday after sunday 's game
â i think it is between scotland and ireland to finish in third spot
the sunderland man was scotland 's hat - trick hero as he netted the country 's first hat - trick since 1969 â i thought we showed a good reaction after falling behind
and i thought the scottish fans were a bit apprehensive when we equalised
â but scotland âs second and third goals killed us
we are nât professionals and to try and maintain that sort of level was very hard for us
â but our manager davie wilson was very proud of us afterwards
and i think the whole of gilbraltar will be proud as well
