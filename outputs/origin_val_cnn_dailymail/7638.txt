britons overindulge more than holidaymakers from spanish , italian , french and german , who were also polled , saying their holiday began long before their arrival at their chosen destination
britons eat and drink an average of 3,402 calories at the airport and on the plane when they go on holiday a burger king at london heathrow , one of more than 60 food outlets at the airport the survey of 2,607 adults who had flown away for a holiday in the past 12 months shows the average briton consumes between 900 and 1,400 more than health professionals say they should

germans come closest to brits for pre-and - during flight consumption with a total of 3,107 calories , followed by travellers from spanish ( 2,350 calories ) , italian ( 2,311 calories ) and french ( 1,269 calories )
escalators lead up to the cafes , restaurants and bars at london gatwick airport , a facility where travellers like to ' get into the holiday spirit ' ' these numbers are astonishing , particularly when you consider the average male should consume 2,500 calories per day and the average female just 2,000 , ' said jetcost.co.uk co-founder michelat
' women are almost doubling their calorie intake within a matter of hours
' despite reaching for high - calorie treats during this brief period of their trip , brits often save their pennies at the airport and on budget carriers that sell food

sandwiches ( 37 per cent ) , crisps ( 31 per cent ) and sweets / chocolates ( 25 per cent ) were the most popular items taken to the airport by holiday makers , not the healthiest of options
while many choose to buy food on board , 34 per cent of brits bring their own food from home ' we 'd never recommend that anyone consume this many calories per day , let alone within such a short period of time , ' added michelat
' yes , we all like to have a blow out every now and then , but eating this much in one go is very bad for your waistline ! this can be damaging for your health in many ways , particularly with regards to weight gain and conditions caused by weight gain
' if you find yourself getting too carried away with food and drink , why not prepare your own food at home and limit yourself to that ? if you 're on a plane , there 's a good chance that you 're heading off on your holidays and you 're about to have a period of time where you 're going to overindulge for the duration , but try to think of the long term effects
