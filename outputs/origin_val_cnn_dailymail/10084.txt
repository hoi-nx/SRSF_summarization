johnson-thompson and jessica ennis-hill âs burgeoning rivalry has all the ingredients to propel athletics into the spotlight in a similar manner to the sebastian coe and steve ovett clashes which captivated sports fans in the 1980s
â they could have a rivalry like steve ovett and i had , â said sebastian coe
â head - to - heads are what get people excited
my kids got up at the weekend to watch lewis hamilton and nico rosberg
the more opportunities we have for athletes going head - to - head , the better
it âs what people talk about
â it âs actually not just the thought of jess and kat but you have morgan lake , too , coming through and i âm sure she will be equally good
it âs an extraordinary period to be entering
â johnson-thompson won the world indoor 's in prague , czech republic to become world no 1 jessica ennis-hill is the olympic and her future rivalry with johnson-thompson is ' exciting ' johnson-thompson , 22 , is the world âs no 1 hept - athlete and broke ennis-hill âs britain record at the european indoor championships in prague this month
her blistering form â coupled with murmurs from the ennis-hill camp that her training for a comeback after the birth of son reggie is going very well â has set the scene for a mouthwatering duel
the pair are understandably keen to play down talk of a rivalry , johnson-thompson out of reverence for the olympic champion of whom she claims to be â in awe â and ennis-hill because she is unsure what competitive shape she will be in
but those charged with promoting the sport are keen to make the most of the fact that britain boasts the world âs two leading multi-eventers
they were expected to compete against each other for the first time since london 2012 â when johnson-thompson was 15th â at the hypo-meeting at the end of may , when the world âs leading heptathletes descend on the austrian alpine town gotzis
but foster revealed to sportsmail that he is trying to set up a head - to - head for earlier that month at the great citygames in manchester
lord sebastian coe wants the heptathletes to have an exciting duel like he did with steve ovett in the 1980s â kat has already agreed to do the 200 metres hurdles and long jump , â said foster
â jess was invited to take part in the same events and soundings are favourable from her
â with heptathlon they might only battle it out twice a year but if sport in britain is to benefit from the rivalry that is going to be inevitable between these two then they should compete against each other a couple more times head - to - head in one , two or three events
it âs in their interests and very much in the sport âs interest
â both johnson-thompson and ennis-hill , 29 , have the world championships in beijing this summer as their primary aim and will probably be joined by 17 - year - old morgan lake , who has surpassed anything either of them achieved at the same age
johnson-thompson and ennis-hill are friends off the track despite the well speculated competition sebastian coe and steve ovett were great rivals in the 80s and provided huge entertainment for the athletics world with 12 years spanning their ages the three are unlikely ever to stand on the podium together but sebastian coe thinks that they can transform the image of a sport that increasingly seems to command the spotlight only when a new doping scandal emerges
â those three can really help engage , particularly with young girls where the challenge is to get them involved in sport , â he said
â stars like kat and jess are important for the sport
they are from normal backgrounds , they have nât come out of some kind of super-schools , they are like the kids next door and that is really important so that people can identify with them
â the morrisons great newham london run takes place on sunday , july 19 and gives you the chance to run on the track and cross the finish line in the olympic stadium

17 - year - old morgan lake is highly regarded and could add serious competition to the title in the future
