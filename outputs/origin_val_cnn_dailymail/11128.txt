today - champion hurdle horse : faugheen odds : 11/10 he 's called faugheen the machine for a reason and it 's hard to see his unbeaten record coming undone on tuesday , despite the impressive field
usual jockey , ruby walsh , is yet to decide his mount for the race , with stablemate and dual champion hurdle winner hurricane fly also lining up , but with fingers pointing towards faugheen it 's just another reason to back him
wednesday - queen mother champion chase horse : dodging bullets odds : 4/1 all eyes might be on sprinter sacre and sire de grugy , but dodging bullets has easily had the most impressive route to this year 's cheltenham , and although a short price the clarence house chase winner could and should serve up an upset to the front two in the betting
thursday : ladbrokes world hurdle horse : saphir du saphir du rheu odds : 9/2 paul nicholls ' stranglehold at the top of the world hurdle betting has tightened again following rock on ruby 's withdrawal
it 's going to be very hard to pick which of the stablemates will be sent off as favourite , but with saphir du rheu back over hurdles it can only be a good thing
he gallops and jumps well , and his cleeve hurdle win shows he can do it at cheltenham friday-gold cup horse : carlingford lough odds : 10/1 it 's impossible to not back ap mccoy 's last ever ride in the gold cup - it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20 - time champion jockey
there 's still doubts whether favourite silviniaco conti can finally make it third time lucky at cheltenham , but for the old romantics there 's only one man that can win this year 's gold cup , and it 's ap mccoy
