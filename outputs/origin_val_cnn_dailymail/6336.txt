it 's been three weeks since dan was heard threatening to stab his ex-girlfriend - and the mother of his one - year - old son teddy-megan tomlin in an audio recording
but a second audio , handed over by megan , 23 , this week and released by the sun on sunday , hears the 23 - year - old towie star make another expletive - laden rant , threatening to end her life
dan , who was arrested but released by essex police without charge after the last incident , also refers to his second child baby ella , born last month with jacqueline , as a ' mistake
now though , an audio - taped recording - heard by mailonline and allegedly secretly taken by megan last november at her home in front of their young son - sees dan refer to her as his ' property ' and threaten her if she moves on with another man
he is heard saying : ' i swear on this boy âs life i will end your f * * * * * * life if you shag another man
never in your f * * * * * * life are you going to be with another man
i can swear on my son âs life
' split : dan and ex-girlfriend megan tomlin split in aprul 2013 and have a one - year - old son together teddy ' shut your f * * * * * * mouth you f * * * * * * c * * *
if you go near another man i promise you i will stab you in the f * * * * * * throat
' dan made similar threats of physical violence in the first tape released earlier this month but in this latest release megan can be heard exclaiming , ' ow , get off me ! ' and tells dan to stop ' hitting ' her until she seems distressed and in tears
there is no proof that dan actually hits megan in the recording
after asking him to leave her house , he admits , ' yes i am horrible when you go on about other men ' telling her that as long as they have a son together , megan is his ' property ' bouncing back : following the release of the first audio recording , in which dan was heard denying he was dating current girlfriend and the mother of his second child jacqueline , dan is now back in his relationship and expected back on towie throwback : megan and dan are now the parents of teddy , who is one year old dan can be heard telling megan that she ca n't get a new boyfriend even though he 's made another girl pregnant because that was a ' mistake ' and he did n't ' mean ' to get 22 - year - old jacqueline pregnant
megan tells him that it 's laughable because having a child does n't get more permanent but he says things would be different if he ' actually wanted a family with [ jacqueline ] ' or if he was going to ' propose ' to her
' i do n't care
it wo n't be funny when you 're in hospital , ' he says , and referring to a future boyfriend he adds : ' if i 'm going to go to prison , i 'll stab him in the throat
' a representative for dan has been contacted by mailonline for comment

he said : ' it has taken me a while to find the right words but i would like to say that i am truly sorry to anyone who was offended by what they heard
' ' i am ashamed and embarrassed that i allowed myself to reach such a dark place that i behaved in a way that even i did n't recognise
' while i acknowledge that there is absolutely no excuse for my deeply regrettable behaviour , i plead for some understanding that i had no intention of violence
