smoke from burned food in the kitchen can damage the brains of unborn babies , scientists say
similarly , pollution from coal fires and traffic fumes disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour
scans of inner - city children from before birth until aged seven to nine revealed those exposed to high levels of air pollution had lower white matter in their left brain , impairing intelligence and causing adhd and aggression
the us study looked at neurotoxic pah - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - and its effects on the brains of inner city kids
they are contained in vehicles fumes , coal fires or oil central heating systems , power plants , wildfires and agricultural burning , tobacco smoke and hazardous waste sites earlier studies has shown pah can readily cross the placenta and affects an unborn child 's brain and animal studies showed that prenatal exposure impaired the development of behaviour , learning and memory
the study by the institute for the developing mind at children 's hospital los angeles and columbia 's centre for children 's environmental health tested the effects on brain structure of pah exposure during the final trimester of pregnancy
it involved taking brain scans of 40 children in new york , followed from before birth until aged seven to nine
traffic fumes , pollution from coal fires and smoke from burnt food disrupts parts of the developing brain that support information processing and behaviour they were part of a cohort of more than 600 mother - baby pairs from which columbia researchers had previously reported exposure to airborne pah during gestation was associated with multiple neurodevelopmental disturbances
these included development delay by the age of three , reduced verbal iq at five , and symptoms of anxiety and depression by seven
professor of paediatrics and psychiatry peterson said : ' this is the largest mri study to date of how early life exposure to air pollutants , specifically pah , affect the developing mind
' our findings suggest that pah are contributors to adhd and other behavioural problems due to the pollutants ' disruptive effects on early brain development
' results published in jama psychiatry showed reductions in nearly the entire white matter surface of the brain 's left hemisphere
recent research has also found the impact that smoking has on a foetus
image shows the 4 - d ultrasound scan of two foetuses at 32 weeks gestation , one whose mother was a smoker ( top ) and the other carried by a non-smoker ( bottom )
the foetus carried by the smoker touches its face and mouth much more , indicating its development is delayed this loss was associated with slower processing of information during intelligence testing and more severe behavioural problems , including adhd and aggression
postnatal pah exposure - measured at age five - was found to contribute to additional disturbances in development of white matter in the dorsal prefrontal region of the brain , which is associated with concentration , reasoning , judgment , and problem - solving ability
prof peterson explained that the morphological features associated with adhd symptoms in this community sample differed from those previously reported in youth with the disorder , suggesting that exposure to high levels of pah may produce a specific subtype of adhd
although the study involved a small sample of ethnic minority children in poor inner city areas with low educational achievements , a larger study is underway
he added : ' our findings raise important concerns about the effects of air pollutants on brain development in children , and the consequences of those brain effects on cognition and behaviour
' if confirmed , our findings have important public health implications , given the ubiquity of pah in air pollutants in the general population
' new ultrasound images show how babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy touch their mouths and faces much more than babies of non-smoking mothers
experts said the scans show how smoking during pregnancy can mean the development of the baby 's central nervous system is delayed
now researchers believe they can show the effects of smoking on babies in the womb - and use the images to encourage mothers who are struggling to give up
the baby whose mother was a smoker ( top ) and the other carried by a non-smoker ( bottom ) show developmental differences dr reissland , of durham university , said the ultrasound scans show unborn babies of mothers who smoke may have delayed development of their central nervous systems as part of the study , dr reissland , of durham university , used 4 - d ultrasound scan images to record thousands of tiny movements in the womb
she monitored 20 mothers attending the james cook university hospital in middlesbrough , four of whom smoked an average of 14 cigarettes a day
after studying their scans at 24 , 28 , 32 and 36 weeks , she detected that foetuses whose mothers smoked continued to show significantly higher rates of mouth movement and self - touching than those carried by non-smokers
the pilot study , which dr reissland hopes to expand with a bigger sample , found babies carried by smoking mothers may have delayed development of the central nervous system
dr reissland said : ' a larger study is needed to confirm these results and to investigate specific effects , including the interaction of maternal stress and smoking
' she believed that videos of the difference in pre-birth development could help mothers give up smoking .
