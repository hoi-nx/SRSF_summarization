the fbi increased a reward on monday for helping to find robert levinson ( seen left in 2010 and right before he went missing ) who disappeared in iran eight years ago fbi director james comey said ' it is long past time for bob to come home

levinson , disappeared from the iran resort of kish island on march 9 , 2007 , while on a business trip
friends of levinson said that , around that time , he had been investigating the counterfeiting of cigarettes , though mainly in latin america
the fbi has been investigating levinson 's disappearance and the hunt has led them into afghanistan and pakistan - and back to iran
however , two iran presidents - including recently - elected moderate hassan rouhani - have denied having any involvement in his kidnapping or knowing where he is
an ap investigation published in 2013 revealed that levinson vanished while working for the cia on an unapproved intelligence - gathering mission
levinson had flown to the iran resort of kish island in march 2007 on cia intelligence - gathering business when he was kidnapped levinson disappeared from kish island , an iran resort in the persian gulf
the iran government has repeatedly claimed that it has no idea where he is and was not responsible for his kidnapping ' year after year , the family has endured the pain of his absence
it is time for him to come home , ' kerry wrote , also expressing concern for levinson 's health
in november 2010 , a video surfaced in which levinson asked for help in winning his freedom but did not say who was holding him or where he was
the iran government has repeatedly said it knows nothing about levinson 's disappearance or whereabouts
in 2013 sen. mccain said that â the cia did not tell the truth to the congress â about levinson
mccain said he was confident the american is doing all it can to learn what has happened to levinson , but added he was disturbed the obama administration has not been more forthcoming with information about him
levinson was last seen in 2010 when his captors sent a video showing him holding several signs
he had lost weight and begged for help from the american government levinson is seen here with his daughter samantha at one of his favorite restaurants in orlando , florida he said he did n't â think there 's any doubt â about whether iran knows levinson 's fate
after he vanished , the cia at first told lawmakers he had previously done contract work for the agency , but he had no current relationship with the agency and there was no connection to iran
however , in october 2007 , levinson 's lawyer discovered emails in which levinson told a cia friend that he was working to develop a source with access to the iran government
the emails were turned over to the senate intelligence committee , which touched off an internal cia investigation
three veteran analysts were forced out of the cia and seven others were disciplined as a result of a breach of agency rules
the cia paid levinson 's family $ 2.5 million to pre-empt a revealing lawsuit , and the agency rewrote its rules restricting how analysts can work with outsiders
the last photos and video of a bearded , emaciated levinson were released anonymously to his family in 2010 and early 2011
investigators say his trail has grown cold since
top intelligence officials fear that he is dead
tuesday is levinson 's 67th birthday - if he remains alive , he has been held captive longer than any american , longer than ap journalist terry anderson , who was held more than six years in beirut .
