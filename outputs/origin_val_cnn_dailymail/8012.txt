an idaho - based couple has released a censoring app for ios and android
called clean reader it deletes certain swear words from books
alternatives are then suggested when the user taps on the deleted word
shown is an excerpt from gone girl , where ' sh * * * * ' becomes ' crappy ' the app is available now for free on both ios and android devices and was developed by couple jared and kirsten maughan from twin falls in idaho
lady chatterley by d. h. lawrence before : â i do nât want to f * * * you at all
my heart âs as cold as cold potatoes just now
â after : â i do nât want to [ freak ] you at all
my heart âs as cold as cold potatoes just now
â before : â it was not woman âs fault , nor even love âs fault , nor the fault of sex
â after : â it was not woman âs fault , nor even love âs fault , nor the fault of [ love ]
â before : â she threaded two pink campions in the bush of red - gold hair above his penis

â gone girl by gillian flynn before : â the girl is one step ahead of me in everything , even sh * * * * luck

â after downloading the app , users are able to browse a variety of books in the app âs store
when a book is opened , readers can switch between â clean â , â cleaner â or â squeaky clean â settings
the lowest setting only blocks â major swear words , â according to clean reader , which includes â the f - word â
the â cleaner â setting blocks slightly more words , while the highest setting â is the most restrictive setting and will block the most profanity from a book including some hurtful racial terms
â in the books , deleted words are covered up with a grey box , removing them from view
if users click a green dot in the middle of the box , the app will suggest alternative words that the can be used instead
for example , in an excerpt from best - selling novel gone girl , a censored sentence reads : â the girl is one step ahead of me in everything , even [ crappy ] luck
â in another example , a segment of d. h. lawrence âs 1928 novel lady chatterley reads , in â squeaky clean â mode : â i do nât want to [ freak ] you at all
my heart âs as cold as cold potatoes just now
' the famous intro to irvine welsh âs 1993 novel trainspotting , meanwhile , reads : â choose sitting oan a couch watching mind - numing and spirit - crushing game shows , stuffing [ freaking ] junk food intae yir mooth

words , if used correctly , can achieve almost anything
' to tamper with what is written - however much we may dislike certain words and phrases - is to embrace censorship
â we âve been down this road before
we should know where it leads by now
it starts with blanking out a few words
it goes on to drape table legs and stick fig leaves onto statues
' it progresses to denouncing gay or jewish artists as â degenerate â
it ends with burning libraries and erasing whole civilizations from history
â â one day our oldest child came home from school and she was a little sad , â explained the creators of the app. â we asked her what was wrong and she said she had been reading a book during library time and it had a few swear words in it
â eventually we decided we would do all we could to bring clean reader to the world
â the creators note that the app does nât violate copyright law as it does nât make actual changes to the book
â all clean reader does is change the way the content is displayed on the screen , â they note
the app has come under criticism , though , for censoring works by authors - and changing the meaning of the book as originally intended
' to tamper with what is written - however much we may dislike certain words and phrases - is to embrace censorship , ' said author of chocolat joanne harris in her blog
