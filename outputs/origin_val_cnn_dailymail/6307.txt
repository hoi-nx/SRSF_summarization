bale rammed some of the ridiculous criticism he has received in recent weeks from real madrid supporters back down their throats with a first - half double and the perfect goal celebration
the former tottenham forward , who scored 22 goals in 44 games in his first season at the club - including strikes that won the copa del rey and champions league final - has had to put up with whistles in his own stadium and a fan poll that had 40 per cent of supporters calling for him to be dropped in recent weeks
when he put real madrid ahead on 18 minutes in the 2 - 0 win over levante on sunday night he made sure he left off some steam , covering his ears as he ran to the corner to give the flag a celebratory kick
bale celebrates , with obvious relief , after breaking a long scoring drought to put real madrid ahead at the bernabeu the welsh winger covers both his ears to demonstrate that he has not been listening to the boos from the real madrid fans bale ran to the corner flag and kicked it as he let out some pent - up frustration having found the net for the first time since january real madrid 's two expensive superstars both celebrate after bale had diverted cristiano ronaldo 's shot into the corner of the net to make it 2 - 0 real madrid ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : keylor navas ; dani carvajal , pepe , sergio ramos , marcelo ; luka modric ( illarramendi 78mins ) , silva , isco ( jese 69 ) ; bale , benzema ( hernandez 82 ) , cristiano ronaldo

it was his first goal in nine games but with 16 in 38 this season he remains on course to match last year 's haul and the singling out from those jeering supporters and some real madrid - based media had clearly got to him
the only player who did not seem to share his joy was cristiano ronaldo
it was his failed bicycle kick that was cleared off the line and came back out for bale to volley into the top corner
cristiano ronaldo could be seen throwing his arms up in the air at his missed effort both before and after bale had buried the rebound
it was hardly the action of a man playing solely for his team
the welshman scored again five minutes before the break , diverting a cristiano ronaldo shot past marino
cristiano ronaldo 's effort looked as if it was going wide and although bale 's touch was slight it was necessary and he was awarded the goal
bale 's first half performance will have silenced those calls for him to be left out of the real madrid team
the jeers that have followed him around the pitch in recent weeks could even be heard when his name was read out before this win - although those for rested goalkeeper casillas and coach ancelotti were more noticeable
bale almost scored inside two minutes , taking a long ball forward down on his chest and volleying it across the face of goal
he looked motivated and buoyed by the return of luka modric in midfield - making his first start for over three months
bale has come in for plenty of criticism from the la liga crowd in recent weeks , but looked to have found his form at the right time benzema tracks levante 's david navarro as real madrid sought to respond after a poor performance against schalke cristiano ronaldo can not mask his frustration after striking the post with an early chance to put real madrid ahead against levante the world player of the year endured a difficult first half , with his temper bubbling below the surface despite real madrid taking control it was a luka modric shot that marino pushed out to the edge of the six - yard box that benzema turned in moments later but all three real madrid forwards - bale , benzema and cristiano ronaldo - were offside
luka modric then took a corner won by bale and planted it on the welshman 's head only for the effort to go just wide
bale was everywhere in the first 45 minutes , even popping up on the left and drilling the perfect cross to the edge of the six - yard box where cristiano ronaldo somehow managed to fail to get enough on the centre and sent it wide
real madrid had former levante keeper keylor navas playing against his old team
casillas will return for next week 's visit to the camp nou
the stand - in keeper was a spectator for the most part as real madrid dominated and benzema could have made it three in spectacular fashion after the break
he flicked the ball onto the crossbar with a volley from a cristiano ronaldo cross from the right and then caught the rebound again on the volley only to send it tamely wide
cristiano ronaldo also shot straight at marino five minutes from time and skied an effort from the edge of the six - yard box in injury time
it was n't his night but it had been real madrid 's
they moved to within a point of barcelona with the victory
it brings to an end a run of two defeats and a draw and sets them , and bale , up perfectly for next week 's potentially season - deciding clasico
video bale was more motivated - ancelotti cristiano ronaldo nicks the ball past levante 's ivan lopez as real madrid prepared for next weekend 's clasico with a win this acrobatic cristiano ronaldo volley was headed off the line , before bale volleyed in the rebound to give real madrid the lead cristiano ronaldo and bale embrace after the second goal , but the portuguese forward 's immediate reaction has been criticised isco takes on simao down the left hand side while benzema waits for the spaniard to deliver a cross at the bernabeu on sunday night levante goalkeeper marino gets up ahead of bale to claim a cross , but the keeper could do nothing about the welshman 's goals dani carvajal holds off the challenge of kalu uche on what proved to be a comfortable night for the home side in la liga cristiano ronaldo sees a shot saved by marino on a night where he looked desperate to score , but found his way constantly blocked
