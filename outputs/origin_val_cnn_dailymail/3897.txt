maxwell scored the second - fastest century in world cup history as australia secured their place in the quarter - finals with an exciting 64 - run win over sri lanka
maxwell brought up his maiden one - day international hundred off 51 balls , one more than o'brien took during ireland 's famous win over england four years ago , as australia ran up a daunting 376 for nine batting first in sydney
maxwell struck 10 fours and four sixes in his 102 while steve smith ( 72 ) , captain michael clarke ( 68 ) and shane watson ( 67 ) were also among the runs as the tournament co-hosts made hay after winning the toss at the sydney cricket ground

the 37 - year - old kumar sangakkara , who is retiring from odi cricket after the tournament , scored 104 off 107 balls to follow up his tons against england and bangladesh

chandimal had blazed 52 off just 24 balls but he was struggling with a what looked to be a hamstring injury and was unable to continue
once he departed , sri lanka subsided to 312 for nine and - with chandimal not reappearing - australia were able to celebrate their third victory in group a and a place in the last eight

he had a life on 95 when kumar sangakkara spilled a steepling catch running back , but still looked on course to claim o'brien 's world cup record for the fastest ton
however , maxwell - who admitted after the match he was not aware what the record was - just missed out before seeing his power - packed stay at the crease ended soon after by thisara perera
his innings proved the difference in the end though , as sri lanka 's valiant run chase fell short despite kumar sangakkara 's record - breaking ton
