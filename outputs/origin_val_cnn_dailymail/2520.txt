organic , free range and grain fed are some of the terms commonly found on food labels in the supermarket - but are they really what they claim to be ? consumers are becoming more aware of choosing healthy and sustainable foods after 18 people became infected by hepatitis a last month from supermarket - bought frozen berries imported from china to australia
the terms ' free range ' or ' free to roam ' pop up on egg packaging in the supermarket but it does n't all mean the same thing , according duncan , general manager at sustainable table
' in the absence of such labelling laws , it is best to look for " certified free range " or " certified organic " products , although the standards can vary between different certification bodies , ' ms duncan told daily mail australia
there are several organisations that certify egg producers , but the ease of access chickens have to the outdoors in sunlight and the number of birds housed in one area can vary
consumer group choice is currently campaigning for a nationally enforceable standard for free range in australia
' credence claims are often used by business in a bid to get consumers to pay a premium and encourage you to buy their product ahead of a competitors , ' choice 's tom godfrey said
' our research has found relying on claims such as free range when making a purchase is largely a waste of money
' the terms ' free range ' or ' free to roam ' pop up on egg packaging in the supermarket but it does n't all mean the same thing , according duncan , general manager at sustainable table organic in similar circumstances to free range , organic is a term also abused on product labels because there are no laws or regulations in the country
' you can only be certain that you are purchasing truly organic or biodynamic produce and products if it has been â certified organic â by one of the seven recognised certification bodies that are accredited and audited by the australian quarantine inspection service , ' ms duncan said
' what people forget is that organic farming is actually the traditional way of farming
' organic farming nurtures the soil by using compost and other organic fertilisers
conventional farming uses synthetic fertilisers , pesticides and herbicides ... to protect plants from pests
' many brands can push the organic or natural term by relying on trademarked names even if it includes preservatives , according to choice
consumers are warned to look out for certified logos on organic products produced in australia
' some smaller producers follow organic principles but have not sought certification due to the cost involved , so always ask questions of your farmers ' market producer if you are unsure , ' ms duncan said
organic is a term also abused on product labels because there are no laws or regulations in australia grain fed this is where animals including chicken and cattle are fed a predominately grain - based diet
the feedlot industry , which is an extensive outdoor feed environment where animals are sent to be fattened before slaughter , has grown drastically in the last 10 years due to demand
there are about 700 accredited feedlots in the country with large ones holding up to 40,000 cattle at a time
while the rspca does n't oppose feedlots , the organisation has raised concerns and listed conditions that must be met to ensure good animal welfare
grain fed animals can have a damaging effect on the environment , according to sustainable table , because it is resource intensive as grain has to be grown and often transported to where the animal is being housed sustainable table says the process of grain feeding can be damaging
' grain feeding is resource intensive and can be environmentally destructive , as grain has to be grown and often transported to where the animal is being housed , ' ms duncan said
' grain production is also being diverted to animals as opposed to being grown primarily for human consumption
' it is estimated that the world 's cattle consume enough food to feed 8.7 billion people , which is more than the entire human population
' fresh while supermarkets regularly promote fresh and natural items that seem like the next best thing to growing your own organically , choice says beyond the packaging it 's a different story
' fresh ' may conjure up images of hand - picked produce only hours old , but in fact it may only mean it has n't been preserved by freezing , canning , high - temperature or chemical treatment , ' the consumer groups says
' it may have been refrigerated and spent time in processing and transport , but it 's still ' fresh '
' while supermarkets regularly promote fresh and natural items , it may only mean it has n't been preserved by freezing , canning , high - temperature or chemical treatment pole and line caught there are various canned tuna options on supermarket shelves , but greenpeace says consumers should always look for the pole and line option where fish are caught one by one with a hook and line
they say fewer sharks , turtles , whales and dolphins will be killed because pole and line fishing is selective and more fisherman are employed in the process
former chef and host of gourmet farmer afloat , evans , has been campaigning for better labelling on things like canned tuna so people can make informed choices
' pretty much every can of tuna will say made in thailand because that âs the world home of where they tin tuna , ' mr evans said
' but it might not come from that water
it can come from anywhere in the world
if you do nât tell us where it was caught , saying it was tinned in thailand is just a small part
' mr evans said labelling laws enabled seafood in australia to be labelled ' made in australia ' even if it was caught somewhere else and just repackaged here
' if more than half the value is added , it 's okay , ' he said
' i bought some supermarket flathead in melbourne , but it was actually an argentinian stick fish
legally it is allowed to be called that because of labelling laws
' former chef and host of gourmet farmer afloat , evans , has been campaigning for better labelling on things like canned tuna so people can make informed choices he says about 70 percent of seafood in australia is imported but consumer have been kept in the dark he says about 70 percent of seafood in australia is imported but consumers have been kept in the dark
' i do n't have a problem with imported seafood if it 's produced sustainably , ' he said
most tuna is currently caught using large - scale industrial fishing methods , which threaten fish stocks and the marine environments that support them
but pole and line fishing is a more sustainable way and most brands and supermarkets stock tuna caught in this way
' pole and line fishing is seen as the most sustainable way of catching tuna because it is literally a pole with a fishing line on it , ' ms duncan said
' ( it ) means total catch is easier to monitor , and it âs easier to avoid â by - catch â , which is when unintended fish species get caught in nets and in other destructive fishing techniques
' mr evans is calling on companies to better label its seafood so people know what species they 're eating , where it was caught and how it was produced
mr evans is calling on companies to better label its seafood so people know what species they 're eating , where it was caught and how it was produced pole and line fishing is a more sustainable way to fish for tuna and most brands and supermarkets stock tuna caught in this way ' the only way we can make a conscious decision to choose sustainable seafood , is by knowing for a start , what we 're eating , ' mr evans said
' i want people to know what they 're eating so that they think about their seafood and they do n't see the ocean as this bottomless pit that will provide seafood forever
' our choices can make a difference and all we need to do is ask what 's on our plate
' some people wo n't care
they will always buy the lowest price
but until we have that information , we have no power to make that choice
