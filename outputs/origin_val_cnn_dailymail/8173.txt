â just five days ago the family were celebrating after he was a medal winner at crufts , the world âs most prestigious dog show
but a little over 24 hours later their life was ripped apart when without warning he fell into a coma and died in their arms
now the family has released a collection of photographs of jagger and his ' best friend ' , nine - year - old jeremy as they vow to find the culprit of the dog 's death
the irish setter died in suspicious circumstances last week , his owners convinced he was the victim of meat poisoning mrs lauwers shook with emotion yesterday as she told the mail â to the person who has done this i would say : i hope you can sleep well knowing you have killed my beautiful child
â he was our love , our family member and the very best friend to our son
â we are still in a state of shock
â my son is devastated
he does not know how somebody could be so cruel and do this to an innocent and helpless animal
â why would anyone want to cause jagger such a slow and painful death ? she realised something was very wrong when jagger âs jaw dropped and he started to tremble after they returned from crufts to their large detached family home in the quiet village of lauw in east belgium on friday evening
she said : â i thought he was having a heart attack but he fell into a coma
â the vet arrived very quickly , but it was too late
within fifteen minutes jagger was dead
â lauwers ( pictured with jeremy and the litter jagger was born part of ) said she and her son was struggling to cope with the dog 's death jagger was born in britain on 1 may 2011 , the son of prize winning dog mr jingles who retired earlier this year
his pedigree name was thendara satisfaction , after the kennels run by his co-owner dee milligan-bott
the lauwers bought him as a 10 - month old puppy for around Â£ 850
by then he was affectionately known to all as jagger
at the time the lauwers posted a picture of him on their website with the caption : â we are all looking forward to a great fun in the future with this stunning boy
â mrs lauwers said : â he lived with us but knew he had a mum and dad in england too
he was a loyal and dedicated pet
â from the start he won them over with his sense of adventure , and was particularly close to the couple âs now nine - year - old son , jeremy

jagger followed in his father âs footsteps and was soon picking up awards and commendations at dog shows
at just over a year old he was crowned luxembourg junior champion and a few months later finished second in the junior day belgium competition
the following year he finished second in a category at the east of england championship show , prompting the lauwers to post : â our boy did us proud
â the three - year - old irish setter was ' best friend ' to the couple 's son , jeremy
the family have vowed to find the person responsible for his ' slow and painful ' death the family bought jagger , whose pedigree name was thendara satisfaction , as a 10 - month old puppy
above , the animal with his litter the lauwers said when he travelled to crufts he was in terrific form and there was no indication of any problems , and certainly no suggestion that anyone meant to harm him
gillian barker bell , a judge at the show , said when she saw him for the mid-limit class at 2.30pm on thursday he looked â absolutely fine â and that his subsequent death was â incomprehensible
â mrs lauwers said they would not let jagger 's death stop them from competing again in the future she added : â he did not look ill. the rules say if you think a dog seems ill you excuse him the ring
â mrs lauwers said the only time he was alone during the competition was when he was on the bench awaiting to perform
â that is the only time it could have happened
it was the only time he was unsupervised
â that is also the time people come and see the dogs , which is something we fully support
â after jagger âs death a vet found cubes of meat laced with a slow - acting toxin in his stomach and the family contacted local police
toxology tests will be completed by the end of the week which should determine the cause of death , amid suggestions they could be rat poison or slug repellants
before then jagger will be cremated
mrs lauwers said : â we will hold a little memorial service with my husband and son to say goodbye
â we will then scatter his ashes over the fields and woods by our house where he used to love going for a walk
â i will be back at crufts in the future
â i think he was just the wrong dog at the wrong place at the wrong time
â i wo n't let the pitiful actions of one mindless idiot put me off doing what i love
â i will return in future and i will compete in his honour
â i will win in jagger 's memory
â mrs lauwers and her husband william ( above outside their home ) said they believe their dog was in ' the wrong place at the wrong time '
