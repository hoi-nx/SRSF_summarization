teenager ash handley scored on his home debut as leeds moved to within two points of super league leaders st helens with a hard - fought 26 - 14 win over wigan in front of a bumper 18,350 crowd at headingley
ash handley , drafted in for only his second senior appearance as a replacement for shoulder injury victim tom briscoe , was among five different try scorers as the leeds overcame the absence of skipper sinfield to condemn wigan to a third defeat in six matches
sutcliffe proved an able deputy for the injured sinfield , scoring a try and kicking three goals , but leeds ' hero was australian prop cuthbertson , who also scored a try and proved a real handful for the visitors with his powerful running and skilful ball handling
teenager ash handley scored the second try for leeds on friday night leeds , who handed a recall to full - back zak hardaker pending the outcome of a disciplinary investigation , were good value for their fifth win of the campaign but could never relax against their injury - hit opponents
the home side made the brighter start without finding the finishing touches and wigan , captained by leeds - born hooker michael mcilorum , opened the scoring from their first real attack , with centre anthony gelling breaking clear to get the supporting smith over after 10 minutes
smith kicked the conversion and added a penalty six minutes later after cuthbertson was pulled up for a high tackle on williams to make it 8 - 0
however , the warriors made a hash of the restart and never touched the ball for the next eight minutes as leeds struck a purple patch with three tries
substitute brad singleton went over for the third try for leeds cuthbertson , who qualifies for england , got the first , following up a grubber kick on the last tackle by hooker paul aiton and was also involved in a sweeping move that was finished at the corner by ash handley
the former newcastle knights forward then produced a superb short pass to get substitute brad singleton over and sutcliffe kicked his second goal to make it 18 - 6
wigan finally managed to stem the tide and struck back four minutes before the break when left winger joe burgess caught williams ' kick on the full to dive over for a spectacular try , which was goaled by smith to cut the gap to just two points
defences got on top in the second half , with wigan having to do most of the work as the leeds gained the momentum
referee richard silverwood gave the visitors a team warning after they conceded a string of penalties and the pressure told on the hour when sutcliffe stretched out of a two - man tackle to score his side 's third try
sutcliffe was off target with the conversion attempt but succeeded with a penalty five minutes later after he was tackled by wigan 's farrell from an offside position
farrell was sin - binned for the offence and the leeds made the most of their man advantage when substitute rob burrow forced his way over from dummy half with 11 minutes to go .
