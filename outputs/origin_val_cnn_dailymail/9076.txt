a friend of jewish schoolgirl anne frank has told of the moment the two were reunited at a nazi concentration camp - where she found her 15 - year - old friend emaciated and wrapped only in blankets as she struggled to survive the camp 's harsh conditions
nanette konig , 85 , had known anne frank from school and had attended the teenager 's birthday party where she received the infamous diary in which she went on to detail her life hiding from the nazis
after being captured , the classmates spent around two years apart before being reunited in the bergen-belsen concentration camp in german
recalling their chance encounter within the camp , mrs konig said : ' she was depleted , wrapped in blankets because her clothes were full of lice
she has now recalled the moment her friend anne frank was given a diary which she later used to detail life hiding from the nazis mrs konig holds the yellow star she was forced to wear while living in amsterdam under nazi occupation ' it was really awful because she had completely wasted away
there was nothing left of her
even today i do n't know how we two skeletons could have recognised each other
' now mrs konig pays tribute to anne frank , who died aged 15 , just weeks before the camp was liberated 70 years ago
the pair were just two of the millions of jewish rounded up into concentration camps following persecution from the nazis
more than six million jewish were killed worldwide in the genocide
anne frank 's parents margot and otto frank were deported to a transit camp with anne frank and her sister margot and then on to auschwitz
when anne frank and her sister were taken to bergen-belsen concentration camp in october that year , mrs konig spotted her friend through a barbed wire fence
mrs konig said : ' i saw anne frank walking on the other side of some barbed wire
' i could n't go near it though , i would have been tortured or killed
' but when the wire was taken down and mrs konig next spotted her friend , she grabbed anne frank 's attention and the girls met up to talk several times
' i am the only one in that class who met her again in bergen-belsen concentration camp
i was in camp seven and she was in camp eight
' i met her several times and it was from anne frank that i learnt what was happening in auschwitz
' she told me about her diary and that she wanted to use it for a book after the war , she never wanted to publish a diary
' we talked about her going in to hiding , how hard life was in the hiding place
' mrs konig recalled how the girls were aware of the terrifying circumstances they were in
anne frank died aged 15 at bergen-belsen concentration camp
her diary detailing the time her family spent hiding from the nazis has sold more than 30million copies she said : ' we were dreaming and we had to hope we would make it through
it was part of our survival
' we were mature - the circumstances made us like that
we had all lost family and did n't know if we 'd see them again
everyone wanted to survive , nobody wanted to die willingly
' anne frank 's diary was first published in 1947 and has been translated into 67 languages with more than 30 million copies sold
recalling the moment anne frank received her gift as a birthday present , mrs konig said : ' anne frank wanted to use the pages of her diary to write a book
' we were dreaming of the future , it was part of our survival
' she always wanted to be seen and heard
anne frank was a girl who was full of life , she loved to talk and liked the boys
' if she was still alive , i am convinced that she would have become an excellent writer
in the end , she got her wish to be a published author
' mrs konig , who was one of 60,000 survivors liberated from bergen-belsen concentration camp by british forces
' i saw anne frank shortly before she died , ' mrs jonig said
' bergen-belsen concentration camp was n't a death camp but the conditions eliminated people
she did n't make it and i did
i still see her in front of me
' mrs konig , who now lives in sao paolo , brazil , with her husband , john , went to school with anne frank in amsterdam during the nazi occupation
in 1941 , they were classmates at the jewish lyceum , a school for jewish children no longer allowed to attend normal schools
the frank family had already fled german following persecution and moved to the netherlands along with 300,000 other german jews
the pupils in these schools were taught by jewish teachers who had been removed from their posts at normal schools
mrs konig said : ' i sat behind anne frank in class and we were friends
i remember she always wanted to be seen and heard
' we were all friends in class
we were aware of the circumstances so we all supported each other
' you knew leaving the house , you might not make it back
' by march 1942 , thousands of jewish had been persecuted and the first trainload had reached auschwitz concentration camp in poland
headstones mark the location of mass graves at the site of the concentration camp bergen-belsen concentration camp , where anne frank died pictured are the interior barracks at auschwitz , auschwitz , where anne frank and her mother were detained for part of the war the curfew enforced between 8pm to 6am meant that the children were unable to see each other in the evenings
but on 12 june 1942 , the children in mrs konig 's class got the chance to spend time together when anne frank turned 13 years old
at that birthday party konig watched anne frank open her parent 's present - a diary
she said : ' all of our classmates were there
i remember some films were projected onto the walls â for us it was such a novelty
' in july that year , anne frank 's family disappeared leaving a note claiming they were moving to switzerland
instead they went into hiding inside anne frank 's father otto 's jam business
jews were forced to wear a yellow star on their clothes to identify them and were routinely rounded up to be shipped to concentration camps
the family stayed undetected for two years inside the secret complex , hidden on the top floor of the business
in february 1944 , mrs konig was taken to bergen-belsen concentration camp , unsure whether she would ever see her friend again
in august 1944 , everyone hiding in the secret annex inside the business was arrested
the family had been betrayed but it has never been established by who
auschwitz ( pictured ) was used as a death camp by the nazis during the second world war
although anne frank was transferred out of the prison , she later died at bergen-belsen concentration camp pictured is the main entrance to auschwitz , where trainloads of jewish prisoners were carried into the facility a pile of shoes offer a chilling insight into the wholesale slaughter which took place at the nazi death camps pictured is a pile of the auschwitz victims ' luggage , inscribed with their initials and place and date of birth she remembers the roll calls at the camp
' they made us stand for 36 hours , ' mrs konig said
' they pulled me out and when they did i began to shake because i did not know what would happen
' i was really lucky because the officer fired into the air and sent me back into the row without torturing or killing me
i survived by pure chance
' when she was able to , anne frank talked to her friend about wanting to become a published author
but she would not live to turn her diary in to a book herself
in march 1945 , anne frank and margot both contracted typhus - a bacteria carried by lice and ticks - just three weeks short of the british forces liberating the camp
after the war , anne frank 's father otto met with mrs konig and told her he was considering publishing his daughter 's diary
mrs konig recalled : ' i said , ' do it
' then in 1947 the first diary was published
i think anne frank would be pleased with it
' anne frank told mrs konig ( pictured ) that she always wanted to be a writer and hoped to publish her diary after the war had ended in 1949 , mrs konig moved to london , got a job as a bilingual secretary and shortly afterwards met her husband , john konig , 88
two years later , they married and moved to south america together , to start a family
the couple of 62 years have three children , elizabeth , judy and martin
now mrs konig spends her time travelling around the world , giving presentations in schools and universities , to educate people about the holocaust
she said : ' if by chance you survived , you have a duty to speak for those who ca n't
' so that the world knows the disaster to the jewish community
but above all , so that a thing like the holocaust never happens again
' two thirds of the community - nine million people - lost their lives
