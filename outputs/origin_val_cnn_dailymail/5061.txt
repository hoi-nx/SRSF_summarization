bobby smith , 60 , a homeless veteran returned the ring engraved with todd 's name last week after finding it among stones in a creek in san luis obispo , california while searching for arrowheads

he called todd last month to tell him he found the ring , which he took to a couple of sports shops to have it authenticated
todd said he was thrilled to have the ring back , which he said he would have over a super bowl ring ( pictured above ) any day one shop owner offered him $ 2,000 for the ring while another suggested they sell it on ebay and split the profits
bobby smith , who met todd for the first time on fox and friends last thursday in new york , said he told one shop owner : ' yes , i 'd like to take the money , but no , i ca n't , because it would n't be the right thing to do , because if it was my ring , i would certainly want it back
' todd said he was thrilled to have the ring back , which he said he would have over a super bowl ring any day
' we went through so much together as a team and community
the ups and downs , the adversity , the microscope we were under , ' he said
' those challenges were unlike any other that we had to deal with
it was a magical season for sure
but that ring had all of those emotions tied up in it , ' added todd
todd has since set up a gofundme page and said half of the proceeds will go to bobby smith and the rest will be given to other homeless veterans
