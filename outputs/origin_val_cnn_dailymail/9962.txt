parents are in danger of being reported to police by their children 's head teachers if they allow them to play video games for over 18s
a letter sent by a group of schools in cheshire raised concerns about the ' levels of violence and sexual content ' young people are being exposed to by playing games such as call of duty and grand theft auto , which are renowned for their violent characters and have an 18 classification
it warns that if teachers are made aware their pupils have been playing these video games they will contact police and social services
it comes amid fears children could be left more vulnerable to grooming and abuse by being exposed to early sexualised behaviour as well as extreme brutality , often seen in video games in the upper age classifications
the letter says : ' call of duty , grand theft auto , dogs of war and other similar games , are all inappropriate for children and they should not have access to them
' nor should they have facebook accounts or interact on sites or media or messaging sites like whatsapp that are not designed for their age
' nantwich education partnership covers 16 primary and secondary schools in cheshire
the letter also warns : ' if your child is allowed to have inappropriate access to any game or associated product that is designated 18 + we are advised to contact the police and children âs social care as it is neglectful
' the teachers claim the games can expose children to sex and violence , making them vulnerable to abuse there is now more pressure on teachers and social workers to report concerns about children after david cameron announced they could face up to five years in prison if they do not speak out about suspicions children are being neglected or abused
department for education guidance on safeguarding also urges school staff that they have a responsibility to identify children who are likely to suffer significant harm
headteacher mary hennessy jones , who helped draft the letter , told the sunday times : ' we are trying to help parents to keep their children as safe as possible in this digital era
' the letter was sent by a group of primary and secondary schools , warning people over the dangers video games with an 18 classification are known for their violence
call of duty allows players to take on the role of a blood thirsty soldier in a number of violent scenarios - arming themselves with an arsenal of weapons including rifles , pistols and grenades
the game has been mired in controversy , with norwegian mass killer anders breivik claiming he had trained himself to kill his 77 victims through playing the game
games such as grand theft auto are renowned for their violent scenes and brutality towards women grand theft auto is well known for its violence which includes carjacking , gambling , killing and simulated sex with prostitutes
last year grand theft auto v was removed from the shelves of australian stores target and kmart amid fears that the game glamorises violence against women
however the message from nantwich education partnership has been criticised by parents as going too far , and threatening parents rather than helping them
margaret morrissey , of parents outloud , told the newspaper : ' accepting the huge concerns about these violent games and their effect on children , i think the schools are stepping outside the realm of what is probably acceptable
' but she acknowledged that there is no a ' huge pressure ' on teachers to report safeguarding concerns , placing them in an impossible situation
call of duty allows players to inhabit the role of a blood - thirsty soldier in a variety of grusome scenarios
gamers are armed with machine guns , rifles , pistols and grenades and play a fast - paced game of kill or be killed
