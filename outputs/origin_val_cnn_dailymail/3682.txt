gorillas are considered to be highly intelligent mammals
so much so in fact that one named koko was able to learn a subset of sign language
but one cheeky gorilla showed off a form of its own sign language while being filmed at a wildlife park â by appearing to give the middle finger
the blackback gorilla can be seen annoying its fellow ape by sticking up his middle finger captured at busch gardens in tampa , florida , us , the large silverback gorilla can be seen interacting with an older blackback
picking up a toy , the blackback throws it at the silverback who protects itself by lifting a hand to its face
continuing to annoy the silverback , the blackback reaches over and picks up the toy as if intending to throw it again
but before he gets the chance , the silverback casually gives it the middle finger
the video maker and the surrounding people can be heard laughing in shock at the cheeky gesture being made by the large mammal
responding in playful fury , the blackback once again throws the toy against the silverback before picking it up a few more time and repeating the process
writing online about the experience , the filmmaker said : â a very spunky blackback gorilla continues to pester the older silverback to play with him
to the surprise of the group of people behind the camera the silverback gorilla appears to give its fellow ape the middle finger â his tactic was to throw a â kong â at his fellow gorilla âs head , as if that was going to coerce the old gorilla into play mode ! then this happened ! â silverback gorillas are generally more than 12 - years - old , and feature a distinctive patch of silver hair on their backs
they also have large canine teeth , and like other great apes have the ability to laugh , grieve , make and use tools and develop loving bonds with their families
the blackback responds to the gesture by throwing the toy against the silverback a few times more
