terry is going to cause chelsea a huge problem in the future and the cost to fix it will be enormous
there will come a point one day when jose mourinho is no longer able to rely on his captain and , privately , he will be dreading when that time comes
the term to describe terry âs influence on this chelsea team is the same as the one you would label his performance at wembley stadium : colossal
jose mourinho âs brilliance as a manager can not be overstated
wherever he goes , he is successful and he has won trophies with any number of different players
some managers need big individuals to get them over the line but jose mourinho does it regardless of who he is working with
terry 's current form for chelsea is arguably as impressive as it was 10 years ago terry scored the opening goal of the game in the recent capital one cup win against tottenham premier league : 2004 - 05 , 2005 - 06 , 2009 - 10
fa cup : 1999 - 00 , 2006 - 07 , 2008 - 09 , 2009 - 10 , 2011 - 12
league cup : 2004 - 05 , 2006 - 07 , 2014 - 15
community shield : 2005 , 2009
champions league : 2011 - 12
europa league : 2012 - 13
with terry , however , the case is different
when chelsea won the league cup 10 years ago â the first of the five trophies they lifted during jose mourinho âs first reign â the side was built around a formidable spine of petr cech , terry , claude makelele , frank lampard and didier drogba
all those players have been subsequently replaced with one notable exception
terry was as good against tottenham as he was against liverpool at the millennium stadium in 2005 and you have to ask when the time comes to fill his shoes , what will the price be ? when you think manchester city paid Â£ 32million for eliaquim mangala last summer and david luiz cost paris saint-germain Â£ 50m , you get an idea of how difficult it will be to find someone with terry âs many qualities
on these pages 14 months ago , i described terry as the best defender in premier league history and one moment towards the end of the game on sunday showed why he has stayed at the top of his profession for so long
terry is the only player that remains from the old spine of the chelsea team , the others have been replaced jose mourinho recognises the importance of his captain ad will be keen to retain his services the game was won but tottenham were looking to grab a consolation and it looked like it might arrive when harry kane wriggled into the area
he was denied , though , by terry putting his body on the line to make sure chelsea âs goal was nât threatened
during the world cup last summer , i complained that there was a lack of great central defenders playing now â the type who will do the dirty work and would kill for a clean sheet
terry is one of the remaining few
as a player , i hold him in the highest regard and his consistency has been remarkable
sometimes i do nât think it gets appreciated how difficult it is to stay at one club for your entire career , especially in the position john has filled
i know what it is like to get beyond 30 and have people writing you off on the basis of your age , the constant questioning of â is he the same as he used to be ? â
a bad game and the scrutiny comes on you
there is an added pressure for defenders
when you are not at your best , you know that one mistake and you will be the one who costs the team the game ; midfielders or strikers can be taken off but as a defender there is nowhere to hide
paris saint-germain paid Â£ 50million for david luiz , who was considered surplus to requirements at chelsea manchester city paid Â£ 32m for eliaquim mangala but did n't feel comfortable starting him against barcelona but john has never hidden , not even after the campaign two years ago when he made just 14 appearances
this season he is up to 36 and playing as well as he has ever done , leaving some to ask whether he could play for england again
wisely , he has ended such talk
he might be the best english defender but he is not needed for the euro 2016 qualification campaign , as england have already qualified
the extra recovery time he now has between games helps his form and who is to say he will be playing so well in 18 months anyway ? the future for england is players such as john stones and calum chambers
concentrating on chelsea is best for him
he is yet to sign a deal but i do nât for one moment expect the stamford bridge hierarchy to let him slip out of the club
he is too valuable and given how jose mourinho sets his team up , he could play for at least another two years
gary cahill and kurt zouma are good players but without terry , i would not be confident about chelsea winning the premier league next season
if he was to leave , there would not be a team in the top flight who terry would not improve
jose mourinho knows this better than anyone
gary cahill and kurt zouma are good defenders but perhaps not in the same class as terry terry and fellow goalscorer diego costa celebrate during the capital one cup final win at wembley stadium
