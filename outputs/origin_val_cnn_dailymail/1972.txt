an australian businessman could now face the death penalty in the philippines after being accused of killing a child and orchestrating an international paedophile ring
last month scully from melbourne was arrested after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in in malaybalay , bukidnon
the 52 - year - old had allegedly established a ' pay for view ' scheme where clients from across the globe paid to live - stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused as per their requests
it has created such outrage in the philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed
peter gerald scully ( right ) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn - related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of philippines girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients the death penalty was suspended in the philippines in 2006 , but an influential conservative politician told the sydney morning herald that the australian 's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death
' the philippines government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia , child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty , ' sherwin gatchalian , an mp with the nationalist people 's coalition , said
filipinos across the country took to social media to call for his execution
it 's alleged that scully , from the melbourne suburb of burwood , took part in perverted acts against children as young as one , which he filmed
he was also running a lucrative business live - streaming videos in a ' pay for view ' scheme
police said scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clientele , who were mostly based in europe
scully managed to avoid being arrested until february 20 this year before a former partner told police that scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013
it was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10 - year - old girl were found at a home formerly rented by scully
an extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls , who survived the trauma of scully 's alleged torturous abuse , paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home
agent janet francisco ( right ) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from scully 's house , is pictured with one of the rescued girls ( left ) cousins , going by the name of daisy , 11 , and and queenie , 10 , told rappler news site about the fateful day in september 2014 when they were approached by scully 's live - in partner , carme ann ' angel ' alvarez
alvarez , who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of scully 's , offered the girls food at centrio mall in cagayan de oro city and then invited them back to their house
daisy said when they got to the house , alvarez bathed the girls while scully , who she referred to as the ' american ' , videoed them
the next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task
it was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other
' i started crying , i do n't know what we were doing , ' a tearful daisy said
scully then allegedly rubbed mineral oil on the girls ' bodies and sexually assaulted them , while alvarez took photos
they were then told to keep digging and daisy was made to sleep in the same room where they had been digging the holes
the next day daisy said they were forced to perform sexual acts on the man
' i was crying and screaming so much that alvarez covered my head with a pillow
i choked so much but scully continued his abuses on me , ' daisy said
' alvarez slapped me and said that i if do n't stop crying , scully will continue doing this
' the girls were then told to keep digging after the horrendous ordeal
the remains of a 10 - year - old girl were found at a home formerly rented by scully after he was arrested that evening , daisy said they were forced the alcohol and she managed three drinks before passing out and woke up the next morning to discover she had slept in one of the dug - out graves because she had kept crying and calling for her ' mama '
it was on the fourth day that became unbearable for the little girls
' they were filming , taking photographs while we dug our graves , and they again brought us to their room , this time , i was tied with a nylon cord , my hands , my feet â i could not move , ' daisy said
' i wanted to kill myself , i wanted to die that night , because i could not bear it any longer
' however , it was the very next day that the girls fled for their lives when scully and alvarez left the house
queenie âs mother took the girls to the local police station to file a complaint against scully and alvarez
when the police turned up to the house - they apprehended alvarez but scully escaped
agents assigned to the case described the video footage as ' the worst video we have encountered in our years of campaign against child pornography ' which led to seven young victims being rescued , the inquirer.net reported
alvaraz , now 18 , revealed her bizarre lifestyle to a prison warden at the cagayan de oro city jail where she was detained
she met scully when she working as a prostitute at just 14 years old and allegedly endured a similar ordeal to daisy and queenie before paid by scully to entice the children into their home .
