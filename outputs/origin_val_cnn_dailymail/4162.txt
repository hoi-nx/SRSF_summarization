a spokesman for the prosecution service said : ' the cps appeals and review unit has completed a review of the case relating to the tragic deaths of soldiers on the brecon beacons in july 2013
' this review was requested under our victims ' right to review scheme
' case reviews completed under the victims ' right to review scheme involve a completely independent assessment of the available evidence against the evidential and public interest standards set out in the code for crown prosecutors
' in this case , our review concluded that the original decision not to charge any individual in respect of this matter was correct
there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction in this case
' the families involved have been informed of this decision and the reasons for it
our thoughts remain with them
' a large amount of detailed material , including reports provided by expert witnesses , was considered during the original review of the evidence , the cps said
it is believed that two of the soldiers ' families asked for the charges of gross negligence manslaughter to be reviewed
the cps found ' insufficient evidence ' to provide a ' realistic prospect of conviction ' a police spokesperson said : ' following a joint police and health and safety executive investigation into the events leading to the tragic deaths of three soldiers on the brecon beacons in july 2013 , files of evidence were submitted to the cps for review , who concluded that that there is insufficient evidence to support charges of gross negligence manslaughter
' all families have been informed of the decision and police will continue to support them
' police will continue to support the health and safety executive who continue with their investigation into the deaths
a file will be prepared for the coroner
' an inquest in to the deaths of soldiers was delayed after senior coroner for birmingham and solihull , louise hunt , ruled last september that a full inquest could not take place until after the cps review of the deaths
the inquest , expected to last for up to three weeks , was rescheduled to begin on june 1
it is expected to hear from soldiers who were manning checkpoints at the time of the training exercise and other military personnel involved in its management .
