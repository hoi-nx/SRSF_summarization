for most of her life young queensland woman samantha thought she was an ordinary australia girl with a loving mum and younger brother living in a beachside suburb of townsville

sam 's mother made several appearances during extradition hearings in a queensland court before ms barnett was finally deported to the us and immediately placed in prison

barnett 's friends told the seven network that benjamin todd had wanted barnett to terminate her pregnancy with savanna in 1993
but when the marriage failed , it was benjamin harris todd iii who gained custody of savanna following a court case in which he alleged barnett was bipolar , and she was awarded only supervised access to her baby daughter
it was on one of these visits barnett and 11 - month - old savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives , travelling to malaysia , singapore , and south african where barnett married juan geldenhuys and they had a son
mr benjamin harris todd iii 's lawyer , sturgis told seven network , benjamin todd ' never quit ' looking for his daughter
' for years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays , ' mr sturgis said nervous : benjamind todd ii ( left on television during the years he searched for his daughter ) and ( right ) last year after learning his 20 year wait had come to an end , but at a time when he was still unsure whether savanna / samantha would want to meet him the couple emigrated to new zealand , where they gained citizenship , and then barnett and her children moved to australia 's sunshine coast , where they were known as alexandria , samantha and rhys geldenhuys
it was over evening drinks after a day 's sailing in 2011 that ' alex ' slipped up
ms barnett referred to samantha as ' savanna ' and said she had fled an ' abusive ' relationship in us
barnett 's south african friends went online and found a page on the us national centre for missing and exploited children 's website
they saw pictures of a woman who looked like a younger ' alex ' and an age - advanced photo of a girl who resembled samantha
they contacted benjamin todd iii in us
his long hunt for savanna was over
tearful reunion : samantha speaks on a phone to her mother inside the south carolina prison where barnett is serving time for her kidnap and passport fraud offences barnett cries as she speaks with her daughter in the prison where she is serving 21 months after being deported and pleading guilty to kidnapping her own child from the us in 1994 as mr benjamin harris todd iii 's lawyer , sturgis told seven network , benjamin todd ' never quit ' looking for his daughter
' for years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays , ' mr sturgis said
' it is a parent 's worst nightmare not to know what happened to a child [ but ] he never lost hope and pursued every possibility that might lead to her recovery
' however , friends of ms barnett described benjamin harris todd iii as an ' evil , evil man ' while barnett herself described his pursuit of her as ' corrupt ' and ' criminal '
whatever is the truth , the extraordinary story of how ms barnett eluded the fbi for two decades , and how her life as a lie unravelled , is said to have ' deeply confused ' 21 - year - old samantha
seven network filmed her as she reunited with ms barnett in the south carolina prison where she is serving a 21 month sentence after pleading guilty to one count of international parental kidnapping and two counts of false statement in a passport application
ms barnett will be required to undergo two years â supervised parole following her release
while seven network has not yet revealed whether samantha finally meets her real father , there has been emotions running high on both sides
' his daughter thus far has been reluctant to meet , ' sturgis , told daily mail australia
' she only knows her mother and the misinformation that has been provided her
she likely would be considered by her mother to be disloyal if she were to meet [ benjamin harris todd iii ] at this time
' mr sturgis said the intensely private stockbroker understood why the daughter snatched from him and who never knew him as father had held off from speaking with him , and that he feared jeopardising his hoped - for reunion with her
but mr sturgis said benjamin harris todd iii yearned for the ' long awaited opportunity ' of meeting savanna and had literally counted the days - 19 years , six months and 12 days - from the access visit on which savanna disappeared to when australia police knocked on a door in faraway townsville and his long lost daughter was found
