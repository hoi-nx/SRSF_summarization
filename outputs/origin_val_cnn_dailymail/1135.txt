billions of stars in our galaxy have between one and three planets which could potentially support life
astronomers came to the conclusion after calculating the chances of planets orbiting in the ' goldilocks zone '
this is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet 's surface , and for alien life to exist
the illustration shows the habitable zone for different types of stars
the green area is the habitable zone ( hz ) , where liquid water can exist on a planet âs surface
the red area is too hot for liquid water on the planetary surface and the blue area is too cold for liquid water on the planetary surface ' according to the statistics and the indications we have , a good share of the planets in the habitable zone will be solid planets where there might be liquid water and where life could exist , ' said jacobsen , from the university of copenhagen
the findings are based on data from the american space agency nasa 's kepler space telescope , which has confirmed the existence of around 1,000 planets orbiting stars in the milky way
it has also identified an estimated 3,000 other candidate worlds
many of the stars have solar systems of two to six planets , but scientists believe there could be more that remain undiscovered by kepler , which is best suited to finding large planets in relatively close orbits
to estimate the positions of the ' hidden ' planets , the researchers updated a 250 - year - old mathematical concept called the titius-bode law law
pictured are exoplanetary systems where the previously known planets are marked with blue dots , while the red dots show the planets predicted by the titius-bode law on the composition of planetary systems
124 planetary systems in the survey â based on data from the kepler satellite , fit with this formula the law , which inferred the existence of uranus before it was seen , states that there is a certain ratio between the orbital periods of planets in a solar system
the titius-bode law law was formulated around 1770 and correctly calculated the position of uranus before it was even discovered
the law states that there is a certain ratio between the orbital periods of planets in a solar system
so the ratio between the orbital period of the first and second planet is the same as the ratio between the second and the third planet and so on
this means if you know how long it takes for some of the planets to orbit around a star , you can calculate how long it takes for the other planets to orbit and can calculate their position in the planetary system
you can also calculate if a planet is ' missing ' in the sequence
because of this , if you know how long it takes some planets to circle a star , you can work out the time taken for other planets to orbit and fix their positions in the planetary system
you can also calculate if a planet is missing in the sequence
' we decided to use this method to calculate the potential planetary positions in 151 planetary systems , where the kepler satellite had found between three and six planets , ' said mr jacobsen
' in 124 of the planetary systems , the titius-bode law fit with the position of the planets
' using t-b 's law we tried to predict where there could be more planets further out in the planetary systems
' but we only made calculations for planets where there is a good chance that you can see them with the kepler satellite
' in this way , the scientists predicted a total of 228 planets in the 151 systems and concluded that each system should have an average of one to three planets in the habitable zone
extrapolating further , this suggested that there could be billions of stars in the milky way with habitable zone planets where surface water and life could exist
the scientists , whose findings appear in the journal monthly notices of the royal astronomical society , have made a shortlist of 77 ' hidden ' planets
they say these planets have a good chance of being spotted as they pass in front of their parent stars light curves of the some of the planets orbiting the star kepler-62
the dip in the light curve occurs when the planet moves in front of the host star , thereby dimming the light of the star
the dip in the light curve is proportional to the size of the planet
the kepler satellite observes exoplanets by measuring the light curve of a star
when a planet moves in front of the star there is a small dip in brightness
if this little dip in brightness occurs regularly , there might be a planet orbiting the star and obscuring its light
