london britain needs more women as spies -- and it could do worse than look to recruit them on popular parenting website mumsnet
that 's according to a report released thursday by parliament 's intelligence and security committee
the report recommends targeting women , including mothers and those who are middle - aged or mid-career , to help break through " the permafrost " of men in middle management " who have a very traditional male mentality and outlook
" the idea that a new cohort of britain spies could be signed up via mumsnet , more usually associated with debates on pregnancy , childcare and homemaking , may surprise some
but lawmaker blears , a committee member , said recruiting more women to the three intelligence and security agencies the committee oversees is a crucial way to change the intelligence agencies ' sometimes hidebound culture
the current setup fosters " a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career and does not fully recognise the value of a more consultative , collaborative approach , " she said
but women 's life experience and other qualities should not be overlooked , she said
in a sign of the changing times , the latest film iteration of britain spy james bond has had a female boss -- " m , " played by judi dench
but while women currently make up about 37 % of the employees across the britain intelligence agencies , according to the intelligence and security committee report , they make up fewer than one - fifth of those in senior roles
the recruiting idea has met with some amusement in the mumsnet community
" if they need someone whose special skill is getting melted chocolate down her dog - haired jumper and not noticing , i 'm their woman , " posts one mumsnet user
" i would love to be a spy
and no one would suspect me
i am too boring and frumpy , " writes another
a third , more skeptical , comments : " yes , people who ca n't help but type their every passing thought into an online forum would make great spies
" besides using women - focused outlets like mumsnet to reach a new pool of talent , the committee recommends certain steps to make working for mi5 , mi6 and gchq ( gchq ) more tempting for women
these include offering better career management , encouraging women to set up their own informal support networks and not limiting their options if they have children
" women who have successfully been filling operational roles must n't be sidelined after they have children
they still have the first class skills that the agencies helped them to build , so these should be used , " blears said
former u.s. secretary of state madeleine albright -- who similarly looked into the position of women in the cia -- backed the britain report and what it said about the value of women in the intelligence agencies
" diversity should be pursued -- not just on legal or ethical grounds , important as these are in their own right -- but because it will result in a better response to the range of threats that threaten national security , " she said .
