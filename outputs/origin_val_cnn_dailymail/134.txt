shocking new footage appears to show lorry drivers in calais ferry port savagely beating up illegal immigrants who were hiding in the backs of trucks
the video posted on facebook by a romanian driver on sunday shows four men crawling out from a tight space in the back of a lorry
the first two stowaways manage to flee but a man dressed in a fluorescent jacket grabs the third and violently beats him over the head while a security official 's dog barks aggressively at him
when the last man falls on the ground , he is dragged away from the camera 's gaze but the same driver is still filmed kicking the man as he lies helpless on the ground
the man in the orange jacket appears to be a port worker who watches it unfold joint attack : he wrestles the defiant man to the ground as another man joins in and starts kicking him - all while the security official and his dog are seen walking away the man who filmed the video checked into calais on his facebook account on wednesday and channel 4 reports claim the buildings in the background are confirmed to be inside the port of calais
