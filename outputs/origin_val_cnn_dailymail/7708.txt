this was the biggest night of kane âs extraordinary breakthrough season , so how did the england striker cope with the famed italians brand of defending on his full debut ? all systems go credit to roy hodgson for abandoning his original system in the 54th minute
it simply was nât working with theo walcott up front with kane
ross barkley replaced him and wayne rooney , a peripheral first half figure , was promoted up front to partner kane
that bold and decisive move gave this more physical duo far more presence in their battle with italy âs three - man defensive shield
kane grapples with emiliano moretti and gigi buffon as the england man makes a nuisance of himself kane has a dig from outside the area as england press for an equaliser in the second half kane and spurs team - mate andros townsend beam at the final whistle after england 's 1 - 1 draw in turin â we struggled physically in the second half , â admitted italy coach antonio conte
kane had a couple of decent chances , one deflected away for a corner and another saved well by gigi buffon when he fed off the scraps from andros townsend âs shots
the beauty of this boy kane is that he shows no fear , standing tall with the rest of this england team as they fought their way back into this game
at the final whistle , gigi buffon embraced the spurs striker before he walked towards the england fans to salute them for travelling to turin for this friendy
he belongs in this company
italians marking prince kane had leonardo bonucci marking him throughout the first half and he was so tight to the england forward it was skin - on - skin at times
leonardo bonucci , along with his central defensive partner giorgio chiellini is part of a juventus team who are top of serie a and have only conceded 14 goals in the league
you do nât get much change out of these two , especially at international level
it is almost a criminal act for an italians defender to concede a goal , no matter what the circumstances or the occasion
kane is sandwiched by leonardo bonucci and giorgio chiellini as italy defend a high ball giorgio chiellini keeps kane under wraps as the england man struggles for space in the area antonio conte âs team spend hours on the practice pitches going through defensive drills , denying opposition players space in the areas where they can be hurt the most
wayne rooney had warned this england team about the dirty tricks , but italy have turned defending in to an art form over the years
they are masters of their trade
this is part of kane âs education , working out ways to unsettle italy âs three man defence and pulling at least one of them out of position to open up some space in central areas
starved of service kane 's biggest contribution to the first half was his knock - down for theo walcott âs effort that rebounded to wayne rooney lurking just inside the penalty area
england âs captain hit the bar
that was better , getting the ball in to dangerous areas of the field for kane to finally do some damage
still , it was hard to get away from the statistics
kane leaps for a corner but the ball is punched away but italy 's veteran keeper gigi buffon kane attempts to rob alessandro florenzi of possession during a tricky night in turin by the time the england team walked off the pitch at half - time in the juventus stadium , when they were losing 1 - 0 , kane had only touched the ball 15 times , theo walcott had 13
that is not nearly enough at this level
the alternative is to stay on the last man , as he did after the break by treading on the toes of giorgio chiellini , his designated second half marker , and acting as a target man
the change gave england options and kane âs effort at the start of the second half would have troubled italy âs legendary keeper gigi buffon , but it was deflected wide for a corner
that was the week this time last year kane had scored just two goals in his entire career for spurs : one against shamrock rovers in the europa league and another against hull city in the capital one cup
this has been a momentous week in kane âs life and he returns to spurs â s training ground to prepare for sunday âs clash with burnley as a full international
kane trudges back to the half way line after england fell behind in the first - half kane has a go from outside the box but failed to get on the scoresheet against the wily italians after scoring 29 times for spurs this season , plus another on his debut for the national team against lithuania at wembley last friday , he remains very much man of the moment
even at 21 he looks like a man who can take it all in his stride and there is even the possibility that he will be named pfa player of the year or fwa footballer of the year in may
under 21 dilemma gareth southgate will hold more talks with the spurs forward , but there is pressure from within wembley for kane to commit to the under 21 tournament this summer
kane has represented england at various levels throughout his international career and it will send a strong message to players that they are expected to play in summer tournaments
kane looks up after finally evading giorgio chiellini 's attentions as the england man looks for attacking options kane is kept at arm 's length by giorgio chiellini as the juventus defender keeps a close eye on the england man the spurs forward has played an awful lot of football this season , but there is a real momentum building with the under 21 team after their fine comeback and eventual victory over germany at the riverside on monday evening
with kane in the under 21s this summer , along with west brom forward saido berahino , england would have one of the most potent attacking partnerships at the tournament .
