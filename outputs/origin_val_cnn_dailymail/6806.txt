' the injuries you inflicted on that women were horrific
the most significant being a severe , gaping wound to the neck running from ear to ear
' but for the intervention of skilled medical professionals , i am certain she would have died
this was a brutal and callous attempt to kill

he told one guest he was in love with ms arnold but was convinced she was going to die

investigation : the home in essex where the attack took place
roberts was due to stand trial charged with attempted murder but changed his plea to guilty when he appeared at chelmsford crown court yesterday peter clark , prosecuting , said : ' this was a sustained attack that caused serious physical and mental harm
' perhaps the most disconcerting thing is the similarities with the previous incident
' speaking after the hearing yesterday , det insp anne cameron said : ' i am relieved roberts has admitted his guilt , albeit at the start of his trial
' he has saved the victim having to relieve the events of that traumatic night in court
we were so lucky we were not investigating a murder
' john caudle , mitigating , today said roberts had been driven by a misguided obsession with his partner misusing drugs - a similar motive to what had led him to commit the previous arson
he added : ' this was not a planned attack
it was spontaneous and as your honour observed yesterday during opening he was not pre-armed and it was during that he went and got the weapon
' clearly , he flipped
