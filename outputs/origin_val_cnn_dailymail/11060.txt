debenhams has unveiled a Â£ 45 pair of bottom - boosting jeans designed by jasper conran
mailonline 's hanna flint pitted the enhancing jeans , right , against her regular jeans , left debenhams has jumped on the derriere enhancing bandwagon by giving customers the chance to enhance that all - important asset with a pair of Â£ 45 jeans
the new denims , designed by jasper conran , can add up to two extra inches to your derriere and have proved an instant success for the high - street chain
according to the store , the shape enhancing jeans are said to be flying off the shelves , purchased by women looking for a more shapely figure
femail put the jeans to the test to see if they really can give you a pert posterior a kim kardashian or whether it 's all just a clever gimmick
the new denims , right , can add up to two extra inches to your derriere compared to normal jeans , left , as modelled by 24 - year - old jenny lucy herring , 28 , tested out her day - to - day jeans , left , against the bottom - boosting pair , right , which have heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve the secret to the new jeans ' success ? a clever combination of cheek - enhancing cut , expert tailoring , and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve , promising to turn a shapeless bottom into rear of the year
control panels at the front also claim to flatten the tummy to emphasise the effect , while the position of the darts in the denim promise to give a flattering hourglass effect
debenhams also say the jeans give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear
speaking about the jeans , a spokesperson for debenhams said : ' pictures of curvy famous women , from kim kardashian and nicki minaj , to pippa middleton and carol vorderman , have helped women with prominent rears realise they have a gorgeous fashionable asset to emphasise , rather than minimise
' of course it is a little more difficult for women with a slimmer , straight up and down silhouette
the only solution used to be an expensive gym membership and weeks of working out , but now buying a pair of shaping jeans can offer a wonderful , instant booty boost
' the jeans promise to give a significant 20 degree rise in overall curvature to the rear , which bianca , 25 , tested out ( left : regular jeans , right : bottom - boosting jeans ) according to the store , the shape enhancing jeans boost bottoms thanks to a clever combination of cheek - enhancing cut , expert tailoring , and heavier denim strategically built in to give extra bulk and curve so what did our testers think ? jenny and bianca were impressed
jenny said : ' i ca n't say i 'm now the proud owner of a behind to rival kim kardashian but i like the lift that the jeans give
everything is more defined and pert - and for Â£ 45 , that 's money well spent
' bianca added : ' the quality was really impressive and much more fitted and comfortable than my regular jeans , i think these would make a good investment piece and staple item in anyone 's wardrobe
' hanna flint , however , would n't waste her money
â i actually think my bum looks better in the first pair of jeans ! ' , she said
' the darker colour and shape seems to give my rear more definition and lift while the other pair seems to flatten it
