depraved mothers who gave up their lives in the west to live under the rule of islamic state terrorists in syria are taking photographs of their newborn children sleeping alongside handguns and assault rifles in a sickening game of one - upmanship on social media
featuring titles such as ' the little terrorist ' and ' generation kilafah ' , the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents ' extremism in raqqa
while some shots feature children so young that they are unlikely to be aware of the significance of the photographs , another shows a masked young girl of around three - years - old dressed in full combat gear , carrying an ak47 and raising her index figure to make a well - known jihadi gesture
' the little terrorist ' : a newborn baby is seen sleeping under a hello kitty blanket
the otherwise adorable photograph is ruined by the fact an ak47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby 's bed exploited : a masked young girl of around three - years - old is seen dressed in full combat gear , carrying an ak47 assault rifle , and raising her index figure to make a well - known jihadi gesture although the images were posted on twitter over the past year , they form part of a new study of the everyday lives and , inevitably , deaths of the young western women who chose to live under isis
one photograph in the study , which was published on buzzfeed , shows a woman calling herself umm abdullatif posting a photograph of a young boy aged about five dressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle
she identifies the child as her son 's ' lil best mate ' and suggests he has already been killed , adding that she hope her own child ' grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him '
another photograph , this time posted by a woman calling herself umm usama , shows a one - year - old girl sleeping alongside a small , black pistol and is captioned ' even my baby girl goes 2 bed with her gun # generationkhilafah '
a similar image was posted on twitter showing a newborn baby fast asleep in a plastic crate and covered in a hello kitty blanket
the otherwise adorable photograph is ruined , however , by the fact an ak47 machine gun is propped up against the side of the tiny baby 's bed
the image was posted on twitter by a man claiming to be the child 's father and was captioned : ' the little terrorist # hammam was born in the land of the caliphate , i ask god almighty to make him one of the khilafah âs soldiers
' horror : featuring titles such as ' the little terrorist ' and ' generation kilafah ' , the chilling images show innocent children being forced to embrace their parents ' extremism in isis ' de facto capital raqqa a woman calling herself umm abdullatif posting a photograph of a young boydressed in military fatigues and firing a huge assault rifle
she identifies him as her son 's ' lil best mate ' , suggests he has already been killed , and adds that she hope her own child ' grows up to be like him and receives and beautiful death just like him ' the study reveals numerous other images of young children being exploited for shocking photographs that are later posted by their twisted parents on social media
the majority show young boys and girls dressed in combat clothing and brandishing weapons and are captioned with horrific messages by their parents wishing the children a hasty death
others show young boys and girls wearing clothing daubed in the chilling black and white isis logo , stating that the children are being ' raised as lions ' who will one day fight against the west
the overall effect is to instill fear in the west that even if the current generation of isis jihadis are killed , there will still be generation after generation of bloodthirsty , brainwashed terrorists ready to fight and die in order to carry out atrocities against innocent people
the use of sickening images of gun toting children also allows the often very young militant parents to brag and boast about how ' hardcore ' they are , distancing themselves from western ideals of parenthood and encouraging them to take part in a pathetic one - upmanship on social media
sick : this photograph shows young boys whose fathers have all been killed fighting for isis posing in the terror group 's capital city raqqa

from the land down under , to the land of khilafah
' zehra duman 's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts
it also featured pictures of her late reported partner , the so - called ' playboy jihadi ' mahmoud abdullatif , as her ' beautiful husband '
daily mail reported in january that zehra duman congratulated her late partner for his death after he was reportedly killed
' you won the race ! ' she tweeted , describing him as a ' green bird ' - the term used to describe a so - called martyr
