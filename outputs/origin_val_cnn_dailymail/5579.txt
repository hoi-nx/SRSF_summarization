martin glenn , chief executive of united biscuits , was earning Â£ 1.4million according to the latest accounts , but will receive no more than around Â£ 650,000 at the fa
however , the lure of working at the top of english football was the main incentive for 54 - year - old martin glenn , who has made plenty of money in top jobs with walkers , birds eye , pepsico and united biscuits â whom he sold to turkish food group yildiz as part of a quick turnaround operation since april 2013

the football league are understood to be looking into the way leicester have stayed within ffp regulations , despite declaring a loss of nearly Â£ 21m in the last financial year when they gained promotion
it is unclear how the foxes kept on the right side of ffp limits that allow a maximum loss of Â£ 8m â not offset by football - related activity â partly through a multi-million - pound marketing and licensing deal with sheffield - based agency trestellar , capitalising on their thai owners â profile in the far east
trestellar is fully owned by former pl chairman sir dave richards and his son
richards was an adviser to the thais after leaving the pl in 2013
