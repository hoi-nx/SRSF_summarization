around 230,000 australia are estimated to have disorders on the autism spectrum like asperger syndrome 's , and as a result will struggle to understand normal social cues and body language , making it far more difficult to form friendships
assistance dogs australia currently support 55 families with autistic children across australia and while you might instantly think of assistance dogs performing physical tasks , ms freeman said brock 's role is far more related to emotional support
' if jason freeman comes home from school and he is a bit anxious or everything feels a bit too much for him , brock will be right there with him
' ' jason freeman does n't have the ability to read others or really have a real grasp on what people are thinking from body language which is something people really take for granted , ' she said

he did n't have the chance to make many real friends and would sometimes come home in tears
' having a connection with others is hard for him but it 's harder to see him not having the friendships that a lot of other kids do
' this was until jason freeman met brock

brock and jason freeman had an ' immediate connection ' and it did n't take long for brock to become ' part of the family '
' if jason freeman comes home from school and he is a bit anxious or everything feels a bit too much for him , brock will be right there with him
' he puts his paw up on his legs and just makes him feel like everything is alright , ' she added
ms freeman said brock is ' very intuitive ' to jason freeman 's needs and that even if he is crying brock knows exactly how to give him the emotional support that will calm him down
brock has given jason freeman the confidence to interact with other people which seemed insurmountable before his furry therapist came along jason freeman has flourished since being given responsibility that comes with being a dog owner
it 's his job to keep brock fed , groomed and walked
jason freeman 's younger brother dylan has also been diagnosed with asperger syndrome and although their relationship can be strained at times she said it 's given jason freeman a chance to teach his brother about trust and relationships
brock has given brothers dylan , left , and jason freeman , right , an opportunity to bond now they have found some common ground ' because they both have asperger syndrome 's , they both struggle in the same social situations
the two boys are pretty full on but brock can bring the whole tone down
' she said brock has a natural ability to read the anxiety and stress levels in the house and always knows when to come up and say : ' hey , i 'm here and it 's going to be okay
' jason freeman now let 's dylan feed brock and while they used to rub each other the wrong way she said they 've found common ground with the newest member of the family
ms freeman said brock 's presence has ' benefited the whole family '
even when things get too much for ms freeman , her ' furry therapist ' is always there to comfort her
she said one of the most challenging parts of having a child with autism is watching your child in pain knowing there 's nothing you can say to take it away , but now she said she has a lot more ' peace of mind ' knowing brock can fix any problem her kids are faced with
animal - assisted activities provide a relatively simple and cost - effective means of helping families improve the social functioning of children with autism assistance dogs start their training at eight weeks and wo n't graduate until they are about two years old autism ( autism spectrum disorders ) is a complex neurological disorder that can cause the sufferer to have difficulty with social and communication skills
people with autism often have unusual ways of learning , paying attention or reacting to sensations
the main areas of difficulty are related to communication , social interaction and restricted or repetitive behaviours
because the affects can vary from individuals it has been recognised that autism has a â spectrum â , hence autism spectrum disorders
around 230,000 australia are estimated to be on the autism spectrum
asperger syndrome is an autism spectrum disorder that is charachterised by difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication , alongside restricted or repetitive patterns of behaviour or interests
children suffering from aspreger âs will often show less severe symptoms with an absence of language delays , unlike children with autism
the notable symptoms of asperger syndrome âs is a decreased ability to socialise with others , to communicate , and to use imagination
' i hear him come home upset from school and even when he does n't want to talk to me he will go into his room and talk to brock , ' she said
' there are a lot of challenges and stress for us as parents but having brock in the home has made it so much easier
' assistance dogs ceo , lord said their dogs start training at eight weeks to ensure they have a ' well - rounded ' education and that nothing can scare them once they 've been placed with families
' they start training at eight weeks where they will work with puppy trainers for a year
then they get 6 months of intensive training at puppy school which is where they are socialised to make sure they wo n't react to children , ' he told daily mail australia
although this process costs about $ 27,000 per dog mr lord said it 's worth every cent to see the extent dogs can improve the lives of children who are faced with a life of challenges
' there have been extensive studies that show if an autistic child has an emotional connection with an animal they will become more independent , their self - esteem can improve , their communication skills advance and they become more self - reliant
' assitance dogs australia spend around $ 27,000 on each puppy but are happy to give them to deserving families for free he said kids who 've been given assistance dogs find their lives improve drastically because they are finally given the opportunity to participate in society without relying so heavily on carers or parents
' these dogs give a bit more equality to people who suffer from a range of disabilities
it helps them enjoy their community , allowing them to get as much out of life as they can , ' he added

april 2 is world autism day and assistance dogs australia will be celebrating the success of their paws program , which is responsible for pairing children suffering from autism with their very own therapy puppy
the paws program not only gives out these lifetime friends but also works with parents to train family dogs to provide the same emotional support that trained assistance dogs do
the dogs can learn up to 50 specialised commands that will help them communicate effectively with children on the autism spectrum
assistance dogs australia receives no government funding so they rely heavily on the generosity of individuals and community support to consistently deliver these positive results for children with autism .
