assured they were okay : the bereaved parents of a teen with a severe dairy allergy who died last year after eating dairy - laced pancakes are suing the diner that served them to him severely allergic : 16 - year - old scott of bemidji had been to the hospital due to dairy exposure before
his family had learned to be very careful about what and where he ate ' he had just finished and he said '' we have to go now , " ' cindy recalled of the moments after scott , her second of four children , ingested the fatal breakfast
scott had suffered allergic reactions before , even from the slightest exposure to dairy
previous trips to the emergency room had taught his family to be extremely cautious
' if it was nât right , we did nât eat until his was right , ' scott 's father steve johnson told wcco
however , the johnsons say they were assured by staff at nice cafe that everything would be fine
and it just so happened that scott had forgotten to bring along his life - saving epipen and nebulizer that june day
cindy rushed her son home
but when they got there , the epinephrine and nebulizer failed to calm scott 's short - circuiting immune system
' i was eighteen miles off the highway when i got the call , ' said steve johnson , who was two hours away on a construction job when he learned his son was in dire straits
' hardest thing for me was i did nât even get to talk to him
' special breakfast : the family did n't normally go out to eat , but scott 's sisters wanted to treat him and their mother one morning last june communication failure ? according to the complaint , the nice cafe staff assured cindy that her son 's pancakes contained no dairy
cindy also maintains she told them the grill would have to be cleaned before scott 's pancakes were cooked on it doctors told the johnsons the dairy exposure had led to anaphylaxis so severe that scott 's heart had stopped
three days after the family breakfast , scott died
now the grieving mother and father are facing massive medical bills and want the minnesota nice diner to take responsibility
' just one mistake can take someone âs life , ' cindy said
the nice cafe owners are not commenting publicly on the pending case
as the case moves forward , a benefit has been organized for july at which a raffle and auction will be held to benefit the johnsons financially
friends of the family have also set up a gofundme page , where donations can be made to help the family offset the cost of medical bills
tragic : scott had forgotten his lifesaving epipen and nebulizer that day in june when his immune system went haywire at the minnesota nice cafe cindy rushed her son home , but when they arrived his epipen and nebulizer did n't seem to work ' hardest thing for me was i did nât even get to talk to him ' : steve johnson was two hours away at a construction job when he learned his son was being airlifted to a fargo hospital
three days later , scott would be dead
