budget chain aldi is launching a ' boutique ' range of wines - but will only allow thirsty customers to buy four bottles at a time
shoppers enticed by the new fine wines will only be able to buy a limited number during each supermarket trip , in a bid to ensure the range remains exclusive
in a further bid to appeal to ' upmarket ' customers , the german discounter will also put an individual number on each of the bottles
aldi is launching a range of ' boutique ' wines costing Â£ 9.99 each which will include a chardonnay ( left ) and a french red pezenas ( right ) the wines , which will come with a specially - commissioned hand - painted tag , will retail at Â£ 9.99 , more than double the price of its usual range
the launch is the chain 's latest attempt to lure families from across the social spectrum and particularly to tap into the taste of middle and higher income shoppers
the supermarket 's continuing success means sales are growing at around 19 per cent a year
it also now has a market share of five per cent - almost the same as waitrose
a spokesman for aldi said the range has been created by some of the world 's most prestigious winemakers for the ' upmarket ' customers
the four wines which make up the range include red argentinian malbec cabernet , white chardonnay , french red pezenas and white valle de leyda sauvignon
the bottle of chardonnay , pezenas and sauvignon blanc will be available to buy from march 30 , 2015
the malbec cabernet will follow in may
there will also be an argentinian malbec cabernet ( right ) , as well as a chilean valle de leyda sauvignon ( left ) jean-claude mas , who partnered with aldi to create the pezenas wine , said : ' the decision to collaborate with aldi was an easy one as i have kept a keen eye on its budding reputation as a top quality wine merchant over the last few years

pezenas ( Â£ 9.99 , 75cl ) rich and charming , with a deep ruby colour , this red is full of character and flair with black cherry , blackberry and even chocolate notes
ripe black fruits and spices ( cloves , vanilla , and liquorice ) create an intense and unique flavour which can be enjoyed today or left to develop over the coming decade
valle de leyda sauvignon ( Â£ 9.99 , 75cl ) a unique and perfectly balanced signature of sauvignon blanc ; this exuberant wine is full of fantastic aromas with layers of ripe stone fruit and tropicality
intriguing floral notes come with a bit of a smoky minerality , freshness and mouth puckering acidity , but with a delightful texture
