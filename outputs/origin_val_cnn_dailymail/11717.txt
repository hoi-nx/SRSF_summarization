the good news for all concerned in monaco was that it had stopped raining
arsene wenger had raised fears on the eve of the game and as the downpour continued into the night the arsenal manager was n't the only one casting anxious glances skywards
this is a big day for the new monaco and they do not want it washed out
arsene wenger had raised fears over the playing surface at monaco 's stade louis ii on monday night the stade louis ii has a poor surface and groundstaff have worked hard to help it drain after heavy rainfall dimitar berbatov celebrates during monaco 's 3 - 1 win against arsenal at the emirates stadium last month a recent game against montpellier had been cancelled and because the pitch at the stade louis ii is a notoriously poor surface , with so much going on beneath it : car parks , swimming pools , etc groundstaff worked through the night to help it drain as they prepare for what they hope will be a famous victory , one which will see them into the last eight of the uefa champions league for the first time since 2004 , when they went on to the final and lost to jose mourinho 's porto
much has happened to monaco since then
they almost dropped into the third tier of french football and faced extinction before russian billionaire dmitry rybolovlev came to the rescue and got them moving in the right direction once again
the first leg result against arsenal was confirmation that the rybolovlev project is still on track , having survived a change of direction and an exodus of top players like james rodriguez and radamel falcao last summer
russian billionaire dmitry rybolovlev rescued the club from almost dropping into the french third division porto celebrate winning the uefa champions league in 2004 after beating monaco in the final in germany monaco wideman jerome rothen shields the ball away from porto midfielder pedro mendes during the final radamel falcao and james rodriguez both left monaco for man united and real madrid respectively no club in the uefa champions league era has surrendered a two - goal lead after playing the first leg away and leonardo jardim 's team prides itself on tight defence
they have conceded only once in the last 12 home games and are quietly confident history will not be rewritten , with leonardo jardim expected to enhance his reputation for caution by making a tweak or two to his team to make it even more solid
if they park the bentley as smartly as they did at the emirates stadium , it promises to be one of the great nights in monaco 's recent history

there were fewer than 6,000 in to see them beat nine - man bastia on friday , a 3 - 0 win which kept them in touch with the ligue 1 leaders
despite its rich history , monaco will never be one of the french 's football hotbeds
it is a unique club set in the playground of the privileged , where most of the local residents are far wealthier than any of the players and many of them more recognisable
in monte carlo , the most famous of the principality 's districts , you would hardly know there was a big uefa champions league game on
the stadium is set in fontvieille , a district reclaimed from the sea in the 1970s , and cut off by a tunnel from the more recognisable sights such as casino square , the opera , a harbour crammed with super-yachts and the grand prix circuit

arsene wenger 's first return to the club he managed for seven years until 1994 fails to make the social calendar for many of those who settle here to enjoy tax - free life in the world 's smallest monarchy
l'equipe has devoted it 's pages to tuesday 's clash prince albert , the ruling monarch , continues to support the club he used to run and will be at the game , as the french attempt to claim another football triumph against the english after chelsea were knocked out by psg last week
french sports paper l'equipe devoted its first five pages to the game with the disciplinary saga of psg idol zlatan ibrahimovic relegated to page 6
instead , rival strikers olivier giroud and dimitar berbatov were pitched head - to - head on the front
at stade louis ii on the eve of the game , arsene wenger was met by monaco 's vice-president vasilyev and presented with a framed picture designed to commemorate his work at the club , where he won the french title in 1988
in an interview with sportsmail , last month , ahead of the first - leg , vasilyev hailed arsene wenger as ' one of the iconic coaches of modern football ' but the arsenal manager is not big on sentiment
he was wounded by the 3 - 1 defeat in the first leg and aware that history is against a glorious comeback , but the noises from the arsenal camp were all about believing the impossible to be possible
with their array of attacking talent , scoring three goals seems an achievable target
keeping monaco at bay at the other end while doing so , may be a different proposition
