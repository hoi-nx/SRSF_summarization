his nine - year career at arsenal has been an emotional and physical roller coaster
often showing glimpses that he is the perfect mix of power and guile his manager craves before spending weeks , or even years , in the treatment room , arsene wenger now looks set to release this french midfielder at the end of his contract in june
the ride is coming to an end
1554 days , 222 weeks , over four years out injured
the numbers are n't as pretty as his playing style can be
this is the curious case of abou vassiriki diaby

comparisons were already drawn to club legend and former captain vieira because of his height , intensity and technique on the ball
' abou diaby is a bit more offensive than vieira but when he plays a more defensive role he is very similar , ' arsene wenger said
he started off well , scoring his first goal for the gunners in april against aston villa , but his debut half - season in north london ended in despair
abou diaby was the victim of an ' assassins tackle ' from sunderland youngster dan smith - according to arsene wenger - his sickening scream as he fractured his ankle at the stadium of light must still be heard by the boss

he has featured in 124 of them or 35 % , one every 15.7 days
league games by season : 2005/06 : 12 , 2006 - 07 : 12 , 2007 - 08 : 15 , 2008 - 09 : 24 , 2009 - 10 : 29 , 2010/11 : 16 , 2011 - 12 : 4 , 2012 - 13 11 , 2013 - 14 1 , 2014 - 15 : 0 put simply , the 28 - year - old has never recovered
whether it be a calf muscle or a hamstring , an abdominal strain or a cruciate ligament , abou diaby 's talent looks set to be wasted
he has clocked up 42 injuries during his arsenal career , according to data from physioroom , averaging a new setback every 80 days
the gunners have played 350 league games since his arrival but abou diaby has featured in just 35 per cent of them
despite his struggles , his almost constant spell on the sidelines has n't been short of its positive moments
in early 2012 diaby came back into the arsenal team to feature alongside mikel arteta and santi cazorla and impressed , even scoring on his return to the french national team
arsene wenger heralded his fellow countryman as a holding midfielder when he made his one and only performance this season , a slack display against southampton in a carling cup defeat

' if he comes back , i will keep him
i always believed in him
in football , the most important thing is health
' but abou diaby has n't come close to featuring since , and given the wealth of midfield options arsene wenger has available it is extremely unlikely he will ever don the arsenal shirt again , even if he were to return to fitness
he is the second longest - serving player at the club behind theo walcott , and is a much - loved figure in the dressing room
his emotional pull remains strong with the fans , who would love for him to be the midfield destroyer and box - to - box runner he has shown he can be
abou diaby vies for the ball with barcelona star lionel messi during the champions league quarter - final at the emirates stadium in march 2010 abou diaby battles with liverpool midfielder joe cole ( left ) during a 1 - 1 draw at anfield in august 2010 abou diaby appeared on the final day of last season for arsenal away at norwich in his most recent premier league appearance for the club
it was also his only appearance last season however , this is n't a perfect world and head must rule over heart , especially at a club vying for the top places
abou diaby has played one premier league game in his last two years , and arsenal have backed the player admirably
but as the midfielder looks to get back to full strength once again , wherever that may be , this quote by vieira should not be forgotten
' if he could have improved constantly , he would have reached an exceptional level
about his potential , he is better than me , better on a technical level , better dribbler , and better scorer too
' what a player arsene wenger could have had at his disposal
