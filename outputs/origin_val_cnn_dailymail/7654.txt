a calf who was left crippled after a freak accident and risked being shot is now back walking again thanks to a pair of custom - made leg braces
two - year - old fawn from woodstock , new york , apparently fell into a concrete manure pit when she was young and fractured her front left knee
a vet treated the injury but the break got infected
as a result , the calf resorted to ' crawling ' on her knees and her bones grew into a bent shape
her previous owner feared she might be euthanized as her range of motion deteriorated
however , rescue workers from woodstock farm animal sanctuary went out a limb to get the animal moving again
prices start around $ 800 per leg support
after weeks of rehab , the youngster was soon back on her hooves again
