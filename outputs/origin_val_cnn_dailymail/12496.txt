after weeks of controversy and the sudden departures of two co-hosts , " fashion police " is going on an extended break
the fashion commentary show on e ! channel announced tuesday that it will be on hiatus until september
" we look forward to taking this opportunity to refresh the show before the next awards season , " it said in a statement
the announcement caps a rocky few months
last week , co-host kathy griffin bid the show bye - bye after seven episodes , saying her style did not blend in with her co-hosts
she made a dig at the show on her way out
" there is plenty to make fun of in pop culture without bringing people 's bodies into it , " she said in a statement
" i do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference
" shortly before her departure , co-host giuliana rancic faced backlash last month for suggesting that disney star zendaya coleman 's dreadlocks smelled of marijuana
giuliana rancic later issued an on - air apology to the 18 - year - old after social media jumped to the teen 's defense
but her apology was not enough for co-host kelly osbourne , who criticized her remarks and quit a few days later
giuliana rancic and fellow co-host brad goreski will return in september , along with executive producer melissa rivers .
