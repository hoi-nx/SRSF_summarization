scholes has criticised chelsea 's part in ibrahimovic red card against them on wednesday night ibrahimovic 's ( right ) challenge on chelsea midfielder oscar earned the paris saint-germain striker a red card ibrahimovic ( centre ) holds his hands up after the challenge as the chelsea players begin their protests chelsea 's players surround referee bjorn kuipers as he sends off ibrahimovic ( second right ) in the first half john terry ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following ibrahimovic 's first - half challenge blues striker diego costa makes a beeline for ibrahimovic as the referee raises the red card ibrahimovic has since condemned mourinho 's side as ' babies ' and scholes has sympathy for the striker
writing in his column for the independent , the former man united midfielder believes chelsea 's pressuring of referees over decisions has been a recurring theme this season and the west london outfit need realise when they have gone too far
' i could tell that he [ ibrahimovic ] knew he was going off when he looked up and saw every single outfield chelsea player around the referee telling him to get his red card out
chelsea have been doing it all season â if it is not the players trying to referee the game , then mourinho does it from the touchline , ' scholes wrote
' i accept that at man united , we could also pressurise the referee at times and the picture of andy dâurso being backed into a corner is often held up in evidence
but we realised that it had become too extreme and from that point there was much less of it
chelsea would not be the first team to pressurise a referee but they have to know when they have gone too far
' when diego costa is rushing from 60 yards away to get involved in the argument then that is a sign that things have got out of hand
against paris saint-germain the tactic worked in getting ibrahimovic dismissed , but it became so extreme that referees will be prepared for it in future
they will have it highlighted in their preparation and they wo nât want to make the same mistake that bjorn kuipers made on wednesday
