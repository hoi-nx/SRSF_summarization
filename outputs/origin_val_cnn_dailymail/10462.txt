for what could be his last appearance at the dispatch box today as prime minister , cameron will have been coached for hours by his officials
but for his fateful â at home â bbc interview , broadcast on monday , in which he dropped the bombshell that he did not intend to run for a third term as pm , cameron does nât seem to have bothered to do his homework properly at all
he had at least watched a recording , on the downing street tv , of ed miliband âs own domestic disaster last week with bbc deputy political editor landale , after which the labour leader was mocked for having two kitchens
but cameron , a former political apparatchik - turned - pr man , never bothered to rehearse questions that might come up
he may have assumed he would not walk into any bear traps â but he could not have been more wrong
the camerons prepared lunch while being interviewed the interview , when it was fixed months ago , was due to be conducted with the bbc âs political editor robinson
but landale stepped in , as he did with ed miliband and nick clegg because robinson , 51 , is at home recovering from an operation to remove a tumour from his lung
it was clear on screen that cameron felt instinctively at ease with landale , a fellow old etonian
they did nât know each other at school as cameron was two years above landale
but they are both from wealthy families
landale was brought up in rural worcestershire , while cameron had a similar upbringing in berkshire
and landale went to university in bristol , the same city where samantha cameron studied
the bbc programme , which was designed to show a softer , more homely side of cameron , had been going to plan , with footage of the pm on the touchline at his son arthur elwen âs football match
then there was a trip to the butcher âs in his oxfordshire town , where he made a rather tortured joke about fellow chipping norton set member jeremy clarkson also being a customer
and then he allowed the cameras into his constituency home
the bbc , who had already spent 30 minutes with cameron , were given an hour in the kitchen in witney , where cameron visibly relaxed
perhaps if his spin machine had exerted ruthless control of events , as alastair campbell once did for tony blair , it could have been a different story
but so confident was downing street that the interview would go off without a hitch that craig oliver , the no 10 communications secretary â himself an ex-bbc man â did nât even bother to make the trip to oxfordshire
cameron was accompanied instead by michael salter , the downing street broadcasting officer , who is a relatively junior adviser in his team
the agreement which was thrashed out with the bbc before the interview concentrated on dress code , of all things
both men were to be in casual weekend attire with no ties
there were to be limited clips of the prime minister âs children , too , showing only the back of their heads
there was also an agreement to ensure there were no clips of the toys lying around the house
samantha was also , as agreed with the bbc , a frequent presence in the kitchen , looking suitably fragrant and glamorous
crucially landale , who has been with the bbc for 12 years after a decade at the times , was not asked for a list of questions he might ask , or even subject areas in advance of the interview
samantha cameron made a rare appearance on screen to endorse her husband as the ' right man ' for pm cameron has revealed he will stand down as prime minister before 2020 if he wins the next election landale , whose gentle manner belies an acute political brain , knows that cameron has form for putting his foot it in when he âs relaxed
remember his unguarded comments in america about the queen â purring â down the telephone to him over the nationalists failing to win the scottish referendum ? perhaps the bbc man sensed that the kitchen would be the most fertile place to ask tricky questions , while the pm was surrounded by his family
yet the question over whether cameron intended to serve a third term was hardly a bombshell : cameron could have easily dismissed it
the fact that he answered it calmly and directly triggered suspicion in some quarters that it was agreed in advance
but landale says he was taken aback by the response , so much so that he hoped the surprise did nât show on his face
the meltdown that followed in downing street as the gravity of the political story became evident supports landale âs version of events
in his bbc blog , landale denies it was a set - up
â it was not something that a helpful downing street official had suggested i might ask â with a heavy hint i might get an interesting answer
it was just one of many speculative questions that political journalists like me ask in the hope that occasionally they might get an answer
and this time i did
earlier this week , cameron announced he would not bid for a third term if he is successful in may 's general election
he has since insisted he is taking ' nothing for granted ' and his focus is on beating ' ed miliband ' â but by answering my question , he has potentially opened a pandora âs box
he has invited westminster and the country to contemplate a time when he is no longer prime minister , a dangerous gamble to make so close to an election
â cameron âs supporters know that for some time he has been trying to squash speculation that if the tories win , he will stand down as pm after the planned 2017 eu referendum
now , his reply to landale is naturally being portrayed by his political opponents as an arrogant assumption he will win the election
as the political fallout continues , downing street surely has only itself to blame
the film was completed at lunchtime on saturday , giving downing street 48 hours to decide how to handle the story and try to control it to best advantage
officials could have leaked it in advance to try to ensure a positive spin on the revelation
or does the absence of any damage limitation strategy suggest that the pm got out exactly the message he wanted â even if he had nât worked out its explosive implications ?
