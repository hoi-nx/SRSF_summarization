the master bedroom , which is located on the top floor , is open plan and can be closed to the triple - height living room by an electrically operated curtain says patel of the project : ' i wanted to capture the grandeur of the building from its initial opening in 1873 , but in a modern day context , ' the views are also somewhat spectacular
' there are views of almost every major landmark in the capital ; from canary wharf in the east to the london eye on the south bank and the bt tower in the west , ' he says
thomas griem of tg studios explains : ' the penthouse is located in one of the most important historic buildings in london
' it is located in the â attic â volume of this gothic building and features the original timber trusses and beams
' these beams are the feature of this penthouse refurbishment and a huge influence to my design
' i have tried to soften these rustic elements and have introduced sophisticated materials throughout and sleek furniture and combined this sophistication with minimal design elements such as cantilevered glass balustrades and the modern style kitchen
