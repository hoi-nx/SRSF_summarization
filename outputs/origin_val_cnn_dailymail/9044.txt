bam said the striking similarities among the three women 's testimonies showed that bob hewitt 's conduct was calculated , and revealed a pattern of behavior
all three were impressionable young girls , flattered by the attention of a renowned player , according to the judge
' their submissiveness in the circumstances should never have been seen as consent , ' said bam
letters that bob hewitt wrote to one of his accusers , theresa tolken , were cited in detail as corroborating evidence
the judge said bob hewitt had failed to convince him that the letters were only about tennis
bob hewitt was a 15 - time grand slam doubles champion , winning doubles and mixed doubles titles
he was inducted into the international hall of fame , but was suspended indefinitely in 2012 after the hall of fame found enough credibility in the sexual assault allegations after its own investigation .
