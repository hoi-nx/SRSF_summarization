labour today hinted at hefty tax rises for people earning more than Â£ 80,000 a year
the party also indicated that profitable companies could be hit as labour attempts to tackle the deficit without trimming britain âs bloated welfare budget or imposing deep spending cuts
miliband has been deliberately vague about labour âs plans to raise taxes to deal with the deficit , identifying only his proposal to reinstate the 50p tax rates , which experts warn may raise nothing
he suggested that those earning more than Â£ 80,000 were rich and could bear to pay more
mr ed balls said labour would not hit those on â middle and lower incomes â , with taxes mainly rising for those on higher salaries
he added : â if you look at people on middle and lower incomes â this is nât only people on Â£ 10,000 or Â£ 20,000 a year , it âs Â£ 50 , Â£ 60 , Â£ 70 , Â£ 80,000 a year â they are paying more tax
' he added : ' people on all these income levels are in our mind
what we want to do is find a way in which we can balance the books in the next parliament , get the debt falling but to do so in a way which is fair to people on middle and lower incomes who are paying quite a lot of tax already
â i ca nât come along today and start making detailed tax policy â that âs for manifestos and budgets â but we âve already been clear â our plans add up without a rise in tax on people on middle and low incomes
â people on the income levels ( i am ) talking about are very much in our minds when we talk about middle and lower incomes
â labour â which has ruled out rises in the headline rates of vat , income tax and national insurance â also left itself lots of flexibility to raise corporation tax on company profits
david cameron , at a rally in wiltshire today , has claimed labour will cost families Â£ 3,000 in tax rises over the next parliament mr miliband said labour would ensure britain âs corporation tax rate remains the â lowest in the g7 â
but this would allow a labour government to raise it from 20 per cent to 26.5 per cent , which is the rate charged by canada , the second most competitive country in the g7
by contrast , the conservatives have said they will keep the rate as the lowest in the g20 , which is currently 20 per cent in russia , saudi arabia and turkey
meanwhile , labour was boosted last night after the ifs ( ifs ) challenged tory claims about the party âs spending plans
david cameron claimed yesterday that a labour victory would lead to Â£ 15 billion of tax rises , costing families an average Â£ 3,000 each over the lifetime of the next parliament
labour dismissed the claim , saying it was based on â made up figures â
the ifs also criticised the tory figures , saying they were based on too many assumptions about labour âs opaque tax and spending plans
the independent think tank said there was â little value in bandying around numbers which suggest either party would increase taxes by an average of Â£ 3,000 for each working household â
ifs director paul johnson said there was â some potential truth â in the tory claim , but said it was â unhelpful â to make a claim based on so many unknown assumptions
shadow treasury chief secretary chris leslie said : â this is a disastrous and embarrassing start to david cameron âs campaign
within hours of making totally false claims about labour on the steps of downing street , the ifs has totally undermined them
