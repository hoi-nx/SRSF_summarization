being a member of a boy band is always a risky business but being a member of a tribute boy band is even more uncertain , as the ' zayn ' of the uk 's most popular one direction tribute band found out last week
jamie searls , 25 , from london , has been part of only one direction for the last three years and was preparing to go on tour with the group when the news broke last wednesday
but despite zayn 's departure from the group , jamie searls has decided to carry on with the band in the traditional five - person line - up
nothing lasts forever but the last three years have been unforgettable for us all
' there âs been tears of joy , tears of pain , hatred , love but when it âs over , we will all leave with a set of friends and i for one , cherish them â¦
but do nât let them know that ' but only one direction will be gigging as normal as a five piece with zayn in it - as long as people want to see us , i think we would be silly not to carry on
' it âs great to be able to do what you love for a living
' jamie searls ( left ) has been playing the part of zayn ( right ) in a tribute band for three years jamie onstage as zayn in 2013 jamie searls joined only one direction in 2012 after being contacted by an old friend who had signed on to play the part of harry styles
he said : ' i knew henry allan , who plays harry styles - we were in the west end gospel choir together
' he called me and said , " hey , i âve got a really fun opportunity
it âs for a one direction tribute , " three years later , i âm still here
' since then the group have toured the uk , ireland and the uae
jamie searls said : ' it âs been a rollercoaster for us
' i entered this group thinking that it would be a little pocket money but it quickly became a full time job
' i was always sheepish about saying , i âm in a one direction tribute but truthfully , i âm very proud of the shows we put on
' zayn with the rest of one direction in 2012 and while they may not be the real deal , it does n't stopped teenage fans going crazy at shows and meet and greets
jamie searls said : ' it can get a little crazy
in dubai , we had to have security and had to be moved to avoid crushing crowds
' people remark on a passing resemblance [ between zayn and i ]
but the truth is we âre not trying to be lookalike band
that would be a little token tribute
' no disrespect to the other tributes out there but we âre a theatre show , we like to bill ourselves as an experience
' jamie onstage as zayn from one direction for the meantime , jamie searls is going to continue performing as zayn , but even if all the members of the real one direction decide to throw in the towel , he has his own music to fall back on
on tuesday he releases his debut solo single doing time on itunes
jamie searls said : ' i 'm inspired by perseverance and learning from those around me
' there âs such talent coming out of the uk music scene and i âm keen to be a part of it
