ant smith says telling the truth about the size of his manhood was ' liberating ' new statistics reveal that the average sized penis is only 5.16 inches , smaller than originally thought , but what 's it like if you do n't measure up to the norm ? one man with a with a small member recently blogged about the perils of having a tiny todger - and his post went viral
here , writer ant smith , a 47 - year - old engineering manager from london , explains why he decided to share his vital statistics and explains what it 's like to be a few inches short
' last year i wrote a poem and blog post about penis size anxiety
it was painfully autobiographical , but the harder it was to write , the more important it seemed to be
' i 'm 48 now , and i 've been struggling with this anxiety for decades , even though i 'm very happily married
' men have a great capacity for emotional deniability
as long as we 're not confronted with our vulnerabilities we can pretend they do n't exist
' it was a drunken evening talking to a new , but good friend , when somehow or other the question of size came up and i admitted i had such worries
' i was very drunk , and just could n't face lying once again
to my surprise , he said he did too
a comrade in arms i thought , as we sheepishly swapped statistics - he went first and admitted to only possessing 6 "
i told him i had 4 , and his relief was palpable
' telling this truth was truly liberating , and being able to reassure my friend was rewarding
this is when i realised how pervasive , and pointless , size anxiety is
i realised my own perspective could help many others too
' so i published the blog in the hope that if more smaller guys were open and honest we could establish a more realistic view of what average is - rather than only ever seeing the behemoths that porn and advertising presents to us
ant smith says men should be more open and honest to establish a more realistic view of what average is ' for the next few months i performed the poem at various venues around london
there was always at least one warm handshake afterwards from a guy who seemed particularly glad that i 'd openly discussed the question of size , from my perspective
' then in september last year the world 's media took notice and i found myself giving interviews around the globe
it seems like i 'd found some kind of magic formula
a way of talking about the issue that was neither too puerile nor too painful
suddenly everyone was talking about my small , but perfectly functioning , willy ! ' and i was personally responding to thousands of men ( by twitter and e-mail )
so much so that it became impossible to keep up
i felt tremendously proud to have achieved this through poetry , to be able to make poetry relevant in the mainstream
' at this point riottv asked if i 'd like to make a short documentary - and i thought if i ca n't reply personally to everyone this was an opportunity to spread my positive take to so many more people
' with the promise of being able to make something enduring i was able to garner the support to organise small penis party
' this meant i had to really think through the issues - remember , i 'd spent most of my life in denial so this was a journey of discovery for me too
ant smith says he first experienced penis size anxiety while getting changed for sports at school ' first i remembered a time , age 13 , in the school changing room putting my shorts on while i was still wearing my long winter coat
i did n't even know what penis size anxiety was then , or why i was doing that , but i did
' growing up i realise more girls asked me out than vice versa , i must have been reasonably attractive - but i never knew it
' by age 18 i was suffering openly from other ( young ) men laughing at me in the locker room or at the urinal
i became very shy to the extent that i 'd find reasons to put off " that first time " with girlfriends that i did have
' i worked hard and i was successful in every other way , but i had zero self respect
and i was very , very bad at sex
not at all because of my small member , but because i never dared practice enough and i never believed i could be anything other than abysmal in that department
' thankfully , after only 17 years my wife has taught me differently ! ' the party was an attempt to head off these , needless , difficulties for others
in and of itself , on the night it certainly worked
we got a great cross section of people attending , including guys of all ages and sizes ( we surveyed the audience )
' i know there were smaller guys there taking a moment of relief
one gentleman travelled from northern italy specifically for the party
and i heard others talking about how they would never again shout " small penis ! " when they see particularly bad driving
' but the party is just the beginning
already others around the world are asking my advice on how to do something similar , and of course soon we will have the short documentary ready too
' i do believe , in some small way , small penis party has made the world a little better place
