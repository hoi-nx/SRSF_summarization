despite the recent news that ryanair had been given approval to offer low - cost flights from europe to us , it seems that such a project may not be in the works after all
a statement , issued from dublin , ireland , shot down recent speculation about budget flights to the us
' in light of recent press coverage , the board of ryanair holdings plc wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do so , ' it reads
despite earlier reports that ryanair was developing low - cost transatlantic flights , the company is now denying such plans however , it is understood that the ideas of such a transatlantic project is still being explored , but with the intention that ryanair would not operate the flights
instead , any sort of budget europe to us service , should it come into fruition , would be operated by a sister company under a separate brand
earlier this week , it was reported that ireland - based budget carrier was moving forward on plans to run services between key europe cities and the us with one - way tickets costing as little as $ 15 ( Â£ 10 )
the news came on the heels of a statement made by michael o'leary , the airline 's chief executive , last year
he told the irish hotels federation conference that ryanair would be offering $ 15 flights to boston and new york , but also admitted that passengers would be expected to pay extra for everything from meals to baggage
chief executive michael o'leary , has said that $ 15 flights were in development but ' four or five years off ' ' not every seat will be ( $ 15 ) of course ; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats , ' he reportedly said
he 's also said in the past that the company has had a business plan in development for low - fare , transatlantic flights for awhile , but would need to wait until new aircraft could be ordered
' the difficulty is , i keep cautioning , is that there 's no availability of long - haul aircraft for another four or five years
' it remains to be seen whether or not ryanair 's possible plan will develop further or if a new sister company will emerge .
