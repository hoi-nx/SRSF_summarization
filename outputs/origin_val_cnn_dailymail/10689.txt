everton boss martinez has stressed there has been no decision yet and that the ' right ' one will be made with regard to ross barkley 's possible participation for england u21s at the european championships in june
earlier this week it was reported that martinez would rather 21 - year - old everton midfielder took this summer off to recharge his batteries than be part of gareth southgate 's young lions squad for the tournament in the czech republic
martinez in january said he did not think ross barkley , given he has already featured for england u21s 's senior side at the 2014 world cup , then being involved in tournaments like euro 2015 could be ' positive for him or the rest of the ( under - 21 ) squad '
martinez has said he will work with the fa to ensure the ' right ' call is made for ross barkley but the spaniard was also not ruling anything out , emphasising everton 's close relationship with the fa and gareth southgate
and when asked about the matter on wednesday , martinez said once again : ' our relationship with the fa is very good
ross barkley could be part of the young lions squad that will travel to the czech republic in the summer martinez has previously said he is not sure whether ross barkley moving to the u21s would be a positive move ' at the end of the matter it is going to be ( about ) what 's best for the player and for the under - 21s in general
' we are facing the most important period of the season for the team and for the player , so you can imagine that there is no decision that can be taken now
' but our relationship with the fa and gareth southgate in this case is very close , and we are going to make the right decision based on what is going to happen between now and the end of the season and the needs that there are from the england u21s team
