more than 300 young people in oxfordshire were groomed , raped and sometimes forced into ' sex slavery ' by gangs over the last 15 years , a damning report will reveal tomorrow
in a scandal startlingly similar to the one in rotherham , police and social services will be criticised for failing to protect vulnerable children from sexual abuse
one gang of asian men was responsible for abusing and enslaving 50 girls , mainly from oxford , but the men were also able to sexually torture girls as young as 11 for eight years after a series of missed opportunities to stop them
the victims , who were mainly girls under the age of 16 in the care system , were targeted by men from mainly asian gangs who raped , tortured and trafficked them for sex between 1999 and 2014
some were abused for up to eight years despite asking for help from the authorities , who instead refused to believe them or blamed them
their abusers fed them drink and drugs before taking them to graveyards , a b&b and flats rented just for the rape and torture of children
according to the guardian , one 12 - year - old girl was taken to a reading house for a backstreet abortion during a six - year period where she was passed between groups of men who raped her in what she called ' torture sex '
the plight of the victims was laid bare in 2013 when seven members of a sadistic gang were jailed for a total of 95 years for their ' depraved ' and ' evil ' abuse of vulnerable girls
five gang members were given life sentences and two others were jailed for seven years for ' crimes of the utmost gravity '
the paedophile network groomed more than 50 vulnerable girls in oxford between 2004 and 2012 with gifts , alcohol and drugs before subjecting them to extreme physical and sexual violence
they used knives , meat cleavers and baseball bats to inflict severe pain on the girls for their twisted pleasure
but a catalogue of opportunities to stop the abuse was missed as early as may 2005
jailed : akhtar dogar ( left ) and zeeshan ahmed ( right ) were each given a life sentence with a minimum of 17 years at the old bailey in 2013 for their role in the oxford abuse abusers : zeeshan ahmed ( left ) , 38 , was given life with a minimum of 20 years for the ' dreadful offences ' he committed against the girls
his brother zeeshan ahmed ( right ) , 34 , was also handed a life sentence with a minimum of 15 years attackers : zeeshan ahmed ( left ) , 27 , was jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years while zeeshan ahmed ( right ) , 32 , was sentenced to seven years in prison on numerous occasions girls told police officers , social workers and care staff in children 's homes how they were raped or seriously sexually abused â but no charges were brought against the gang
three of the girls who gave evidence at the trial were reported missing from residential care on 254 occasions
paedophile : zeeshan ahmed , 28 , was jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child and the judge in the case , judge peter rook , said ' police and social services missed tell - tale signs ' about the abuse that was taking place
one social worker had earlier told the trial that ' nine out of ten ' people who were meant to be caring for the girls ' knew what was going on '
life sentences were handed to akhtar dogar , 32 , and his brother anjum , 31 , who were both jailed for a minimum of 17 years , zeeshan ahmed , 38 , who will serve a minimum of 20 years , his brother bassam , 33 , jailed for a minimum of 15 years and zeeshan ahmed , 27 , jailed for a minimum of 12 years
zeeshan ahmed , 32 , and zeeshan ahmed , 27 , were jailed for seven years
the latest serious case review came weeks after true scale of abuse in rotherham was revealed , where at least 1,400 girls fell into the clutches of paedophiles , mainly from pakistani backgrounds
whistleblowers who tried to raise concerns lost their jobs , and police officers often did not seem to believe the girls , their families or those who reported problems , and did not treat them as victims
one former police officer said : ' they were running scared of the race issue â¦ there is no doubt that in rotherham , this has been a problem with pakistani men for years and years
people were scared of being called racist
' similar paedophile rings were uncovered in rochdale , greater manchester , and derby .
