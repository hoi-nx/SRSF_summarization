firefighters desperately tried to battle a fierce blaze that took hold of the 124 - year - old building at around 6.30am on monday morning but it has been left gutted
ms rachel griffiths told 774 abc melbourne the church was plagued by â tragedy and complicated feelings â and described it as being known locally as â the haunted house on the hill â
â we 've all attended many funerals of boys that we now know were abused by [ pickering ... and other perpetrators in the parish - at the actual church that it occurred in , â she said
' it 's been hard for priests to really cleanse this parish , it 's been very difficult to rebuild a community and we pretty much all scattered after the revelations came out and found other parishes
' ms rachel griffiths revealed she and other local roman catholic church had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it
' i think that 's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends ' brothers got involved with , ' she said
ronald pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in melbourne ' we stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door
' at least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest ronald pickering between 1960 and 1980 , according to research carried out in 2012
the former priest was named by the roman catholic church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children
however , after emigrating to britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died
one victim , dâbrass , told a 2013 victoria government inquiry that pickering groomed him with cigarettes , money and alcohol
he was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church
in his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on march 4 , 2013 , mr dâbrass said : â over this four - year period i am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by father ronald pickering
â i was regularly fondled and petted by pickering , as were other boys
this occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery
i began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol , which left me vulnerable to such abuse
â 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at st james church in brighton , in melbourne 's south - east ms rachel griffiths revealed she and other local roman catholic church had avoided being married in the church photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky he recalled : â i now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses , as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication
in 1983 , i stopped going to the presbytery after pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father
â he told me that i was not welcome back and that i would burn in hell
between 1983 and 1987 , the two other boys who i know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money , alcohol and cigarettes from pickering , but i chose not to because i was terrified of him
i have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by pickering
â one night after one of the boys paid a visit to pickering , he attempted suicide
he was unsuccessful on this attempt , but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later
