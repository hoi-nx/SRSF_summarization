the derek family were just trying to celebrate a birthday with a nice dinner out
but their night ended in tears when they had to rush their 2 - year - old daughter gabriela to the hospital drunk
the asheville , north carolina couple went to texas roadhouse this week to celebrate derek 's 25th birthday , with their toddler daughter in tow
the family ordered dinner and non-alcoholic drinks - including a cranberry juice for gabriela
little gabriela pictured during another trip this month to the restaurant worried sick : tiffany and derek say their little girl found the drink tasted funny , and then started acting strange and getting sick apologetic : the incident happened at this texas roadhouse restaurant in asheville
the restaurant has since issued a public apology to the family , saying it was a honest mistake
however , gabriela seemed to think the drink tasted funny , leading her parents to try it and also notice something was off
what they figured out was that the waitress had mistakenly brought a glass of sangria to the table instead of cranberry juice , like their ordered
sangria is a cocktail of wine mixed with fresh fruit
it appears the alcohol was too much for little gabriela 's small body , and she responded quickly
' she was staggering and she was kissing everything , ' mother tiffany gilliam told wlos
the experience likely ruined the restaurant for the gilliams , who appear to have favorited the joint
less than two weeks before , they took gabriela to the restaurant to celebrate her birthday as well , and she was pictured having a laugh while sitting on a horse saddle in photos posted to facebook
