walker said the 49 - year - old garrard ' should n't be spared ' after being convicted of capital murder in the death of savannah hardin
her mother , heather walker ( right ) , told the court that she believes her ex-mother - in - law deserves the death penalty joyce was found guilty of capital murder on friday
after more than three hours of deliberation an etowah county jury found garrard guilty of murder in the death of nine - year - old granddaughter , savannah hardin ' i personally feel like i see no remorse and she took away my baby 's life , ' walker said of garrard
seated just a few feet away at the defense table , garrard showed no emotion
meanwhile , much of walker 's testimony was hard to understand because she was sobbing uncontrollably
walker , who is divorced from garrard 's son robert and has since remarried , said she was n't allowed to see savannah during the last two years of the girl 's life
she had sent multiple care packages that were returned to her , and when she would phone the numbers , eventually all the contact numbers she had had been changed
but then one day a number she did n't recognize phoned her , she told the court on monday , and it was robert calling to say savannah had suffered brain swelling following a seizure ' how soon can you get here ? ' , he asked
at that point in her testimony ms heather walker burst into tears , detailing how she tried frantically to get more information
when she finally tracked her daughter down at children 's hospital a person on the line said she needed ' the grandmother 's permission ' to give heather walker any information
joyce tried to keep heather walker from being alone with savannah when she did get there
monday on the stand heather walker sobbed as described her daughter , who looked normal other than some blood on her face , but was nonetheless hooked up to machines with a fatal injury
savannah never had adhd to her memory and had no injuries or other medical issues
'' i could n't understand how that could just happen , ' she said she thought
heather walker had not seen daughter savannah in the year before her death , as she moved out of state to live with her father and stepmother
jessica says she repeatedly sent things , which would be returned to sender to her jurors convicted garrard on friday and now must decide whether to recommend death or life without parole , the only options under alabama law
the final decision is up to the judge
garrard showed no reaction when the guilty verdict was read , but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies
she glared toward the audience as she walked out silently
some of her relatives sitting behind her began to cry
defense attorney dani bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict , delivered after about three - and - a - half hours of deliberation
garrard 's husband , johnny , sat behind her , hugging a crying daughter before the daughter ran from the courtroom sobbing
the defense will begin presenting its case for a life sentence on wednesday
savannah collapsed and had a seizure after carrying wood as garrard refused to let her stop running
she died three days later in hospital prosecutors said garrard â with eight surviving grandchildren and a ninth - grade education â should be put to death for making the child run around her yard and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy in february 2012
prosecutors contended that garrard refused to let savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise
in court , they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson
defense attorney richard rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9 - year - old savannah while the girl 's father was overseas working as a contractor for the u.s. state department
under cross-examination by defense attorney richard rhea , walker said she did n't believe garrard ' woke up that morning ' planning to kill savannah
rather , she said , the situation seemed to get out of hand
' i think there was a point where she knew what she was doing , ' walker said
another witness , samuel hudgins , testified he saw the girl running laps around the house that day as garrard stood by
garrard forced savannah to run around the house and carry wood as punishment for a lie about candy in february 2012 some witnesses who testified about seeing garrard force savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than garrard appeared to be , griffith said
but rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day
garrard showed no reaction when she was found guilty , but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies he said , ' i think we have all had the thought : ' if it was that bad , why did n't they do something ? '' he said witnesses did n't notify police about their concerns until days later , after they heard girl was on life support
' then it becomes ' oh yeah , i witnessed boot camp
i witnessed the drill sergeant from hell ' , ' he said
garrard was the final witness to testify on wednesday and attorneys for both sides concluded their closing arguments friday afternoon
savannah collapsed from a seizure and died three days later in a hospital in birmingham after doctors determined there was no brain activity and removed her from life support
an autopsy blamed her death on seizures cause by low sodium following extreme physical exertion
walker described the mournful scene in the hospital room as a physician turned off a breathing machine as a test to see whether savannah , who was unconscious , would breathe on her own
' during this time joyce was just screaming at savannah saying , ' savannah , you need to breathe , '' walker said
within moments it was obvious savannah would n't survive , she said
' i held her hand until her body stiffened up , ' said walker , sobbing and barely understandable
but garrard seemed more worried about herself than her granddaughter , walker said
later at the hospital , walker said , garrard grabbed the shoulders of the child 's pregnant stepmother , jessica mae hardin
even though savannah hardin was in labor at the time and would later give birth , garrard seemed intent on getting the other woman 's attention , walker said
' she said , ' jessica , there 's a lot on the line
you need to pull it together , '' walker said
walker said already had suspicions about what had happened to her daughter , and she became ' more uneasy ' after hearing garrard 's remarks to savannah hardin
