it 's art in the most temporary form
for as soon as the tide comes in , chris 's beautiful beach designs are lost forever
talented ' sand artist ' chris , 25 , of marazion , cornwall , drives to nearby gwithian beach where he spends an hour on each creation using nothing more than his trusty rake
inspired by the work of sand artist tony platt , chris bought himself a rake and headed to his local beach to give it a try the talented artist places his rake into the sand and experimenting with lines and swirls until he spots patterns emerging he drags the rake through the sand to create an array of impressive geometric shapes , which are washed away as soon as the tide comes in
but chris says he does n't mind that his work only has a limited life - span - as he has managed to capture all his designs on camera , with a beautiful background created by the beach 's dramatic cliff face

' someone took a picture and shared it on the st michaels mount facebook page and overnight it had 300 likes , so i thought this is something i could do
' chris , who describes his work as temporary graffiti approaches each beach like a blank canvas , placing his rake into the sand and experimenting with lines and swirls until he spots patterns emerging
describing his work as temporary graffiti , he refuses to plan his artwork in advance - instead he follows the contours of the rocks and cliff faces , letting the rake decide its own path
he said : ' i just follow the rocks and cliffs or just walk and see what the rake does
' i just went to the beach and thought i wonder what this will look like and took it from there
chris describes his work as temporary graffiti approaches each beach like a blank canvas chris had a special message for mother 's day , drawing what every mum in the land will have wanted , some flowers chris drives to nearby gwithian beach because of its size and over-looking cliff face , which is perfect for photos ' i wanted to give something to the public when they are out and about - something totally different on the beach
' chris has now been commissioned to create some of his unique artwork for local cornwall businesses , including a law firm from truro and a falmouth based festival organiser
more of his artwork is available online , on his ' one man and his rake ' facebook page
spotting a perfect opportunity for some self - promotion , this design is accompanied by a teaser to his facebook page in almost a perfect circle , this design could be a football , or it could just be a mesemerising mesh of circles ...
