a doctor who made a stand against sexism in medicine has received hundreds of messages of support from disgruntled women physicians across the world
dr ashleigh witt , who works as a medical registrar , posted a lengthy post on her blog discussing how she is frequently belittled because of her sex , with people regularly referring to her as a ' lady doctor ' instead of just ' doctor '
she pointed out that she has also been judged by members of the profession in the higher ranks of her hospital who claimed she got into her position because she was pretty
dr ashleigh witt , who works as a medical registrar in melbourne writing on blogspot.com , dr ashleigh witt , from melbourne , australian , said : ' sexual harassment is every time you call me " blondie " or " barbie " , every time you make a joke about my choice to wear a skirt not pants , every time you comment on my appearance rather than my skillset , every time you call me a " lady doctor " instead of a " doctor "
' sexual harassment is two weeks ago when i lead a code blue which saved a woman on the labour ward and my male colleague arrived after the fact and said , " they should nât send you up here , you âre too clucky "
she continued : ' it âs also the consultant who commented that i âd " obviously gotten to where i was at a young age because i was pretty " ( um , maybe i âm actually good at my job ? )
' it âs the surgical registrar who told me if i wanted to be taken seriously i needed to dye my hair dark
' dr ashleigh witt wrote the essay in response to recent comments by a respected australian vascular surgeon called dr gabrielle mcmullin , who suggested women should accept sexual advances by their male colleagues instead of making a complaint that could damage their career
dr ashleigh witt , who says she has faced sexual harassment at work dr ashleigh witt believes that sexual comments of the kind she has experienced are causing serious damage to the medical profession
she said : ' these seemingly harmless comments , coupled with the line that we ' need to take a joke ' , teach women in medicine that they need to just accept everyday sexual harassment
' and worse still , they encourage those deeds further along the spectrum of sexual harassment
' where do we draw the line between commenting on someone 's appearance to commenting on her body to making an unwanted sexual advance ? ' clearly we 're having a great deal of trouble with the grey zone , so why do n't we stop subtle sexual harassment where it starts
' dr ashleigh witt ended her blog post with a call to arms for female medical workers , suggesting that they point out sexual harassment when it happened to the person in question
she said : ' i âm going to ask you , that this week you look out for subtle sexual harassment and call it out
' whether you âre the med student , the consultant , the nurse , the dietician or the plaster tech , that when you hear a comment towards a woman that would not be made if she was a man say " hey ! let âs not make jokes based on gender " , or " i do n't think that 's appropriate
" ' maybe , just maybe , the tiny ripples of change could start here
' the blog , which was posted on sunday , has since been praised by thousands around the world
