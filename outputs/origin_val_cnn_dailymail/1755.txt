click here to read matt lawton on how the liverpool boss put his faith in 3 - 4 - 3 liverpool have not suffered premier league defeat since falling 3 - 0 to man united at old trafford
sunday âs match at anfield is a measure of how far they have come
man united have been more hit and miss in that period , but still only lost twice in the league
they produced their best display of the season in the 3 - 0 victory over tottenham
plenty of players have improved , some have faded , while brendan rodgers and louis van gaal have toyed with their systems
here , sportsmail looks at how a composite xi of the sides might take shape , choosing the 3 - 4 - 3 formation favoured by liverpool to fit as many attackers in as possible
the liverpool and man united composite xi selected by sportsmail goalkeeper â david de gea the outstanding goalkeeper in england and arguably the best in the world right now
seems to pull off a save a real substance every game , offers good distribution , and exudes calm from his penalty box
david de gea has been outstanding between the sticks for man united this season centre - back â chris smalling a surprise perhaps , but turned in one of his best games in a man united shirt against tottenham
he was strong , brought the ball out with assurance , and picked a pass more than once
chris smalling produced one of his best performances of the season in man united 's win over tottenham last week centre - back â michael carrick not his ideal position but for want of excellent defenders could easily operate here
his anticipation and experience are valuable
a breathe of air to man united âs team after returning from injury
michael carrick celebrates his goal in man united 's 3 - 0 win over tottenham at old trafford last weekend centre - back â emre can has blossomed in his converted role in liverpool âs back three
deceptively quick because of his hulking frame , and an excellent ball player
emre can right wing - back â adam lallana such a skilful player clever enough to function in a variety of positions
offers energy and trickery down the flank and a threat when cutting in
liverpool 's adam lallana takes on neil taylor during last week 's 1 - 0 win at swansea left wing - back â ashley young has enjoyed a really consistent season and seems to be growing under louis van gaal
a menace down the left n recent games with renewed drive and end product
ashley young rampages down the wing against tottenham 's nacer chadli during last sunday 's match centre midfield â philippe coutinho dazzling talent and goal threat from any range
the oil to make the midfield cogs roll seamlessly along and possesses the imagination to unlock defences in the final third
philippe coutinho celebrates after scoring liverpool 's opening goal against southampton last month centre midfield â jordan henderson the steely core to the team and the best - performing midfielder in england right now
two stunning goals from distance in his recent back catalogue and a formidable mentality to seep across the side
jordan henderson celebrates his important winner for liverpool against swansea last monday right wing â raheem sterling brings whippet pace to stretch defenders and is illustrating his flexibility by coping intelligently to requests by brendan rodgers for positional changes
an absolute terror at his optimum
raheem sterling takes on swansea 's jack cork during liverpool victory at swansea left wing â daniel sturridge has not yet burst to life since his comeback from injury , but offering enough glimpses to force his way into this imaginary line - up
a potent scoring danger and able to assist as well
daniel sturridge celebrates in hallmark fashion after scoring against west ham at anfield in january striker â wayne rooney back to his best as a snarling centre - forward , with five goals in his last six games , so let him continue there
vast experience , vast ability and a ferocious desire to win
wayne rooney celebrates after scoring man united 's third goal against tottenham at old trafford last weekend so six liverpool players to five from man united , eight englishmen , and a team full of attacking intent
marouane fellaini would be first off the substitutes bench to offer a physical presence up front .
