it 's thanks to those 19th - century promoters that the elephant rose to become the circus 's king of beasts -- the living symbol of " ringling brothers
" " this is something that has been a big deal historically , " says circus historian janet davis , an american studies professor at the university of texas
traditionally , she observes , elephants are the stars of the parade when circuses come to town
there was even a 19th - century phrase , " to see the elephant , " a euphemism used by soldiers for seeing battle , recognizing the wonder and rarity of these giant animals
on thursday , ringling brothers , part of the feld entertainment firm , announced that it would be ending use of elephants by 2018
it 's a startling change for the show , which has made the giant pachyderms a centerpiece of its presentation for decades and weathered criticism for their treatment from animal rights groups
cnnmoney : ringling brothers will soon be without elephants brown was perhaps the first to make elephants a part of the circus atmosphere
the modern circus only dates back to around 1770 , the invention of an englishman named philip astley , who added jugglers , acrobats and clowns to his equestrian show
( the term " circus " comes from the ancient romans , although the roman version was closer to a sporting event featuring soldiers , and it could be quite bloody
) astley 's circus was such a huge success that he created one in paris , and his students and acolytes -- knowing a good idea when they saw one -- brought the circus to other cities
to this day , the ringmaster wears elegant riding clothes because of the circus ' equestrian roots
brown , a shrewd marketer who was also responsible for making the circus a tented traveling show , added a " menagerie " to the event to help combat the form 's sometimes seedy reputation
" circuses in this era were really for adults , and not marketed for children at all , " says davis
brown 's show , by adding a menagerie tent to the circus tent , could market their shows as educationally uplifting by " showing people the wonders of the animal world , " she adds
by the 1850s , elephants were regular circus attractions
in the early 1870s , the clever entrepreneur , who had made his fortune with such acts as the " feejee mermaid , " singer jenny lind and a new york - based museum of curiosities , created p.t. barnum 's museum , menagerie and circus
" they had exotic animals from the four corners of the earth , and you had to go through the menagerie first and then you went to your seat in the big top , " deborah walk , curator of collections for the ringling museums , told pbs for a 2010 documentary called " circus
" " there was no way to miss the menagerie -- it was all part of the educational outreach to get people to go to the show
" barnum and his partner made the circus an efficient business , running it on the railroad to far - flung destinations and transporting their animals long distances
" elephants become this incredibly important signature part of the circus , " says davis
the beasts were huge attractions
when barnum announced he was going to bring a white elephant back from asia , a competitor whitewashed his own elephant and engaged in a media war
( the clash popularized the term " white elephant
" ) another barnum purchase , the african elephant jumbo , was the centerpiece of his circus , and when jumbo died in 1885 , the victim of a train accident , the news made worldwide headlines
the attitudes towards elephants , and circus animals in general , started changing in the early 20th century , says davis
for one thing , until world war i , the circus was the king of the entertainment circuit : " there were no movies , radio or television to compete with the wonders of the circus ring and little traffic congestion or parking problems to impede those who sought to attend , " wrote bob brooke in history magazine
and in recent decades animal - rights activists have increasingly protested against the use of performing mammals such as elephants and killer whales , demanding better treatment for them
ringling brothers and other circus companies have dealt with numerous challenges over the last half - century , including ever - splintering attention for entertainment dollars and the rise of acrobat - based shows such as cirque du soleil , which is now a global empire
but " ringling brothers " is still hugely popular , and davis believes the loss of elephants wo n't affect the circus ' bottom line
still , she says , there is something special about the majestic animals
at a show she attended in 2013 , the elephants had their own space , and a bunch of children were standing nearby , watching them in awe
" it was very moving , " she says
" this physical proximity to these animals is powerful
" when it comes to circus animal acts , are more changes to come ? are lions and tigers next ? davis wonders
" in a way , the elephant is kind of the bellwether animal
i would imagine this is a kind of catalyst , " she says
" i would imagine that we have not heard the last of the kind of changes that are afoot in terms of animals and circuses
