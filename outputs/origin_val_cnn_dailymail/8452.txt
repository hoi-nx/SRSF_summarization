schmeichel has picked his # one2eleven of stars he played alongside throughout his career goalkeeper : schmeichel i 've only ever played with myself in goal
i would never do that , normally
but i 'm in goal
defender : gary neville this week he was pundit of the year
that is so typical of gary neville
whenever he sticks his head to something , he wants to be the best
he probably was n't the biggest talent , but pure will and so dependable
you could depend on him
defender : jaap stam i only played with him for one year and that was a very successful year , winning the treble
i took up smoking that year because i had nothing to do
i was up against the goalpost smoking because i had jaap in front of me
he was big , strong , quick , unbelievably quick
this guy was quick on half a yard , three yards , 20 yards , 50 yards
jaap stam lifts the premier league trophy as he had a very successful year alongside schmeichel defender : steve bruce he was there when i arrived at united
he was a really good friend
i ended up living next door to him , so he looked after me and my family
i 've never played with a player so brave
he was slow , but unbelievable
he could read the game
he was never , ever , ever scared to sacrifice himself in order to do one tiny little thing for the good of the team
defender : denis irwin what can you say about denis irwin that has n't been said before ? doing this team i 'm thinking about as a defender you 'd remember what mistakes they made
i could n't come up with a single mistake
so dependable , so reliable
his personality was really , really good for the back four of the team because we had so many outspoken personalities
he would be the guy in between
fantastic shooting technique , and he would score goals from open play as well
not many full - backs do that
former united player steve bruce ( left ) features in the goalkeeper 's best xi he played with midfielder : david beckham what david beckham has done with his life , people will remember him for that
i hope people wo n't forget how good a player he was
not only was he a good player but he is the one guy with the best kicking technique i 've ever seen in my life
that came from talent to begin with
he was one of the guys who took lessons off what eric cantona did
doing stuff on your own for instance
no - one did that at united
david beckham never cut a corner
midfielder : roy keane a person of many different things but for 90 minutes when we played football this guy was unbelievable
i ca n't remember anyone who had the energy to run box to box , or 120 if it went to extra time
keep doing the same thing , keep doing the same thing
driving everybody to do the same
in his prime he was probably one of the best midfield players in the world
midfielder : scholes when i came to united he was a kid back then , playing in the youth team , but he was a striker
you could see there was something very special about him
he was converted into a midfield player
scholes 's passes , any kind of distance , from one yard to 40 yards , they were always accurate
roy keane ( from left to right ) , david beckham and ryan giggs all make it from schmeichel 's united days midfielder : ryan giggs we know the goal he scored in the semi-final against arsenal
it 's been shown time and time again because it is the best goal ever scored in the fa cup
from 16 years of age to this year , to be able to perform at that level , to give the team so much , this guy has got to be the best premier league player of all time
what he has given united and what he still gives united is fantastic
midfielder : michael laudrup probably the best player i 've ever played with
it 's a shame he has n't played in this country but this is a guy who played in one of the best barcelona teams ever
he made the journey to madrid , and played in one of the best madrid teams ever
won everything that football has to offer
striker : eric cantona the king
we had one season in 95 we were struggling
we really , really did n't play the way we should
this guy just changed everything
a different approach to games
