an online shopper got the fright of his life when a live mouse leapt out of his grocery bags and ran around his kitchen
bain was unpacking his tesco shopping at his home in clacton , essex , when he noticed something stirring in one of the bags
the 41 - year - old was shocked to then see a mouse dart out from one of the plastic bags and scurry across the floor
after he phoned tesco to complain , the supermarket sent a team of pest control experts whose trap later caught the creature
it was one of the first times mr bain and his wife , hayley , 28 , had used tesco 's online delivery service
the car salesman said : ' i was going through the bag and i did n't realise it was there but when i put my hand in i saw something move
' i told my wife there was a mouse in the bag and she jumped off the floor
it was just so fast
it 's the last thing you expect with a delivery
' mr bain managed to film the mouse on his mobile phone shortly after it emerged from the rubbish
in the footage he captured , the mouse can be seen darting across the floor of the kitchen , which is currently being re-fitted
the couple were worried about their two staffordshire bull terriers , max and bruno , eating the mouse in case it was diseased
the mouse was later caught in a trap after ' scratching for two nights solid '
the animal ran around the couple 's kitchen and disappeared into a hole before being caught by pest control mr bain said the incident left him wondering what might have happened to other people 's shopping which was also on the delivery van
he added : ' it disgusted my wife and it makes you think if it was in the van , whose other bags had it been in and whose other food had it urinated on
' to be fair to tesco , they gave us some flowers and some treats for the dogs and sent rentokil around , they 've been pretty good
' the shopping was delivered last thursday and the mouse was captured in a trap on saturday
a tesco spokesman said : ' we 've apologised to mr bain and the local online food shopping manager has visited him to deliver flowers , a replacement order and a gesture of goodwill
' a thorough check of the store by pest control found no evidence of further problems , so we 're still investigating to find out exactly what happened
' tesco , which sent in pest control experts , has apologised and replaced the Â£ 85 worth of shopping
