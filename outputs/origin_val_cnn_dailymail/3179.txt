a family that has worked the same hillside farm for five generations was yesterday forced to hand over their land to an â aggressive â loan company
mary and alun williams , who produce beef and lamb for supermarkets , say their lives have been destroyed after they were tied to crippling interest rates that dragged them into millions of pounds of debt
court yesterday ruled they would have to hand over the 600 - acre rhyngddwyafon farm in snowdonia national park , north wales , which the family has farmed for a century
mary and alun williams ( pictured ) , who produce beef and lamb for supermarkets at their 600 - acre farm in snowdonia national park , north wales , have ordered by a court to hand over their land to a loan company williams , 55 , ( pictured outside llangefni county court following the ruling ) said it was ' the worst day of our lives ' and claimed the couple had been ' duped by a firm that is asset - stripping farmers of their livelihoods ' last night mrs williams , 55 , said : â it has been absolutely heartbreaking , the worst day of our lives
we have been totally duped by a firm that is asset - stripping farmers of their livelihoods
â my family and especially my sons , robert and rhodri , who farm the land , face an uncertain future
i think the fact nothing has been done to stop this company is a national disgrace
â i ca nât believed we were so stupid as to believe them and trust them
â the williams family say they were advised about four years ago to take a short - term commercial bridging loan to cover their mortgage â starting at rates of up to 22 per cent with the understanding a domestic mortgage rate of around 4 per cent would follow
as it did not materialise they took out further bridging loans and saw their Â£ 1.24million loan rocket to Â£ 3.1million due to fees , interest and other charges
when they were unable to pay , the firm â somerset - based uk acorn finance â started legal action to repossess the farm
farmers across the uk are being driven to the wall by lenders using lax regulation to seize properties and livelihoods , say mps , who accused acorn of â reckless , if not fraudulent â practice
the couple initially took out a short - term commercial bridging loan to cover their mortgage four years ago but saw the amount they had to pay back soar to Â£ 3.1million due to additional loans , fees , interest and charges the family has farmed on the 600 - acre estate in north wales for the last century

' i appreciate the thoroughly unenviable position mrs williams and her family find themselves and i very much sympathise with them
â as commercial lending is unregulated , most of acorn âs activities are not overseen by the financial conduct authority
elfyn llwyd , a plaid cymru mp and barrister , said acorn and associated companies had exploited farmers for more than two decades in what he called â one of the worst scandals â he had seen
dozens of farmers have complained to avon and somerset police , saying they were victims of an organised sting with conspiring lenders , brokers and solicitors
mrs williams ( pictured right on the farm in 2007 ) said : ' i ca nât believed we were so stupid as to believe and trust them ' after being dragged into debt by the loans
pictured left : her husband alun williams working on the farm in 1986 the couple said their lives have been destroyed by the crippling interest rates that dragged them into debt in response to complaints it had not tackled acorn , the force said it accepted the lender was â aggressive and unpleasant â and had caused significant distress
it said the firm exploits a â loophole â and called for tighter regulation
now the financial conduct authority , the solicitors regulation authority and the government are scrutinising acorn âs activities
outside court , the firm said : â uk acorn finance has repeatedly invited mrs williams to enter into a constructive dialogue with it to achieve the repayment of her loans but mrs williams has chosen not to take up those invitations
' that has left uk acorn finance with no option other than the enforcement of its loan security
