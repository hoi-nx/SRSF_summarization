shakib , and bangladesh , have had little success against their super-power neighbours in the intervening years and were beaten by their fellow co-hosts as india steered their championship route in this tournament in 2011
but as bangladesh enter unchartered territory , as quarter - final debutants , shakib warns anything is possible
' this is the first time we 're playing in a cricket world cup quarter - final - but at the same time we need to understand it 's another game of cricket , ' he said
