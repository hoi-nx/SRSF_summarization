former scotland captain mackay , legendary enforcer of tottenham âs 1961 double winning side , has died aged 80
in an age of hard men , the stockily built midfield man was one of the toughest , a symbol of passion and fiery commitment
for years the iconic picture of him angrily holding leeds â equally combative billy bremner was framed on the wall in the players â lounge at white hart lane , the club âs spiritual leader long after he âd left

born in edinburgh in 1934 , he was the second in a family of four boys whose father worked for the scotsman newspaper
he began his career with his boyhood idols hearts , winning all three domestic honours before captaining the side in 1957 - 8 when they won the league title â setting a british record with 132 goals scored and only 29 conceded
that persuaded tottenham to buy him in 1959 for Â£ 32,000 , a transfer that manager bill nicholson later claimed was his greatest ever signing
he created a powerful partnership with danny blanchflower , and together they provided the driving force in the side that became the first post-war team to achieve the double of league title and fa cup
in all mackay played 318 times for tottenham , twice recovering from a broken left leg to captain the side that won the fa cup in 1967
in a statement , tottenham said : ' mackay will certainly always be remembered here as one of our greatest ever players and a man who never failed to inspire those around him
' in short , a tottenham legend

he was a powerful personality , the leader off the field in the days when the players would congregate in the bell and hare pub after matches , as well as the leader on the pitch
when clough was forging the early days of his management career in 1968 he persuaded tottenham to sell him derby captain mackay for a bargain Â£ 5,000 â and the scot then became captain of the team that first won promotion to the old first division , and then captured the league title in their first season in the top flight

that began a management career which brought more success , starting out with nottingham forest and then peaking when in 1975 , appointed as derby county âs manager following clough âs resignation , he guided the club to the 1974 - 5 league title
further jobs with walsall , doncaster and birmingham brought less success , however , and his career ended taking jobs in egypt and qatar before he retired from football altogether in 1995
in later years he suffered from both alzheimer âs and parkinson âs disease .
