examining an ultrasound scan of your unborn child is a nerve - racking moment for most parents
but any worries that ed and dee parsons may have harboured quickly faded when they saw their baby in the womb at 20 weeks
the child was making an unmistakable v - sign â the victory gesture associated with winston churchill and , latterly , with world peace
the baby formed a v symbol with its tiny fingers while in mother dee parson 's womb during a scan â the sonographer could n't believe it â she said she had never seen anything like it before , â said mrs dee parsons , 35
â it âs nice to have such an iconic image of peace when there âs so much unrest all around us
she said she and her husband , also 35 , were feeling weighed down by negative global events and the death of someone close to them
â we were thinking , we âre bringing this child into the world at such a horrible time , â she added
â but then this happened , we could nât quite believe what we were seeing
' all our friends said they thought it was such a positive , happy symbol
â the couple , who live in godalming , surrey , and run an event production business , are thinking of calling the winston if it is a boy
â it âs growing on us , â mrs dee parsons said
â but for now we are calling it peace - baby , that âs our nickname
â mrs dee parsons , who has a daughter , grace , six , from a previous marriage , said that in the 12 - week scan the child had given a clear thumbs - up
winston churchill is reported to have once said : â all babies look like me
but then , i look like all babies
â expectant parents dee parsons and ed parsons said the image was ' very reassuring ' because the symbol is so ' happy '
