they are not recognised by neighbouring countries , do not know their ages , and have little concept of reading or writing
the bajau people are known as the ' sea gipsies , ' as they spend most of their time living on boats and working in the turquoise pacific ocean
photographer rã©hahn spent eight days among the sea nomad children in borneo , learning about their fascinating aquatic lives
the young children learn from a young age how to swim or dive , and start their hunting as young as eight years old
despite many of them not knowing their ages , or written communication , rã©hahn described the peace and serenity that emanated from the water tribe
' the children are like fish in the sea
young children are sometimes on the boat alone , but all seemed very happy to see a foreigner , ' the 35 - year - old french photographer said
' children were jumping from a wooden bridge and they wanted me to take their photo
' the bajau tribe 's beliefs centre around a combination of animism and islam , with their relationship with the ocean and its inhabitants being at the heart of the nomads ' existence
happy and content ! rã©hahn said the sea gipsies were like fish in the water , and spent a lot of their time jumping happily into the water from a bridge due to extended periods under the surface , the sea nomads have an enhanced underwater - vision , perfect for spearfishing rã©hahn said : ' when i arrived , children jumped on the boat to come near me
some families invited me to their house ' being around water from a young age results in the best divers being able to stay submerged at depths of 20 metres for several minutes , while they hunt for fish
the hunter - gathers mainly use spearfishing to get their produce , but can dive for pearls and sea cucumbers
studies have shown that youngsters have exceptionally good underwater - vision due to being constantly in the ocean environment
as diving is such a big part of their lives , often their ear drums rapture at an early age
regardless of their age , everyone in the bajau tribe has a place and helps in some way to catch the fish splashing around ! bajau children enjoy their water existence and play in the turquoise waves the best divers are able to stay underwater at depths of 20 metres for several minutes , while they hunt for fish rã©hahn , who has over 180,000 fans of his work on his fan page , said : ' they are very welcoming and friendly
when i arrived , children jumped on the boat to come near me
some families invited me to their house
' although some of the seafaring tribe are born on the ocean and never live on the land , more frequently the sea gypsies are heading to the shore for trade and to gather materials to build boats
rã©hahn said the bajau roughly know about age but time does n't matter much to them , and they live in the present , and live only for and by the water
some female sea gipsies give birth on their huts with stilts , although many come to land to trade and get supplies , there are a small number who have lived entirely on the ocean throughout their whole lives the tribe 's beliefs centre around a combination of animism and islam , with their relationship with the ocean and its inhabitants being at the heart of their existence
