burnley boss sean dyche believes dressing - room spats between players are ' a natural occurrence ' at the highest level
city visit turf moor on saturday at the end of a week where the club have been forced to play down reports that captain vincent kompany was dropped following a bust - up with team - mate fernandinho
the row allegedly came at half - time during their defeat by liverpool earlier this month , with neither player in the starting line - up for the clash with leicester three days later
vincent kompany ( left ) and fernandinho ( right ) were involved in a dressing - room row at liverpool but sean dyche dismissed suggestions it was a good time to face city and can understand why passions occasionally run too high
he said : ' i think it 's a natural occurrence
you 've got highly - talented , highly - motivated people , all in a working environment that 's very challenging
' everyone wants a shirt , everyone wants to play , and also , i can only imagine , at that level you 're borderline into 25 mini companies
it 's not just players , you 're dealing with the whole shebang - pr consultants , agents , pas , who knows what else
' i imagine it 's like having 25 ceos and trying to align them all with whatever the bigger picture is
there 's always going to be challenges because they 're powerful - minded people , which is why they 're at the top of the game
' vincent kompany was dropped to the bench when city hosted leicester burnley are without a win in two months and sit second bottom of the premier league table , three points from safety
but city and manager manuel pellegrini will certainly not underestimate the burnley after their stunning performance at the etihad in december , when they fought back from 2 - 0 down to claim a draw
sean dyche said : ' they 've got some fantastic players
we experienced that once before , we gave a good performance and i think overall deserved a point out of the game
but that does n't guarantee us anything this time around
' they 're a highly - motivated group of players , still in the hunt , still right up there , very experienced and a fantastic manager , so obviously it 's a big challenge once again
' vincent kompany attempts to tackle raheem sterling during city 's 2 - 1 defeat by liverpool sean dyche added to his squad this week with the recruitment on a three - year deal of norwegian midfielder ulvestad
the burnley boss has been keen for the club to expand their scouting network into europe and signed 22 - year - old ulvestad after a two - week trial
the burnley were already short in midfield before dean marney was ruled out for the season with a knee injury last month but sean dyche insisted ulvestad will not be rushed
' he wanted to come in and i think it 's a good way of doing business because he gets a chance to have a look at us and we can have a look at him , and he fitted in straight away , ' said the burnley boss
' that was probably the key thing
sometimes players who are with you and are not part of the group , they look not part of the group , but he fitted in seamlessly and we thought there was more to come from him , so that 's why we signed him
burnley boss sean dyche can understand why passions occasionally run too high ' at the moment it 's that cooling - off period , getting used to how we work
i do n't know that much about the norwegian league but i know it 's not the premier league
' he 's been to a couple of games so he knows how we operate and how the premier league operates
we 're looking forward to him working with us and developing further
' we have been light in midfield but that 's not why freddie 's come in , because if it was he 'd have to operate immediately
we think there 's more to come going forwards than right now
' if he 's needed this season and we think he 's ready , then that 's different , but he 's only been in the building a couple of weeks , so we 'll see how he continues getting used to what it is to be here and obviously then looking at the idea of being in the first team , but there 's no rushing that situation
