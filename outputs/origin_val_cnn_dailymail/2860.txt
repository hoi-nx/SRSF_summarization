a high - flying academic who travels the world as a government adviser is set to be deported from uk under ' barmy ' new visa laws - because she is out of the country more than 180 days a year
dr miwa hirono , 38 , is originally from japan but has been living in the uk since becoming a lecturer at the university of nottingham seven years ago
the world - renowned academic 's work - which helps the uk government to set foreign policy - requires her to spend long spells working in china and africa
set to be deported : miwa hirono with her husband , peter trebilco , 61 , and one - year - old son tada , must leave uk under ' barmy ' new visa laws in 2009 and 2010 she spent around 200 days abroad researching china 's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations
but home office immigration laws now state that people working in the uk on a migrant visa can not be out of the country for more than 180 days each year
and despite the fact dr miwa hirono does research for a government - funded organisation and her baby son was born in uk , the home office has decided to deport her
her university colleagues have slammed the decision as ' vindictive and bone - headed ' but the home office has refused to back down
today , dr miwa hirono , who lives in beeston , notts. , with her husband peter trebilco , 61 , and their one - year - old son tada , said : ' it came as a massive , utter shock
' my australian husband quit his job to join me in the uk as a family
i bought a house in beeston two years ago and gave birth to my son here
' i have my life here , everything is here but i have to give up everything
battle : dr miwa hirono 's university colleagues have slammed the decision as ' vindictive and bone - headed ' ' it is idiocy
the government funded my research and now they are penalising me for hard work and contributing to their policies
' i have one published paper which is uploaded on the uk embassy in beijing 's website
they changed the visa rule in 2012 and have applied it retrospectively to my travel in 2009 and 2010
' what has happened to me is absolutely wrong and everyone understands my point except the home office
' i thought this was a democratic country with natural justice but it does n't seem that way
' dr miwa hirono , an expert in international relations , has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it ' impractical '
instead she has taken a job at a university in kyoto , japan , and the family are leaving the uk on march 29
her husband peter said the home office decision has caused the family to uproot their whole life
left with no choice : dr miwa hirono , an expert in international relations , has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it ' impractical ' he added : ' it tears at your heart because we 've gone to great lengths to make good friends in the neighbourhood and we 're very supportive and contribute to the community
' we 're having to tear our son out of nursery , give up a home we 've established , with neighbours we 're very fond of , and none of that is our doing
' it 's an inflexibility - the law does not have the capacity to deal with individual situations
it 's our whole life
' dr miwa hirono came to the university of nottingham in 2008 on a prestigious five - year research council uk fellowship , which then became a permanent role
but when applying to extend her visa last march , she was banned and told she would be deported because of the foreign travel aspect of her job
university bosses even wrote to the home office to tell officials that the trips were part of her job
in december , dr miwa hirono won an appeal against the home office with a judge suggesting it would not be in the national interest to deport someone who had ' made a significant and profound contribution to the academic framework of higher education in this country '
but that ruling was later overturned and immigration bosses confiscated the family 's passports a year ago
professor mathew humphrey said dr miwa hirono 's research had had a significant impact on policy towards china , including on the uk 's co-operation programme with the country
unsympathetic : government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the uk via skype after ruling her private life should be given ' little weight ' philip cowley , professor of parliamentary government at the university , said : ' it is pure madness for the government to be driving out an expert on what is probably the most important foreign policy challenge of the next decade
' both from a human perspective and from the interests of the uk , this is indefensible
' dr miwa hirono 's local mp , anna soubry , even wrote to home secretary theresa may asking her to consider the decision , but no action was taken
a home office spokesperson said : ' ms miwa hirono 's application for indefinite leave to remain was refused in july 2014 because she had spent more than 180 days outside the uk
' government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the uk via skype after ruling her private life should be given ' little weight '
dr miwa hirono said she believes her case will have a wider impact on the uk 's ability to hire foreign professionals
she added : ' this could mean the uk loses its capacity to hire any foreign professional on a permanent basis
' who would want to stop their live elsewhere and move everything to the uk only to be kicked out after five years
