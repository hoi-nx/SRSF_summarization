joe launchbury could return to wasps by the end of the month as he nears the end of neck surgery recovery launchbury ( right ) is an england international but was out of the six nations due to the issue launchbury ( left ) has not played since october but could feature for wasps against exeter on april 26 ' joe launchbury is in the final stage of his rehab , so he 's over the worst , but if one or two days do n't quite go to plan it will make a difference in when he 's back , ' young said
' we 've pencilled in either the leicester or the exeter games , so he should be back in either of those games
it will be like having a new signing
' launchbury will be missing for sunday 's trip to double european champions toulon with wasps facing the toughest assignment of the four english teams in the last eight of the champions cup
the odds are heavily stacked against the coventry - based club , but young is planning to ambush the big - spending top 14 team with a display bristling with attacking intent
' if this is a slow , set - piece game we 'll lose
if they are allowed to control the tempo , we do n't have enough to win , ' young said
' if we can get some real tempo and intensity and ask questions of them , then who knows what can happen ? ' this is a game we have to try to win
if we sit back and are conservative , there 's only winner
' toulon have lost games and they 're not unbeatable , so you have to back yourselves
launchbury , 23 , could play against leicester on may 9 if the game against exeter comes too soon young has a plan for wasps ' encounter against french side toulon on the weekend ' we 've shown we can upset the best teams
against these guys we 'll have to play for 80 minutes
we just have to go out there and really play
' if we can get quick line - outs or taps going then great
anything within kicking range we 'll kick it , but until then let 's play rugby
it may be good enough on the day , it may not
' we 're not going to throw caution to the wind , but we have to be a little more adventurous than we would be in the premiership
