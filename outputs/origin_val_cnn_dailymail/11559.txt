spy chiefs have been told by mps to recruit middle - aged mothers because they are ' emotionally intelligent ' and skilled at relationships
the intelligence and security committee said mi5 , mi6 and gchq should start advertising on the mumsnet website
an inquiry by the mps and peers on the committee found that action was needed to break through the ' permafrost ' of middle - aged men dominating the ranks of the intelligence agencies who have a ' very traditional male mentality and outlook '

labour 's blears , who sits on the intelligence and security committee , said yesterday that recruiting a greater number of women would make the security services better at their job
she highlighted the particular skills mothers have in building relationships â a vital talent for spies trying to recruit informants
' women who have had children and brought their families up , they have valuable life experience , ' the former home office minister said
the dominance of men , by contrast , ' can reinforce a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career ' , she said
women deliver a ' more consultative , collaborative approach '
labour mps blears said more women spies were needed mrs blears said : ' if all intelligence professionals are cut from the same cloth â sharing similar backgrounds and characteristics â then they are likely to share ' unacknowledged biases ' that will circumscribe both the definition of problems and the search for solutions
' according to the inquiry , her view that women can make for a better working environment for spies was backed by sir iain lobban , the former director of gchq , the listening agency
' i find that the discussions are deeper , i think they are more emotionally intelligent and , if you like , i think there is more intuition in the room , ' he said
mrs blears said the need for mi6 officers to be able to deploy abroad â sometimes at short notice â could be a problem for women with children
she added : ' there is a bit of testosterone in the system that says , ' tickets , money , passport â we all have to get there '
and if you 've got children , finding 24 - hour childcare is often very difficult
' mrs blears also revealed that the bbc tv drama spooks had made it harder for mi5 to recruit women a string of its female characters met a grisly end , such as being blown apart trying to rescue a home secretary from a bomb

targeted recruitment should also be carried out , including through websites such as mumsnet , it recommends
ms blears said : ' changing the culture is the one area that is most difficult to articulate and , crucially , to take action on , but if you want change , that is where to start
i âd make a great spy
i go totally unnoticed everywhere i go , but i have a keen eye for detail
nobody suspects a woman in mum boots of anything underhand
if they need someone whose special skill is getting melted chocolate down her dog - haired jumper and not noticing , i âm their woman
i âve always said that a crack team of mothers could knock most governments into a cocked hat
i would love to be a spy
and no one would suspect me
i am too boring and frumpy
well i âm not signing up
everybody i get attached to dies a horrible death
' it is clear to us there are those at middle management level - referred to by some people as ' the permafrost ' - who have a very traditional male mentality and outlook
' this can reinforce a management culture which rewards those who speak the loudest or are aggressive in pursuing their career and does not fully recognise the value of a more consultative , collaborative approach
' we therefore recommend that there is a real focus on identifying and tackling the barriers that can exist at middle management level , so that women and men can fully achieve their potential in a supportive team ethos
' the intelligence and security committee hopes that this report and the specific recommendations it contains will galvanise support for , and lead to further concerted efforts to create , a more gender diverse workforce in the agencies
' former us secretary of state madeleine albright , who conducted a similar investigation into women in the cia , said improving diversity would help in the response to threats to national security
she said : ' as ms blears rightly says diversity should be pursued - not just on legal or ethical grounds , important as these are in their own right - but because it will result in a better response to the range of threats that threaten national security
' much of what is said in this report echoes and reinforces my own work on the director 's advisory group on women in intelligence and security committee at the cia
' i am sure we will all benefit from close cooperation on these vital issues between our two countries
