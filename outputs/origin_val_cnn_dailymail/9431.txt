deputy pm clegg making cornish pasties during a visit to st merryn school in north cornwall clegg yesterday handed over Â£ 150,000 of public money to promote a language barely anyone speaks
the liberal democrat leader âs generosity to the handful of cornish speakers is the latest in a series of extraordinary gestures to the county over recent months
yesterday âs handout brings coalition spending on attempts to revive cornish to Â£ 500,000 â enough to give nearly Â£ 900 to every person who speaks it
the deputy prime minister âs interest in cornish provoked cynicism among opponents , who pointed to his party âs lowly status in the polls
it comes a week after the party announced a drop in fuel prices that mainly benefits areas full of liberal democrat voters
the 5p cut on fuel duty covers 17 rural areas , 14 of which are liberal democrat seats
three of cornwall âs six mps are liberal democrat with slim majorities and mr clegg even chose to visit the county rather than attend the commons on the day chancellor george osborne presented his autumn statement in december
mr clegg said : â i am determined to keep [ cornish ] alive and thriving
â great efforts have been made to revive and return cornish to common use
it would be a crime to let such a distinct language disappear again
â cornish has not been widely used since the 18th century
at the 2011 census 557 people listed it as their first language
last april , liberal democrat persuaded the council of europe to recognise cornish people as a â national minority â in england , which means the government is now pledged to â combat discrimination â against them
tory mp andrew bridgen said : â i do nât know what the cornish is for a blatant electoral bribe , but with Â£ 150,000 of taxpayers â money i âm sure that clegg can tell us
it would appear that mr clegg is trying to buy votes with public money
â the money will go to the cornish language partnership , an organisation financed by taxpayers and run by activists and local council nominees
mr clegg said yesterday he will stay on as a caretaker deputy prime minister if there is a hung parliament because the country will need a government in place to â keep the lights on â
he confirmed he was prepared to stay on while coalition talks are hammered out , which could take weeks or months .
