a woman who described herself as a ' good girl ' and had been married to the same man for 17 years has spoken about her ' year off ' trying an open marriage
writer robin rinaldi , now 50 , slept with ten men and two women during her year of promiscuity in 2008 , but is now divorced from her husband
appearing on itv 's this morning , robin rinaldi opened up about her unorthodox decision , which she says was triggered by her husband 's vasectomy
' i would say before the year i was in a somewhat inhibited but satisfied , normal loving relationship , ' she said of her 17 year marriage to scott mansfield , a brewer and wine - maker
' but when i got into my early 40s my husband got a vasectomy and i knew the discussion of having a baby was over , which kick - started this experience , ' she explained
' i looked forward to my death bed and thought
" what will i have ? " i wo nât have children and grandchildren
will i at least have lived fully ? " ' ' if i could nât have one i wanted the other , ' she explained
' like a lot of women at that age i was hitting my confidence and sexual peak and suddenly realised very dramatically that i was nât going to have children
it was the perfect storm
robino said having ' very little sexual variety ' in her youth was a motivating factor , as the fact that she was living in san francisco , which she described as ' a very liberal city ' ' wild oats ' : robin rinaldi , 50 , negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years , which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship ' i have had lots of people telling me i should have travelled the world , tried painting classes or cooking â but i already know how to cook ! ' she also said having ' very little sexual variety ' in her youth was a motivating factor , as the fact that she was living in san francisco , which she described as ' a very liberal city '
' i was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation , ' she said
' so i thought ok whilst we do that i need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same
' under the terms of her new deal , robin rinaldi took out an apartment , where she lived from monday to friday and would bed her conquests
but over the weekend she would go back to mansfield , and the two would live as a married couple , without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart
' the ground rules were safe sex , not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances , ' she explained
' but at the end of the year , we each broke two rules
' to find willing participants in her project robin rinaldi decided not to pick up men at bars , but to be more strategic in her search
' i was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had i picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand , ' she explains
' so i felt like going about it in a more clear - headed , conscious way
' robin rinaldi posted an online ad , entitled good girl seeks experience
in the post , she wrote : ' i 'm a 44 - year - old professional , educated , attractive woman in an open marriage , seeking single men age 35 - 50 to help me explore my sexuality
' ' i said i wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks
i explained that if it led to sex then great , but that i could nât get seriously involved or see them more than a few times
' the next day , robin rinaldi had 23 offers and over the course of the year had 12 sexual partners , including two women
struggle : robin rinaldi said her husband , scott mansfield , right , was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children , driving her to want lovers instead so would she advise it ? â not if you want to stay married , ' she told this morning hosts philip schofield and amanda holden
' read my book instead and have an armchair adventure
' ' i was well aware it would be very risky â but i did nât think we had that much to lose
' this 5:2 idea of weekends together and weekdays apart was to put a bit of distance between us to see each other in a new light and add some sparkle
' that happened at first , ' she said , but admitted their sexual exploits ended up pushing them apart
account : robin rinaldi describes every step of the ' project ' in intimate detail in her newly - released book , the wild oats project ' it was hard to put it all back in the box , ' she exlained
robin rinaldi , who made the life - changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008 , has written a book about her exploits called the wild oats project
in the book she describes her relationship with mansfield , a brewer and wine - maker , as ' stuck in a rut ' , adding that ' our once - a - week sex life was loving , but lacked spontaneity and passion '
recounting her exploits in her book , robin rinaldi described her first encounter with a 40 - year - old lawyer , whom she bedded in her apartment on the second date : ' we stumbled to the bed , where he turned me onto my hands and knees and took me from behind
' we had intercourse twice and , after he left , i felt satiated
' she later moved on to much younger men , and described texting her husband goodnight from a las vegas hotel room moments after a 23 - year - old paramour left the room
two of her 12 encounters were with women , one of which was a threesome
describing another encounter , she writes explicitly about taking a new - found pleasure in fellatio
however , after the raucous year , robin rinaldi admitted , she could not turn back
attempts to rekindle their marriage after the year failed - and robin rinaldi began sleeping with one of the men from the past year , whom she refers to by a pseudonym
she wrote : ' the turning point was hearing from alden
he sent me an e-mail , out of the blue , several months after the project had come to an end
' before long , we were having sex again
being with him was exquisite
after reconnecting with alden and falling deeply in love with him , there was no going back
' irretrievable : after robin rinaldi 's year of uninhibited encounters , she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with mansfield , and the two now have different partners robin rinaldi has now lived with ' alden ' for five years in a monogamous relationship , while mansfield has also moved on
the former couple now consider themselves at peace - and mansfield was even happy with her writing the book , detailing every aspect of their sex lives and her previously secret exploits with other men
speaking to the daily beast about how he responded to the book , she said : ' his response was , " you have to write it
if you write it well , it wo nât really be about us , it will be about lots of marriages
