another student in oklahoma named rice has been bombarded with hate messages and threats from people believing he is the racist fraternity member of the same name
he realized he had been mistakenly tied to the scandal when his roommate at oklahoma state university woke him up on monday to warn him of a barrage of hateful messages on his intsagram and facebook accounts
at first he thought his accounts had been hacked , but he soon realized he had been mistaken for the racist student at arch rival oklahoma university
the other rice , 19 , was expelled from the institution after he was caught singing : ' there will never be a n * * * * in sae ' in a sickening video that has shocked the nation
the privately - educated catholic schoolboy from dallas was identified as one of the conductors leading the songs on a bus on saturday alongside 20 - year - old levi petit
the innocent rice , who is studying towards his elementary japanese exams , told kera news he sees the funny side of what has happened , but admitted it had still been stressful
' initially , it was kind of scary , to not know what i did to bring all of this hate to myself , ' he told the station
' it 's definitely been stressful
but i guess i take a lighter view of the comments , and be happy it 's not directed at me
links : the innocent rice ( left ) was wrongly targeted with the other rice , a privately - educated catholic schoolboy from dallas was identified as one of the conductors leading racist chants on a bus he added : ' i do think it 's wrong
and it should n't be happening
and from the looks of it , we have a lot of work to do , if as a community we want to change that
' he also wrote a message on facebook saying : ' i would like everyone to know that i 'm not the rice who allegedly was in the racist video from the sae incident this past weekend
i am a student at oklahoma state university and have never had any involvement with this fraternity
' my instagram , twitter and facebook profiles have been linked across the internet in relation to this incident
i would appreciate it if people would stop posting slanderous and hateful messages on my pages
in the wake of his identification , the guilty rice apologized and stated he had quit the university
even though other reports suggested he had been expelled
he wrote : ' i am deeply sorry for what i did saturday night
it was wrong and reckless
i made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same
' ' on monday , i withdrew from the university ... i admit it likely was fueled by alcohol consumed at the house before the bus trip , but that âs not an excuse
response : the innocent rice , who is currently studying towards his elementary japanese exams , admitted he sees the funny side of what has happened , but admitted it had still been stressful ' yes , the song was taught to us , but that too does nât work as an explanation ... for me , this is a devastating lesson and i am seeking guidance on how i can learn from this and make sure it never happens again
' his family have since been forced to flee their home after protesters gathered outside and began chanting : ' racism is taught '
in response to the chant , which a whole busload of students joined in with , sae 's national leadership closed the fraternity
rice is featured the most prominently in the video , as he pumps his fist and encourages others aboard the chartered bus to sing along with the lyrics : ' there will never be a n * * * * * sae
you can hang him from a tree , but he 'll never sign with me
there will never be a n * * * * * sae
' the video , taken aboard a party bus saturday night en route from the campus in norman to the oklahoma city golf & country club , caused immediate outrage on sunday when it was posed on social media
oklahoma state university officials responded by banning the fraternity from campus and demanding that members move out by midnight on monday .
