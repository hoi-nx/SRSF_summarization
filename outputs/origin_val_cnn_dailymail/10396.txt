he said : ' obviously we would certainly not be supportive of that kind of behaviour
' it is pretty appalling because it is someone who is clearly in need of support and assistance
that behaviour is something we would condemn
' clearly what that individual needed was time and space and a professional to help them out
' the individual would have been in need of care and support and appropriate intervention from medical professionals , so anything like that to encourage someone to jump should be unequivocally condemned
' a petition has been launched on campaigning website change.org calling for those who ' encouraged ' the victim to be arrested
in just five hours it gathered more than 1,000 signatures
friends of the man took to the website to voice their disgust
