' a recording of that radio call was played to jurors hearing the trial of accused bomber dzhokhar , 21 , on wednesday , as prosecutors turned to the charge that the defendant and his older brother murdered mit police officer collier on april 18 , 2013 , in an unsuccessful attempt to steal his gun
meanwhile , the mit police chief revealed his last words to the 27 - year - old officer in a wrenching fifth day of testimony in the long awaited boston bomber trial
chief john difava on wednesday recalled chatting with collier about an hour before his death
' i told him to be safe , and i left , ' john difava said , adding it was the last time he saw collier alive
the officer who found collier , sergeant clarence henniger , said he was responding to a 911 call about possible shots fired on mit 's cambridge , massachusetts , campus , just outside boston
collier had visible bullet wounds to his temple , neck and hand and was so covered in blood that clarence henniger struggled to pull him from his vehicle
' i could hear gargling coming from his mouth , ' clarence henniger testified at u.s. district court in boston , where the jury hearing dzhokhar 's trial will also decide whether to sentence him to death if he is convicted of killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade bombs at the april 15 , 2013 , race
jurors also saw surveillance footage of two figures approaching collier 's police cruiser on the mit campus , spending about a minute at the car , and leaving
the only visible suggestions of commotion in the video are the car 's brake lights , flashing on and off
collier 's gun belt and holster were covered in blood , evidence of dzhokhar 's clumsy but unsuccessful effort to steal his handgun , prosecutors have said
dzhokhar 's attorneys opened the trial by admitting he committed the crimes of which he is accused , but are seeking to spare him the death penalty by demonstrating he was following the lead of his older brother
prosecutors say both brothers were culpable in the officer 's murder and that they killed the 27 - year - old in order to steal his gun and arm dzhokhar in the act ? video taken from above the site of collier 's april 18 murder purports to show the tsarnaev brothers ( circled ) rounding a corner toward collier 's cruiser , at left ( grab via wcvb ) federal prosecutors contend dzhokhar , who emigrated with his family from chechnya a decade before the attack , was driven by an extremist view of islam and a desire to take revenge on the united states for military campaigns in muslims - dominated countries
prosecutor william weinreb said in his opening statement last week that it was unclear if dzhokhar or his brother fired the weapon that killed collier but argued that both brothers were equally culpable in the officer 's death
a graduate student at mit , nathan harman , who was bicycling on campus the night of the murder , testified on wednesday that he saw dzhokhar leaning into the driver 's side door of collier 's car , but did not see the older sibling
' i only saw the one person , ' said nathan harman , referring to dzhokhar
' he sort of snapped up , stood up and turned around , and he looked startled â¦ and then i just did n't think anything of it and rode off
