thompson has now joined 35 other women who have made claims of sexual assault against the the cosby show star
ms thompson , a 44 - year - old from florida , told people : ' it 's come to my understanding that there 's greater credibility for my testimony with a full name and an image
' i am so very grateful for the jane doe no.2 who came before me in the lawsuit 10 years ago ... my mother and i were very eager to give our support via testimony at that time â however , not to the general public
i was not quite strong enough then
' in 1988 , the then 17 - year - old aspiring model met cosby via her modelling agency in new york
he assured the teen and her parents that he would help her become a star
ms thompson told people that cosby made uncomfortable advances against her which ended in her feeling pressured to perform a sexual act on him
' i 'm like a robot , and that is what i became , and that is what i did for him , ' she said
she was reportedly given $ 700 as she left his home
she told people that she had decided to come forward now because she ' would rather go to bed at night knowing that i 've been honest '
she also felt that remaining as ' jane doe no.2 ' made her allegations less credible
ultimately , ms thompson hoped that cosby will come clean about the mounting allegations against him
daily mail online was awaiting a comment from cosby 's attorney , singer , on thursday
when ms thompson 's story was originally revealed in november 2014 , singer called it ' absurd ' to publish an ' unsubstantiated story from this anonymous person '
miss constand eventually settled out of court
last friday , cosby 's lawyers asked a federal judge to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women - tamara green , serignese and traitz - accusing the beleaguered comedian of decades - old sexual offenses
the accusers , all of whom have stepped forward in recent years , said cosby 's representatives publicly branded them as liars while trying to defend his innocence
but cosby 's lawyers said the actor was merely acting in self - defense as his character was under attack
' the law does not require that one stand idly by while he is publicly attacked , ' the lawyers argued in their 38 - page filing
' instead the law entitles an individual who is accused of serious wrongdoing to rebut the allegations without facing defamation claims
' joseph cammarata , a lawyer for the three accusers , said his clients disagree with that position
' we believe that the law provides that when you make a public statement about an individual , it must be truthful , ' he said
' we look forward to an opportunity to have the truth tried by a jury who can ultimately determine which of the parties was being truthful
' cosby 's legal team has said their client denies all of the allegations of sexual misconduct
the former star of the cosby show has n't been charged with any crime
more than a dozen women have stepped forward in recent years to level various assault accusations
tamara green , a 56 - year - old california lawyer , says cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in her los angeles - area apartment in the early 1970s
serignese says cosby drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in las vegas around 1976
and traitz alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a california beach in about 1970
tamara green , a california lawyer , ( left ) filed a defamation lawsuit against cosby in december 2014 claiming that he and his attorneys said she had lied about a sexual assault from 40 years ago ( she is pictured , right , at the time ) green was joined in the lawsuit by traitz ( left ) , who alleged that cosby tried to drug her and then sexually groped her in 1970 , and nurse serignese ( right ) , 57 , who said the comic raped her in 1976 when she was 19 years old cosby 's lawyers said his representatives were responding to the accusations in strongly - worded rebukes
one november 2014 statement references traitz 's ' extensive ' criminal record , which includes larceny , fraud and drug possession charges
' as the old saying goes , " consider the source , " ' wrote cosby attorney martin singer , who also attached copies of traitz 's florida criminal and prison records with the statement
another november 2014 statement cited by cosby 's accusers offers ' general comments ' on the allegations and does not specifically name any of the accusers , his lawyers say
' the new , never - before - heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated , fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30 , 40 , or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity , ' singer wrote at the time
' it is long past time for this media vilification of mr. cosby to stop
' the three women seek an unspecified amount of money for compensatory and punitive damages
many of the accusations against him exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution
but the scandal has taken its toll on the 77 - year - old actor and comedian as he has sought to revive his career with a national stand - up comedy tour
cosby has canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances as more accusers have come forward , and women 's groups have protested or threatened to rally at many of his public appearances
lawyers for the three accusers have until march 20 to file a reply to cosby 's motion to dismiss the suit
green originally filed the defamation lawsuit in december 2014 and serignese and traitz joined later
the suit is filed in us district court in springfield , in western massachusetts
cosby has a home nearby in shelburne falls .
