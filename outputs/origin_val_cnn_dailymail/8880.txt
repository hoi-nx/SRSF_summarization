brighton midfielder ince is being chased by a host of top - flight clubs ahead of a potential summer move
liverpool , newcastle , west ham and west brom have all had the 6ft 3in midfielder scouted in games in recent months
the 22 - year - old is a former youth player at chelsea , having joined the club aged seven and coming through their academy before failing to make the senior team
ince is wanted by a host of clubs including liverpool , newcastle , west ham and west brom however , since his move to brighton in 2013 his stock has soared and , under former boss oscar garcia , he was awarded the club âs young player of the year trophy in his first season
it was oscar garcia who converted him from a centre - back into a defensive midfielder
under sami hyypia he struggled for games but has since been brought back into the fold by current manager hughton
â there is no doubt he has ability , â hughton said last month
â he is a physical player as well
he can give us something on set plays
oscar garcia converted from a centre - back into a defensive midfielder under former brighton boss oscar garcia â when you are as big as ince you know he has the ability to get on the end of set plays
he also likes to break from midfield
â he has an athleticism about him and his past was playing a little bit deeper , so he is always going to be seen as that more defensive type of player
â in a team with good footballers it gives him an opportunity to improve his game on the ball
at this moment he has been playing and he 'll look to keep developing
â but brighton could struggle to keep hold of ince in the summer with his contract moving into its final year in june
if liverpool were to win the race to sign him , he would be the third member of the ince family to play at anfield after his second cousin tom ince and his father paul .
