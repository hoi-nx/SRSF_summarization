iran 's judicial system believes in the ancient concept of " an eye for an eye " -- literally
on tuesday , a man convicted of blinding another man in an acid attack was himself forcibly blinded in one eye , according to amnesty international and tasnim news , a semi-official news website
the punishment is believed to be iran 's first case of qasas , meaning retribution in kind , tasnim news said
" this punishment exposes the utter brutality of iran 's justice system and underlines the iran authorities ' shocking disregard for basic humanity , " said raha bahreini , amnesty international 's iran researcher
" meting out cruel and inhuman retribution punishments is not justice
blinding , like stoning , amputation and flogging , is a form of corporal punishment prohibited by international law
such punishments should not be carried out under any circumstances
" the acid attacker had been hired by the victim 's wife to throw acid in his face , tasnim news said
amnesty international said the attack occurred in 2009 in the city of qom
the defendant was blinded in his left eye at rajai shahr prison , but the blinding of his right eye was postponed , amnesty international said
the man was ordered to pay " blood money " and sentenced to 10 years in prison
amnesty international said punishment has been delayed for another iran man in a " retribution in kind " case
that man had been sentenced to be blinded and made deaf , amnesty international said
