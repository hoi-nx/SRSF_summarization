following this week 's results in the premier league it is looking increasingly likely that all three teams promoted last summer will be heading straight back down to the championship
leicester , burnley and qpr find occupy the bottom three places in the top flight with just 10 games to play and although there are other teams in sight , form is a big concern for all three
if the trio are all relegated it will be the first time that no promoted team has survived in 17 years , and only the second season none have stayed up in since the premier league 's inception in 1992

twice - in 2011 - 12 and 2001 - 02 - all three promoted teams have avoided the drop , while only five of the last 18 promoted sides have been relegated
in fact , promoted teams have a 58.2 per cent instant survival rate , with only 27 of the 68 teams to have been promoted to the top flight being sent straight back down
that recent record will significantly worsen though come may unless leicester , burnley and qpr can all find form fast
* four teams relegated * * two teams promoted
