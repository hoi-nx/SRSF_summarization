a powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 rocked the pacific nation of png on monday , generating a ' small tsunami ' and frightening locals near its epicenter
the quake struck at a depth of 65 kilometers ( 40 miles ) , about 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) southeast of the town of kokopo , near rabaul , at around 10am local time , the u.s. geological survey reported
it was followed by a 5.7 - magnitude aftershock and a 1.5 - foot - high tsunami , which was measured in rabaul 's harbor , near the quake 's epicenter , said mose , from the national disaster center
but despite the quake - which was likely felt by people up to a staggering 2,000 kilometers ( 1,240 miles ) away - and the subsequent tsunami , no damage nor injuries have been reported , officials said
