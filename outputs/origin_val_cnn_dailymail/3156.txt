beef has been wiped off restaurant menus across mumbai after its state government said it will now enforce laws making possession of the meat and the slaughter of cows illegal
but steak and kidney pie will continue to be served up at one of india 's oldest british raj - era clubs in defiance of the ban
the law was passed by the state of maharashtra around 20 years ago , but not implemented until now by a new hindus nationalist administration
still on the menu : the british raj - era royal bombay yacht club ( above ) in mumbai has vowed to continue serving steak and kidney pies despite a state - wide ban on the possession of beef or the slaughter of cows violators could face a fine and up to five years in prison
residents expressed outrage on twitter using the hashtag # banbeef - which topped the social network 's trends , appearing more than 22,000 times in less than 24 hours
but panicked steak lovers will have a safe haven at the royal bombay yacht club , mumbai , which will continue to serve its steak and kidney pies to customers
the 170 - year - old club has said it will keep steak on the menu by sticking to its original recipes using ' buff ' - buffalo meat - rather than beef for the pies
royal bombay yacht club president ardhendu bose felt pessimistic about the ban until he realised that the leaner buffalo meat used in their recipes would leave the club 's menu intact , he told the daily telegraph
on wednesday night , the club served both steak and kidney and steak and onion pies , with parsley potatoes and sautÃ©ed cauliflower to reassured customers
' i spoke to my vice president and said " we should do something , we do n't want to get into trouble "
' but he said buffalo is allowed , so we 'll carry on as usual ' , he said
loophole : the 170 - year - old club has said it will keep steak on the menu by sticking to its original recipes using ' buff ' - buffalo meat - rather than beef for the pies the 112 - year - old taj mahal palace hotel removed beef from the menus on wednesday , according to chief sommelier saxena - including its ' really sought - after ' chateaubriand steak
mr saxena said : ' beef has been on the hotel 's menu for many years
' our signature restaurants were affected by the ban so we will have to look again at the dynamics of their menus
' our chateaubriand , the tornado - a cut of meat - the tenderloin , the veal , all of that has been removed
it will definitely affect our business
' he added : ' we still need to understand the thought process behind the ban
' there are many segments of society being affected by this - from the folks who grow the cattle , to us who would be selling it
' hindus , who make up 80 per cent of india 's 1.2billion population , consider cows sacred
but large numbers of the population - particularly the extremes of the international elite and the poor - eat beef .
