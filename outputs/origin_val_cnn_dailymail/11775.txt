president obama called on congress to raise the federal minimum wage , which has been at $ 7.25 since july 2009 , to $ 10.10 in his state of the union address last year
many states - such as washington , massachusetts and florida - have already put increases in place with more promised in the next two years
but the report concluded : ' these findings confirm that income inequality remains a salient issue in many big cities today
' while the minimum wage is a potentially important means for helping low - earner households living in high - cost places , local policy - makers should not ignore other tools they have at hand - from education to economic development to housing and zoning policies - that are essential for improving social mobility and sustaining income diversity in big cities today
