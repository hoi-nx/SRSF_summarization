remote - controlled planes crash frequently enough that there is a webpage about it
the no. 1 cause of remote control plane crashes is pilot error , according to r / c airplane world
according to the site : ' either the pilot is flying beyond his or her abilities , or flying a plane that 's too advanced or simply unsuitable for his / her level of experience
' or perhaps they make a genuine mistake because of , say , disorientation - even experienced rc pilots make the wrong stick movements sometimes ! ' equipment failure is another reason
in fact pilot error is commonly disguised as equipment failure ! ' flying surface or control surface failure can also be the guilty culprit in bringing down our planes , especially if the builder did a less than satisfactory job on the hinges ! ' prevention is better than cure , but sadly it takes a crash to figure out what went wrong and hopefully prevent it happening again in the future
