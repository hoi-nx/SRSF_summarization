durst 's wife mysteriously disappeared decades ago
it 's an unsolved case that has n't stopped haunting him
years after she went missing , prosecutors argued durst was hiding out from investigators digging into that case when he killed a neighbor , dismembered the body and skipped town
jurors acquitted him in a high - profile 2003 murder trial after his lawyers said he 'd acted in self - defense
now the 71 - year - old millionaire real estate heir from one of new yorker 's wealthiest families is behind bars , accused of murder again in another case that some say is tied to his wife 's disappearance
fbi agents arrested durst saturday night in new orleans
investigators say they believe he was behind the 2000 slaying of susan berman , a crime writer and durst 's longtime friend , who was shot dead in her beverly hills home
" as a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year , investigators have identified durst as the person responsible for ms. susan berman 's death , " lapd said in a statement sunday
police , who described him as a " cold case murder suspect , " did n't specify what new evidence pointed them toward durst
the arrest comes amid heightened interest in the eccentric heir , who 's now the focus of the hbo documentary series " the jinx , " which explores whether he had any connection to his wife 's disappearance and investigators ' suspicions that susan berman was killed because she knew what happened to her
durst has long maintained he did n't kill susan berman or have anything to do with his wife 's disappearance
investigators found him saturday at the jw marriott hotel in new orleans , where he was staying under a false name and was carrying a fake driver 's license , according to a law enforcement official who 's been briefed on the case
he 'd paid in cash , and authorities believe he was preparing to leave the country and flee to cuba , the official said
he was jailed without bond and was awaiting an extradition hearing monday morning
" we will waive extradition and get to la as soon as possible to answer the charges , " chip lewis , durst 's lawyer , told cnn on sunday
durst 's brother said in a written statement that he was thankful for the arrest
" we are relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of durst , " douglas durst said
" we hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done
" accusations about what durst has done depend on who you ask
his one - time wife , kathie , went missing in 1982
no one has been charged in her disappearance
and according to the new york times , she 's been declared legally dead
durst has said the last time he saw her was when he dropped her off at a train station in westchester , new yorker , so she could head back to medical school in the city
he secretly divorced her in 1990 , court tv reported
her family has said durst is to blame for her disappearance and hailed his arrest over the weekend as a sign they could be close to getting answers
" the dominoes of justice are now starting to fall , " jim mccormack , her brother , said on sunday
" through our faith , hope and prayers the last domino will bring closure and justice for kathie
" this is n't durst 's first run - in with the law
in 2003 , he admitted he 'd killed and dismembered black , his neighbor in galveston , texas , but argued he 'd shot black in self - defense during a struggle
prosecutors argued he 'd planned black 's killing in order to steal his identity and escape the attention of new yorker investigators looking into his wife 's disappearance
durst testified that he hid out in galveston and posed as a mute woman because he was afraid as he faced increasing scrutiny in the case , court tv reported at the time
" it seemed to me the big problem was durst , " he said , referring to himself in the third - person
" i wanted to not be durst
" durst is an heir to a fortune thanks to his family 's new yorker real estate investments
the durst organization was founded by his grandfather and is now run by his brother and cousin
after a civil lawsuit in 2006 , durst cut ties with his family and 10 manhattan skyscrapers in return for a $ 65 million settlement , the new york times reported
in 2000 , his friend and longtime confidant , susan berman , was killed in her california home
the killing , cnn 's sister network hln reported in 2012 , occurred just after police reopened the investigation into kathleen durst 's disappearance
" she was a confidante of durst
they knew each other and were very , very close , " cnn 's jean casarez said
" and it was just days before investigators were to fly out to california to talk with her about what she may have known about the disappearance of kathleen durst that she was shot execution - style in her living room
" for years , speculation has swirled about who could be responsible for susan berman 's death
she 'd written books about her family 's mafia ties and explored the history of las vegas , and some suspected she might have drawn the ire of a killer through her work
investigators in the past homed in on one key piece of evidence : a postcard sent to authorities that tipped them off that susan berman 's body was inside her home
a police handwriting analysis said the writing on that card looked like durst 's , author corwin told cnn in 2004
but corwin , who shadowed investigators working on the case as part of his book " homicide special : a year with the lapd 's elite detective unit , " said at the time that police did n't have enough evidence to charge durst in the killing
" they do n't have enough to arrest him , " corwin said in 2004
what 's changed since then ? in " the jinx , " susan berman 's stepson reveals a letter from durst he found among her possessions
that could be a key development , said daly , a special correspondent for the daily beast
" you look at the letter , and the handwriting is astonishingly similar , " daly said
the los angeles county district attorney reopened the susan berman homicide investigation last week
investigators have n't said whether the documentary series played a role in this weekend 's arrest
hbo , which is owned by cnn 's parent company time warner , praised the series ' director and producer in a statement sunday
" years in the making , their thorough research and dogged reporting reignited interest in durst 's story with the public and law enforcement , " hbo said
cnn 's jack hannah , kyung lah , carma hassan , shelby lin erdman and linh tran contributed to this report .
