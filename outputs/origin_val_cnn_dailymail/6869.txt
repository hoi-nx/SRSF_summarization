it seemed like the ultimate feel - good story , a health fanatic who managed to ward off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis simply through eating well and using a natural and holistic approach to life
australian blogger gibson shot to stardom on social media and gave hope to cancer sufferers worldwide after she revealed that she had prolonged her life despite shunning conventional medical treatment and relying on her own ' whole life ' concept
now , however , friends close to the mum - of - one have said that she may have fled overseas to avoid confronting claims that her remarkable cancer survival story is not all it seems
doubts over ms gibson 's cancer survival story surfaced after it was revealed she failed to donate up to Â£ 151,000 in profits from the health and lifestyle app to charity
the blogger has also admitted that she may have been ' misdiagnosed '
friends say information surrounding ms gibson 's original diagnosis has mysteriously begun to be ' erased ' in recent days but previously her story has been well documented
she has stated that her health problems began when she was 20 , when she experienced problems with her sight , memory and walking
a stroke followed and ms gibson was told that she had ' malignant brain cancer ' with just four months to live
two months into a gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy routine , ms gibson said one specific incident prompted a treatment ' epiphany '
after passing out in the grounds of a melbourne hospital , she claims she awoke determined that she would attack the disease without the help of conventional medicine
against the advice of doctors , ms gibson said she turned to alternative treatments including herbalism , craniosacral therapy and meditation
in addition to her vegetarian diet , she also gave up eating dairy , gluten , refined sugars , gmo foods and preservatives
she says that doctors advised her that she may never have children but her son , oliver , known as ollie , was born in 2010
a miscarriage at five months during her second pregnancy in 2012 prompted her to share her story online
friends say ms gibson , who enjoys international travel and designer clothes , may now have fled to the the states amid claims she has n't been entirely honest using the twitter handle @ healing_belle , she quickly amassed followers from across the globe and launched her glossy cookbook and healthy eating app in 2014
at the time , she had , she said , been ' stable for two years now with no growth of the cancer '
the whole pantry app , which costs Â£ 2.39 , has been downloaded over 300,000 times and proved so popular that she was flown out to silicon valley last year where she was told her app was to be included on the new apple
in july 2014 , the blogger then broke the news via instagram , on which she has 200,000 followers , that the cancer had returned , saying : ' with frustration and ache in my heart / / my beautiful , gamechanging community , it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that i 've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer
' around 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up her initial post , revealing she was undergoing ' germany integrative oncology protocol '
the whole pantry brand , which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms , is run by mother - of - one ms gibson , who charges Â£ 2.29 for the app ms gibson 's success might have continued unabated were it not for doubts raised about significant amounts of money raised through sales of the app that were destined for charity
the health guru has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business ' profits were being donated , last year claiming that Â£ 151,000 had been raised
it was revealed on monday , however , that ms gibson had failed to donate that sum
in a post to their facebook page , the whole pantry clarified they were a ' for - profit ' company and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry
' we have , like all start ups , struggled with managing all facets of a new business , biting off more than we could chew , juggling internal and external priorities with little staff
' we have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external business manager and accounts team , an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses
' they have been working over our finances for the last five months , and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight
we were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward , ' the post read in part
only Â£ 3,500 has actually reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated
there were also revelations that neither the business nor ms gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises , a situation that could lead to huge fines and potential jail time
ms gibson also this week admitted that she may have been ' wrong ' about the extent of her terminal cancer
' it 's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong ... ( i felt ) confused , bordering on humiliated ' , ms gibson told the australian
she revealed a medical team from germany had examined her using ' magnetic ' therapy and believes this investigation led to her misdiagnosis , although she declined to name the medical team
however , since then friends have come forward saying they had long held suspicions about holes in ms gibson 's story for a long time , and revealed that whenever they tried to raise it with her they were shut down
' i was told last night that she booked a business class flight to the the states and that âs why she has n't been responding
she âs been on a plane for the last 20 hours , ' a friend , who did not wish to be named , told the daily mail australia
silicon valley hit : ms gibson has also released a cookbook version of the creations that appear in the app following the success her online ventures missing money : there have been revelations that the whole pantry business nor ms gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises the same friend , a fellow social media personality with a large online following , said she first met ms gibson at a gala in early 2014 and the pair clicked
but they had held suspicions in recent months , like many in the same friendship group , that the young entrepreneur may have been dishonest with them
' she claims that she was having treatment ( chemotherapy ) when she was pregnant with ollie but no doctor would treat someone like that when they were pregnant , ' the friend said
as soon as articles began to surface this week casting doubt on ms gibson 's story , it has been suggested that thousands of photos and social media posts which directly referenced her cancer have been deleted
friends have now said they had trouble reconciling her stories , and that ms gibson was cagey when they offered help or asked about her medical conditions
' it does n't make sense , no doctor would let you travel the world and she just goes away at the drop of a hat ' , the same friend revealed
' all she wears is designer clothes and travels the world which does n't make sense for someone who should be setting up life for their child before they die
' ' there âs people that have invested their money and time â¦ a lot of people i know have held fundraisers and supported her
' high profile on cancer : ms gibson has appeared across a number of networks ( pictured on sunrise in australian ) speaking about her approach to healing success : last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new apple after it was downloaded 300,000 times failure : apparently only Â£ 3,500 of a projected Â£ 151,000 has reached charities so far , after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated another woman who almost entered into business with ms gibson said she was particularly devastated when ms gibson announced she was riddled with cancer mid-last year on social media , before telling her closest friends
' that is exactly when we had our main falling out , she said i was n't being supportive and i said she had n't told me personally , ' the entrepreneur told daily mail australia
this friend , who was very close to ms gibson , said the young mum was standoffish when she offered to visit medical appointments with her for support
' she âd always just change the topic and would n't let you broach the topic
' the same friend claims ms gibson was dishonest about her age , and her illnesses , and even cast doubt on whether she ever had cancer at all
she also confirmed that it was her understanding ms gibson had ' fled ' to the states
these revelations come amid reports by the herald sun that police visited ms gibson 's home in elwood , melbourne overnight
the woman 's partner apparently let officers into the property , and that ms gibson was not there at the time
penguin , the publisher of ms gibson 's book which was launched off the back of her app 's success said they did not see it necessary to seek confirmation on the entrepreneur 's medical history or age during their dealings with her
' penguin did not seek or receive documentary evidence of gibson 's medical condition or birth date prior to publication , ' a spokesperson told daily mail australia
' we did not feel this was necessary as the whole pantry is a collection of food recipes , which penguin has published in good faith
' we are concerned about the questions raised in recent days - we 'll discuss them with gibson as ultimately only she can answer the questions , ' the spokesperson added .
