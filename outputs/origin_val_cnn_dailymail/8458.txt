australia scientists have made a major breakthrough in treating alzheimer 's with a new drug - free method that can restore memory loss
researchers at the university of queensland 's brain institute hope to be able to trial their new ' cheap and mobile ' ultrasound device within two years on humans
the treatment attacks the neurotoxic amyloid plaques that cause memory loss and cognitive failure with ultrasound waves
research director professor gã¶tz hopes the new method will revolutionise alzheimer 's treatment by restoring memory for sufferers

' we 're extremely excited by this innovation of treating alzheimer 's without using drug therapeutics , ' professor gã¶tz said , according to the australia
' the word ' breakthrough ' is often misused , but in this case i think this really does fundamentally change our understanding of how to treat this disease , and i foresee a great future for this approach
' the mobile device could be used by patients in their own homes several times a year , eliminating the need for expensive drug treatment that costs up to $ 250,000 , prof gã¶tz said
' with an ageing population placing an increasing burden on the health system , an important factor is cost , and other potential drug treatments using antibodies will be expensive , ' he said

' in contrast , this method uses relatively inexpensive ultrasound and microbubble technology which is non-invasive and appears highly effective
' almost two thirds of all dementia patients in australia suffer from alzheimer 's , which accounts for almost 250,000 people
the total number of dementia cases in australia is expected to rise to 900,000 by 2050
findings of the research , ' scanning ultrasound efficiently removes amyloid - Î² and restores memory in an alzheimer 's model ' , are published in the journal .
