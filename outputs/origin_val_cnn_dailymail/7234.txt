supplement haircare with diet i âd also recommend following a balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables that provide the body with the natural and necessary vitamins and minerals that are the basis for healthy skin and hair
you need to balance the topical products you are using with a healthy lifestyle including the right foods , 6 - 8 glasses of water a day and enough sleep to help from the inside out as well
use natural oils avoid products that are heavy in mineral oil as this can block the pores
there are natural oils that do the same job and yield great results
you can massage natural oils into the hairline where breakage is happening to stimulate the blood circulation in these areas and promote regrowth
let hair breathe while it âs understandable why women may want to wear a wig to cover up hair loss or breakage , i âd highly recommend taking it off when indoors and overnight to allow the scalp to breathe
colouring afro hair colouring any hair type can be damaging to condition , however ammonia - free formulas like lâorã©al professionnel inoa are much gentler on the hair
these formulas also tend to amplify shine , which gives the appearance of healthier hair
gentle combing when your hair is weaker or suffering from breakage , make sure you choose combs that have wide teeth and no seams , which can snag the hair
kent handmade combs , which are made from a single sheet of cellulose acetate , a non-petroleum based plastic derived from plants that has been found to create less static in the hair
they are then hand polished and buffed to create soft , rounded teeth that will not damaged the hair or scalp
due to the way the teeth are cut rather than moulded , they are much less likely to snag causing split ends , but instead stimulate the natural oils inside the hair cuticle encouraging each strand to lie flat , creating healthy , strong and shiny hair
regular trims ensure you are coupling your deep condition treatments with regular trims every 6 - 8 weeks to encourage healthy hair
while hair loss often happens around the hairline , a lot of damage occurs through the mid-lengths and ends , so ensuring they are in the best condition will give the illusion of an all - over healthier , fuller head of hair .
