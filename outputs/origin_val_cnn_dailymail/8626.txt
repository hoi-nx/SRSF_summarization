although the child is surrounded by an array of toys , he remains uninterested and motionless , until his mother begins noisily unwrapping the tape
at the first loud rip , lucas jumps and his face is a picture of shock as he stares at his mother , mouth wide open , with a horrified expression on his face
he looks alarmed for a while and then relaxes momentarily , gazing back at the television
upon hearing the loud rip , he looks visibly panicked and looks at his mother with a worried expression what on earth is that ? catching lucas ' hilariously panicked reactions , his mother laughs and apologies to him as his mother loudly pulls off another strip of sellotape , the baby boy jolts again , rattling his toys from his shock , with a look of sheer panic on his face
his mother is unable to hide her amusement as she chuckles and apolgises , saying : ' i 'm sorry sweetheart !
