londonapple ceo cook has released the much - anticipated apple watch -- his company 's first new product since the ipad
cook said the new watch , in addition to telling the time , was a " comprehensive health and fitness companion
" but we 're unlikely to hear much about how people will actually use this new product for some time
our research has found that smartwatches certainly do have some benefits for users
but they also have a hidden , darker side which the companies selling them are unlikely to talk about
as part of a research project with alberto rizzoli , we have tried to understand what drives people to invest in smartwatches
one participant , a judge , hoped he could keep track of the deluge of emails during long hours in the courtroom when he had to pay attention -- and be seen to pay attention
the dilemma is familiar to many of us
we spend our days engaged in social interaction
huge proportions of our time are taken up with meetings or impromptu encounters with colleagues
however when we are in these meetings , our smartphone is buzzing away reminding us that our inbox is filling up
we may want to check these incoming messages , but know it would be rude to glance at our phone
when one of the first smartwatches came to market , the judge thought he had found the solution to this problem
we found that heavy smartwatch users valued how the devices helped them track information as it arrived while still appearing socially attentive
it also saved users the hassle of having to dig through their pockets or handbags to find a buzzing phone
surprisingly only about half the people we spoke with actually used all the health tracking technology built in to the watches
they were more interested in keeping abreast of their inbox than their calorie count
we also noticed a worrying side to these new devices as heavy users of the watches incorporate them into their daily routines -- we call it the " phantom device effect
" they would compulsive check their watch not just for the time , but for a wide range of information
in some cases their new gizmo would become such an instinctive part of their life that even when not wearing one they would check their bare wrist
some would feel a phantom buzz , notifying them of an imaginary incoming email
the phantom device effect leads us to ask about just how ingrained in our daily habits these devices might become
recent research has suggested that average smartphone users check their phone 150 times a day , starting just minutes after waking up
we also know this has the effect of extending work into all areas of our lives -- monitoring work emails late into the night or during social or family events
we used to worry that the average american watched television for six hours a day
now we accept as a matter of course the fact that we tied to our devices for most of the time we 're awake
indeed many of us go to bed with our smart devices quietly monitoring our rhythms as we sleep
this raises the question of what impact it will have on our lives
in the work carl cederstrã¶m and i have done on the hidden dangers of wearables , a big big concern is privacy
the apple watch , like most wearables , is essentially a tracking device , recording heart rate , sleep patterns , movement , whereabouts , and much more depending on the apps installed
all this is packaged and transmitted to datacentres for analysis
the result ? a database of personal information of which the stasi could only have dreamed
as well as sucking up personal information , wearables could fuel an unhealthy obsession with personal wellness
by pumping health and wellbeing information at us non-stop , we start to become a little too focused on our bio-rhythms
data which would have been generated only in the most unusual situations now becomes commonplace , making people not just health conscious , but also self - obsessed
instead of checking in with social networks , we spend more time checking in with our own bodily rhythms
as a result other people start to become more interested in what is going on inside themselves rather than what is happening in the world
as we pay more attention to our feed of personal biodata we 're likely to become more anxious about things that we may never have given a second thought to in the past
not walking your allotted steps in a day or finding you had a poor sleeping pattern at night can become a source of significant personal guilt or worry
as a result , we pour more attention into monitoring and controlling ourselves , giving us less time to do the things which actually make us happy
if apple 's projections are indeed correct and tens of millions of people purchase smartwatches , it 's likely to create a step change in our lives
we already see people routinely posting on social media information they would have only shared with their doctor a few years ago
widespread use of smartwatches could mean that instead of relieving our boredom by answering emails , people will spend their time sifting through their biodata stream , planning ways to maximize their personal wellness ratings
rather than talking about what was on television last night , people will start comparing charts of their sleeping patterns
when this happens we will know that the internet of me has arrived
