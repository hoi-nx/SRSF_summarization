mh370 man : the sister of captain mh370 has defended her brother in a statement the sister of the mh370 pilot has urged everyone to stop blaming her brother for the aircraft âs disappearance ahead of the anniversary of the tragedy this week
sakinah shah has released a statement in defence of her brother , captain mh370 , who headed the crew on the missing jet , where she claims there is no proof of ' wrongdoing '
her statement comes as malaysia âs transport minister has admitted that if the missing malaysia airlines plane is not found by may search efforts will go â back to the drawing board â
ms sakinab 's statement on behalf of the family was released through the star in malaysia , just days ahead of the one - year anniversary of the disappearance of mh370 on sunday
â as things stand today , with no tangible evidence to show no - one , be you politician , scientist , aviation expert , plane crash investigator , pilot , retired pilot , media or whoever else , none of you have the right to blame captain mh370 for any wrongdoing
â ms sakinab recalled how on march 8 2014 her life and the lives of all the families and friends of passengers an crew of the aircraft changed for ever
she recalled how at the time of the â tragic occurrence of mh370 â her brother , a father - of - three , was 53 years old and married to his childhood sweetheart faizah khanum
ms sakinab described her brother as a ' doting father , generous , kind and cool with a warm sense of humour
he had a passion for life , for family and above all for flying
â i was n't kidding when i said that if he could he would have attached wings to himself
he had as much as a man could possibly want in his life ; a professional career , family , friends , health and a more than comfortable life
â he was very open - minded , coming from a family with a pretty wide range of nationalities through intermarriages
he got on extremely well with family members
the younger ones simply adored him ... their ari
â he was very savvy at diy
he could fix anything ; garden fixtures , floor tiles , old doors , etc. my home and the homes of my sisters and brothers are not short of the things that remind us of him every day ; framed pictures , leaking windows now repaired , a fish pond levelled up and nicely tiled , a new tv installed ... i could go on and on
' back to the drawing board ' : malaysia âs transport minister seri liow has said that the search area would be extended if the missing mh370 jet is not found by may missing : this sunday marks the one - year anniversary of the disappearance of flight mh370 still lost : the boeing 777 plane was carrying 227 passengers and a crew of 12 when it suddenly disappeared off the radar on march 8 , 2014 â the rollercoaster ride since march 2014 has never really stopped , except perhaps momentarily
i want the world to know here is a loving man who will stop at nothing to render help when it is needed
â his presence during every family function never failed to light up the occasions
he was always sought after by sisters , brothers , nieces and nephews alike â¦ a man of integrity
he was a generous brother and uncle who often came bearing gifts from his overseas trips
' ari was a simple village boy of humble beginnings but had high ambitions of becoming a commercial pilot
' with the current chatter about mh370 involving big name media organisations like national geographic , i feel compelled to divulge some information about captain mh370 's scholastic â prowess â and academic achievements
â i am doing this with some regret knowing that he would not be too happy at this disclosure
throughout his secondary schooling he was by no means a student genius
in fact he was just an average student
such being the situation , he certainly did n't have the right foundation to be able to figure out a scheme to hijack his own plane and then to disappear into thin air without leaving a trace
â without a doubt he had a strong sense for loyalty towards malaysia airlines ( malaysia airlines )
his aviation training in the philippines was sponsored by malaysia airlines
it was there he served as a pilot and later as a training captain
he had an unblemished flying record of eighteen thousand plus hours , i am proud to say
it is sheer dedication to this profession that prompted him to set up his own home flight simulator just to equip himself in order to give a better teaching experience to his students , all at his own expense
â as a training captain he often expressed joy and satisfaction with the camaraderie he shared with all his students
following march 8th 2014 , we received feedback from many of these students , both locally and internationally , all in praise of his accommodating ways and generosity at sharing his knowledge
â i know for certain mh370 opted to remain loyal to malaysia airlines despite a few challenging offers from other airlines that came his way
it was his love for family that made him want to remain with malaysia airlines until his retirement
â when the devastating news of mh370 was broadcast , like everybody else , we were also in a state of shock and disbelief
â the last time we met with mh370 was some two weeks prior to march 8th when we were together for dinner
he was no different from his normal , usual self
he was loud , jovial , and full of chuckles with his share of jokes
â we continue to pray and hope that this bizarre mystery will unravel soon
we stand firm in the belief that no matter how long the night , dawn will still break
' ms sakinab 's statement was released as malaysia âs transport minister seri liow suggested that the search area would be extended if mh370 is not found by may
this means that once again , the search will be carried out from the southern indian ocean to the himalayan mountains , as far west as the maldives and as far east - and beyond - as the south china sea
mr liow âs admission is unlikely to provide any comfort to the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew who were on the boeing 777 when it vanished on march 8 last year about an hour into a six - hour flight from kuala lumpur to beijing
search efforts : australian âs prime minister tony abbott said this week that the search for mh370 off the coast of australian might have to be scaled back after the year - long - search he told the new straits times that any decision to re-strategise the search - or look again at the methods employed - would only be done if the current scouring of the ocean floor in the southern indian ocean did not find the aircraft âs wreckage
â it is important to continue the search and hopefully we can complete it by then , â he said in a reference to may
â if the plane is not found we will have to evaluate the figures and rely on the experts to guide us on what to do next
â we are confident that the plane is situated in the identified search area in the south indian ocean and we are looking forward to finding it , â said mr liow , speaking in kuala lumpur
he was responding to a comment by australian âs prime minister , tony abbott , who said this week that the search and recovery effort might have to be scaled back after the year - long - search
â there is no discussion on the issue to stop the search , â said mr liow
â this is because as far as we are concerned , it is a tripartite decision ( between australian , malaysia and china ) that has made a commitment to complete the search in the 60,000 square kilometers
therefore it has to continue
â australian search director , kennedy , told the australian broadcasting corporation today that â we âre scanning continuously , 24 hours a day , seven days a week
' they âre out there for six weeks at a time
and as we search the ground , we analyse the data and we âre just looking everywhere for the plane
eventually , we âll find it
â mr kennedy admitted that the search team had a â massive responsibility â to give closure to the families and everybody else who flies on an aircraft
theories of where the malaysia airlines aircraft ended up have covered numerous seas and countries , the reasons for the plane âs disappearance ranging from the credible to the crazy
despite the massive search currently taking place in the southern indian ocean and requests for coastal villagers to keep their eyes open for debris that might have washed up on beaches , not a single piece of evidence from the aircraft has been found .
