williams wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written a brutally honest letter written by roald dahl to a teenager who asked him for advice on his a-level project has surfaced
budding writer williams wrote to the author in 1980 asking him to look at a short story he had written
the 17 - year - old did not expect a reply
but mr williams , who grew up near carlisle , was delighted when he received a typed note signed by the man himself
however , in true roald dahl style , there was a sting in the tail
however the letter was not what the eager teenager had expected with roald dahl heavily criticising his use of ' beastly adjectives '
the correspondence read : ' jay , you are asking too much of me
you must realise i get an awful lot of these letters and you ca n't expect me to write your thesis for you
' it should be fairly obvious to you what the role of a short story is in modern literature
it 's a big one
' study particularly the american short story writers like o'henry and runyon and hawthorne and poe , and lots and lots of english ones
' if you want any dope on me there have been an awful lot of profiles in english magazines over the past year starting with the february 1979 edition of vogue
' i have read your story
i do n't think it 's bad , but you must stop using too many adjectives
roald dahl responded saying the teenager was ' asking too much , ' but that said that he had read his story ' study hemingway , particularly his early work and learn how to write short sentences and how to eschew all those beastly adjectives
' surely it is better to say ' she was a tall girl with a bosom ' than ' she was a tall girl with a shapely , prominent bosom ' , or some such rubbish
the first one says it all
' jay , who now lives in bristol , recently found the letter while going through old boxes and posted a picture on twitter
the image was posted alongside the caption : ' in 1980 , as a spotty teenager , i wrote to roald dahl asking for advice on writing
here is his priceless response
' amazingly it has now been re-tweeted more than 1,700 times and has been favourited by almost 2,400 people
jay , who set up pr company 72point , said : ' as a callow youth , i was expecting him to tell me how marvellous the story was , and offer to introduce me to his publisher
mr williams in his teens , left , and the celebrated author roald dahl , right , who replied to his letter ' instead he gave me this fairly forthright criticism
' the story was for an a-level english literature project , and was probably really self - indulgent , overflowing with flowery adjectives , which roald dahl quite rightly bristled at
' after considering his advice , i have to admit it was probably fair and i 've taken heed of it ever since
' i was a big fan of roald dahl 's short stories aimed at adults , like kiss kiss
i loved their dark elements , the twist in the tale
' roald dahl 's advice has informed whatever writing style i have had since , especially in news reporting
