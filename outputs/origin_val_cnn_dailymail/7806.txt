a china furniture shopping mall which invited the public to release butterflies back to nature has seen the event ended up in a complete opposite direction â hundreds of colourful creatures were stamped to death by onlookers who hoped to capture them
the mall held the ceremony at a park in chengdu , regional capital of sichuan province in central china
more than 10 boxes of butterflies were flown to chengdu on the same day from yunnan in southern china
organisers said they have rescued the injured butterflies and will take good care of them
tragedy : hundreds of butterflies were stamped to death during an event to release them back into the wild set free : 10 families were selected from thousands of in the crowd to release the butterflies from shoe boxes keen participants : the butterflies were transported in the cardboard boxes from yunnan on the same day
as soon as they were let into the air , crowd started chasing and trying to capture them the ceremony , named ' freeing of butterflies ' , attracted thousands of chengdu citizens who eagerly awaited the release of the insects
ten families were selected from thousands in the crowd to release the butterflies into the air
however , after the butterflies were released , many of them settled on the large stage
this resulted in excited onlookers and their children chasing and trying to capture the butterflies with many people treading on them without realising
eventually there were shouted warnings that the butterflies were being trampled underfoot , but it came too late for hundreds of squashed creatures
picture time : some participants were so busy taking photos that they did n't realise many butterflies had been stamped to death on the ground organisers said some butterflies failed to take off properly because they had just arrived from tropical yunnan where the temperature was higher than chengdu and so they were slightly sleepy
event staff picked up as many of the grounded insects as they could and put them back into their boxes to be returned to a sanctuary
a similar incident happened last autumn in xinxiang in central china
thousands of butterflies were crushed or injured when they were released back to the wild during a commercial event
aftermath : although some butterflies were set free successfully , many were killed in this event
organisers said they have rescued as many as possible and would looked after them well
