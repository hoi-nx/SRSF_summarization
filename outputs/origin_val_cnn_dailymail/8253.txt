the dutch ' willem-alexander and maxima were among the crowds that flocked outside to watch the partial solar eclipse this morning
resplendent in a crimson ensemble , 43 - year - old maxima donned protective glasses and watched from a wharf in hamburg alongside her husband
perhaps not finding the eclipse quite as dramatic as she had hoped , the argentina - born royal soon began laughing and whipped off her glasses
in britain , millions turned out to watch the first solar eclipse of this century , which plunged parts of the britain in to brief darkness
britain 's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the moon started to move between us and the sun , with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country
today 's eclipse produced a 100 - mile - wide ' totality ' shadow path that crossed the north atlantic , resulting in a partial eclipse across the northern hemisphere , including the whole of europe , greenland , newfoundland , northern africa and western asia
is that it ? a less enamoured maxima took off her glasses early and turned away on tour : the dutch royals are touring hamburg today as part of a brief 48 - hour tour of northern germany meeting : they are attending a meeting aimed at boosting dutch business and trade links gas : the royal couple are also being shown a new barge that is fitted out to carry liquefied natural gas maxima and willem-alexander arrived germany yesterday , after completing a short three - day tour of denmark
having waved goodbye to their denmark hosts at copenhagen 's kastrup airport , they flew on to lã¼beck where they were greeted by excited well - wishers clutching hand - painted portraits
after a lunchtime reception , they then continued on to the thã¼nen institute for organic farming in trenthorst , where maxima came dangerously close to getting her shoe stuck in some silage
along with watching the eclipse , today 's schedule includes a meeting at hamburg 's fischauktionshalle to discuss business opportunities for dutch firms in germany
the royals will also be shown a newly - built barge , named the hummel , which is designed to carry liquefied natural gas
all natural : yesterday , maxima came close to treading in some silage ( fermented hay ) during a farm visit looking around : the dutch royals were touring the thã¼nen institute for organic farming in trenthorst warm welcome : the couple arrived in lã¼beck to be met by well - wishers proffering portraits of them maxima and willem-alexander will also tour the joop van den ende academy , which focuses on innovation in theatre technology - also a speciality of the dutch performing arts sector
so keen are the dutch royals on giving local performers a boost , they flew four dancers from amsterdam to copenhagen for a performance on wednesday night
the men , all from the het international choreographic arts centre , got their big moment during a banquet hosted by maxima and willem-alexander for the denmark royals
designed to give dutch culture a platform , the minimally - clad performers treated denmark 's queen margrethe and her family to an unusual modern dance performance
watching from the front row was maxima herself , elegant in a patriotic russet dress beside the scandinavian country 's crown prince frederik
interesting : the couple spent their last night in denmark treating their hosts to a dutch dance performance keep smiling : maxima appeared to enjoy the modern dance performance and beamed throughout looking good : the 43 - year - old dutch queen looked fabulous in a patriotic russet gown round of applause : all the royals politely applauded at the end of the performance
