saints to make it seventh heaven the race for the top four has always been keenly contested , but it âs normally between the same six sides : chelsea , city , arsenal , united , liverpool and spurs
now southampton are forcing people to reconsider and make it seven
that was an excellent point at chelsea and , aside from poor marking for diego costa âs goal , the saints were excellent at the back
they are so well organised , have an excellent midfield shield in victor wanyama and morgan schneiderlin and fraser forster is a top goalkeeper
he was immense against chelsea and has been a big plus since arriving from celtic
the result keeps ronald koeman âs side in the hunt and , whatever happens , it âs been a good season for southampton
southampton team - mates congratulate goalscorer tadic after levelling the score at 1 - 1 in the first half 21 - southampton have conceded the fewest pl goals this season and kept the joint-most clean sheets ( 13 )
they have made huge strides and anyone with a talented young lad would love them to play for that club
their transfer policy is sound and they are happy to give youth a chance thanks to their incredible academy facilities
some of the top clubs in europe will be keeping tabs on ronald koeman because he has done a fantastic job with a side many tipped for relegation
as for the race for the champions league ? if it keeps going as it is there are going to be some big clubs and good sides who miss out

# marchingon ' boy oh boyd ! george boyd typifies what has been good about burnley this season
he works so hard for his manager and his team - mates , but he âs also got that little bit of quality to go with it
he scored a fantastic goal against city â it was superb technique and such a pure strike â but i was so impressed by his work ethic
he covered 8.4 miles on saturday â the fourth - highest distance in the league this season
and , incredibly , of the top 10 distances run in 2014 - 15 , six of them belong to george boyd
that is an incredible effort and exactly what managers want
george boyd ( centre ) wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner against manchester city pellegrini 's city slackers that was a shambolic performance from city
i ca nât understand how a team can go from being champions to being so slack
the players almost look bored and uninterested
it happened under roberto mancini and it âs happening under manuel pellegrini
every time chelsea stutter , city fail to take advantage
i do nât think you can pin it all on the manager , but he needs to do something and quick , because now they âre looking over their shoulder at the chasing pack
manchester city players traipse from the pitch after losing 1 - 0 to burnley at turf moor on saturday evening Â£ 195m - the approximate cost of manchester city âs star - studded starting xi at turf moor this weekend - burnley âs was less than Â£ 7 pain for poyet i âve played alongside gus poyet and he is one of the most passionate people in the game
that result will have hurt him
he took full responsibility after the game but that was one of the worst performances i have seen in the premier league
they were sloppy with the ball and showed no real desire to get into the game
no wonder the supporters were venting their anger
gus poyet was left fuming in the sunderland dugout after his side fell 4 - 0 behind to aston villa by half - time pulis on the up tony pulis has his strikers firing but , most importantly for west brom , he has stopped them leaking goals
he builds teams from the back and it shows in the stats
at crystal palace last season they conceded far fewer goals after his arrival and it âs the same now at the hawthorns
he âs such a specialist in the relegation scrap
tony pulis is doing a remarkable job at west bromich albion as his side continue move towards safety magic marouane strikes again i âve never been his biggest fan , but credit where credit âs due : marouane fellaini was outstanding against tottenham on sunday
since he first arrived at the club he has had to fight perceptions and prove his worth
i still do nât think in the long term he is a united player â he âs certainly not someone to build a team around â but this season he has been one of their most effective players
louis van gaal has made him his go - to man and it is paying off
he scored one , was involved in another and caused spurs the most problems
he was united âs best outfield player against arsenal and again on sunday , so fair play to him and van gaal for making it work
marounne fellaini buries this chance for manchester united 's opener against tottenham in the 3 - 0 victory n'zogbia key to villa 's revival i was speaking to tim a few weeks ago and he said the biggest problem at aston villa was that the players were paralysed by fear
tim has come in and changed all that
he has christian benteke and gabriel agbonlahor scoring but , more importantly , he has brought charles nâzogbia back in from the cold
paul lambert froze him out but he is exactly the kind of creative force aston villa were crying out for
he certainly does nât play with fear and his energy and skill tore sunderland apart
charles n'zogbia ( right ) was in fine form for aston villa against sunderland on saturday afternoon blues are back it 's been a good week for everton in a very tough season
the first half - hour against dynamo kiev was painful to watch last week â there was almost an anger around the ground at the way the team were playing
they had to fight so hard to get that win but you saw what it did for their confidence â they followed it with a big result against newcastle
i never felt they were in danger of being relegated and now they could go on a run and might even be england âs last team standing in europe
james mccarthy ( right ) opened the the scoring for everton on sunday at goodison park 170 - yannick bolasie has attempted 170 dribbles in 2014 - 15 , more than neymar ( 160 ) and arjen robben ( 154 )
crystal palace 's wide boys get it done crystal palace are flying under alan pardew and it âs the wide men who are doing the damage
yannick bolasie and wilfried zaha were excellent but it was a tough result for chris ramsey
he looks like he âs playing youngsters to please the chairman but this is a time to win points , not brownie points
170 yannick bolasie has attempted 170 dribbles in 2014 - 15 , more than neymar ( 160 ) and arjen robben ( 154 )
yannick bolasie ( left ) was in great form to provide two assists for crystal palace on saturday afternoon jamie 's premier league number crunching 3 - during their demolition of qpr on saturday , crystal palace scored three first - half goals for the first time in their six seasons in the premier league
however , it was the third time this season that qpr had shipped three before the break
the fact that matty phillips scored from the furthest distance this pl season ( 40 yards ) will be of little consolation for queens park rangers fans
matty phillips fired in an unbelievable strike for queens park rangers at selhurst park on saturday 18 - wilfried zaha had gone 18 premier league games without a goal or assist before saturday , but managed both in the first half against qpr
21 - after failing to score in 21 games for lille , liverpool loanee divock origi grabbed a hat - trick in his side âs 3 - 0 win against rennes
2005 - arsenal have hit some excellent form in the second half of the season
the gunners have won eight straight home pl games for the first time ever at the emirates and the first time overall since november 2005
12 - aston villa scored as many goals in the first 18 minutes against sunderland as they had in their previous 12 away league games ( two )
1 - southampton have not conceded more than a single goal in a premier league away game since the opening weekend of the season , when they lost 2 - 1 to liverpool at anfield
