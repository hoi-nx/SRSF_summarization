the family of the six - year - old oregon boy publicly shamed for being late to school thought they were simply getting their car repaired when they were surprised with a newly refurbished minivan
hunter 's parents nicole garloff and mark were told their dodge durango had been repaired after local medford businesses heard he was late because their car was old and unreliable
but when the family arrived at automotive , they was presented with a 2001 chrysler minivan , complete with a new windshield , two new tires and free oil changes for a year
but it was a local radio host who came up with the idea to get the family a reliable car
bill meyer saw the photograph of hunter after nicole garloff posted it on her facebook and immediately wanted to help the family tackle the ' root of the problem '
' i saw the school policy as being unjust , but i saw the root of the trouble was car trouble , ' he told abc news
bill meyer initially enlisted the help of mcclease-kelly 's automotive owner lisa mcclease-kelly to repair the family 's dodge , but she soon realized the repairs would cost more ' than what the car was actually worth '
that 's when local company rapid repo and collections stepped in and offered to donate the chrysler
fellow businesses in the medford and grants pass neighborhood chipped in to outfit the car with updated parts
they also gave the family a $ 100 gas card and two $ 60 gift cards , according to oregonlive
mcclease-kelly , who contributed an additional $ 1,400 worth of repairs , said the family was completely taken by surprise with the gift
local radio host bill meyer saw the photo of hunter eating alone behind this cardboard divider and said he saw ' the school policy as unjust ' and wanted to get to the root of the problem - the family 's frequent car trouble the school district said that the system is supposed to give children the chance to catch up on work they have missed by being late - but staff have now agreed to stop using the screen ' when i handed dad mark the key to the minivan , he was speechless and extremely grateful , ' she told oregonlive
bill meyer said all it took was a little ' nudge ' to help the deserving family
' the family never asked for the help
all they ever wanted was to change school policy ' he told abc news
' everyone else came in with their time and generosity
' as for hunter 's family , they said the outpouring of community support still ' does n't seem real '
' i 'm trying to tell hunter that this does n't just happen to you , ' nicole garloff said

his mother nicole garloff said : ' i 'm trying to tell hunter that this does n't just happen to you ' ' this is my grandson , hunter
he 's a little first grader , ' she wrote
' his momma 's car sometimes does n't like to start right up
sometimes he 's a couple of minutes late to school
' yesterday , he was one minute late and this is what his momma discovered they do to punish him ! they have done this to him six times for something that is out of his control ! ' they make a mockery of him in front of the other students
' she said that his mother found hunter crying and took him home
his parents said they were devastated when they found out what their son was going through
' they are shaming him for something that 's not in his control , ' hunter told koin6
' it is our fault that he is late
