foxnews.com later announced that jarrett had stepped down from his role as anchor for ' personal reasons ' and he went to a rehab facility in minnesota
but after checking out , he had an ' immediate relapse ' and a bar employee at minneapolis called police after he became unruly and started bothering another customer
footage of the arrest , which was released , shows him calling an officer a ' f * * * ing stupid ass ' before the officer grabs his arm and forces his face against a wall , then slams him into the cell 's bench

and yet , through alcoholism that 's what i 've become
' but roger still refused to give up on jarrett , telling him : ' we can beat this
' the ceo assured the anchor that his job was safe and that he would continue to get paid , while also regularly checking in on his wife and their two daughters , grace , 18 , and olivia , 16
