ditching green energy targets would save every household in british around Â£ 214 a year , a report reveals today
the centre for policy studies paper concludes that the rush for renewable energy has been the â most expensive policy disaster in modern british history â
shifting to wind and solar power have hugely increased costs to consumers , while creating an energy supply that is â intermittent â
as a result , huge additional investment has been required in backup capacity to cover for when the wind is nât blowing and the sun is nât shining
shifting to wind and solar power have hugely increased costs to consumers , while creating an energy supply that is â intermittent â ( file picture ) and billions more have been spent to connect remote wind farms to the national grid
author darwall concludes that , astonishingly , no british government has conducted a rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits of the renewables target which was first negotiated by tony blair at the european council in 2007
the government is committed to providing 15 per cent of its energy from renewable power by 2020
mr darwall , the author of the age of global warming , concludes that the annual costs of the renewables target is a staggering Â£ 9billion
switching back to a free market in power would save households around Â£ 214 a year , assuming that gas replaces renewables , he says
the report says : â energy policy represents the biggest expansion of state power since the nationalisations of the 1940s and 1950s
it is on course to be the most expensive domestic policy disaster in modern british history
â by committing the nation to high , cost , unreliable renewable energy , its consequences will be felt for decades
â â in addition to their higher plant - level costs , renewables require massive amounts of extra generating capacity to provide cover for intermittent generation when the wind does nât blow and the sun does nât shine
â the report concludes that the costs of â intermittent renewables â have been â massively understated â
as a result , â massively subsidiesed wind and solar capacity floods the market with near random amounts of zero marginal cost electricity
â â to keep the lights on , everything ends up requiring subsidies , turning what was once a profitable sector into the energy equivalent of the common agricultural policy
â the cost of the national grid has nearly trebled as a result of connecting to remote wind farms , he says
more solar and wind means british is having to more than double its overall capacity , because additional sources are needed when wind is nât working
without renewable energy , the british would need 22gw of new capacity to replace old coal and nuclear stations , but as a result of renewable energy , an additional 50gw is required , the report says
the annual costs of the renewables target is a staggering Â£ 9billion , according to the report abandoning renewables and going back to a market system would save around Â£ 6billion a year , or around Â£ 214 for every household , he says
but professor catherine mitchell , professor of energy policy at the university of exeter said the report â downplays climate change as a problem â
she said : â what is needed is an electricity market that is constructed to best integrate renewable energy and energy efficiency for the benefit of customers , the environment and security
â last month , energy secretary ed davey announced Â£ 4billion in new energy deals for wind and solar schemes
it means a guarantee for some 27 new renewable energy projects that they can sell their power at a fixed price until 2040
the subsidised schemes include 15 onshore wind farms , five solar arrays , two offshore wind programmes and five waste conversion plants
it will be paid for by householders through their electricity bills with a subsidy added to the basic cost of electricity
a spokesman for the department of energy and climate change said : â we are dealing with a legacy of underinvestment to safeguard people âs electricity supplies now and in the years ahead
â the government âs electricity market reforms are designed to attract up to Â£ 100 billion of capital investment that we will need in the sector over the next decade
by creating the world âs first low carbon electricity market , we are going green at the lowest cost , and attracting tens of billions of pounds of infrastructure investment , creating huge numbers of green jobs
