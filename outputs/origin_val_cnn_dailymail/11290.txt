in a hammer - blow for the italy , no 8 parisse has not recovered from a foot injury suffered during last weekend 's 29 - 0 home loss to france
he will be replaced in the back row by samuela vunisa , who moves from openside flanker , with veteran mauro bergamasco handed the number seven shirt

and there is also a chance in the front row for leonardo ghiraldini 's leicester colleague michele rizzo , who replaces the injured matias aguero
highly - experienced forwards quintin geldenhuys and robert barbieri , meanwhile , are on the bench
saturday 's encounter will be a third home game for italy in this season 's tournament , but they have so far scored just three points at home , going down to france and also being beaten 26 - 3 by ireland
they have , though , beaten wales twice from seven previous six nations starts in rome , even if the italy - especially without parisse - go into battle as huge underdogs
wales are currently third in the table on points difference behind leaders england and second - placed ireland , and realistically they need to better their record six nations win in rome - 38 - 8 , 10 years ago - to maintain hopes of a third six nations title during the past four years .
