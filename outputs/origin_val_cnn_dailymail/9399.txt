to most eyes she was just a little girl doing no harm to anyone as she made her way to school with her father
but to the local police , sophie was a law - breaking menace ... because she was riding her bicycle on the pavement
an officer stopped the four - year - old and threatened to confiscate the purple bike , which is fitted with stabilisers , if she did not get off and walk
they had paused to feed the ducks when the policeman warned her it was against the law to ride on the pavement
former soldier mr lindley , 34 , said : â at first i thought he was joking but he looked deadly serious
â i said , â you must be kidding
what do you want me to do , make her ride on the busy road ? it âs rush hour
â â he just shrugged and said , â she must get off the bike and walk and i âm going to sit here and make sure you do nât put her back on it
if you do , i âll confiscate the bike
â the officer kept watch as they began the one - mile walk uphill to west grantham academy st john âs school
when sophie arrived at school she was in floods of tears , mr lindley said
traumatic experience : by the time sophie was in school , ' she was so upset a teacher had to calm her down ' â the poor thing thought she was going to be put in jail
i âm absolutely outraged that a policeman can act in this way
surely the police have better things to do than pick on parents taking their kids to school ? â sophie âs mother emma stephenson , 33 , said : â when dale came home and told me what had happened i could nât believe it
â how on earth is my daughter riding her little bike with stabilisers to school a criminal offence ? surely there needs to be some common sense applied
â you ca nât expect a four - year - old to ride in the road â it âs not exactly safe
â i am trying to teach her that they [ the police ] are friendly
now that has all gone out the window
â lincolnshire police have now apologised to the family , admitting that common sense should have prevailed , but sophie âs parents are considering making a formal complaint so no other child is treated in the same way
' absolutely outraged ' : mr lindley ( left ) said his daughter sophie ' thought she was going to be put in jail ' ' unbelievable ' : sophie 's mother emma stephenson ( above ) accepted it was illegal to ride on the pavement , but added that it was ' ridiculous to think a four - year - old is not allowed cycling groups criticised the officer âs actions
roger geffen of ctc , the national cycling charity , said : â everyone lets their children ride on the pavement
it is perfectly normal and not criminal
â a ctc spokesman said : â a four - year - old child should be encouraged to cycle and not be deterred
it is good exercise and gives them a sense of independence
police officers should use their discretion â this child was nât causing any danger or distress
â cyclists are told in section 64 of the highway code that ' you must not cycle on a pavement ' - which is backed up in law by section 72 of the highway act 1835
the penalty for cycling on the pavement is a fixed penalty notice of Â£ 30 under section 51 and schedule 3 of the road traffic offenders act 1988
however , children under 10 can not be charged with committing a crime , although they can be given a local child curfew - an overnight ban from being in public without an adult
last year cycling minister robert goodwill told police that cyclists should not be fined for mounting the pavement to avoid dangerous stretches of road
he urged police to remember official guidelines from 1999 which state that fines are not aimed at those using pavements out of â fear of traffic â , provided they show consideration for pedestrians .
