for the time being sara and rob are staying with one of rob âs friends from college but that is merely a temporary solution
rob never got renter âs insurance because he âs only been living at his home for a few months so he may not get anything back from the building in damages
rob moved into the apartment in november and while he planned on getting insurance , he had n't gotten around to it yet
