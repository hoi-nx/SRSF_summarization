a mexican mafia hit man convicted of beating and strangling a san antonio woman because she did n't pay the gang 's 10 per cent tax on her illegal drug sales was executed wednesday evening
the injection of vasquez with a lethal dose of pentobarbital leaves texas with enough of the powerful sedative to carry out only one more execution
vasquez was the fourth texas inmate put to death this year , and at least six are scheduled for execution in the coming weeks
texas prison officials , like those in other death penalty states , have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use
vasquez , in a final statement , told his family and friends he loved them and thanked ' the lord for his kind mercy , faithfulness and unconditional love
' ' in jesus ' name i pray , ' he said , then told the warden : ' i 'm ready
' he took three deep breaths , then began snoring loudly
the snores became progressively quiet , and all movement stopped within less than a minute
the sister of his victim was among witnesses watching through a window
he never looked at her
his own sister and a female friend cried as they watched in an adjacent room
vasquez 's lawyers filed no late appeals to delay his execution for the 1998 slaying of 51 - year - old ybarra
evidence at vasquez 's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51 - year - old ybarra for ignoring the mexican mafia 's 10 per cent street tax on drugs â known as a ' dime
' ' i 'm sure she was told if you 're selling , you 've got to pay the tax , ' said mary green , an assistant bexar county district attorney who prosecuted vasquez
' i guess she did n't take it seriously
' after a night of drinking and drugs at a run - down san antonio motel , vasquez and two companions put on bandannas on their facesbarged into the nearby room of ybarra and her boyfriend , bazan , early on march 19 , 1998 , according to evidence presented at his trial
bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw ybarra being beaten , heard vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle ybarra
the attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry , stuffed them into a pillowcase and fled
when bazan regained consciousness , he stumbled to the motel office to summon police
he was able to identify at least one of the attackers , leading to the arrest of all three
one of them , johnny joe cruz , took a plea deal that carried a seven - year sentence and testified against vasquez
the third man charged , oligario lujan , is serving a 35 - year prison term
court records show the three were carrying out orders from mexican mafia boss rene munoz , who spent years on the texas department of public safety 's 10 most wanted list until his arrest in 2012
joel perez , vasquez 's lead trial lawyer , recalled last week that the motive for the slaying was ' very detrimental '
' we have the texas mexican mafia , and anyone selling drugs they collect a dime - 10 percent , ' he said
' and the motive in this case was she was n't paying
' detectives also found the blood of the victims and vasquez 's blood on clothing left in the trunk of a car he used
' it put him at the scene when he denied being around there , ' mary green , an assistant bexar county district attorney who prosecuted vasquez , said
the lethal injection of vasquez on wednesday evening at huntsville prison in texas would leave t officials in the nation 's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply ' i recall he was an extremely violent individual
in the punishment phase we proved up two other homicides he 'd been involved with
' vasquez had a lengthy record and had been in and out of prison at least twice
one conviction involved the beating of a man who died after his body was set on fire
records also show vasquez ' father is serving a life sentence for a 1976 murder , and a brother and cousins are or have been in prison
texas ' next execution is scheduled for next week
randall mays is set to die for a 2007 shootout where two texas sheriff 's deputies were killed
executions set for april in the nation 's most active death penalty state will require a new lethal drug supply to be carried out
some states have started considering other options
utah 's legislature gave final approval tuesday night to a proposal to allow executions by firing squad if there is a drug shortage
legislation to allow firing squads also has been introduced in arkansas , while a wyoming firing - squad measure failed
in oklahoma , lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow the state to use nitrogen gas to execute inmates
' i remain optimistic we 'll be able to carry out executions according to the schedule , ' brad livingston , executive director of the texas department of criminal justice , has told the associated press
' vasquez ' execution is the 522nd in texas since the state reinstated capital punishment in 1976 .
