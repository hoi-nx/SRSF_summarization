gardner from perth ensemble san cisco was on a friend 's farm taking some time out last week to hunt pests when the unfortunate incident occurred
the band member was with a friend near the west australian town of collie , about 200 kilometres south of perth , when they were driving through rough terrain and the gun went off
the bass player in perth band san cisco has ruled himself out of the first leg of the band 's upcoming tour after he literally shot himself in the foot ' as we were driving through an exceptionally rough paddock , i reached down to stop the gun from bouncing around and before i knew it , it had gone off , ' gardner said
' the bolt had slid down and the jolting had triggered the gun
somewhat of a freak accident
i realised i had been shot and ripped off my boot and sock to reveal a hole in my foot and blood everywhere
gardner then explained the mate he was with , isaac , quickly jumped into action grabbing his first aid kit and bandaging his friend 's foot up
the gun went off accidentally while the bassist was in the car on the way to hunt pests ' he then started driving towards the nearest hospital , which was 100kms away
i passed out in shock and came to shaking and being yelled at
' by the time we got to the hospital i was calm , but in excruciating pain
the doctors got morphine into me and put me in an ambulance headed for a bigger hospital , ' he continued
' i eventually made it to the perth hospital where a specialist has done a great job putting my foot back together
' san cisco ( gardner is pictured left ) kick off their international tour across the us , mexico and europe later this month although the bassist is now on the mend , he will miss the first leg of san cisco 's tour , which sees them hit the us and mexico before heading to europe
gardner said he 's devastated to be missing the band 's first festival in mexico , but will rejoin san cisco in europe ' when i 'm not completely knocked out by painkillers '
' however i know the band will do me proud and there will still be the same show , just without my embarrassing dancing ! , ' he added
this news comes ahead of the release of the band 's latest album , gracetown this friday march 6 .
