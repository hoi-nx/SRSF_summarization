the grand slam door was slammed in ireland âs face at the millennium stadium as wales defended their patch like 15 cardiff bouncers to secure a famous six nations victory
as the welsh tackle count moved past the 250 mark , it was clear that ireland had finally met their match
there have been questions about the entertainment value of northern hemisphere rugby but , if ever an advert was needed , this was it
shaun punched the air in delight and the championship race lives on
wales killed off ireland âs 10 - match winning run and â describing himself as â a simple kiwi boy â in the post-match press conference â gatland proved that he is a smarter tactician than a tub of flora

replacements : cronin , healy , moore , henderson , murphy , reddan , madigan , jones tries : penalty conversions : sexton penalties : sexton ( 3 ) â a lot of our players ran themselves into the ground , â said gatland
â in terms of atmosphere and intensity , it had everything as a test match
sometimes you suffer a loss and the next three or four days are a struggle to get out of bed ; we were definitely on it emotionally
â that emotion was beamed through the exquisite kicking game of full - back halfpenny
ireland âs sexton was dubbed as the player with gold - plated feet , but the celebrated no 10 did not quite live up to his billing
the visitors were shot down in â the battle of the skies â and were forced to dessert their aerial game that was so effective against england
in the early exchanges , rob kearney fumbled a short kick - off and jenkins won a fine turnover
sexton kicked a restart straight into touch and wales were able to build up phases
all the momentum was with the hosts and , after 13 minutes , they were 12 - 0 up
welsh forwards coach robin mcbryde has told supporters not to expect a feast of flowing rugby but - despite tickets exchanging hands for Â£ 300 - a - pair on the blackmarket before kick - off â they were more than happy with what they were seeing
â there are a few â what ifs â and â maybes â , â said ireland coach schmidt
â you look at the small margins that might potentially have changed the result
our strategy was the same as the last few weeks but it âs not a case of back to the drawing board
we wo nât throw the baby out of the bath water because it âs pretty hard to start all over again
â wales were building nicely but their progress was stalled by an injury to lee in the front - row
gatland breathed a sigh of relief as sexton pushed his first penalty wide of the left post , but the no 10 made amends with his second effort following a cheap high tackle by scott baldwin
the tables were there to be turned and ireland identified lee âs replacement , aaron jarvis , as a weakness at the set - piece
they immediately used their choke tackle to set up a scrum , but warburton stole a dangerous attacking line - out from toner âs 6ft 11 grasp shortly after

sexton continued to edge his side back with two more penalties â sandwiching a fine drop goal by dan biggar â but wales survived the yellow card with their half - time lead still intact
gatland was forced into more front - row changes at half - time when he lost jenkins to a hamstring injury
ireland needed to change their approach after the break and they enjoyed more possession and territory
schmidt âs players were consistently penalised for not rolling away in the first half and their discipline improved in the second
they enjoyed more improved territory and possession , but lack the execution in the final third
they camped themselves deep in welsh territory in the 50th minute but were repelled by a cacophony of noise and fierce tackles
inspired by the roars , warburton rallied his players , locked the gates and forced ireland backwards
in a breath - taking seven minutes , the welsh defence saw off two full - blooded attacks â combining almost 50 phases â and eventually won the penalty when sexton went off his feet at the breakdown

play moved downfield and wales built up phases of their own
the forwards carried powerfully - providing the backs with quick , front - foot ball - and two quick passes found replacement centre scott williams
the 24 - year - old , who had replaced jamie roberts because of a dead arm , short - changed tommy bowe after 62 minutes and cut through the defence to slide over for the first try of the game
â the attitude in defence was second to none , â said warburton
â shaun âs gone into a lot of detail all week about certain policies to cover their trick plays in attack
the boys took on all that information and the detail paid off
certain matches you can tell the boys are extremely focussed , and at breakfast i could see that everyone was so desperate to win
â wales were on the brink of their third home victory over ireland in 33 years , although ireland were not finished
on the afternoon of his 100th test , paul oâconnell turned down a near - certain three points and ordered his fly - half to kick for the corner
peter oâmahony claimed the line - out and wales conceded a penalty try by collapsing the maul
it set up a tense finale â with jonathan davies being shown a late yellow card â but wales held on to set up another weekend of drama .
