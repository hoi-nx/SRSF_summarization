recalls mr marc marginedas : ' once in position , [ jihadi john ] took a red pen and began to draw a sword on the [ unnamed ] hostage 's face , letting him know , in this macabre he would end his days in western , beheaded
' ' the pen tip broke before he finished the sketch , but jihadi john wanted to finish his work with the rest of sharpened pencil , already cut almost like a knife , tearing the skin of the cheek with a vengeance , and leaving for the following days a visible wound in the face , outlined by the scar
' mr marc marginedas also claims that the the beatles were only put in charge of the prisoners because islamic state commanders could n't spare hardened fighters from the battlefield
and he believes this may have been a source of a grievance to them which only served to fuel their cruelty
mr marc marginedas was captured on the 4th of september 2013 by rebel jihadists , close to the city of hama , in western
he had entered the country three days before , through turkish ; accompanied by members of the fsa ( fsa )
according to mr marc marginedas , jihadi john was a ' manic - depressive ' , similar to that of a serial killer so often depicted in films

writing in the sunday times , javier espinosa , described how mohammed emwazi squeezed maximum drama out of the torture and intimidation of the hostages
javier espinosa , a journalist for spanish newspaper el mundo , said mohammed emwazi liked to carry an antique metre - long sword with a silver handle , of the kind muslim armies used in the middle ages
after enduring a mock execution at the hands of jihadi john , mr javier espinosa said ' that encounter confirmed the psychopathic character of my interlocutors
' mohammed emwazi was among ' psychotic ' extremists who pillaged the spaniard 's belongings to put towards a haul of stolen cash apparently so large there were rooms filled with millions of dollars
it was , he continued , one of ' several episodes of psychological and physical torture , privations and humiliations ' prisoners endured

alongside american journalists and aid workers including british alan henning and david haines , they were locked in isis prisons - as mr javier espinosa describes them as ' elegant mansions ' and the former government headquarters in raqqa - across the war - ravaged country for months
being woken by the screams of other hostages as they were tortured in their cells was commonplace
on one occasion , the spaniard notes , a young boy was beaten to a pulp after being caught smoking - a forbidden habit under oppressive sharia law
the european and american hostages who disappeared had been either freed or moved , mr javier espinosa claims to have been told
instead they were being picked off one by own , their deaths showcased to the world in barbaric propaganda videos

javier espinosa , described how mohammed emwazi squeezed maximum drama out of the torture and intimidation of the hostages freed : the moment journalist javier espinosa was reunited with his son on the tarmac of a spanish airport after spending months in captivity , held by isis terrorists mr marc marginedas recounts an incident in february last year when jihadi john visited the hostages and claimed that he had been wounded in combat : ' once , on a february evening , he appeared in the room and began walking in circles to the silent hostages
he seemed limp , and claimed that he had been wounded in combat during the day
' he said " i wonder what you would do to me if you were in my position , " hinting that he was aware of the suffering being imposed on innocent and the desire for revenge that may be raising his performance
' mr marc marginedas says the jihadists ' evil cruelty is further demonstrated by another episode in which the ' the beatles ' gave the leftovers of their food to half the starving hostages while the remaining hostages were ordered to watch their fellow prisoners eating
this , he says , was designed to sow bad feeling among the prisoners - which it did , with recriminations against those who had played the the beatles ' game by eating the food
mr marc marginedas was one of the first of the 19 hostages from 11 different countries to be released by is
he recalls how jihadi john first told him the good news : ' marcos , marcos [ is the name on my passport ] , are you ready to go ? ' , he asked in a quiet , mellow voice
" yeah , i replied , instinctively looked up by the surprise news that was giving me and forgetting that when we spoke to the ' the beatles ' i had to keep my eyes focused on the ground , fearing that we might end up identifying these three masked by eye
' " do not look at the eyes ! " , he shouted , lifting his hand .
