as most kids were spending their school break heading off on vacation or sitting at home , ashima was busy breaking some very longstanding world records
the 13 - year - old from new york city has become the newest , and youngest , rock star in the world of rock climbing , and prove just how amazing she was with one very difficult climb
by conquering open your mind direct , a notoriously difficult rock wall in santa linya , spain
she became the first woman and the youngest person ever to make it up the challenging crag
and it only took her about 10 minutes
' for every hard climb , especially open your mind direct , the hardest part is the mental game
' what 's more , the already daunting climb was made even harder as the climb became even harder since a key hold , which climbers use to attach themselves to the wall as they move up the face , has broken off a while back , and since then no one has been able to successfully complete the climb , which is rated a 5.15a
no one , that is , until ashima
and like most kids her age , she celebrated her victory the best way she knew how - with ice cream
ashima , who says she loves to hang out with friends and eat when she is not rock climbing , celebrated her big climb with some ice cream the daughter of japanese immigrants , who began climbing when she was just 6 , is ready for more challenges now , and knows that she and other girls can handle them just as well as the boys
she said ; ' i think that now it âs not always the guys that are pushing the limits ; it 's also girls who are strong and focused and inspired to climb
