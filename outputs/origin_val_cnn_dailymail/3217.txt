a shocking report from investigators at the social security has found that 6.5 million dead people are still listed on the benefit agency 's rolls , listed at age 112 or older
illegal immigrants and thieves are taking advantage , according to the social security 's office of inspector general
the ig set out to find out if death dates were being entered into computers for people who had ' exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies
' if found millions who the government officially considered at least as old as the oldest living human currently alive
us social security numbers belonging to 6.5 million dead people were still listed as active â not deceased â when the social security 's inspector general investigated young'uns : some of the still - active ssns belonged to people who were born before teh us us civil war former homeland security secretary janet napolitano launched the ' e-verify ' system in 2011 , which screens out illegal immigrants during hiring , but some have been using still - valid ssns belonging to dead zombie americans bureaucrats never added their social security numbers to the government 's ' death master file , ' so it 's possible benefits have been paid erroneously for decades
the gerontology research group reported in october 2013 that there weer only 35 people on earth who were confirmed to be age 112 or older
the inspector general did not say how many benefit checks were sent to the 6.5 million zombie americans whose social security accounts should have been closed out years ago
but the ig 's report , just one page in length confirms only that payments have been ' terminated ' for 410,074 of the affected accounts
judicial watch president fitton told daily mail online in a telephone interview that he was outraged by the possibility ' that there are dead people getting government checks
' ' now we 've got 6.5 million walking dead , ' he said , ' and frankly â are these zombie americans voting ? are they working ? are illegal immigrants using their ssns to get jobs ? ' indeed , ' thousands of the ssns could have been used to commit identity fraud , ' the inspector general 's report concludes
' we obtained information indicating a man opened bank accounts using several different social security numbers , ' according to the ig , which said two of them belonged to people born in 1869 and 1893
' and between 2008 and 2011 , employers trying to screen out illegal immigrants during hiring submitted 4,024 ' e-verify ' requests to the federal government representing 3,873 people who used ssns that belonged to people born before june 16 , 1901
wisconsin johnson sen. johnson told cns news that it 's ' incredible that the social security in 2015 does not have the technical sophistication to ensure that people they know to be deceased are actually noted as dead
' johnson chairs the senate homeland security committee
the committee 's ranking democrat , delaware sen. tom carper , noted that ' a few thousand ' of the deceased people who still had active social security numbers were born before the us civil war
' preventing agency errors by keeping track of who has died is a relatively simple problem , ' he said
' walking dead ' : judicial watch president fitton said the federal government si committing the same kind of fraud that would get banks shut down , by failing to ensure its money is spent wisely identity fraud : bureaucrats at the government benefits agency , located in baltimore , maryland , failed to enter social security numbers into the ' master death file ' fitton blamed the obama administration , not just individual criminals , for the lapses
' when you 're an agency and you do n't do what you need to do to make sure people are n't getting money they 're not entitled to , that 's fraud , ' he said
' if you were a bank and you did n't have the checks in place to make sure your money was n't misused , you 'd be shut down , ' he said
' just ask hsbc what could happen
... when government agencies do it , they 're just told to clean up their act
' ' social security is on the verge of bankruptcy , ' fitton warned
' unless it 's fixed the whole thing collapses
the last they could do is make sure that 6.5 million people who are n't entitled to benefits are n't getting checks
' ' and it 's not the dead people who are cashing those checks , ' he said
