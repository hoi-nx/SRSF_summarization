the powerbrokers behind carl frampton and scott quigg will meet in london on wednesday in an effort to finally make a fight that could be the biggest in britain this year
barry mcguigan , who manages carl frampton , will sit down with scott quigg âs promoter hearn at breakfast to try to iron out the issues standing between the two super-bantamweight world champions
if successful , the hope is for a summer showdown that will net a seven - figure payday for each man , but significant obstacles remain in the way , with hearn concerned that unless progress is made in the next two weeks then the long - awaited fight will be delayed further

hearn has already submitted a proposal for staging a pay - per - view fight on sky and , as such , is likely to offer a greater purse
but barry mcguigan has long been adamant that the fight should prioritise the exposure of terrestrial television over â greed â

the hope is for a summer fight , possibly on june 20
â i think we need to reach some kind of agreement soon , probably the next two or three weeks , if we are to get this fight on in the summer
it really is the fight people want to see
â carl frampton , 28 , extended his perfect record to 20 wins against chris avalos in february , while scott quigg is unbeaten with 30 wins and two draws
