any mother who is charged with getting a young family ready in the morning knows exactly how physically demanding it can be
and it is a daily reality lili - who is only eight - knows all too well
before lili , from barnet , north london , even heads out to school in the morning she has to help to get three people dressed , as well as put on the wash and make breakfast for her family
the 37 - year - old , who is an ex-dancer , is registered disabled and suffers from a degenerative condition - scoliosis - which causes the spine to curve
the painful illness not only makes it difficult for her to walk but can leave her in agony
in addition , sarah has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder , which has seen her sectioned twice
sarah is separated from lili 's father graeme and has two other younger children , three - year - old tyler , who suffers from adhd ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ) and two - year - old kaya , who , more often than not , lili is charged with taking care of
she told the mirror : ' i 've always done lots to help mummy
she wakes me up in the morning around 7am - i 'm normally a bit tired , but i get myself dressed and then help kaya out of her cot , because we share a room
' sarah ( left ) says she feels guilty that she has to ask lili to help with family life
lili ( right ) can prepare family meals including pie and mash and spaghetti bolognese and knows how to use a knife safely an average day continues with kaya preparing ' coco pops and milk ' for her little sister and making her mother a cup of tea
lili adds : ' some mornings i 'll run mummy a bath
depending on how well she is , she can dress herself , but i help with things she finds hard , like putting on her socks and shoes
then , when we 've all got our bags and coats on , i go to school
' lili 's story is all too familiar
according to the charity carers trust , there are currently estimated to be at least 180,000 carers under 18 in the uk
the organisation has launched a new website , babble.carers.org , specifically for children who are caring for siblings or grown ups
the charity adds that many children feel they ca n't share the burden of what 's happening at home , with up to 39 per cent of young carers not admitting to a teacher that they are looking after someone
another harrowing statistic is that children caring for others often face bullying , with 68 per cent of young carers saying they have faced name - calling at school
lili is a dab hand in the kitchen but says she does n't feel like she 's missing out : ' the only time i feel a bit jealous of other kids is when i go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps ' for lili , school offers some respite from the relentless routine at home
when the school bell rings in the afternoon , lili can often find herself head of the kitchen , preparing family staples such as spaghetti bolognese and pie and mash
although sarah arranges for food shopping to be delivered , little lili is no stranger to running errands and is a familiar face at the local shops
' i 'm used to shop assistants and customers looking surprised and asking me if i 'm by myself , ' smiles lili
' i just explain my mummy is outside waiting , and i make sure i get the right change
' other household chores include hoovering , separating our colours from whites and putting on a wash - load and doing the dishes ... tasks which leave mum sarah feeling wracked with guilt
' i feel constantly guilty that lili does so much for me and the other kids , ' says sarah
' i should be looking after her
' sarah says the situation was made worse when she split with her partner graeme in 2014 , quickly plunging lili into the role as key carer
sarah ( left ) separated from her partner graeme last year , leaving lili ( centre ) a key ally in caring for her younger children kaya ( far left ) , now 2 and tyler , ( far right ) now 3 time for fun : sarah makes sure lili ( above right ) is well supported
the eight - year - old is part of a local group for young carers and has access to a counsellor if she needs it ' she 's always been so grown up and capable
graeme and i decided to split up last year â it 's not easy living with someone who 's bipolar
he 's a good father and the children see him all the time
' i do worry lili will end up resenting me one day
i ask her if she wishes she was like her friends , but she just says , " this is my home , you 're my mum , why would i want anything else ? " i 'm lucky to have her
' in a bid to inject some fun into lili 's life , sarah ensures that her daughter is as well supported as she can be
she has support from counsellors and is a member of a young carer 's club which focuses on enabling lili and other children in similar situations to kick back and have fun
so , does lili worry that she 's missing out ? the resilient youngster seems to take her demanding role in her stride , saying only that she enjoys spending time with her friends and with her dad
she adds that all she 'd really like is to ' make mummy better '
' the only time i feel a bit jealous of other kids is when i go to their houses to play and their mums start fetching them crisps and biscuits while they watch tv
i wish i could have more play dates , but it 's hard for mummy to have extra children round
' ' i do like helping mummy , but i can get fed up sometimes when she keeps sending me up the stairs to fetch nappies or put clothes away
i 'll say , " i do n't want to " , and sometimes she 'll say , " it 's ok , i 'll leave it here and you can do it later
" ' ' i never wish i was anyone else
but if there is one thing in the world i could wish for , it would be to make mummy better
