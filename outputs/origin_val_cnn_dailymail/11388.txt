one of the first victims to receive an nhs payout after being sexually assaulted by savile has spoken out against the â derisory and insulting â amount he received
steve ashton , 50 , was awarded just Â£ 3,125 after a two - year legal battle
mr steve ashton , who was repeatedly abused by the late dj from the age of ten , told the mail on sunday : â i would have got more for whiplash
' it makes you wonder how many more of savile âs victims have been fobbed off with such a derisory amount
â victim : steve ashton ( left ) who was abused by savile when he was 10 , was awarded Â£ 3,125 after a two - year legal battle mr steve ashton said his case was not about the money , but he felt the figure was a snub to all victims
â what is this going to show to other people in this situation ? â he asked
â do they want to go through years of absolute hell for such an amount ? hundreds of people who have yet to come forward will think , â i âm not having my life made into an open book for such a small amount
â it âs a disgrace
â no money can make up for savile âs effect on my life
but there should be some recognition from the authorities of the damage done
â mr steve ashton added that his payout , which had been contested by the nhs charitable trust , â is probably one day âs work for the law firm that represented me â
he added : â you hear of celebrities receiving Â£ 50,000 after having their phones hacked , but how does that compare with being sexually molested as a ten - year - old boy again and again ? â i âve been going through this for 40 years and i still feel savile laughing at me
â mr steve ashton âs award was calculated using a compensation â tariff â , which sets payouts at between Â£ 1,500 for indecent assault over clothing to Â£ 40,000 for rape
victims are entitled to more if they can prove lasting psychiatric damage or repeated abuse
the compensation scheme , set up jointly by savile âs estate , the bbc , the nhs , children âs charity barnardos and lawyers acting for the victims , was finally approved by the court of appeal three months ago
payments capped at Â£ 60,000 have been awarded to more than 200 people who applied
each claim triggers payments of up to Â£ 16,000 to lawyers
â my law firm was very caring , but they will come out of this far wealthier and happier than i did , â mr steve ashton said
he added that he was advised he might be able to secure more by continuing his fight in the high court , but decided not to as success was not guaranteed
savile befriended mr steve ashton at stoke mandeville , where the victim âs mother pamela worked as a spinal injuries researcher
the abuse happened in the porter âs lodge and in savile âs private room at the hospital
mr steve ashton recalled : â he used to say , â this is our secret
â â if everywhere was busy he would take me to the mortuary
he once pointed at the fridges and said , â if you âre a naughty boy for savile , this is where you âll end up â
