for the first time , the air force has resurrected a b - 52 bomber that had been in long - term storage at the boneyard , the portion of davis-monthan near tucson , arizona , where the military sends aircraft that have been retired from the fleet
the 53 - year - old stratofortress , tail number 61 - 1007 , nicknamed the " ghost rider " had been in storage at the desert in the care of the amarg ( amarg ) since 2008
thousands of aircraft are stored at the boneyard , where the dry desert environment helps preserve them
some are scavenged to supply parts to planes still in the fleet
others are brought back into service
ghost rider , after upgrades , will become the first stratofortress to return to duty from the boneyard
though the dry desert air inhibits corrosion , the baking heat can have other adverse effects , including causing dry rot in the tires and fuel lines
the lines and fuel bladders in ghost rider were completely replaced , tech. sgt. stephen sorge , a fuels specialist from the 307th maintenance squadron , said in an air force report on the project
once that work was done , the plane 's engines were tested again in january
on february 13 , ghost rider flew again , a three - hour flight from davis-monthan to its new home , barksdale in shreveport , louisiana
the resurrection process took 70 days , according to the air force report " i 've been flying the b - 52s since the ' 80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years ... she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems , " col. keith schultz said in the air force report after piloting the eight - engine jet on the 1,000 - mile flight
schultz , who with more than 6,500 hours flying b-52s is the most experienced active pilot of that aircraft in the service , led a co-pilot and a navigator , the minimum three - person crew , on the flight to louisiana
the stratofortress would normally fly with a crew of five
" those were the only three seats we had activated for egress , " he told the times
for safety reasons , ghost rider made the entire flight with its landing gear down , at a speed of only 288 mph and at a height of 23,000 feet , well below its top speed of 650 mph and ceiling of 50,000 feet , according to the times report
it also flew without some of the other things aviators have come to rely on
" we were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed , " schulz said in the air force release
ghost rider will replace another bomber at barksdale that was damaged by a fire during maintenance
" we had an oxygen leak with a spark and it caused a cockpit fire
there was so much damage it was actually more economical to bring this one out of the desert , " schultz told the times
for a time , ghost rider will sit beside the damaged stratofortress for transfer of usable , updated equipment , the times reported
it is expected to resume active service next year
as of may 2014 , the air force reported there were 76 stratofortresses in its fleet , 58 in the active force and 18 in the air force reserve
besides barksdale , b - 52s are based at minot air force base in north dakota .
