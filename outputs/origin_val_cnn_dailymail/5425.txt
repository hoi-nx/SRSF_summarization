' one woman was charged 20 times the value and the other , 10 times
' the third person did n't hand over any money but became upset and almost buckled under the aggressive behaviour from the defendant
' the work in rhiwbina took place over many months with the victim in the end having difficulty in recalling all the jobs her workmen claimed to have done

' then there was a wobbly window in her garage and the garage ended up being almost rebuilt and she was told there was damp
' they looked in her loft and gutters and weather boards were replaced
' by that time she had paid about Â£ 70,000 to Â£ 90,000 - she says she lost track and told the police ' they just kept finding things to do '
' mr reynolds said : ' she paid out Â£ 52,000 in february 2012 and that month ronald connors bought a Â£ 32,000 range rover and in march a ford fiesta costing Â£ 10,000

' in porthcawl , a neighbour was looking out for the 60 - year - old who had already been targeted by cold callers

' he was advised to cancel the agreed quote for Â£ 7,000 , his neighbour helped him write a letter which was posted by recorded delivery but a few days later the defendant turned up saying he was going to do the work
' he was aggressive , threatening and abusive
' hughes , defending , said connors had no previous convictions and had built up his business since the age of 18
but at the time he was under financial pressure and sub-contracted jobs to others , not realising the work they were doing was deficient
' he thought it was being done properly ' mr hughes told the judge
' he had no idea it was of poor standard
he now accepts he was too aggressive in his practises
' the court heard claims that ronald connors had taken out a bridging loan to repay the victims and that had cost him Â£ 30,000
recorder george bull qc told ronald connors : ' you are a thoroughly dishonest businessman preying on people and you chose your victims carefully and it was going on over a period of time
it was despicable conduct and you should be thoroughly ashamed of yourself

' the sentence should also send a strong message to all rogue traders that we will investigate all complaints made , with a view to recover the proceeds of their crimes and prosecute them through the courts
