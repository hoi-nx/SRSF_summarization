preliminary exit poll estimates released by israel 's three major broadcasters late tuesday show an election too close to call
millions of israel cast their votes to determine their country 's next prime minister and the makeup of its parliament
channel 2 israel reports the likud party , headed by prime minister benjamin netanyahu , has a slight lead over the zionist union , led by isaac herzog -- 28 seats , over 27 seats
channels 10 and 1 show the two tied with 27 seats each
the incumbent claimed victory ahead of a final count
" against all odds , we achieved this huge victory , " benjamin netanyahu told his cheering supporters
" now we should form a strong and stable government that will be able to take care of the security , safety and welfare of each and every citizen of israel
" the zionist union responded by saying in a statement that the likud party " keeps misleading
" " the rightist bloc has shrunk
everything is possible until the real results are in , when we can know which parties passed the electoral threshold and which government we can form
all the spins and statements are premature , " it read
official results are not expected to be published until next week , and the process of building coalitions could take much longer
gabriel sassoon , foreign communications adviser for the isaac herzog campaign , said : " the fat lady has far from sung in this case
the parties are neck and neck and it 's a matter of coalition negotiations and let me tell you , it 's entirely possible to form a center - left coalition at this point
israel is tired of nine long years of benjamin netanyahu
" election ballots are for political parties rather than individual candidates
israel has a proportional representation system , meaning a coalition government is likely to be formed within its 120 - seat knesset
how does israel 's parliament work ? cnn 's labott described the early results as a " stunning turnaround " for benjamin netanyahu , who took a sharp turn toward the right during the final days of the hotly - contested campaign
" it seems to have worked
he seems to have energized that right - wing base and now he is neck - and - neck with isaac herzog , even inching a little bit ahead of him , " she said
" we 'll have to see who 's able to form the coalition with the other parties , but it does look as if prime minister benjamin netanyahu has fought his way back and has a very good chance of forming this government
" before polls closed tuesday , benjamin netanyahu released a video on his facebook page urging his supporters to vote , suggesting that leftists are bringing " huge amounts " of israel 's arab citizens to the polls to vote against his likud party
" the right regime is in danger , the arab voters are coming in huge amounts to the polls , " benjamin netanyahu said
" the leftists are bringing them ( arab ) in huge amounts to polls using buses
... we have an urgent wake - up call
" arab make up about 20 % of israel 's population
according to the early exit poll estimates , an arab coalition ranked as the third largest party
arab citizens of israel face defining moment in election kahlon , a former likud minister who now heads the kulanu party , said benjamin netanyahu 's statement " clearly shows he is feeling the pressure
" " these remarks were inappropriate and regrettable , " kahlon said
polls closed at 10 p.m. local time ( 4 p.m. et )
following the release of exit poll estimates , president reuven rivlin said that citizens need a ruling government as soon as possible
" the president will work with all the election bodies to start the consultations process asap
we hope to start as soon as sunday , " his office said in a statement
isaac herzog comes from israel political royalty
his grandfather , rabbi yitzhak halevi herzog , was the first chief rabbi of the state of israel
his father , chaim herzog , was an army general , an ambassador to the united nations and the president of israel
before entering politics , isaac herzog served with a military intelligence unit of the israeli army , rising to the rank of major , and worked as a lawyer and served as the director of the israel anti-drug authority
he began his political career in 2003 , when he first won a seat in the knesset with the labor party
he held a variety of ministerial positions , including minister of housing and construction , minister of tourism and minister of welfare and social services before becoming leader of the labor party in 2013
in those elections , he also became the leader of the opposition , as benjamin netanyahu won another term as prime minister
isaac herzog has pegged his bid for the premiership on social reform , vowing to " change the nature of the division of wealth
" he has also promised to restart stalled peace talks with the palestinian
benjamin netanyahu served for six years in the israeli army in an elite commando unit until he was wounded in a rescue operation during an airplane hijacking in 1972
in 1976 , benjamin netanyahu 's brother was killed in a raid to try to free hostages in uganda from an air france jet hijacked by pro-palestinian terrorists
benjamin netanyahu set up an anti-terror institute in his name
his outspokenness on the threat of terrorism attracted attention , and he was given high - profile diplomatic assignments
in 1988 , he was elected to the knesset
in 1996 , he became israel 's youngest prime minister
he was defeated three years later after signing an interim peace agreement with then - palestinian leader yasser arafat
in 2009 , he again became prime minister
cnn 's labott says benjamin netanyahu 's emphasis on security -- particularly speaking out loudly on iran -- and his counteroffensives against hamas in gaza have boosted his popularity in israel
but labott says peace with the palestinians remains elusive , and benjamin netanyahu is finding himself increasingly alienated from western partners
as negotiations with iran near a crucial state , benjamin netanyahu has sided against the white house , telling the u.s. congress this month that a proposed agreement was " a bad deal " and would not be supported by israel , which would stand alone if necessary to defend its people
