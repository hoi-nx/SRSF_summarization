bump on the head or not , alonso is the same wily maverick he always was
this most brilliant yet political of drivers , who is apt to spell the word team with the pronoun â i â , delivered his disloyal lines here yesterday quietly , courteously and devastatingly
a steering problem , he told a press conference before sunday âs malaysia grand prix , was the cause of the mclaren driver âs apparently innocuous accident during pre-season testing in barcelona last month
just one thing : mclaren repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with their car
calling on every conceivable bit of tele - metry , they compiled a 37 - page report , which they presented to the fia , substantiating that view
alonso stands in front of the world 's press as he poses for the cameras ahead of sunday 's race the spaniard is back in action this weekend after missing the season - opening australia grand prix alonso has claimed his steering wheel locked which caused his pre-season testing crash in barcelona â the steering problem came in the middle of turn three , â elaborated alonso , who missed the opening race in melbourne as he recovered from the crash that threatened his career
â it locked into the right and when i approached the wall i braked at the last moment , i downshifted from fifth to third , and unfortunately we are still missing some data
â how routine steering data would not be readily available baffled most observers , including a host of former drivers
â i âve listened to alonso âs very clear explanation of the incident , â said broadcaster martin brundle , who drove in 158 grands prix
â now i âm really confused
â one of the fia âs most senior technical officials commended mclaren âs report as honest and robust
why , then , would the spaniard blame a steering problem when there is apparently no supporting evidence ? alonso is set for his second mclaren debut after he left the team at the end of the 2007 campaign the spaniard was in good spirits as he addressed the media in sepang after being declared fit to race the two most obvious reasons are that he was either too proud to admit he made an error , or a possible neurological glitch caused him to black out prior to hitting the wall ( even though he was changing gears , he may have been semi-conscious as he did so )
it appears he did not mention any steering problem to mclaren until last week - three weeks after the accident
they then smuggled a quotation from him citing this explanation into the middle of a press release on monday , perhaps to appease him
what they did not expect was alonso to make such a fuss about the issue when he spoke in the sepang paddock
they could not disregard their meticulous data , nor could they publicly argue with their Â£ 25million - a - year driver - relations between the team and alonso still have not entirely recovered from the fractious year he spent at mclaren in 2007
alonso barely speaks to dennis , the mclaren chairman
his relationship with the de facto team principal eric boullier , who was not at mclaren during alonso âs first spell there , is somewhat more trusting but he is closer to andrea stella , an italian who moved with him from ferrari to remain his race engineer
these scenes echoed 2007 , when alonso threatened to report incriminating evidence about dennis to the fia during the spygate scandal
alonso arrives in the sepang paddock for the malaysia grand prix ; the second round of the championship the double world champion in the paddock with compatriot carlos sainz prior to thursday 's media briefing back then , the team were split in two
alonso and his manager luis garcia abad would brief spanish journalists in one corner
the same procedure happened at the team âs hospitality area here on thursday
alonso was again surrounded by his cabal - abad and his deputy alberto fernandez , and physiotherapist edoardo bendinelli - as he ate jacket potatoes as part of the so - called â boys â lunch â ... the meal provided for the team âs mechanics and engineers
by this point , alonso , who arrived at the track at 9.45am , had been cleared by the fia âs doctors to compete on sunday , a virtual formality after he passed more extensive tests by three cambridge university doctors at the weekend
yet still the mystery goes on
alonso said he was â perfectly conscious at the time â of the accident - a version of events that seems to contradicts with mclaren âs public statements and eyewitness accounts at the scene
alonso insisted he will have no problems stepping back into the cockpit for first practice on friday alonso smiles in his car in the garage at sepang , home of this weekend 's malaysia grand prix â i lost consciousness in the ambulance or in the clinic at the circuit but the doctors said this is normal because of the medication they gave me for the helicopter transfer and the checks they did in hospital , â he said
â there is a time i do nât remember from two oâclock to six oâclock , but that was normal on the medication
â alonso more plausibly denied reports originating in spanish that he woke up believing himself to be a teenage go - karter
he said he could remember everything the following day , but then said it took him â three or four days â to gather his memory
but not for his team - mate button , who said : â i âve seen every single bit of data many times
it all says that the car is ok
â it was button âs polite way of saying what we were all thinking about the confused nature of alonso âs testimony .
