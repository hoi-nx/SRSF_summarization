nine - man cardiff survived a late brentford onslaught to dent the home side 's promotion charge with a smash - and - grab 2 - 1 win
all the goals came from goalkeeping blunders in a game which ended with harris and macheda both seeing red for cardiff
gray gave the home side a first - half lead , but goals from macheda and alex revell turned things round for cardiff
cardiff 's harris was sent off for a reckless lunge on brentford midfielder alan judge the welsh club came to west london with a game plan to stifle the fluent bees by breaking the game up at every opportunity , and brentford at times looked rattled by their physical approach
yet the bees took the lead midway through the first half after a howler by their former stopper simon moore , who could only parry pritchard 's dipping free - kick into the path of gray to bundle home from close range
the hosts should have put the game beyond doubt by the break , only an acrobatic simon moore save denying pritchard 's deflected looping shot
jota also caused havoc down the right flank and gray twice went close to extending the lead before the break

macheda drew them level on 53 minutes when brentford goalkeeper button collided with his own centre - back harlee dean and dropped the ball into the path of the italian , who slid home from 12 yards
and the comeback was complete on 68 minutes when button raced off his line to intercept a hopeful through ball and was caught in no man 's land for alex revell to chip home into the empty goal
however , the sheen was taken off the win by two red cards for the welshmen

that sparked a frantic spell of pressure from brentford which saw james tarkoswski head over when well placed and tommy smith 's goal - bound drive blocked by a melee of city bodies as russell slade 's men held on
cardiff almost snatched a third deep into stoppage time , but kenwyne jones squandered a gilt - edged chance to give the scoreline a flattering feel by blazing over after racing on to a through ball with the home defence committed
