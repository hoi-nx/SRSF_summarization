babysitters may have once just been the teenager next door , but nowadays parents in some states are willing to pay over $ 16 an hour for a caregiver their children adore
a new survey has revealed that the average pay rate for a sitter has increased more than 28 per cent in just five years - rising by more than a dollar to $ 13.44 since just 2013
by contrast , babysitters in 2009 made an average $ 10.50 an hour
average babysitter wages have increased by 28 per cent in the last 5 years , as the graphic by care.com reveals but the cost for care has risen much higher than a couple of dollars for certain cities
the care.com survey , which had more than one thousand respondents , revealed that babysitters are most expensive in san francisco , where they make an average of $ 16.65 per hour
that 's five dollars more than the city 's minimum wage
boston and silicon valley hub san jose are not far behind , with rates clocking in at $ 15.37 and $ 15.63 , respectively
new york , unsurprisingly , still made it in the top five with a $ 15.09 rate
costs significantly drop further from the coast
babysitters make , on average , $ 11.31 an hour in grand rapids , michigan , the cheapest of the rates
cities in south carolina , utah and ohio round out the top five least - expensive babysitter wages with costs in the $ 11 rage - with rochester , new york , also making a surprise appearance
although one in four parents said they believe they 're paying their babysitters too much , the survey found they also have no problem upping the costs
eighty - seven per cent of parents give their sitters an annual raise , and 26 per cent will tip them
and one in 10 parents is willing to throw in an extra $ 5 an hour if they booked their caregiver on short notice
only three per cent of families said they choose their sitter based on expected wages
forty - nine per cent of families select a sitter loved by their children
a new survey by care.com has revealed that the average pay rate for a sitter has increased more than 28 per cent in just five years - rising by more than a dollar to $ 13.44 since just 2013 according to care.com 's senior managing editor bugbee , parents today expect more from their sitters - and are willing to pay the price
' parents want experience , ' she told yahoo! parenting
it 's not longer the kid down the street who will just sit there and eat doritos all night
' that means , according to the survey , that the babysitter is between 20 to 25 years old , does n't smoke and is certified in first aid or cpr training
bugbee said that , on the flip side , sitters are likewise working harder to make more of child care
' millennials are graduating college and becoming nannies or babysitters and the interest is there to perfect the profession , ' she said
' we 're seeing the evolution of the field on both sides
' surprisingly , over half of the surveyed parents said they 've hired a babysitter without running a background check or checking listed references
but a whopping 94 per cent of families said they have complete trust in their child caregivers
and many parents will go to incredible lengths to keep them around
twenty per cent of parents said they 'd be willing to poach another family 's babysitter and 16 per cent said they would n't share a great sitter 's contact with their own friends
but that 's hardly shocking
according to the survey , 31 per cent of parents think of their sitter as family .
