a cyclist claims he was warned by police he could face an assault charge after he saw a driver throw litter out of his car so threw it back through his window
the rider filmed the moment he confronted the motorist , who got out of his vehicle and asked him for a fight in dumbarton , near glasgow
in the footage the cyclist tells the driver , who is wearing a white cap and white t - shirt , ' here 's your stupid litter back ' , before throwing the cup into the man 's corsa
but after contacting the police the cyclist was warned he could be charged with common assault for instigating the fight
the 20 year - old cyclist , who has asked not to be named , posted the video online last thursday in an attempt to shame the motorist
he said : ' i just thought for some reason in my head i should be confronting this person
i was n't intending it in a very aggressive way
' as i approached the driver i asked him to roll down the window and this was when i threw the cup in the window
' the rider 's video shows him picking up an empty pepsi cup he claims the driver threw from his car
he then pedalled after the black car , which was caught in traffic and tossed the cup back through his window
