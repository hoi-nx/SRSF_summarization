all foreign nurses , midwives and dentists will have to pass tough new english language checks before being allowed to treat patients in the uk
nhs trusts will be required to check the language competency of all their healthcare workers , before they are given licence to practise in the uk
the move marks an extension of legislation introduced early last year , which demands that all foreign doctors are now subjected to tough language checks before treating patients
since the new law was passed 429 doctors have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the uk because their english language skills are not up to scratch
until now only nurses , midwives and dentists from outside the eu were subject to any language competency tests
all foreign nurses , midwives and dentists will be required to pass english competency tests before treating patients in the uk after mps voted to extend legislation introduced last year for all foreign doctors but today mps voted to extend the rules to cover those from member states
today health minister dr poulter said voting to include all healthcare professionals , as well as doctors , would offer ' better protection for patients '
debating the final stage of the legislation , he said : ' we all value the contribution that doctors , nurses and healthcare professionals from all over the world make to our nhs , but being able to speak and communicate to a good standard of english is essential to provide high quality and safe patient care
' these new laws will provide protection for patients and the public
' currently the nmc is only required to test the language skills of those nurses and midwives coming to work in the uk from outside the eu
those moving from member states are permitted to begin work without taking a language test
the nmc said there are currently 26,474 nurses and midwives from the eu on their register , while another 66,163 are from non-european economic area countries
there are a total of 685,262 nurses and midwives on the register
under the new powers if an applicant can not provide evidence of their language competency , the nmc will be able to ask them to take an internationally recognised test
the nmc 's new powers are expected to come into effect later this year
a change in the law , which was passed for doctors last year , came after germany doctor ubani killed his patient gray , when he confused two drugs and gave mr gray an overdose until last year when the law changed , the gmc only had the powers to test the language skills of foreign doctors from outside the eu
since 1983 , the doctors ' regulatory body had been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from eu countries
last year 's change in law for doctors was prompted by an ' alarming ' number of cases where patients complained about poor treatment from doctors with a poor grasp of the english language
in 2008 germany doctor , dr ubani killed his patient gray , when he confused two drugs
as a result dr ubani , who was working his first shift in the uk providing out - of - hours cover , injected mr gray with 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine
an inquest later found he was unfamiliar with the drug and had poor english
the nigerian - born medic was struck off by the gmc but was able to continue working in his adopted country of germany after the authorities there let him off with a nine - month suspended prison sentence and a small fine
in addition , an alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior nhs staff in 2011 after patients complained of inadequate treatment , citing language difficulties
in an attempt to tackle the problem , the government proposed changing the law in september 2013
the language tests were to be introduced for the first time , for doctors arriving from the eu
health minister , dr poulter added : ' as a practising nhs doctor , i know the importance of good communication skills to ensure the very best patient care
' and i have seen first hand when poor communication has let down patients
' as a minister , i am pleased to be using my front line healthcare experience to give our healthcare regulators these important new language testing powers , which will benefit and protect patients and the public
' the bodies that regulate nurses , midwives , dentists and pharmacists will be given the same powers as the gmc
the gmc now has the power to investigate any complaints made about doctors ' poor language skills
and as part of their regular appraisals , and the new medical revalidation process for doctors , which they must pass to continue treating patients , the gmc now checks language skills of those medics from overseas .
