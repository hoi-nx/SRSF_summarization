dramatic footage has emerged showing the killer germanwings pilot learning to fly as a teenager years before the fatal crash in the french
andreas lubitz , 27 , who deliberately crashed his passenger jet into a mountain killing all 150 on board , is seen laughing and joking as he takes off and flies a glider in germany

but he was forced to take a six - month medical break for depression and ' burnout ' before finally qualifying as a first officer at lufthansa two years ago
germany investigators also found torn - up sicknotes and a ' small mountain of pills ' in andreas lubitz 's dusseldorf flat which showed he had hidden the extent of his illness from his employers
at least one of the medical certificates covered the day of the crash last tuesday
the 27 - year - old was also said to be ' living on the edge ' because he feared that his deteriorating blurred vision would cost him his pilot 's licence
calls are now intensifying for doctor - patient confidences to be suspended for people responsible for the lives of others
