india on wednesday joined countries like iran , saudi arabia , china and pakistan to support a proposal moved by russia denying staff benefits to gay couples at the un
the move was defeated as 80 votes were polled against it while 43 countries , including india , backed it
speaking against the proposal , us ambassador to the un samantha power said : â we must speak plainly about what russia tried to do today â¦ diminish the authority of the un secretary general and export to the un its domestic hostility to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) rights
â the un extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries
( file picture ) india went with the russia proposal as it was based on its domestic laws on same sex relations
the un extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries
but last year , secretary general ban ki-moon had moved a proposal to extend the benefit to all gay couples irrespective of their domestic laws
the russia envoy at the un had strongly advocated in favour of extending the domestic laws to respect cultural differences of the members of the world body
this is also perhaps the reason for india to back the russia proposal
while pakistan and saudi arabia were the other countries on india âs side , 37 members abstained and 34 did not vote at all
india âs own legal provision on the issue has been subject of much debate
section 377 of the indian penal code was struck down in 2009 only to be revived by the supreme court last year
there is one last chance for the gay community to get homosexual acts decriminalised by the supreme court
after their review petition against the judgment which made gay sex a crime punishable with life was dismissed on january 28 , 2014 , the activists filed a curative petition before the apex court on april 3 , 2014 which it has decided to hear in an open court
the apex court said the government âs indecision and flip - flop on the issue was to be squarely blamed for the situation
the bench , which ruled that making or changing of a law was the sole prerogative of parliament , questioned why the government had not acted even 13 years after a law commission report sought deletion of the section and there were repeated demands
the court said this proved that the centre wanted the section to remain in the statute .
