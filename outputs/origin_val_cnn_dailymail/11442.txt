it is possible that clinton distributed sensitive information through her personal email , the state dept. now admits , and only a review of her messages will determine if she broke the rules
a state dept. official who spoke to the post acknowledged that some of the correspondence clinton sent through her private email may constitute a breach of security guidelines
the official asserted that clinton did n't directly defy state dept. 's policies by using her personal email for government communications , but a manual obtained by news outlets shows that since 2005 state dept. has directed its employees to use its email system because it has the ' proper level of security control

' she and her team has said that it was not used for anything but unclassified work , ' harf , deputy spokeswoman for state dept. told reporters on wednesday , adding moments later , ' i do nât think there was any indication she was doing anything but [ that ] here , so i do nât think it âs really a pertinent question
' further pressed to ' definitively ' claim clinton was n't sending classified information through her personal email â which is against the law â harf argued that ' you ca nât claim that about anyone âs unclassified email
' she also noted in the exchange that the department does n't monitor its other employees ' private communications to make sure that classified information is n't being shared
' i âm not sure why this would be anything different , ' harf contended
' i do nât know why this would be held to a different standard
' when clinton did need to discuss classified information she communicated through her her staff , the state dept. spokeswoman claimed

former obama senior adviser david axelrod has said that the longer clinton and her team wait to respond to the flurry of questions about her use of not only a non-official email for her work at the state dept. but also a personal domain name and a private server , the likelier the situation is to get out of hand

and a spokesman for her confirmed to the press at the beginning of the week that all of her emails that pertain to the state dept. have been remanded to the federal government
questions continue to linger , however , and neither clinton nor her team have given a reasonable explanation for the former obama administration official 's actions
