there may still be 10 games and more than two months to go until the curtain falls on this season 's premier league action
but , somewhat farcically , voting for the players ' player of the year award , has already begun
luis suarez , who scored 31 league goals for liverpool last term before his Â£ 75million summer move to barcelona , currently holds the title
sportsmail 's team of top writers give their verdict on which player they would want to follow in the uruguay international 's footsteps if they were asked to cast their vote today
ian ladyman nemanja matic jose mourinho âs current chelsea team is perhaps the most physically imposing he has ever assembled and nemanja matic stands out as a giant among men
a superb reader of the game , nemanja matic can pass the ball well , too
he would get in just about every team in europe and that says it all
nemanja matic , in action for chelsea against psg earlier this week , has starred for the blues this season matt barlow harry kane chelsea have been the best team with immense consistency from nemanja matic and eden hazard
but no - one has made a greater individual impact than harry kane
he âs transformed the mood at white hart lane with his energy and desire , deflected attention from the big - money flops and offered hope for the future as a flag - bearer for the youth system
not to mention 26 goals , and an anticipated england call - up
he must finish the season and kick on , but harry kane seems capable of that
each time he seems about to fade , he hits back
harry kane celebrates with his second successive barclays player of the month award on friday harry kane , pictured celebrating against queens park rangers , has scored 26 times for spurs this season lee clayton who deserves to be voted player of the year today ? here âs my answer to the question : no - one
it âs a nonsense that the players have to vote so soon and shows why the footballer of the year award , voted by members of the football writers â association , has more credibility
i 'll save my vote until then , thank you
but among the contenders : john terry , harry kane , coutinho , alexis sanchez , costa , eden hazard , danny ings , de gea and charlie austin
voting now is like deciding a wimbledon champion before the quarter - finals are played
i want to see how they fare at the business end of the season
alexis sanchez has impressed for arsenal following his summer switch from barcelona mike keegan eden hazard it 's close between eden hazard and sergio aguero but the brilliant belgian shades it thanks to his remarkable injury - free record
already this season hazard has pulled on a chelsea shirt 41 times and has again been superb
sergio aguero 's susceptibility to various issues stops him from becoming manchester city 's first winner of the award
eden hazard has played 41 matches for chelsea this season but has been one of the league 's best players neil ashton harry kane he deserves it for the surprise element more than anything else - nobody could have predicted his impact at spurs this season
he lives for the game , thriving on the responsibility of scoring goals for the club and enjoying his relationship with spurs supporters
next week he will be rewarded with a call into the england squad
rob draper nemanja matic i reserve the right to change my mind in the next few weeks , as eden hazard and alexis sanchez have both been superb
hazard could become one of the game âs greats
but i âm close to settling on nemanja matic , because his position is often under - acknowledged and because he has provided balance to a chelsea team that had collected flair players while eschewing midfielders who can defend
he is a throwback to patrick vieira : the aggression , the superb distribution , the instinctive reading of the game and , most of all , those longs legs extending to whip the ball away from an attacking player who thinks he is clear on goal
because he is so good defensively , his passing and creativity in forward areas are often overlooked
i âm expecting the more glamorous players to win the awards but i do nât think any player contributes more to their respective teams than nemanja matic
nemanja matic parades the capital one cup trophy with branislav ivanovic after their triumph over spurs alexis sanchez and eden hazard have both been impressive performers for their sides this season craig hope harry kane there is nothing dark about the art of harry kane and a victory for the spurs striker would be a victory for football and all of the reasons why we should love the game
there are no elbows , no spitting , no intimidating referees - he scores goals for his boyhood club and does so with a smile on his face
his brilliant enthusiasm aside , harry kane is a worthy winner on footballing merit alone and has consistently been the division 's best striker this season
his goals have invariably been match - winning and his breakthrough campaign should be crowned with a clean sweep of the annual awards
de gea has spared united 's blushes on a number of occasions this season branislav ivanovic would win joe bernstein 's vote martha kelner de gea he almost certainly wo n't win it but de gea deserves some representation for player of the year based purely on the fact he has single - handedly and often stunningly rescued united and kept them in the hunt for a top - four finish
joe bernstein branislav ivanvoic this is one of the toughest to call because the obvious stand - out performers - costa , eden hazard and sergio aguero - have missed games or been inconsistent
so in a very even field i 'd vote for branislav ivanovic because he 's typified best why chelsea will be champions chris wheeler eden hazard chelsea are nât winning too many friends at the moment but it does look like they will win a premier league and capital one cup double , and no - one will have contributed more than last season âs pfa young player of the year
a supremely gifted footballer , eden hazard deserves the main award this season ahead of alexis sanchez , costa , coutinho and harry kane
laurie whitwell de gea nobody goes to football matches hoping for clean sheets but the united goalkeeper has produced saves of wonder this season , genuinely entertaining and worthy of repeated replays as much as any goal
this award should go to a player who has impacted his team significantly , clearly lifting them higher
so far , de gea has done that .
