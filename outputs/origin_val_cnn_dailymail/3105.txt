country singer glen campbell 's two oldest children have launched a court fight to take medical and financial decisions away from his wife of 32 years
the move has emerged days after campbell , whose husband has late - stage alzheimer , was forced to stand in for 78 - year - old as he was nominated for best song at the oscar
now it has been made clear how deeply the singer 's two oldest children , debby and travis , are unhappy with the arrangement
' the petition claims that campbell is not providing her husband with needed toiletries and clothing , not visiting him regularly and possibly mishandling his finances
it says several of his eight children - the three youngest of which were with campbell - are not on his list of allowed visitors
and it alleges that campbell has allowed her husband to be interviewed and filmed at the facility , even though his disease has progressed to the point where that is inappropriate
the petition to a nashville court concludes by asking a judge to appoint conservators and a guardian to protect glen campbell 's interests

his daughter had already criticised mrs campbell for moving him into the facility - but she insisted it was the best thing for the aging legend
mrs campbell said : ' it is crushingly sad to see him afflicted with alzheimer 's but indulging those feelings does not help him
' i am his wife and no one wants him home more than me but i must do what is in his best interest
' when questioned by the associated press campbell referred questions about the petition to her attorney , bill harbison , who said he could not comment because the judge has placed the petition under seal
glen campbell revealed he had alzheimer 's disease in 2011 , but he went on to record two albums and play more than 150 concerts
family bond : glen campbell and his daughter debbie , then 17 , at heathrow airport in 1975 at the time , campbell said the tour was a way to help her husband combat the brain - ravaging disease and spend time with family members who made up his band and traveled with him
he also starred in a documentary about life with alzheimer 's , glen campbell : i 'll be me
last month , he won a grammy for his song i 'm not gon na miss you , which plays at the conclusion of the documentary
the song also was nominated for an oscar
mrs campbell stood in for him at the ceremony , telling reporters on the red carpet : ' i 'm not sure if he 's really aware but he will be at his own little oscar party tonight
' it would be lovely to go back and let him hold one
it 's just hard for him to understand
the best song gong went to rap artist common and r&b star john legend for glory , the anthem from selma .
