a new ad starring a ' realistic ' fashion doll with curves , stretch marks and a ' normal ' sized body is trying to change women 's perceptions of their bodies
plastic doll lammily - who was created as an antidote to barbie 's super-slim frame - is being used to teach us about our bikini body obsession
the brown - haired figure confronts her fears on a trip to the beach and sees other women there with flaws and scars , making her realise that no one 's perfect
in what seems to be a parody of the victoria 's secret show - famous for its underwear clad models - two barbies then start twerking on a stage as average barbie looks on
she is then confronted by adverts for a ' dolly tuck , ' and one which says you can lose half an inch in two weeks - a reference to the dolls small waists
in the advert lammily is constantly faced with adverts which tell her she can lose weight quickly - the same images women see in real life the doll is initially seen with red cheeks when she gets to the beach because she is embarrassed by her bikini body however when she finally heads to the beach average lammily realises that everyone there has their own issues
some have stretch marks , others have spots and one has a scar across her stomach
the dolls creator nickolay lamm , a digital artist who majored in marketing at the university of pittsburgh , said of making the ad : ' i was thinking about how lammily , in the fashion doll world , would feel very out of place
i think one of the hardest things to do in life is to be yourself
' lammily also looks at magazines which ask her ' are you beach ready ? ' when lammily sees the other dolls on the beach she soon realises that they all have their issues with their bodies lammily was first created in 2014 as the result of a crowd - funding project
nickolay lamm felt that there was no doll on the market that represented real women
more than 13,000 people signed up to the project with 19,000 of the dolls being pre-ordered
you can buy clothes to fit on the doll as well as stickers which show scars , stretch marks and acne just like normal women have
nickolay lamm , speaking in the pittsburgh post gazette , said : ' i âm an artist , plus event planner , email checker , data entry person , graphic designer and pizza delivery driver
my goal is nât to make a ton of money
i just want to create the most awesome content on the internet
' if you buy a lammily doll then you can buy stickers to go on her - for example these stretch mark stickers which show the marks many women have on their bodies lammily has stretch marks herself which she proudly shows off as she djs a party on the beach for her friends
