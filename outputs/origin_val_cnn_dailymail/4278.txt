mailonline âs victoria woollaston reveals her first impressions of the huawei watch : â there is a plethora of smartwatches at this year âs mobile world congress - and with apple expected to launch its version on monday , there are likely to be even more released in the coming months
however , many do nât feel as luxurious at huawei âs model
the entire crown , frame and hinge are made of steel which makes it feel expensive , sturdy and most importantly , makes it look like a watch
the screen is bright and clear , but its size and the fact it is predominantly used to show notifications means there is little added benefit to this
there will be a range of straps available when the watch launches and i can see it being popular with both sexes
previous watches such as the moto 360 feel more masculine , for example
huawei would not be drawn on battery life or pricing and these will be key to its success , but it is certainly the most stylish and luxurious smart watch i âve seen
' the firm did nât reveal battery life details but said that the timepiece ( pictured ) would charge wirelessly on a magnetic charging station that will ship with device
exact availability and pricing is yet to be announced â we have responded to consumers â requests from around the world asking for a smartwatch featuring a timeless design that is truly smart from within , â said richard yu , chief executive of huawei consumer business group
â as the first smartwatch in our expanding line of premium wearable products , the huawei watch was designed and created to enhance and be part of the consumer âs everyday lives
â huawei continued the watch is made using 130 components and the steel is what âs known as â cold - forged â making it 40 per cent stronger than standard steel
when the watch goes on sale it will be available in gold , silver and black and will have an interchangeable strap

stephen ebbett , global director of gadget insurer protect your bubble told mailonline : â 2015 is set to be the biggest year yet for high - tech wrist candy , and huawei âs smart watch is one of the most beautiful so far , if chunky timepieces are your thing
â its sapphire crystal screen , 40 watch faces , and a rather classy optional leather strap make it all too easy to forget that it âs what âs inside that really counts
â 4gb of internal storage and 512mb of ram are rumoured to be exactly what the apple watch will offer
â it looks as though we already have an apple watch killer , or at least an arch nemesis powered by android wear , on the scene
