facebook has now launched its own version of this feature , called ' on this day ' , that works in an almost identical way
each day the social network will highlight posts made on the same date years before either by that user , or posts that the user was tagged in
facebook has launched ' on this day ' - a tool that highlight posts made on the same date years previously
these posts only appear on a user 's on this day page , and this page can only be viewed by that user
they then have the option to edit , delete or share these posts with their friends these posts only appear on a user 's on this day page , and this page can only be viewed by that user

' people often look back at old photos and other memories they 've shared on facebook , and many have told us that they enjoy products and features that make this easier , ' said the site in a blog post
' on this day shows content from this date in the past
for example , you might see past status updates , photos , posts from friends and other things you 've shared or been tagged in - from one year ago , two years ago , and so on
' facebook has been experimenting with this tool for a while
currently , when statuses , photos and videos are uploaded , the app shows what was similarly posted on this day a year ago , for example
