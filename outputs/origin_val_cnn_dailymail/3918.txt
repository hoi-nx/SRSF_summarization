dawson , who now lives and works in los angeles , told the tribune before the show aired that he ' had no idea how difficult it would be to actually play '
' and that applied to the the basic survival elements - the food , the water , the shelter , the sun - but it really , more than anything for me , to the personal dynamics , ' he said
after the episode aired on wednesday , dawson claimed on twitter that he did n't know that much survivor trivia , despite teaching a class on the show for two years
' full disclosure : i actually do n't know that much survivor trivia
it 's just most that players who call themselves fans are actually casuals , ' he wrote
