' i thought against newcastle he played very well and from that point i did n't want him to lose that feeling so i asked him to travel to kiev
he could n't play but he was around the group and i thought we benefited from that
' he looked like a player that has been at everton for years [ against queens park rangers ]
he took responsibility , he knew he had fresh legs , and the way he performed was magnificent
' it was n't just what he did in front of goal , but the way he worked in defence was a real help
it was a really strong performance
' the winger was frozen out at white hart lane but seems to have had a new lease of life in merseyside and with safety from relegation not quite secured , roberto martinez will be hoping lennon can continue to play a vital role in prolonging their premier league status
