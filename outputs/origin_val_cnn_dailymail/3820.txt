the convicted killer featured on the popular ' serial ' podcast filed a brief monday with the maryland court of special appeals stating the case for why his conviction should be overturned
syed , 34 , was convicted of strangling his high school sweetheart hae min lee in 1999 and has been serving a life sentence since 2000
he was 17 at the time of lee 's death
the lawyer for syed is arguing his client should be granted a new trial because his former attorney , gutierrez , made mistakes that were ' deeper than the typical error or omission '
gutierrez , who was disbarred by consent after questions arose about her handling of client funds , died 12 years ago amid legal and health problems , the baltimore sun reported
in the filing , brown wrote : ' the errors by trial counsel were of such a fundamental nature that syed must be given a new trial
' the circumstances here are worse than the circumstances of any other case in which a court has found ineffective assistance of counsel relating to an alibi issue
' the basis of syed 's appeal is that gutierrez failed to interview mcclain , a student at syed 's school who said she was with him in the library at the approximate time of lee 's death
mcclain had written to syed after his arrest offering to speak with investigators and his attorney
in her letters , mcclain also mentioned two other witnesses who said they saw syed at the library
gutierrez never interviewed mcclain nor called her as a witness

' he also argues gutierrez told syed that prosecutors would not offer him a plea deal , but never inquired if one was even on the table
the appeals attorney wrote : ' it not only violates something fundamental to the trial process , but it violates the duty of loyalty that is at the heart of attorney - client relationship
' his lawyer effectively stopped representing him
' serial raised questions about the integrity of the case against syed , the fairness of the trial and his guilt
