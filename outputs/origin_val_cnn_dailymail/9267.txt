a tube of pringles similar to the tin a mumsnet user found in her son 's bedroom filled with urine messy teenage boys ' bedrooms ... they 're the stuff nightmares are made of
but a mother on the parenting website mumsnet has now clarified just how gruesome it can get when clearly out the room of an adolescent , after discovering a pringles tube full of urine
the mum , who goes by the username ' myotherusernameisbetter ' revealed she made the discovering while cleaning out her son 's room this weekend
she wrote : ' today [ my second son ] ( 13 ) was away for the day and i was waiting on hospital visiting time as my mum is very unwell , i needed something to keep me occupied so i decided to do [ his ] room as a treat
' apart from the dirty laundry i found : 2 empty juice bottles , 1 empty smoothie carton , 1 empty milk shake carton , 6 empty crisp packets , 3 apple cores , a pile of orange peel , a pile of sweet wrappers , some bits of popcorn , 2 plastic bowls , 2 plastic cups ... ... and a pringle tube full of urine
' we are going to have to have a talk when he gets home
the lid was on - i reached out to pick it up expecting it to be light ...
. it was heavy , and full of liquid - i opened and sniffed
' it 's just as well he keeps his windows open and heating off
' the revelation caused some shock to other users on the forum , with some saying that they would be serious consequences for such behaviour in their households
but other mothers , often of teenage boys , were sympathetic , with many sharing their own horror stories of items left to rot in their children 's bedrooms
one user called soupdragonwrite : ' i did [ my son 's room ] whilst he was away over half term
' i filled 4 kerbside recycling crates with paper , 2 with bottles and cans , 3/4 of the landfill bin and did approximately 47 billion loads of laundry which mostly consisted of odd socks
' i was a little surprised not to find a dead rat
' another called bellmcend said : ' i mucked out [ my eight - year - old son 's ] bed today
' under his pillow i found : 4 books , 52p , a medal from sports day , a weird piece of felt he 'd been doing something with at school for art , a lego man and a lip salve
' i only changed it ten days ago
' teenage boy in messy bedroom ( posed by model ) one disgruntled mother is so fed up with her son 's untidy habits that she has given up attempting to tidy his room
faithope said : ' my [ son ] is 16 and a slob when it comes to his room
' dirty pants and clothes continue to lay on the floor - the pile of clean and ironed clothes are piling up as i just add to it
t ' the fact that [ my son ] thinks he has run out of clean pants and has helped himself to his dad 's so he has a pair to wear ... if only he looked in that lovely pile of laundry on his bedroom floor , he would find the 20 pairs that are clean and ready to wear
' the mumsnet discussion about disgusting items found in teenagers ' bedrooms the forum debate took on a similar tone to a conversation on the site in 2012 , when one user asked a question about a ' penis beaker ' that almost crashed the site
the person , called saracrewe , wrote : ' we have a dedicated post-sex cleanup area on the bedside table
' a box of tissues , a small bin , and a beaker of clean water for temporary cleaning / dunking while the bathroom is occupied by me
' apparently our penis beaker is strange and not the done thing
' it was met with more than a thousand comments from mumsnet users who called the beaker ' disgusting
