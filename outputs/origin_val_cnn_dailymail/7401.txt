right , its lifeless corpse floats upside down after being savagely attacked mr ncinally said : ' in fifteen years of expeditions to the remote revillagigedo islands , the crew of the boat i was on had never seen orcas there , much less witness the orcas ' exhibit predatory behavior
' the attack was chaotic and horrible to watch
' mr craig mcinally , a qualified technical diver from san diego , california , had been diving with the humpback school the day before the attack
in the photos , the humpback calf can be seen swimming closely with its mother before the larger killer wales separate the pair before slowly drowning and killing the baby
craig mcinally added : ' the first day we were diving with the humpbacks the mother was patient and comfortable with us
' she allowed us to get extremely close and the baby seemed inquisitive , passing close to us whenever coming up to breathe every three minutes or so

here the baby and mother are pictured swimming together fully grown humpback whales , such as the one pictured by mr craig mcinally , can grow to be 16metres in length the baby calf cuddles up to its mother during a swim through a pacific ' the next day another diver noticed an odd fin breaking the surface
i looked over and was shocked to see the unmistakable fin of a male orca
' we grabbed our cameras and dive gear and after a moment we realized the orcas were here for the baby
' the battle was hard to follow
the baby was trying to escape and get back to its mum , but the orcas coordinated the attack to keep the baby separate
' the next tactic was to injure the baby , perhaps to slow it down
finally , the orcas succeeded in drowning the baby and then fed on the blubber
' it was not until back onboard that i had the time to process the immensity of the event and reflect on the raw power of nature
