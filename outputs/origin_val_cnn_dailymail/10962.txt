it was a case of cristiano ronaldo winning his battle with lionel messi but barcelona emerging victors in the war with real madrid after el clasico at the nou camp on sunday in spain
goals from jeremy mathieu and luis suarez gave barcelona a 2 - 1 win to move four points ahead of real madrid atop la liga with 10 games remaining but it was only cristiano ronaldo who got his name on the scoresheet , after a quieter display by lionel messi 's imperious standards
lionel messi appeared relaxed in the tunnel , dabbling in conversation with his barcelona team - mates , his fleece zipped up to his chin
cristiano ronaldo stood poised , staring forward
the nou camp was an inferno , shrouded in gold , purple and blue with the 99,000 supporters in fearsome voice as the two superpowers of global football marched out on the pitch
cristiano ronaldo got on the scoresheet but it was lionel messi who was happiest after el clasico lionel messi ( left ) provided the assist for barcelona 's first goal in el clasico from jeremy mathieu jeremy mathieu ( right ) headed in to give barcelona the lead after only 19 minutes against real madrid lionel messi ( second right ) celebrates assisting barcelona taking the lead against real madrid cristiano ronaldo ( left ) poked real madrid level after 31 minutes , completing a tremendous move cristiano ronaldo ( second left ) watches on as he brings real madrid level against arch rivals barcelona cristiano ronaldo 's first touch of the ball after 40 seconds was met with searing jeers by the barcelona fans
he was eventually crowded out by alves and ivan rakitic and the dispossession of real madrid 's talisman was met with emphatic cheers
lionel messi 's start was subdued , the diminutive argentina international lingering quietly in the centre of the pitch , exchanging the occasional pass with iniesta in the first five minutes
but he snapped into life in the sixth minute with a nutmeg on real madrid playmaker toni kroos
six minutes later , the first clear chance of the game fell to cristiano ronaldo , who escaped his defender on the back post but could only turn benzema 's deft lob onto the crossbar with bravo beaten
he should have scored and barcelona were off the hook
lionel messi was still awaiting his first opportunity to get at real madrid 's defence
nutmeg aside , his first 15 was perhaps best summed up by iniesta uncharacteristically hitting a looping pass over his team - mate , who had found space out on the right touchline
but two minutes later , lionel messi had the ball at his feet and he surged inside , picked out neymar and burst into the area , where he met the cross with his head but sent it wide
barcelona 's breakthrough came on 19 , and lionel messi had the assist
luis suarez was fouled on the left , lionel messi whipped a glorious ball into the area and jeremy mathieu flicked it past casillas to give luis enrique 's side the lead
it was lionel messi 's 15th assist of the season and cristiano ronaldo 's miss after 12 minutes already appeared costly
the goal galvanised barcelona and luis suarez drew a foul from pepe two minutes after the opener and lionel messi seized the ball again
this time he was central and 25 yards out but his effort was deflected out for a corner which came to nothing
neymar missed a glorious chance for 2 - 0 on the half hour mark , meeting a ball across goal from luis suarez six yards out , only to guide his effort safely into the hands of casillas with the goal gaping
cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi walked out to a formidable atmosphere at the nou camp for el clasico cristiano ronaldo 's goal came moments after neymar ( right ) has missed a great chance from close range cristiano ronaldo ( right ) wheels away to celebrate after scoring for real madrid against barcelona cristiano ronaldo ( right ) celebrates bringing real madrid level against barcelona in the la liga clash cristiano ronaldo hit the crossbar from close range with the scores goalless at the nou camp it was a shocking miss and 30 seconds later , real madrid were level
cristiano ronaldo led the surge forward and as benzema collected possession on the right of the penalty area , the portugal international continued his run through the centre
benzema sensed his presence and picked out his run with a glorious swish of his heel
cristiano ronaldo hit fifth gear to beat bravo to the ball , poking it under the goalkeeper to haul real madrid level as the jeers spewed out at the nou camp
eight minutes before half time , cristiano ronaldo picked up the ball on the left and skipped past alves but with mascherano and gerard pique closing him down , cristiano ronaldo went tumbling
television replays showed that gerard pique momentarily left his boot dangling , perhaps to entice a cristiano ronaldo fall but the referee 's decision to book the real madrid man was correct
in the 40th minute , cristiano ronaldo thought he had assisted a goal from gareth bale , who poked cristiano ronaldo 's header into the back of the net
gareth bale was definitely onside but cristiano ronaldo was not and the goal was rightly ruled out
but the real madrid man was finishing the first half in scintillating form
a ferocious shot from 30 yards out was tipped over by bravo and gareth bale skewed a shot wide from the corner
as the second half began , it seemed lionel messi was in the shadow of cristiano ronaldo
real madrid undoubtedly ended the first period of play in the ascendency
lionel messi ( left ) of barcelona closes down real madrid defender pepe in the first half at the nou camp cristiano ronaldo ( right ) was booked for diving in the first half of el clasico cristiano ronaldo was jeered by barcelona 's supporters every time he had possession for real madrid cristiano ronaldo ( third right ) had strayed offside before flicking the ball to gareth bale to score and it was cristiano ronaldo who was involved in the first incident of the second phase , returning the ball into benzema in a probing attacking move , before bravo dived to his left to beat out the france striker 's clever shot across goal
lionel messi was drifting deep to find the ball , and mascherano picked out his compatriot on the halfway line on 52 minutes
he turned and sprinted at the heart of real madrid 's back line and luka modric reached for the ball with his leg but only managed to clip lionel messi 's heels
the free kick failed to worry real madrid like lionel messi 's sprint forward did
four minutes later , barcelona went ahead with a tremendous finish from luis suarez
the uruguay striker was found by a forensic pass by alves , who spotted luis suarez had escaped the attention of pepe and had curved his run to stay on side
the ball was floated over , luis suarez caressed it under control with the outside of his boot and threaded it across casillas and into the far corner
cristiano ronaldo might have been worried after a clash with mascherano on the hour mark
he was flattened by the midfielder but appeared to retaliate , with mascherano exaggerating the contact made by the real madrid attacker
lionel messi ( centre ) attempts to evade the challenge of marcelo , cristiano ronaldo and toni kroos cristiano ronaldo enjoyed a formidable first half for real madrid but was quieter in the second cristiano ronaldo ( second right ) tries to block a clearance from gerard pique of barcelona but the referee was not fooled , only booking the barcelona man for the initial foul
tempers began to fray after the clash between the pair and it suited lionel messi 's barcelona side more as the clock ticked on
as 73 minutes passed , lionel messi went inches away from extending barcelona 's lead
again out on the right , he ran inside and sprinted ominously through the centre before unleashing a fine strike from the edge of the area that went the wrong wide of the post with casillas beaten
barcelona manager luis enrique thought the shot was in and a minute later , he must have been certain his team were about to add to their advantage
lionel messi was again the engineer , perhaps buoyed by his attempt seconds earlier
with luis suarez to his left and neymar to his right , lionel messi played in the brazil international , who blazed wide on an unusually wasteful night from the former santos man
the pair combined again on 77 , this time lionel messi shooting at goal but his low , right - footed strike was blocked and real madrid cleared
benzema almost punished barcelona and lionel messi for spurning their chances when his shot from 25 yards deflected wickedly off mascherano , but bravo managed to turn the ball away brilliantly
lionel messi ( left ) celebrates luis suarez 's goal as barcelona moved ahead in the second half lionel messi curled an effort from range inches wide in the 73rd minute for barcelona lionel messi was creating again four minutes from full time , unlocking real madrid 's defence with a neat pass into jordi alba , who was denied by casillas
barcelona were pouring forward looked to extend their advantage
they did not manage to do so , but lionel messi 's side held on
he might not have settled his duel with cristiano ronaldo , but it is advantage barcelona in the race for the la liga title .
