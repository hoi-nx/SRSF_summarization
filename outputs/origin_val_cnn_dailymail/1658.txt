voters in every ethnic group want the number of migrants coming to britain to be cut , reveals a report out today
overall , the survey found that 79 per cent of respondents thought immigration levels should be reduced with 59 per cent wanting a big drop
this support for stricter border controls was shared by people from all ethnic groups , according to analysis by campaign group migration watch
home secretary theresa may has been pushing for a firm immigration pledge to be included in the next tory manifesto , after the failed a pledge to cut the number coming here to ' tens of thousands ' some 60 per cent of asian respondents wish to see immigration reduced , with 38 per cent wanting it down by a lot
the same is true of black respondents with 57 per cent thinking it should be curbed and 32 per cent wanting a large cut
for those of mixed origin , 60 per cent wanted a decrease with 30 per cent wanting a big fall
of those classed as â other â ethnicities , 56 per cent wanted a drop with 32 per cent believing there should be a large reduction
for all minority groups combined , most want lower immigration levels while about 30 per cent want them to stay the same
only one in ten want it to rise , making it unlikely that policies to curb immigration would deter ethnic minorities from voting for the conservatives
the report is a response to the centre - right lobby group bright blue , which claims the tories must abandon their target to limit net migration to attract more black and ethnic minority voters
home secretary theresa may , who wants a firm pledge to cut migration in the tory manifesto , recently quit as a member of bright blue âs advisory board
a poll by migration watch found that 60 per cent of asians , 57 per cent of black people , and 60 per cent of those from mixed backgrounds wanted to see a cut ( pictured , pedestrians on a street in london ) migration watch said that while tighter immigration controls do not deter voters from an ethnic minority background , the tone of the debate must be â right â
it said black and ethnic minority voters are more likely to see previous waves of immigration as positive for the britain but are clearly concerned about current levels
vice-chairman alp mehmet said : â the report confirms that the concerns of ethnic minority voters are very similar to everyone else and why would nât they be ? â the way to appeal to ethnic minority communities is to propose reasonable policies and reducing net migration to the level last seen in the early 1990s is entirely reasonable
â kiran bali , a member of migration watch who has founded a series of inter-faith groups , said : â the majority of people share similar concerns
â they are worried about schools , hospitals , jobs and overcrowding
â it is ludicrous to lump diverse communities together in suggesting we all want mass immigration
reasonable levels are the only way to achieve strengthened community relations
â the tories are expected to repeat david cameron âs promise to cut net migration to the â tens of thousands â
it is now almost 300,000
the report is based on the british social attitudes survey , a long - running poll of 3,000 residents
tony blair aide : we did n't expect all those poland plumbers sir wall , eu adviser from 2000 to 2004 , said labour did n't see the attraction britain would present to skilled poland workers , such as plumbers labour failed to realise the britain would prove a magnet for poland plumbers , tony blair âs most senior eu adviser admitted yesterday
the admission came in a series of revelations about how labour chronically mishandled eastern european immigration
in advance of poland and seven other eastern bloc nations joining the eu in 2004 , ministers relied upon advice suggesting only 13,000 would settle each year
but more than one million have travelled to the britain , attracted by wages which are significantly higher than at home â with at least half settling here in what proved one of the biggest waves of immigration in britain history
sir wall , an eu adviser between 2000 and 2004 , said : â we simply did nât take account properly of the pull factor of england for people with skills who could probably find a bigger market [ in the britain ] for their skills â you know , the poland plumber
â the remarks risk re-igniting the debate about labour âs record on immigration â for which ed miliband recently apologised
last night lord green of deddington , chairman of migration watch , told the mail : â it is astonishing that nobody properly considered the impact of the wage differential between britain and ... poland
' we said at the time the forecast of 13,000 a year was almost worthless
in fact , it was completely worthless
â yesterday it also emerged that former labour cabinet minister denham had written to chancellor gordon brown and home secretary charles clarke in 2006 to warn the new arrivals were having a huge impact but was largely ignored
mr denham said that wages were being driven down by as much as 50 per cent and that a&e departments were under strain , adding : â on eu migration there was a catastrophic failure of the civil service machine
â not backing down : despite mr wall 's comments , former home secretary david blukett ( pictured during his time in office ) defended labour 's record , he is ' confident ' mass migration was a good idea in a further bombshell , respected economist paul ormerod , writing in the left - wing guardian newspaper , exploded labour âs economic case for mass migration
he argued that it had a â barely perceptible â impact on economic growth per head while suppressing the wages of the less well - off
â it is the relatively unskilled in the bottom half of the distribution who have lost out , â he said
but former home secretary david blunkett was unrepentant about the party âs record , saying : â i âm confident that it was the right decision , even though very few people now will stand up for it
