former chelsea star kalou is being sued for â¬ 10,000 after appearing to smash a lump out of the wall with a hammer and chisel
kalou , who is now at bundesliga club hertha berlin , was filmed chiseling the wall by german terrestrial broadcaster ard in a preview video for hertha berlin 's game against schalke on saturday
the clip , which was filmed in the autumn , was shown in the olympic stadium before the game , and repeated on ard 's saturday night highlights show sportschau
former chelsea forward kalou was filmed taking a piece out of the wall tv presenter gerhard delling was left stunned after seeing kalou take a chunk out of the wall the ivorian international could be hit with a Â£ 7,100 fine after smashing lump out of wall the producers had come up with the idea of the hammer and chisel as a metaphor for kalou 's task of smashing his way into schalke 's rigid defence , with the wall representing schalke coach roberto di matteo 's unpopular defensive style
the former chelsea man obliged unquestioningly , and set about attacking a section of the east side gallery , an open air graffiti exhibition which is one of the longest remaining sections of the wall
the ivorian was apparently unaware that the gallery , which attracts more than a million tourists a year , is protected under german monument protection law
not only that , but the gallery is beloved of many berliners , with hundreds joining david hasselhoff and pink floyd 's roger waters to protest against its partial dismantlement last year
alavi , head of the artist 's initiative in charge of east side gallery , was particularly incensed by kalou 's actions
' when i initially saw the pictures , i nearly fell off the sofa , ' alavi said
' some celebrity is promoting himself at the cost of a monument , and public broadcasters are playing along
it shows a lack of respect
' ard producers came up with idea ahead of hertha berlin 's match against schalke in reference to roberto di matteo 's defensive approach hertha berlin striker kalou played the full 90 minutes of his side 's 2 - 2 draw with schalke the initiative has now made an official complaint to the police , and is looking to sue kalou for around â¬ 10,000 ( Â£ 7,100 ) worth of damage
the actual extent of the damage , and whether or not kalou or the broadcaster will be held responsible , remains unclear
' it 's not the first time it 's happened , ' alavi told bz
' we had a case a few years ago where someone was caught daubing the wall without permission , and they were ordered to pay â¬ 2,500 ( Â£ 1,800 ) by the court
alavi was not the only one shocked by the clip
when it was broadcast on sportschau , presenter gerhard delling was visibly taken aback , saying ' he 's really taken a piece out of the wall , there
the beautiful , old wall ! '
gerhard delling 's comment led to even more uproar , and the presenter was forced to defend himself against accusations of nostalgia for the oppressive wall .
