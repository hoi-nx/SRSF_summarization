' milner has played 36 times for city this season in all competitions and contributed six goals

milner has scored six goals for city this season in 36 appearances for the club manuel pellegrini described milner as a complete player and said it is difficult to find someone better the 29 - year - old has played in almost every position since his big - money move from aston villa in 2010 manuel pellegrini added : â and whatever position i put him in he plays well : at full - back â which is the only place he does nât like playing â attacking midfield , wide , or as a striker
i used him this season as a forward and the team was scoring three goals a game
â you leave him on the bench and he is furious , but watch him during the game , encouraging and shouting
and in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes
