they 're great at cleaning carpets , but when it comes to getting dust and dirt off a wooden floor vacuum cleaners can leave a lot to be desired
now engineers at dyson may have the answer â a new model designed specifically for hard flooring
the firm âs cordless v6 fluffy vacuum cleaner â which goes on sale today costing Â£ 399 â aims to cater for the growing trend for exposed wooden floorboards , ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring
engineers have replaced the traditional spinning bristles â which were designed to drive dust out of a carpet â with a large soft nylon brush similar to a paint roller which scoops dust and dirt from hard floors
larger pieces of debris such as spilled cornflakes are grabbed by the soft material and passed into the machine âs suction stream , while microscopic grains of dust are brushed up by strips of carbon fibre filaments
sir dyson said previously that the company ' must relentlessly invent ' to keep up with changing demand dyson claims the v6 fluffy is particularly good at sucking dirt out of the crevices between floorboards , and is able to pick up a whole 1kg bag of sugar in just four seconds
powered by the dyson digital motor v6 , and digitally controlled , the motor spins at up to 110,000rpm to create the most powerful cordless vacuum
it gives up to 20 minutes of powerful fade - free suction
the vacuum features a special soft roller cleaner head with soft woven nylon , and rows of anti-static carbon fiber filaments
15 two - tier radial â¢ cyclones , arranged across two tiers , also work in parallel to increase airflow and capture more fine dust
the v6 fluffy converts for handheld cleaning and features a centre of gravity located towards the grip and hygienic push - button bin emptying
hard floors have surged in popularity in recent years , driven by a fashion for industrial and â shabby chic â interior design styles
market researcher the freedonia group estimates that there has been a 70 per cent increase in the use of hard flooring in the last two decades
dyson âs new cleaner , which is being produced in singapore , runs for 20 minutes between battery charges
it can clean carpets and rugs as well as hard floors with the help of an attachable head
stephen courtney , head of new product innovation at dyson , said : â in homes today we see more hard floors , so we set out to solve the age - old problem of conventional cleaners simply snowploughing debris across the floor
' we wanted a machine that could pick up scattered cheerios , whilst also capturing fine dust
