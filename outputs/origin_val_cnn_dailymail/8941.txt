deila accused mcgowan of endangering the career of henderson with a wild lunge in the dying moments of celtic 's scottish cup victory over dundee united
the norwegian 's side strolled into a semi-final meeting with inverness by putting four goals past the tannadice men , yet the third of four successive meetings between the sides was again pockmarked by ill - discipline
anthony stokes was sent off by referee calum murray for a swipe at paul paton before mcgowan was also dismissed for scything down celtic sub henderson â prompting the sixth red card in three back - to - back meetings
mcgowan is sent off by referee calum murray after he scythed down celtic sub henderson and a clearly angered deila believes the young celt was fortunate to escape serious injury
' it was a red card , ' he insisted
' it was a stupid tackle on the sideline
we need to get these things out of football
' it was a youngster trying a little trick in the corner
you could have stayed there and kept him out wide instead of going in with both feet
he could have injured him for life
' it must have been frustration
it was a straight - forward win in the end but there were some angry and disappointed players out there
' it got a bit tense at the end but that can happen
celtic boss deila claimed mcgowan could have injured henderson for life with his late challenge ' these have been important games for both teams and sometimes it can get a bit tense
' today , we were the better team , like we were on sunday , and they had some frustration
we need to handle that and get ready for the next game
' deila , who wanted to look at the anthony stokes incident before commenting further , isn ' t concerned the ill - feeling will spill over in the fourth encounter between the sides on saturday
' i spoke to anthony stokes , ' he added
' his mouth was bleeding after a challenge from paul paton and he reacted
we have to see it again if it is a red card
' i am not concerned for my players
we have to be at the same level and get the three points
i am delighted to be playing them again
' celtic eased through at the second attempt thanks to goals from jason denayer , griffiths , kris commons and virgil van dijk
but given the tempestuous nature of the three previous games , griffiths believes there 's every chance matters might get out of hand when the teams reconvene on league business at celtic park
' that 's six red cards in three games now and if i was a betting man then i would be putting money on another sending off this saturday , ' he said
anthony stokes ( second left ) comes together with mcgowan during an ill - tempered second - half ' it is just one of those things and the dundee united players are getting a bit frustrated and we move on to saturday and hopefully we can pick up another three points
' i do n't think there is niggle between both sets of players
i just think dundee united are sick of the sight of celtic
' we have got them again on saturday and then we do n't see them for a while
' dundee united assistant manager donnelly believes refereeing decisions have gone against his side in the three games
the tayside outfit felt ryan dow should have been given a penalty in the league cup while ambrose should have had a second yellow early in the second half last night for a foul on nadir
' the celtic reaction on the back of their player being sent off maybe influences the referee ( when mcgowan is sent off ) but i 'll need to look at it again , ' donnelly said
' is it any worse or any different to brown 's two weeks ago ? ' asked about ambrose , donnelly replied : ' it 's another yellow card
we deliberately put nadir out there to play on ambrose because he was on a yellow card
deila celebrates at full - time as his side reached the scottish cup semi-finals with a 4 - 0 victory ' i thought it was another yellow card when we were having a reasonable period in the game
' they 've gone against us in the last few games
we 've spoken about the penalty at the weekend
' meanwhile , celtic skipper brown says he 's moved on from being photographed seemingly drunk in an edinburgh street four days before the league cup
' i do n't think i 'm the first player to make a mistake and probably wo n't be the last , ' he stated
' but i 've spoken to the manager , it 's been dealt with and now all i 'm doing is moving on
' i 'm sure the club , the manager and the fans know that my total focus will always be on the matches coming up and nothing else but winning for celtic
' it was a real honour as captain to lift the league cup on sunday and we now want to push on and try to bring our fans even more success this season
' that 's all we 're thinking about
