wales star north wants to reward warren gatland 's ' trust ' in him after a challenging few months on the international circuit
juggernaut wing north will win his 48th cap in saturday 's six nations showdown against unbeaten title favourites ireland at the millennium stadium
and the 22 - year - old 's impressive display when wales beat france in paris 11 days ago suggests he is on the way back to recapturing top test match form
earlier this term , wales head coach warren gatland called for north to increase his involvement in games , and it did not go unnoticed
wales winger north collects a pass in training ahead of the six nations clash with ireland north is thankful for the ' trust ' that wales coach warren gatland has shown in him in recent weeks wales centre jamie roberts ( left ) runs with the ball during a training session at the vale hotel scrum - half rhys webb catches the ball in training ahead of saturday 's six nations showdown with ireland ' for me , it 's never a good point if the head coach is not happy with you , ' north said
' that is when you start getting dropped and stuff
' i felt that paris was a step forward for me to where i want to be in a welsh jersey , and hopefully on saturday i can push forward again and reward his trust
' north has only scored one try in his last seven tests - against fiji last november - but at the millennium stadium it is a strike - rate of seven touchdowns from 10 starts during the past 16 months
victory for wales this weekend would keep them in the six nations title mix heading for an appointment with italy in rome next week , but recent history suggests that ireland occupy the box - seat
they have beaten wales in each of the last two six nations campaigns , scoring an aggregate 56 points , while joe schmidt 's men are currently on an irish record - equalling run that has realised 10 successive test wins
north is tackled by england 's jonathan joseph ( left ) and anthony watson ( right ) during the six nations match ' if you look at ireland over the last couple of years in this fixture , they have just been clinical , ' north added
' over the past two years they have been very good at finishing games off
they take their chances when they can , and we have lacked that composure when it has come to the crunch
' they are 10 ( wins ) from 10 , which is unbelievable
' they have got a lot of confidence now , they execute their game - plan very well and they are a side that knows what they want to do and where they want to go , and everyone has bought into that ethos
' we do n't need to big the game up more than it is
it 's a massive game for ireland , going for the grand slam , and for us it will be a great test match here in cardiff
' north ( pictured here in 2014 ) will win his 48th cap for wales if he plays against ireland at the weekend wales , meanwhile , will be captained by flanker sam warburton for the 34th time as he overtakes ryan jones ' welsh record , and north said : ' it 's exceptional for sam warburton
' he is a quality player and leads from the front , and as a captain you can not ask for any more
' with someone like sam warburton it 's not necessarily what he says , it 's the actions he does
he is the kind of man who will never ask you to do something he would n't do himself
' in training , he is not someone who stands up and gives a 20 - minute speech and everyone gets up and starts screaming
' it 's more of a kind of chat that is to the point and is no more or no less than what it needs to be
' wales flanker sam warburton will captain his country for a record 34th time against ireland on saturday
