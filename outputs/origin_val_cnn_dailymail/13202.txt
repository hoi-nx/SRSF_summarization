germany investigators found antidepressants in the apartment of germanwings co-pilot andreas lubitz this week , according to published reports
die welt , a germany newspaper , cited an unidentified senior investigator who said andreas lubitz suffered from a severe " psychosomatic illness " and germany police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition
andreas lubitz suffered from a " severe subjective burnout syndrome " and from severe depression , the source told die welt
the new york times also reported that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment
cnn has not been able to confirm the reports
investigators continued to work saturday to piece together the secret life of andreas lubitz , who officials say was hiding an illness from his employers
he had been declared " unfit to work " by a doctor
they were expected to question his relatives , friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the seemingly competent and stable co-pilot to steer a jetliner into a mountainside on tuesday
as their efforts continued , dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town , digne-les-bains
there were 150 people on board germanwings flight 9525 , including andreas lubitz
relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site , in the village of le vernet
flowers have been laid there , in the shadow of the snow - covered peaks of the french
much attention has focused on andreas lubitz 's state of mind , with some media reports speculating that he may have had mental health issues
investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his dusseldorf , germany , apartment saying that andreas lubitz , 27 , was n't fit to do his job , city prosecutor kumpa said friday
the note , kumpa said , had been " slashed
" just what was ailing andreas lubitz has n't been revealed
the new york times and the wall street journal , citing unnamed sources , reported friday that andreas lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer
a subsequent new york times report on saturday , citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation , said andreas lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk
according to those unnamed officials , andreas lubitz also was being treated for psychological issues
other media reports indicate he was treated for depression
andreas lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014 , a germany aviation source told cnn
an official with lufthansa , which owns germanwings , said the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health , and that if andreas lubitz had vision problems that would have been discovered during the tests
" we ca n't believe it
if anything was wrong with his eyes during the physical exam we would have known , " the official says
the lufthansa official also said the company was never given any indication andreas lubitz was depressed , and that if he went to a doctor on his own he would have been required to self - report if he had been deemed unfit to fly
a dusseldorf clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently on march 10 , " concerning a diagnosis
" but the university clinic said it had not treated andreas lubitz for depression
germany investigators said they still have interviews and other work to do before they can reveal what they gleaned from the records found in the apartment and at his parents ' home in the town of montabaur
but the fact that investigators found " ripped , recent medical leave notes , including for the day of the offense , leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment , " prosecutors said
germanwings corroborated that assertion , saying it had never received a sick note from andreas lubitz
authorities left andreas lubitz 's apartment friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside
dusseldorf police said saturday that a small team of french investigators had arrived in the city and that they were sharing information
jean pierre michel , lead investigator for the french inquiry , told french tv from dusseldorf that the french team would work in " full transparency " with their germany counterparts
" we will interview people related to the investigation in the coming days
the hearings will be conducted in the coming days and weeks , " he said , according to cnn 's french affiliate bfmtv
asked by a journalist about reports of andreas lubitz 's possible mental illness , he replied : " the elements of the investigation are strictly confidential and we can not address these matters today
" no scenario can yet be ruled out , including mechanical failure , " as we do not have the necessary evidence , " he said
the germany tabloid newspaper bild said saturday it had interviewed an ex-girlfriend of andreas lubitz
the woman is not named in the story and cnn has not been able to verify the report independently
according to bild , the ex-girlfriend said andreas lubitz was a very nice and sensitive man who needed a lot of care and attention , and he was very troubled
she said he would get into fights with her
the newspaper also cited the ex-girlfriend as saying that andreas lubitz had bad dreams that his plane was going down
patrick sondenheimer was the pilot of germanwings flight 9525 , according to reiner sondenheimer of dusseldorf , germany , who says he is a relative of patrick sondenheimer 's
patrick sondenheimer is the pilot believed to have been locked out of the cockpit by his co-pilot , andreas lubitz
cnn spoke to reiner sondenheimer at his dusseldorf apartment
also at the apartment was a woman who did not provide her name but said she was patrick sodenheimer 's relative
that woman also said that patrick sondenheimer was on the doomed flight
reiner sondenheimer declined to say anything else , other than the family wanted time to grieve
the pilot has not been named by germany authorities
another germanwings pilot who once flew with andreas lubitz , woiton , told wdr , a local broadcaster belonging to cnn 's germany affiliate ard , that his impression of andreas lubitz was that he was " friendly " and that there was " nothing suspicious
" woiton also said andreas lubitz " was a good pilot and had a good command of the plane
" woiton 's first job after he found out about the crash was the route barcelona - dusseldorf -- the same route as had been taken by germanwings flight 9525 a day earlier
he was praised in germany media for the emotional announcement he made to passengers before takeoff , in which he said the crew , like everyone else on the plane , wanted to get home safely to their families
at the scene of the crash , two helicopters were being deployed above the mountainside by recovery crews saturday
the weather has improved after high winds friday made their complex task even more treacherous
lt. col. vialenc , a spokesman for the gendarmerie , told cnn there were about 40 officers at the crash site saturday
once at the crash site , recovery workers spend all day working there , he said
back in seyne-les-alpes at the end of the day , they can see a psychologist if they choose and have a debriefing session with all the workers
vialenc said the operations were going well so far and that the progress made was meeting their expectations
yves naffrechoux , captain of rescue operations at seyne-les-alpes , told cnn on friday that rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site , but few of them are intact
it could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered , identified and released to the families , authorities said
what could have prompted andreas lubitz to deliberately destroy the aircraft , killing everyone on board , remains the focus of investigators in germany
he had passed medical and psychological testing when he was hired in 2013 , said spohr , ceo of lufthansa , which owns germanwings
spohr also told reporters that andreas lubitz had " interrupted " his pilot training , which he began in 2008
that break lasted several months , he said , but added that such an interruption is n't uncommon
spohr did n't give a reason for the break
while the ailment lubitz had sought treatment for has n't been revealed , that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail , aviation analysts say
pilots are required to maintain their fitness to fly and must tell their airline if they 're found unfit , cnn aviation analyst david soucie said
who was co-pilot andreas lubitz ? although authorities have recovered the cockpit voice recorder , the flight data recorder remains missing
it could shed crucial details about what happened inside the cockpit , authorities say
andreas lubitz was the co-pilot on tuesday 's flight between barcelona , spain , and dusseldorf when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit , then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain
germanwings said the plane dropped for about eight minutes from its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet before crashing
the only sounds , authorities said , were those of pounding on the cockpit door , andreas lubitz 's steady breathing and , eventually , screaming passengers
andreas lubitz and 149 other people on board the plane died in an instant , authorities say
most were from germany and spain
