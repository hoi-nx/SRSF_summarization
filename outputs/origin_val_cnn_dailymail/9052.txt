motor neuron disease ( mnd ) is the name given to a group of diseases in which the nerve cells ( neurons ) controlling the muscles that enable us to move , speak , breathe and swallow undergo degeneration and die
motor function is controlled by the upper motor neurons in the brain that descend to the spinal cord ; these neurons activate lower motor neurons
the lower motor neurons exit the spinal cord and directly activate muscles
with no nerves to activate them , muscles gradually weaken and waste
mnd can affect a person âs ability to walk , speak , swallow and breathe
' my right hand is really bad so i ca nât undo buttons or press buttons
' ( and ) both my legs are pretty bad , ' jaime wild revealed
desperate to help her daughter , mum kate millar sprung into action , spending all hours of the day researching potential treatments and clinics
stem cell treatment is one of the most common ways to treat motor neuron diseases among sufferers , however is not available in australian due to inconclusive medical studies
kate came across a doctor called broeska , owner of regenetek research , offering clinical trials in stem cell treatment out of a clinic in india
however since then mr broeska 's medical qualifications have come under scrutiny by cbc and other news organisations , with some reporting that his medical degree is fake
' when wild was first diagnosed of course i went googling and searching for anything that i could come up with , ' kate told daily mail australia
here wild ( third from left in front row ) is pictured with her extended family jaime wild ( second left ) now has a trip to israel lined up which she leaves for in under two weeks , where she will undergo the first part of stem cell treatment to try and stall the onset of the mnd she said the doctor came highly recommended from another patient who had suffered from ms , and kate and her family were in frequent contact with mr broeska before he went underground with their money
' we transferred the first lot which was $ 24,000 australian dollars , two days later that âs when it all came out in the media questioning , ' kate said
she also revealed that since further revelations against the ' doctor ' , were aired , the canadian police have been involved to try and recover her money
after the first treatment option fell through , jaime wild 's family wanted to get moving to get her some more help as soon as they can
jaime wild now has a trip to israel lined up which she leaves for in under two weeks , where she will undergo the first part of stem cell treatment to try and stall the onset of the mnd
to raise funds for this treatment and her ongoing medical costs , her friends and family threw her a ' cinderella ball to remember ' at the weekend
wild and her husband , chris , on their wedding day
the couple have three children together organised primarily by her brother geoffrey , 30 , who is also her full - time carer jaime wild was almost lost for words as she described the evening
' it was amazing , all of it was just so surreal , i just sat there at the front just taking in every moment of the night , ' she said
decked out in a stunning white dress and arriving at the venue in a carriage , jaime wild described the moment she arrived at the ball to a red carpet awaiting her as ' incredible '
' when wild was first diagnosed , wild was in the closet one day crying and i was sitting on her bed and i thought what does every girl want to be , and i thought to be a princess , ' geoffrey revealed
' so we came up with the idea of the ball
' the ball was a great success and between that and boxing fight organised by a kind stranger called chris more than $ 26,000 has been raised , but to sustain the high level of treatment jaime wild needs the family needs more
' wild ca nât get any support from the government because her husband and her do own a small business , ' geoffrey said
' they âve gone from having three kids and two incomes to one income and still three kids plus wild âs medical expenses
' ' we literally take it five minutes at a time , i could come around here in the morning and wild ; âs having a bad day , ' geoffrey continued
' her life is just beginning , her and her husband have always been hard workers ' she âs done everything right she does nât smoke , she does nât drink ' it is unfair but me as wild âs brother i believe that if wild was supposed to be taken away from us she would have been
