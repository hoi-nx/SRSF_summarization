civil rights activist diane nash has said that she did n't participate in a march across the edmund pettus bridge in selma , alabama on saturday because of former president george w. bush
nash revealed her reason to opt out of the saturday event in an interview with newsone now
' i refused to march because george w. bush marched and was in the photograph , ' nash said
i think the selma movement was about non-violence and peace and democracy
' she continued , claiming ' and george w. bush stands for just the opposite , for violence , and war , and stolen elections
' newsone now reported that nash ' is widely considered the architect of many of king âs campaigns , and one of the only women in his inner circle
' tessa thompson played nash in the 2014 film selma , the website pointed out
nash was a leader in the freedom riders movement , having been one of the student nonviolent coordinating committee founders and the nashville student movement ride coordinator , pbs reported
nash recently told wls that she and james bevel , to whom she was married at the time , ' tried for several months to persuade king and andy young , who was the executive director of [ southern christian leadership conference ] at the time , to go into alabama on a voting project and we were not successful
' it always seemed to be some type of thing that needed to be done right away
so jim and i decided that he would take the car and some of his staff and start organizing
it was a big sacrifice for me because i was expecting a baby and had a toddler at the time
' she told the television station that the pair couple drafted the first plan for the selma voting rights movement after a 1963 church bombing which killed four children
nash told wls ' i never considered dr. king my leader
i always considered myself at his side and i considered him at my side
i was going to do what the spirit told me to do
so if i had a leader , that was my leader
' history : the events of ' bloody sunday ' prompted a follow - up march led by civil rights leader king that spurred the voting rights act
king is seen here at the march 26 , 1965 march in selma on saturday , president barack obama declared the work of the civil rights movement advanced but unfinished during a visit to the alabama bridge that spawned a landmark voting law
obama , the first black u.s. president , said discrimination by law enforcement officers in ferguson , missouri , showed a lot of work needed to be done on race in u.s. , but he warned it was wrong to suggest that progress had not been made
' fifty years from bloody sunday , our march is not yet finished , but we 're getting closer , ' obama said , standing near the edmund pettus bridge , where police and state troopers beat and fired tear gas at peaceful marchers who were advocating against racial discrimination at the voting booth
the event became known as ' bloody sunday ' and prompted a follow - up march led by civil rights leader king that spurred the voting rights act
' the u.s. who crossed this bridge , they were not physically imposing , but they gave courage to millions
they held no elected office , but they led a nation , ' obama said
' what they did here will reverberate through the ages ... because they proved that nonviolent change is possible
' after his remarks , obama and his wife michelle , daughters malia and sasha , and mother - in - law marian robinson joined some of the original marchers along with former president george w. bush and his wife , laura , to walk across the bridge
commemoration : obama is seen hugging rep. john lewis ( d-ga ) , who was at the ' bloody sunday ' march 50 years ago the marchers sang songs including ' we shall overcome ' as a crowd of some 40,000 people looked on
the anniversary comes at a time of renewed focus on racial disparities in the u.s. , including discrimination from police against black citizens nationwide
obama condemned the city of ferguson on friday for ' oppressive and abusive ' actions against black residents that were revealed in a u.s. justice department report accusing police and court officials of racial bias
on saturday , he criticized efforts to limit voting rights that have sparked a clash between republicans and democrats across the country
' right now , in 2015 , fifty years after selma , there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote
as we speak , more of such laws are being proposed , ' he said
' meanwhile , the voting rights act , the culmination of so much blood , so much sweat and tears , the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence ... stands weakened
' rev. raphael warnock , the 45 - year - old pastor of the atlanta church led by king at the height of the civil rights movement , lamented that the measure was now in limbo
' i 'm glad to see a parade of politicians here , but two years later we still are waiting on reauthorization of the voting rights act , ' he said
' you ca n't celebrate lessons of history from one period while standing on the wrong side of history today
' others reflected on how much had changed since the violence of a bygone era
' fifty years ago if we were standing here we would be surprised if a police officer did not beat us , ' said dick gregory , 83 , who was on the bridge 50 years before .
