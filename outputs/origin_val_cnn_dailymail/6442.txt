it was followed by paris , oslo , zurich and sydney in economist intelligence unit âs worldwide cost of living survey
london , in 11th place , is now as pricy as tokyo , which was the world âs most expensive city until it was unseated by singapore last year , while new york ranked as the most expensive american city in 22nd spot
the top five is unchanged from last year âs study , while european cities hold five spots in this year âs top 10

the chasm is even greater in central and eastern europe
kiev , for example , was dropped 38 places amid the ongoing conflict in eastern ukraine
given the slide in the russian rouble , moscow and st petersburg would rank in the bottom ten under current exchange rates
ten years ago sydney and melbourne were both cheaper than new york , a long - term rise in the relative cost of living in australia , driven by the strength of the country âs dollar , has pushed them up the list
sydney ( pictured ) and melbourne have climbed the list thanks to the strength of australia 's dollar a stronger dollar and localised inflation means new york , which jumped four places , is getting even pricier asian has seen a marked increase in the cost of living in the last 12 months , although japanese cities have dropped in the ranking thanks to deflation and a devaluation of the yen

the report âs editor , jon copestake , said in a statement : â the situation of an unchanged top five is very rare for the worldwide cost of living survey and disguises some significant global drivers that are impacting on the cost of living everywhere
â in fact , a look at the data six months ago would have shown a different top five , and things are changing quickly
rebasing the survey to today 's exchange rates would put zurich top , highlighting how fluid the global cost of living has become
