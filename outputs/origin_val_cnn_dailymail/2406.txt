if prescribed , the once - a - day tablet , called ibrutinib , could spare blood cancer patients the sometimes agonising side effects of traditional chemotherapy
ibrutinib is one of only a handful of new medicines to be made available via the cancer drugs fund after two trials in 28 british hospitals showed it to be extremely effective in treating both mantle cell lymphoma ( mcl ) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( cll )
professor devereux , consultant haematologist at king âs college hospital in london , says it is a new class of targeted medications , known as a bruton âs tyrosine kinase inhibitor
it works by targeting and switching off a protein in the cancer cells
â chemotherapy kills cancer cells but it also kills normal cells and therefore has lots of side effects , â he says
â as this drug is targeted at the b - cells , the side effects are minor
in addition , patients do nât have to go into hospital to have it administered
â about one in every 25 people will be diagnosed with blood cancer during their lifetime â that âs 25,000 people each year in the british
of these , 2,800 will have cll , the most common type of leukaemia , and 500 will have mcl , a rare type of b - cell lymphoma
for the time being , a course of ibrutinib â which costs up to Â£ 74,000 a year â will be prescribed only to patients whose disease does not respond to chemotherapy , or those who have relapsed following chemotherapy
but trials using the drug as a first - line treatment are also taking place
prof devereux says : â we âre looking forward to a chemotherapy - free future , although we âre not there quite yet
â this drug takes on an aggressive disease and makes it benign
it âs not a cure â these diseases are incurable â but it turns them into chronic conditions
we already know that it can work for several years â¦ the challenge to the nhs is cost
â if prescribed , the once - a - day tablet could spare blood cancer patients the sometimes agonising side effects of traditional chemotherapy

he says : â the new class of targeted drug therapies that pharmaceutical companies are currently developing , like ibrutinib , offer hope to many people with lymphoma â both in relation to the efficacy of the treatments and how well tolerated they are in terms of side effects
