' it 's a phenomenal achievement : i think he 's getting better with it even as the years go on , ' said cronin , as ireland look to home in on a second grand slam in six years this weekend
' but he 's the kind of player that , whenever he 's playing , he nearly makes you play better because that 's the enthusiasm , the passion , the physicality that he brings
' he kind of instils that in the players around him , it 's great to play under him
' he sets the standard and you 've got to get up there with him
' he 'll demand it off you one way or another , so it 's great to play with a person like that , because it raises your standards as well
' o'connell will equal mick galwey 's record as ireland 's oldest captain of all time on saturday o'connell will stride past a multitude of milestones in cardiff this weekend , as he aims to mark his 50th nations performance by setting ireland a new winning test run of 11 matches

cronin acknowledged the legend around o'connell bringing team - mates to tears with his unbridled pre-match passion - but admitted the munster stalwart 's rhetoric far more fearsome than emotive
the 35 - year - old is put through his paces during an ireland training session at the kingspan stadium ' i 've nipped out a couple of times to dot the eyes during his talks ! ' joked cronin of myths o'connell can invoke raw emotions
' no , but seriously , he scares me more than makes me cry to be honest with you
' he brings a certain level , you see him doing it , his intensity , physicality , attention to detail
' so when you see him doing that , you 're saying to yourself ' i need to get to that as well '
' if 15 or 23 lads get to that level , we 're hard to beat
' he 's similar to schmidt ( schmidt ) in some ways
' o'connell is n't going to get to the heights of test rugby that he has without hard work and accuracy
' he 's got great influence on the squad , the lads buy into that and he 's fantastic to have around
