knox âs family are rallying around her and trying to help her lead as normal a life as possible in the run up to the final decision by the court of cassation - italy 's highest court - in rome on friday
shortly before their walk , colin sutherland was seen carrying a bag of ice and two bags of shopping into the house , possibly supplies for a long and agonizing night waiting for the verdict
earlier on thursday , amanda â who in 2013 penned memoir waiting to be heard about the murder case and her four years in jail - was spotted with her fiance writing on a notepad in the backyard
the italy court is set to decide if it will uphold a 2013 ruling declaring knox and her former boyfriend , raffaele , guilty of the 2007 killing of the british exchange student
the decision was due on wednesday but has been delayed
and today , raffaele 's lawyer launched a last - ditch attempt to save his own skin and blow a hole in us 's defense
the former lover was compared to a ' forrest gump ' caught up in events beyond his understanding
knox and raffaele had originally been convicted in 2009 , but were acquitted in 2011 , allowing knox to fly back to her hometown in the us , although the verdict was then reversed in 2013
there are a number of possible outcomes to the trial : either both knox and raffaele will be found guilty , they will both be declared not guilty , one will be convicted but not the other , or the whole thing could go back for another round of appeal
even if the trial does end in a conviction , former judge mike heavey â who has long championed knox âs cause and become close to her family , even being invited to her wedding - says he feels there is little chance of her being extradited to italy for the 28 and a half year sentence she has been handed if convicted
earlier in the day , sitting in the afternoon sun , amanda calmly wrote in her journal in mom 's backyard if declared guilty , the decision to extradite amanda back to italy ultimately rests in the hand of president obama and secretary of state kerry speaking exclusively to daily mail online , he said : â i imagine it âs been very tense for [ the knox family ]
i âm optimistic the case will be dismissed and they âll be acquitted
â well respected scientists are coming in and debunking the dna evidence against them and public opinion [ in italy ] has gone from 90 % against to around 80 % for her
â raffaele was in court wednesday which is good
they never really aimed at raffaele , it âs always been amanda , amanda , amanda
very sexist , by the way , very anti-american
â but this has been a witch - hunt , as if it was salem , massachusetts , 1691
no different except that it goes global
â and it titillates a great percentage of people , they find is fascinating , this idea of a sex orgy gone wrong and two pretty girls that was originally put forward by the prosecution
â referring to the 2003 kidnapping and transportation to egypt of italy cleric abu omar by the cia and the subsequent conviction in absentia by an italy court of ex-cia operative robert seldon lady for that crime , he added : â there âs good reasons to dislike the us , we âve done a lot of bad things around the world , i can agree with a lot of their criticisms
ms kercher , a 21 - year - old student from coulsdon , surrey , was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in perugia in 2007
the house in perugia where british student meredith kercher was murdered aged just 21 in november 2007 raffaele is pictured leaving rome 's supreme court on wednesday as italy 's top judges delayed a ruling on whether to uphold his and amanda 's conviction for the murder of student meredith kercher meredith kercher is serving a 16 - year sentence for his involvement in kercher 's death after a separate trial â our cia kidnapped an islamic cleric , an italy citizen , and they ca nât get their minister of justice to ask the us for an extradition , they ca nât get it done , so they âre frustrated
â [ but in this case ] raffaele is collateral damage
if we confirm their convictions , we send an innocent italy man â and the people probably wo nât like that â to prison , and the [ italy ] minister of justice probably wo nât even ask for extradition , but even if he did are they going to pick a fight with the us on a false claim ? â the kidnapping of an italy citizen â that âs a legitimate claim and they still do nât want to take on the us
so are they going to take on the us on a b.s. claim ? â no. it âs a fraud , and everybody knows it and everybody is playing along
' if knox is declared guilty , the decision to extradite her back to italy ultimately rests in the hand of president obama and secretary of state kerry .
