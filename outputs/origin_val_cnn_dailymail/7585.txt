it is an english landscape of quintessential beauty , whose many shades of green contrast sharply with the red , loamy soil : a place of steep , broad hills and ancient stone churches , where magnificent open vistas stretch from the crags of dartmoor to the sea at dawlish
devon has inspired many writers , such as thomas hardy , michael morpurgo and sir arthur conan doyle
but today , one of its jewels , haldon ridge , in the heart of an officially designated area of great landscape value close to the dartmoor , is being desecrated
thanks to a company controlled by harry lopes , the former underwear model who is the son - in - law of the duchess of cornwall , running along the road at the top of the haldon ridge for close to a mile is the edge of a giant 50 - acre solar panel energy farm
they have now sold their interest to sister company belltown power
belltown and solstice share the same investor , berti investments , while â green â financier seth tabatznik is a director of all three firms
without the huge subsidies added to consumers â bills , the solar panel business would not be profitable
ms fearnley-whittingstall refuses to divulge how much solstice â in which mr harry lopes owns 115,000 shares - has been paid , saying this information is â commercially sensitive â
an internal report by the local council âs heritage and landscape officer , olwen maidment , described the solar panel development as â not sympathetic to the character of the locality â , warning that it would â detract from its scenic quality â
however , it was awarded planning permission late last year without ever being discussed by the council âs planning committee
on its website , lopes âs firm , solstice renewables , claims the farm â sits within its own bowl , largely hidden from the surrounding landscape â
in fact , seen from the air , it dominates it : a y - shaped hilltop sprawl with line after line of black , reflective panels on metal frames
as maidment âs report makes clear , the farm is visible from hay tor , a popular hiking and picnic spot ten miles away on dartmoor
the ranks of panels loom over ashcombe , a gorgeous village with water meadows and a grade i listed 13th century church
the ranks of panels loom over ashcombe , a gorgeous village with water meadows and a grade i listed 13th century church the ashcombe estate âs owner , rayner , refused to say yesterday how much he was being paid for the use of his land
his only comment was to complain that we had flown over the solar farm without seeking his permission
the solstice website makes much of a pledge , issued by sophy fearnley-whittingstall , to pay Â£ 6,500 a year for a â community benefit fund â for projects such as improved local internet connections
yet , next to the vast amounts the farm will rake in , most of it from subsidy , this pales into insignificance
the the mail on sunday asked john constable , director of the renewable energy foundation , a specialist think - tank , to compute the sums , given the panels â supposed output of 6.5 megawatts
he said : â the total annual income will be about Â£ 770,000 , of which about Â£ 430,000 a year will be from subsidy under the renewable obligation scheme , ie over 50 per cent of their annual income will be from subsidy
â this is about 60 times as much as might be expected as income from growing wheat
when the mail on sunday asked about the figures , mr harry lopes and sophy fearnley-whittingstall issued a statement
this referred only to the legality of the farm âs planning permission , adding that the site would eventually be surrounded by newly planted hedges
â once [ these ] have had a chance to grow in , no one will be able to see it , â the statement said
â not only is the solar park helping to cut carbon emissions and increase our energy security , it will result in a huge improvement in ecology and biodiversity , with the creation of habitats for nightjars and skylarks being just one example of measures that have been built into the design
â in maidment âs view , while planting hedges might reduce the impact , the site âs exposed and windy location meant the hedges were â unlikely to survive â
in the money : tom parker-bowles ( right ) at the races with his sister laura ( left ) and her mother the duchess of cornwall moreover , this large industrial project was completely at odds with the landscape , and â the panels will stand out from the surrounding green fields and be a focal point in views â¦ given the high scenic quality of the valley and sensitivity of the viewpoints along public footpaths and access land , the adverse effect on these views is considered significant
â the council planning committee never discussed or voted on the solar farm because the local ward member , lib dem alan connett , decided not to refer it â as he was entitled to do
the the monk of haldon of haldon never , i ween , has fairer scene â sapphire - blue and emerald - green , with the glow of the red red rock between , bathed in a glory of golden sheen , â gladdened your heart , or dazzled your een
there tarry a while , and gaze your fill , from berry head to portland bill ; or turn your face to the north if you will , where the dartmoor range lies gloomy and still , and i âll wager a crown when you get back to town , bright visions will haunt you of haldon hill
by r.h.d. barham , whose poem features haldon hill - where the solar farm now sits â i was content for the officers to deal with it , â he said
other councillors were more vociferous
â i was amazed when i saw how big it is , â said tory chris clarance
â i would very much have liked it to go to the committee
it is a scar on the landscape
â climate historian tony brown , who lives nearby , said : â that so much pristine countryside can be swallowed without anyone picking this up through the democratic process suggests the system has failed
we âve ended up with an eyesore when we have no need for it
â in october , environment secretary liz truss told this newspaper that large solar farms were â ugly , a blight on the countryside â
in the middle of the 19th century , the devonshire poet r. h. d. barham wrote the poem , the monk of haldon â part of which is reproduced on the right â describing the very spot where the farm , now nearing completion , lies
there is no fairer scene anywhere , he writes
on the ashcombe estate website , mr rayner describes himself and his family as â custodians â of its landscape
asked whether he thought the poet might have thought the solar farm added to its beauty , he again refused to comment
in an email response yesterday , sophy fearnley-whittingstall said : â overall this planning application received substantially more letters of support than objections
we believe the benefit to the public in the long run will outweigh any negativity
â an earlier version of this article has been amended to make clear that solstice renewables and harry lopes has sold its interest in the scheme to an associated company belltown power which will receive the green subsidies and has been responsible for construction
the article previously described the farm as â permanent â
in fact permission is for 25 years .
