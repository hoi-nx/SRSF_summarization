twelve years ago 24 photographers decided to carry out an ambitious project - to document a full new year 's day every year for 24 years
to begin with each was allocated one hour of the day to record what was going on around them
but the project did not stop there
this was a project that was to last 24 years , with each photographer progressing one hour every year , so that at the end of 24 years , there will be 24 sets of images from new year 's day - or 576 images

' to contrast with the chaos she took this picture of a couple in ' a calm embrace and in their own magic space ' the original 24 photographers met while studying on a postgraduate photography course at central st martin 's in london
six prints from this year 's project will be auctioned off in aid of hope and homes for children , an international charity working to ensure that all children have the chance to grow up in the love of a family
curator bridget coaker said : ' when i first heard about 24photography i thought what a great idea , i do hope they manage to keep the momentum going
now in its 12th year this group of dedicated photographers are still going out in all weathers and all hours to capture something that shows something of the first day of each new year
their commitment to the project is inspiring
' claire spreadbury , founder of 24photography , said : ' the exhibition is going from strength to strength and now in our twelfth year we 've really developed an identity and feel that we 're an established part of london 's art calendar
new year 's day is an exciting time of the year , and we hope that 24 captures some of that excitement , but also gives a little glimpse into the rest of the day after the celebrations and parties

a little bit tired , i was wondering what i could shoot and discussing about that with my room - mate laurent , we had the idea to play with the science skeleton belonging to my wife marion
a lot of scenes were tried in an self - portrait mode and at a moment , i decided to dance with the skeleton
getting older , 2015 is for me the step to the age of fourty
dancing with the death is an ironic reference for me , as if i was daring the death ' 06:00 by ali waggie â celestial watcher guardian angel : ' every night this constellation stands above us
he watches from on high , what has he seen , heard ? powerless to help as mankind destroys the earth below ' 07:00 by colin blackstock - the restless cries : ' hours earlier cheers and joyous voices welcomed a new year with champagne toasts and fireworks , the remnants of which line the banks of the river

and part of why i love this city ' 09:00 by sarah lucy brown â mono no aware : ' due to an unseasonably warm start to the winter , this delicate cherry blossom tree had flowered already

i decided to go to winter wonderland , in hyde park , to gauge the mood

at first it seemed romanians were the target ; but the charlie hebdo atrocity took things to a new level ; it became a blame game ; blame the immigrants , blame themuslims , blame the jews , blame somebody , for something
to my mind inclusiveness and diversity are things to be celebrated , not demonised ' 20:00 by helen chambers â quietways and superhighways : ' this picture was taken crossing london fields on the way back from seeing friends â¦ the day after the night before
