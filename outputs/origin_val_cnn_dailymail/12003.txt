the report highlighted the department 's practices , saying the city 's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department 's approach to law enforcement and the role of ferguson 's municipal court
it states : ' the ferguson municipal court handles most charges brought by the ferguson police department , and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice , or protecting the rights of the accused , but of maximizing revenue
