britain is set for a chilly start to the week with a cold air mass blowing from eastern europe bringing temperatures as low as -2c
after a crisp weekend in which parts of the britain saw freezing overnight temperatures , the tail end of a cold blast means spring will continue to be put on hold
clear skies at night will bring the coldest weather and will affect regions including east anglia , with areas of high altitude , such as the pennines , possibly seeing a dusting of snow
' it will be cloudy tonight with low temperatures of around 3c
monday will see a cool , cloudy , grey start with the easterly cold air mass easing a little
we expect to see temperatures of around 9c in the north of the country and it will be a touch warmer in the south
' monday night could be the coldest night of the week where the cloud clears and in places such as east anglia the temperature may fall to -2c
' throughout the week we 're going to see an increasing amount of sunshine
it will generally be quite dry and settled
' on tuesday and wednesday the temperature will move up to around 13c to 14c
it will still be just below average at night , but it 's fairly normal to get these variations in spring
' snow is possible only in the highest parts of the britain such as northwest scotland and the pennines , but as there wo n't be much precipitation this is unlikely
' on thursday the daytime temperature will be slightly cooler and drop back to around 10c
' weather this weekend was in stark contrast to the beginning of the month when the britain was warmer than rome and athens at a balmy 17.5c
forecast : the britain is set for a cold and cloudy beginning to the week but temperatures will to rise on tuesday and sunshine will increase thousands of sun - seekers were pictured flocking to brighton beach and london 's hyde park to welcome what they thought was the start of a new season
on friday a near total eclipse of the sun will be viewable from the britain but with cloudy weather predicted , people hoping to catch a glimpse of the spectacle may end up disappointed
if the skies remain clear , it will be the best solar eclipse the country has seen since august 1999 , with between 85 per cent and 95 per cent of the sun obscured
the northern and western isles of scotland will see greatest eclipse , with nearly 98 per cent of the sun obscured at its peak .
