the editor of film industry website deadline has apologized for an article about casting minorities on television that sparked fury last week
deadline editor mike fleming jr said in an interview on sunday that the article by co-editor andreeva titled ' the year of ethnic castings â about time or too much of good thing ? ' was not an accurate reflection of the site 's opinion and that they will strive not to make a similar mistake again
the article posted tuesday night deals with a surge this season in television shows depicting actors of a diverse background , but stipulates that it could be a ' trend ' that 's not sustainable
pictured above at an event in los angeles in november deadline : in the article , by andreeva , published tuesday , she wrote that though ethnic diversity in television is long overdue , ' the pendulum might have swung a bit too far in the opposite direction
' ' the only appropriate way to view racial diversity in casting is to see it as a wonderful thing , and to hope that hollywood continues to make room for people of color , ' fleming said sunday , adding that the mistake has been dealt with ' internally ' and that the website will ' do our best to make sure that kind of insensitivity does n't surface again '
rhimes , creator of ' grey 's anatomy , ' ' scandal , ' and ' how to get away with murder , ' was one of the many in hollywood to lash out about the article on twitter ' andreeva and i apologize deeply and sincerely to those who âve been hurt by this
it is important to us that deadline readers know we understand why you felt betrayed , and that our hearts are heavy with regret
we will move forward determined to do better , ' fleming said
the article caused controversy not only from the greater public at large , but by high - ranking members in the film industry - including african - american television writer and producer rhimes
the 45 - year - old creator of hit shows grey 's anatomy , scandal and how to get away with murder tweeted : ' 1st reaction : : hell no. lem me take off my earrings , somebody hold my purse ! 2nd reaction : article is so ignorant i ca n't even be bothered
' retweeters of rhimes ' post include actress garcelle beauvais , helena andrews , author and washington post journalist , ava duvernay , the director of ' selma , ' and more than 1,000 others
new yorker tv critic emily nussbaum , new york times culture reporter dave itzkoff , and the huffington post 's mo ryan also voiced concerned about the article
in the article , andreeva noted that though african - americans are the most ' loyal ' television viewers , the group only accounts for 13 per cent of the american population
' so ignorant ' : above , rhimes ' tweet following the facepalms ' tweeting ' horrible deadline article 's publishing last week she went on to say that ' grossly underserved ' african - american actors are being compensated , but said the growth in ethnic roles may have ' reached its peak
' additionally , she noted that other ' hot commodities ' are contributing to the trend , including ' occasional foreigners with that ' sparkle
'' on sunday , co-editor in chief fleming said that andreeva was looking at the uptick in diverse castings through a purely scientific lens and did n't realize how the work ethnic could come across as cold in her headline
' our writers , and editors , can be so focused on the trees they sometimes forget to look at the forest , or in this case , the readers who are much more than statistics
' a perfect storm of events left us vulnerable , including me choosing the worst time to be zonked from a 22 - hour return flight from new zealand , and normally smart editors on duty failing to respond decisively even after a torrent of hostile comments rolled in , ' fleming said
fleming said he decided to come forward and accept responsibility for the regrettable story after seeing how sony executive amy pascal fell from grace following the leak of embarrassing emails from her company late last year
' i do nât believe you can can make an unwise story disappear and pretend it did nât happen
i observed how amy pascal raced around with knee - jerk apologies to anyone who âd listen , after those stolen sony e-mails surfaced
her actions felt like panicked damage control to me ; we decided to face the consequences and take our lumps
we did that in the comment tail following that story , where over 700 readers teed off on us , ' fleming explained
