manchester united and skipper wayne rooney significantly boosted its own chances and delivered a probable knockout blow to tottenham hotspur 's hopes of champions league qualification with 3 - 0 home win sunday
first half goals from fellaini , carrick and wayne rooney effectively ended the epl match as a contest , with the win leaving manchester united in fourth spot , but only two points adrift of second - placed manchester city
tottenham hotspur is seventh , six points adrift of the top four
wayne rooney 's third after another piece of disastrous defending from the visitors led to an impromptu and topical goal celebration , which was certainly the main talking point
a national newspaper had posted a video on on social media sunday which appeared to show wayne rooney being felled by fellow epl footballer and former manchester united teammate phil bardsley as both donned boxing gloves for a " friendly " fight in his kitchen
after he had converted following a mistake by bentaleb , wayne rooney threw a few mock punches then keeled over backwards on to the old trafford turf
tottenham hotspur 's players and fans were probably the only people not to see the funny side , but the joke was on them , having gone into the match seeking a third straight away win at manchester united and five games unbeaten against the red devils
from manchester united first significant attack on nine minutes , an unmarked fellaini was found by carrick and the belgian international beat hugo lloris with a low shot
fellaini caused chaos in the tottenham hotspur defense for the second with carrick left free to head home from distance

the victory eases the pressure on manager louis van gaal and his expensively assembled side after some lackluster recent performances and last monday 's disappointing fa cup exit to arsenal
it meant tottenham hotspur , off the back of two straight wins and with harry kane in top form , was favored going into the crucial match , but the young striker barely had a glimpse of goal , until having his side 's first shot on target after fully 88 minutes as manchester united dominated
earlier , chelsea extended its lead at the top of the epl to six points but was held 1 - 1 at home to saints in another less than convincing performance from jose mourinho 's team
off the back of a disappointing champions league exit to paris saint germain , chelsea again struggled to find its best form at stamford bridge despite going in front from diego costa 's 18th league goal

chelsea found fraser forster hard to beat and the visiting goalkeeper made fine saves from oscar , eden hazard and juan cuadrado to deny the leaders three points
however , it has a commanding lead plus a game in hand over chasing manchester city , which lost 1 - 0 to burnley saturday , in a severe blow to hopes of retaining the title
in sunday 's other epl clash , everton eased its relegation fears with a 3 - 0 win over newcastle , who had fabricio coloccini sent off for a foul on aaron lennon , who is on loan at goodison from tottenham hotspur
in la liga , gareth bale snapped a recent lean spell of scoring form with both goals as real madrid beat levante 2 - 0 in the bernabeu
the record signing struck first in the 17th minute when ronaldo 's acrobatic effort was cleared off the line and the welshman scored the rebound
the same combination was at work for the second in the 40th minute with ronaldo 's strike helped into the visiting net by gareth bale
ronaldo might have added to the tally and missed several opportunities but real madrid was never threatened by levante and eased to the three points
it leaves them a point adrift of barcelona ahead of next weekend 's el clasico , which could go a long way to determining the title race .
