a woman , who was ' red in the face and wheezy ' was left to die on a grassy bank by her partner who instead went searching for magic mushrooms
however an inquest into the death of athanassiou , from wellington , turned up no concrete cause of death , it was revealed
the lack of information about the circumstances in which she died is partly due to the fact the 39 - year - old 's long - term partner johnston initially refused to disclose some details , the nz herald reported
athanassiou ( pictured ) , 39 , from wellington , wellington , died on july 9 , 2012 ms athanassiou was found dead in bushland above wellington east girls ' college on july 9 , 2012 , but a post-mortem examination did not determine the cause of death
mr johnston was interviewed about his partner 's death , and despite witnesses placing him at the scene he denied being in the area
then in a follow - up interview , the man said he felt obliged to tell the truth and revealed he had left ms athanassiou wheezing and unwell when he went to search for magic mushrooms
her body was later discovered near where he had last seen her laying unconscious , before he left her again after alerting people nearby she was in need of help
she was found dead in bushland above wellington east girl 's college after being left ' red and wheezy ' by her partner who went hunting for magic mushrooms mr johnston is said to have left her side as he did not want to be ' busted ' for having drugs in his possession , according to the nz herald
the first person to reach ms athanassiou described her skin and being grey , and believed the woman was dead
mr johnston said he told people in the area to call for help for her , before he left
corner evans said at the inquest that the deceased lead a ' sad and somewhat lonely life ' , and ' the circumstances of her death leave many questions unanswered
' these unanswered questions are primarily due to mr johnston refusing to disclose what he was doing between 9am and 11am when ms athanassiou was found
' at the time he left his partner , mr johnston knew that members of the public were arranging for emergency help
ms athanassiou was left to die alone , ' mr evans said , before adding the police file into her death would be left open .
