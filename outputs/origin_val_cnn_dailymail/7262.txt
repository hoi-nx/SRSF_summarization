gwyneth paltrow 's lifestyle website goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again , this time to pregnant women
according to ms gwyneth paltrow 's osteopath - self - described pain expert vicky vlachonis , who penned ' ten ways to have a pain - free pregnancy ' for goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to ' relax their vigilance over food ' , and to always ' remind ' themselves : ' you do nât need a ton of food to sustain your baby
' ms vicky vlachonis ' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - ' dairy , rich fatty meats , pork , peanut butter , wheat and sugar , for example ' - is very much in keeping with ms gwyneth paltrow 's strict diet , so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health - focused website
' but while a number of the tips offered up in the piece â such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet â have been welcomed by health experts , dr. salber , an internist and the author of popular advice site , thedoctorweighsin.com , tells daily mail online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of goop âs advice
' although not as " sexy " as " anti-inflammatory diets " and " magical cures " , common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy , ' she says of the website âs top tips
and when it came to ms vlachonic âs suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a â magical cure â for morning sickness â while other foods like wheat , dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation â dr salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims
' i am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation , let alone any evidence to support it , ' dr salber remarks
' most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates , crackers for example , help with the nausea
' glowing : in keeping with ms gwyneth paltrow 's strict diet , ms vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid ' dairy , rich fatty meats , peanut butter , wheat and sugar '
pictured , ms gwyneth paltrow pregnant with her daughter apple in 2004 ms vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the ' pressure ' caused by the growing baby on a mother - to - be 's back , and warns against lower back massages
' pregnant women should n't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy , ' counters dr salber
' remember women 's pelvis ' evolved to a different shape than men 's because we become pregnant
' as for diet , dr salber recommends a variety of ' fruits , vegetables , whole grain cereals , and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat '
she does concur with ms vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should ' watch their portion size ' however , and recommends ' avoiding fast foods , overly processed foods , and sugared sodas '
one of us : while critics have dubbed her out of touch in recent years , ms gwyneth paltrow , pictured last week in hong kong , recently insisted she was ' incredibly close to the common woman ' in regards to recommended weight gain , dr salber admits : ' there is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy
' it depends on whether you are normal , over , or underweight to start with
' ' normal weight women should gain between 25 - 35 pounds , underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds , and overweight between 15 - 25 pounds
obese women should gain slightly less , between 11 - 20 pounds
other kernels of advice offered up by ms vlachonic in her recent goop post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day , and plenty of time spent in the ' bathtub , a pool , or the sea
' she even helpfully suggests : ' the crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you âre pregnant ! ' repeat offender : goop ( pictured ) often comes under fire for handing out questionable health advice , not to mention outrageously expensive products this is far from the first time goop has been criticized for its questionable health advice
in january , ms gwyneth paltrow came under fire for suggesting women partake in ' vaginal steams ' , which she said ' cleanse your uterus ' and ' balance female hormone levels '
this information was slammed by doctors , some who even suggested the practice might be harmful
just this week , ms gwyneth paltrow defended herself in the face of long - standing criticism surrounding goop 's expensive and unattainable content
speaking to cnn money , she said : ' i 'm incredibly close to the common woman in that i 'm a woman and i 'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers
' we all want fulfillment , we all want to live our best lives
we want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life
i think that 's all women
