mcgugan would be open to signing a permanent deal at sheffield wednesday after manager stuart gray helped â put a smile â back on his face
the attacking midfielder is on loan from watford and has a decision to make in the summer , with one year left on his vicarage road contract
mcgugan has scored three times and made four assists in his last eight games , setting up two goals in the dramatic late win at rotherham on saturday
mcgugan has impressed during his loan spell at sheffield wednesday in recent weeks mcgugan in action for watford last season â if sheffield wednesday and watford can do a deal , then brilliant , but it âs up to the clubs
i can only concentrate on playing well on the pitch , â mcgugan told sportsmail
â at this point in time i âm playing week in week out , i have a smile back on my face , and that âs the most important thing
â the manager has been fantastic for me , really straight
you know exactly what he wants from you
he gives you the platform to go out and perform and it âs up to you to repay the faith
â mcgugan says his spell at hillsbrough has refreshed his enjoyment for the game after a difficult period at watford under five different head coaches since joining in july 2013
he joined on a free from boyhood club nottingham forest and scored 11 goals in 37 games in his first season â but gianfranco zola âs departure in december of that campaign altered the scene
giuseppe sannino came in before resigning last august sparking three changes in quick succession
oscar garcia was forced to vacate the role on grounds of ill health after four games , billy mckinlay was sacked after two , and slavisa jokanovic has since steered watford into automatic promotion contention
â it was a chance to go and play under gianfranco zola which was a massive pull for me , â said mcgugan
mcgugan says he went to watford to play under gianfranco zola but was ' shocked ' after the italian left playing time limited , he made his first loan move to wednesday last november and signed again in the winter window
â i could have easily sat there and seen what happens but you know when you âre not really in someone âs plans and i want to play football , â he said
â knowing this manager has 100 per cent faith in me to go out and perform can only build confidence
hopefully i can have a strong end to the season and see what happens
' a number of clubs may be interested in mcgugan come summer , and he did not rule out a switch back to nottingham forest â even if sanctions limit his former club to loan deals
â you never say never , â he said
â nottingham forest was a massive part of my life and career
i made my debut at 17 and i left at the age of 24
it âs where i âm from
but the most important thing i can do is concentrate on performing
â mcgugan has refused to rule out a return to former club nottingham forest in the summer
