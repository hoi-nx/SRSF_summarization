durst , who recently featured in the hbo documentary ' the jinx : the life and deaths of durst , ' must remain in louisiana on weapons charges until his next court date on april 2 , magistrate judge cantrell ruled , finding him a likely flight risk and a potential danger to others
durst 's lawyer , dick deguerin , did not seek bail but argued his client 's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier this month in new orleans were improper , and that investigators wrongly interviewed him without counsel present
durst 's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to los angeles county , where he has been charged with the 2000 murder of longtime friend susan berman and could face the death penalty
the hbo documentary broadcast durst being presented with evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of susan berman 's likely killer
the 71 - year - old durst 's voice was subsequently captured on a microphone saying that he had ' killed them all
' long a suspect in the disappearance of his wife , kathleen durst , in 1982 in new york , durst was acquitted in the dismemberment killing of his neighbor in texas in 2003

fbi agents arrested durst over fears he would flee the country , the agency has said
durst , long estranged from his powerful family with its major new york real estate holdings , appeared in court on monday with his head shaved , revealing a long scar on the right side of his head
he was being held in a prison psych ward in new orleans where officials have deemed him a suicide risk
o'hern , an investigator for the local district attorney 's office , testified that authorities tracked durst down after he placed two calls from a phone at the hotel to the voicemail on his personal phone
also in his room was a scribbled tracking number for a package that authorities later seized , which contained $ 117,000 , o'hern said
former westchester county district attorney jeanine pirro , who reopened an investigation in 2000 into the disappearance of durst 's wife , was also in court
durst 's attorney asked her to be removed from the courtroom as a potential witness
cantrell allowed pirro , now a fox news host , to stay
