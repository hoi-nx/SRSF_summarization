a weasel proved that it is more of a handful than a mouse when it prevented its owner from playing on his computer
recording the encounter at home , the video maker waits poised with his hand on the computer mouse as the little mammal named ozzy watches
after flicking his thumb a few times he gets the weasel âs attention and invites the onslaught from his cute and cuddly attacker
the intrigued weasel comes over to its owner after he twiddles his thumb in the hope of getting its attention diving at his thumb , the weasel rolls underneath it and begins nibbling on it as it curls itself up into a ball
before retreating , looking around and repeating the process â this time clinging on to the thumb
spinning onto its back , ozzy casually looks at the camera and bares its teeth before flipping back onto all fours with great agility and attacking the man âs hand once more
seconds out , round one ! the weasel feels out its opponent 's thumb before springing into action retreating behind the computer âs speaker , the weasel runs back and forward in between its rough - and - tumble
before momentarily choosing to ignore the thumb and come right up to the camera to stare down its lens curiously
after more of the same , ozzy runs off behind the keyboard and the video maker is left twiddling his fingers
the cute and cuddly attacker rolls onto its back while enjoying some rough - and - tumble with its owner according to the owner , the weasel is fully grown and always in the mood for fun and games
but , writing on his youtube channel , he also noted that weasel âs should not be considered pets
he wrote : â they hate being locked up , they 're not friendly when hungry
ozzy is a special case rescue baby
â rolling onto its back , the weasel takes a break from fighting to look down the camera and bare its teeth the least weasel , as ozzy 's type is known , is native to eurasia , north america and north africa , though it has been introduced elsewhere
despite the mammal âs small size , it has the capability of killing a rabbit five to ten times its own weight
and a mouse ( and a thumb ) is clearly no match for it either
the adorable animal has become so popular on youtube , its owner has even set up a facebook page in honour of ozzy the weasel , complete with videos , pictures and updates
the weasel called ozzy latches onto its owner 's thumb and begins giving it a little nibble
