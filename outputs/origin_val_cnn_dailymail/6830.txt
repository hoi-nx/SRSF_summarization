â the information actually comes from a database of companies such as magazine subscriptions , finance companies , insurance companies , as well as then holiday companies , people that buy mail order

mrs joanne clayton would not meet our reporter in person because , she said , she was out of the country
instead , she spoke in a follow - up meeting on the internet call programme skype , waving , smiling and giving thumbs up during discussions about medical data
she spoke from what appeared to be a mobile home
mrs joanne clayton explained : â different ailments â it could be people that have bought mobility products from a catalogue
â even if they âve gone on holiday and they âve ticked to say that they are needing mobility
â asked who buys this data , she replied : â people that are selling beds or selling mobility scooters or them types of products
â but she was happy to sell the same data to the mail âs fake pensions firm to target disabled pensioners with investment cold calls
she sold 3,000 of these records to an undercover reporter with no checks on the mail âs supposed firm
had she done any due diligence she would have found that it was not a registered or regulated company at all
the cost was Â£ 576 â just 16p per record plus vat
thousands of people are thought to have been scammed over the phone ( file picture ) later it emerged that mrs joanne clayton had no idea whatsoever where the data had come from
in an email about the information to controversial data firm b2c data , which was passed on to the mail , she wrote : â i âm guessing you have provided all of these
â b2c data insisted it had not provided the records
in a follow up call with the undercover reporter , she was asked if she knew which companies supplied the mobility data
â no , i do nât know , â she admitted
â even the list owner has got an agreement
â if i turn round to their staff and say please can you tell me which specific company , they âll turn round and says that they do not know
they âre not allowed to give that information out
â when confronted with the mail âs evidence , mrs joanne clayton denied any wrongdoing
â we are a reputable data broker which supplies data legally , â she said
she claimed she had done â nothing illegal â by selling the data , which contained only the names of those who had opted in to having their details passed on .
