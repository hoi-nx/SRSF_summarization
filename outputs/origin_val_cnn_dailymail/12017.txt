a primary school headteacher has banned pupils from watching this friday 's solar eclipse on health and safety grounds
in a letter sent to parents , paul rooke claimed new machar school in aberdeenshire would not take ' risks around pupil safety and wellbeing ' during this friday 's rare cosmic event
parents have spoken out about the overzealous measures , suggesting the children should be given the chance to see the phenomenon - but the school says the protective glasses are not suitable for children under ten
ban : new new machar school in aberdeenshire , above , will not allow children to watch the eclipse on friday in mr paul rooke 's letter , he wrote : ' it is with disappointment that i need to advise you that we will no longer be purchasing the solar eclipse glasses and viewing the eclipse as a school
' this is after further careful consideration of the health and safety advice , alongside guidance from aberdeenshire 's health and safety colleagues
' clearly the school will never take any risks around pupil safety and wellbeing
i do hope you understand my decision
' staring directly at an eclipse carries the risk of permanent damage or even blindness unless specialist lenses or devices are used
although the moon is expected to block out 98 per cent of the sun 's light , even staring at the remainder of it for too long can cause irreparable damage to the eye
mr paul rooke referred to an online report which suggested the protective glasses may be too big to be worn securely by children , and that children under ten should only watch the eclipse on tv or with an indirect viewer
the partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on friday , march 20 , and will be visible for thousands of kilometres parents of the pupils at newmachar primary in aberdeenshire said they were disappointed they would miss out on witnessing the phenomenon , which will not reoccur in uk until 2026
one parent , euan pittendreigh , said : ' it just seems like a little bit too much political correctness
' i understand that it 's for the kids ' safety , but if the glasses fit my kids correctly i 'd let them see it
' another father , derek mathers , added : ' it 's a shame
my daughter kirsty was looking forward to seeing the eclipse , but the school has got to put safety first really
' maria walker , aberdeenshire 's director of education and children 's services , said : ' schools will decide individually on activities to watch the eclipse and will do so safely
' the last solar eclipse of a similar size took place on 11 august 1999 and had an eclipse magnitude of 1.029
an eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the sun 's diameter obscured by the moon
it is based on a ratio of diameters and differs from an eclipse obscuration , which is a measure of the sun 's surface area covered by the moon
the value given is taken at the moment when the eclipse is at is maximum
the maximum of two minutes and 23 seconds of totality for the 1999 eclipse occurred close to ramnicu valcea in romania
it was said to have been the first total eclipse visible in europe since 22 july 1990 , and the first visible in the uk since 29 june 1927
local councillor fergus hood added : ' some might say this is health and safety gone mad but i think the school is doing the right thing to protect the children 's eyesight
' new new machar is not the first school to make the ruling
whitchurch primary school in cardiff said it will not let children watch the natural display outside , even if they have bought special glasses with solar filters
instead , the primary school will show the eclipse on a live feed inside the school premises
the decision came following an email which was reportedly sent to the schools by cardiff council
the memo advised schools to read a leaflet from the royal astronomical society on how to observe an eclipse safely
the partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on friday , march 20 , and will be visible for thousands of kilometres
it will be the first time that the astronomical spectacle has occurred during rush - hour in the uk , and there are fears that motorists may take their eyes off the wheel to watch the cosmic alignment
experts have warned that drivers may be dazzled as they watch the sun or risk a crash simply by letting their concentration falter
the proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near - total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the uk , so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in london , manchester will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in glasgow , aberdeen and edinburgh
the most ' complete ' eclipse in the uk will be see from lerwick in the shetland isles
timeings will vary , so that in london , the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will begin at 8.24am
the eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. by 10.41am , the moon will leave the sun 's edge and the partial eclipse will end
astronomer gemma lavender from all about space magazine do you need special equipment to look at the eclipse ? ' it 's all too easy to look at the sun when an eclipse is happening , but you should never look at the eclipse with naked eyes , binoculars or a telescope without filters - otherwise you run the risk of permanently damaging your eyesight
' that 's not to say that you ca n't watch the eclipse on friday - but you should ensure that you have the right equipment that will provide you with the right amount of protection
many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse - they can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers ' dedicated telescopes such as solar telescopes can allow you to observe the eclipse with absolutely no risk
however , unless you already own one , know somebody who does or are looking to get into solar astronomy , they can be a massive investment of several hundred pounds
' there are cheaper ways to observe the eclipse , though
' are solar glasses fine to use ? ' many people buy solar glasses or viewers to watch the eclipse
these can be bought quite cheaply from telescope dealers
' they work by employing a mylar film that blocks out over 99 per cent of the sun 's light , allowing you to view the eclipse safely
' before using them though , you should make sure that they are not damaged in any way and you should ensure that you have bought them from a reputable dealer
if you 're in doubt , do n't use your viewers at all
