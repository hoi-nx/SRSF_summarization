after a raucous davis cup victory over the usa , great britain must now decide which surface will give them the best chance of upsetting the french in the quarter - finals
as the home side , gb can choose the venue for the july 17 clash against last year 's runner - up
it is tempting to stick with the indoor hard court in glasgow where the local fans created a tremendous atmosphere last weekend , but , in this case , the grass is greener
murray has a good record on hard courts against french 's fearsome quartet of gasquet , gael monfils , gilles simon and jo-wilfried tsonga , winning 18 and losing five
but on grass , he has been totally dominant , unbeaten against all four in six matches
murray celebrates during his straight sets win over john isner that clinched the brits a quarter - final place the great britain team celebrate their 3 - 2 victory over the usa in glasgow last weekend doubles team jamie murray ( left ) and dom inglot have both experienced success on grass courts against gasquet and jo-wilfried tsonga in particular , murray can draw on the memories of some famous victories on the lawns
in 2011 the 27 - year - old beat tsonga in the final of the aegon championships at queens
he also defeated the world no 13 in the wimbledon semi-finals on the way to lifting the trophy in 2012
and it was a 2008 last - 16 win against gasquet on centre court that made the nation realise that this wild - haired scot had something very special
a 21 - year - old murray stormed back from two sets down to win 5 - 7 , 3 - 6 , 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 4
there is more good news for the doubles players
julien benneteau has reached 17 doubles finals but none have been on grass
nicolas mahut has won a tournament on the grass of newport in 2013 , but all of his other seven titles have come on an indoor hard court like glasgow
murray beat french jo-wilfried tsonga on grass in the 2012 wimbledon semi-finals the french team of edouard roger-vasselin , julien benneteau , gael monfils , gilles simon and nicolas mahut celebrate after their win against germany in frankfurt great britain 's pair of jamie murray and dominic inglot , meanwhile , have thrived on grass
the scot has one title and two finals appearances on the green stuff , and the englishman won at eastbourne last year
so gb should forgo the cauldron of the emirates arena in glasgow for the more sedate lawns of nottingham or eastbourne , assuming the wimbledon grass will not have had time to recover .
