suspected taliban gunmen have brutally murdered a pakistan former lawyer who represented the doctor that helped the us track down al-qaeda leader bin laden
senior police officer khan said unidentified assailants shot and killed afridi this morning in the northwestern city of peshawar before fleeing the scene
although the pakistan taliban have not yet claimed responsibility , they are considered the most likely candidates for an attack that took place close to the border with afghanistan , in the terrorist organisation 's heartland and just over 100 miles from bin laden 's abbottabad compound
the doctor was convicted in may 2012 of ' conspiring against the state ' by giving money and providing medical treatment to militants , not for helping the cia track down bin laden
afridi left pakistan in november after receiving threats from taliban militants
investigating officer khan says the lawyer recently came back from abroad , adding that the motive for the killing was not immediately known
the murder came on the same day as pakistan officials executed 12 people in the country 's single - largest day of executions since a moratorium on the death penalty was lifted in december

prime minister nawaz sharif lifted the moratorium on december 17 , a day after pakistan taliban gunmen attacked a school and killed 134 students and 19 adults
the killings put pressure the government to do more to tackle the islamist insurgency and the current wave of executions are a continuation of pakistan 's crackdown on the taliban
authorities at different jails in the country 's largest province of punjab today hanged 10 people who had been sentenced to death in murder cases , said the provincial home minister shuja khanzada
he said authorities planned to execute more convicted criminals in the coming weeks , adding : ' we have started a process , and it will continue
' the superintendent of the main jail in the southern port city of karachi , qazi nazir , said they executed two convicted murderers and handed their bodies over to their families
late last year , pakistan 's prime minister lifted the death - penalty moratorium specifically for terror - related cases after the december taliban attack on a school in peshawar killed 153 people , most of them children
last week , in a controversial step , the government completely lifted the death - penalty ban for all cases
human rights groups estimate pakistan has roughly 8,000 prisoners on death row .
