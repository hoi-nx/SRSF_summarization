dennis , the mclaren chairman , has apologised for the confusion over alonso âs condition , and predicted that the spaniard would race again in malaysia a fortnight on sunday
at a dinner in melbourne ahead of the opening grand prix in australian this weekend , dennis set the record straight after saying erroneously that alonso was not concussed in an accident in testing in barcelona on february 22
dennis said : â it was not the best performance by me
i understand why the press beat me up - for being inaccurate
i wanted to be open and honest
dennis apologised for saying alonso was n't concussed when he crashed in testing last month italian alonso had an accident during in testing for mclaren in barcelona on february 22 â i failed
but it is , as always , my objective to try to be as honest as possible in the future
â there are complexities about concussion
it is difficult to quantify , and it goes beyond my area of expertise
it is not my decision whether he will race in malaysia , but as far as i know he will be there
i have every reason to believe he will be
â i spoke to alonso on the way to this dinner
â he wants to race in malaysia
i hope he does , but it is his decision , not mine
â alonso , here being wheeled away from the crash site , says he wants to race in the malaysia grand prix mclaren boss dennis relayed alonso 's desire to race a fortnight from sunday and says it 's the driver 's choice meanwhile formula one âs penchant for chaos was never better demonstrated than in a bizarre court case unfolding just down the road from the albert park track that will host sunday âs race
at issue is whether a dutch driver called giedo van der garde should drive for sauber
subject to an appeal in melbourne on thursday , he will win that right - a decision that could even mark the end of sauber âs participation in the sport after 22 years
this pickle came about after sauber seemingly reneged on a contract that said van der giedo van der garde would race for them this season
they instead hired two drivers , brazilian felipe nasr and sweden âs marcus ericsson , who between them bring Â£ 20million to the team
but van der garde went to the court of arbitration for sport in lausanne , clutching his contract
dutch driver giedo van der garde has taken sauber to court claiming his right to drive for the team they found in his favour , a ruling that was upheld by the supreme court of victoria here on wednesday
sauber decided to appeal , the result of which is expected on thursday
the team âs lawyers argued that - only days away from this weekend âs race - installing a different driver was an unacceptable safety risk
they said the cars had been fitted to the specifications of felipe nasr and ericsson
rodney garratt qc told the court that the absence of the correct seatbelt meant van der giedo van der garde could not compete safely given the 210mph speed of the cars and g - forces â up to five times their bodyweight â
in truth , sauber âs argument was melodramatic rubbish
even if they need to make some late changes , why is it less safe to let van der giedo van der garde drive than merhi , who was only named as manor âs driver on tuesday ? merhi has never driven the manor car
it only passed its crash test last week
sauber 's marcus ericsson ( left ) and filipe nasr wait to se if they will drive in melbourne this weekend and van der garde , 29 , was even sauber âs test driver last year
no , sauber can not afford to drop felipe nasr , who is backed by banco do brasil , or ericsson , who brings in a sponsorship package worth Â£ 10million
much of the pair âs money has been paid up front
those backers would not react kindly to being told their man is suddenly out of a job
one solution would be van der giedo van der garde agreeing to receive compensation , but it is said he would prefer to get the drive rather than the money
however , even this is illogical because without sauber âs two high - paying drivers the whole team could be forced into administration , meaning therefore , he would have nobody to drive for .
