as romantic comedy pretty woman celebrates its 25 - year anniversary this week , the film 's scriptwriter has revealed that the iconic fairy - tale ending could have been very different
the 1990 film , which is set in los angeles , sees julia roberts as vivian , a down - on - her - luck prostitute who agrees to become a one - week escort for wealthy businessman , edward , played by richard gere
the much - loved movie ends with the improbable pair going off in the sunset together - yet the original ending was more realistic and was intended to reflect his story 's ' dark and gritty ' tone
in the original script , edward is seen to patrol around intentionally looking for a prostitute american screenwriter lawton , who penned the original script , which was called $ 3000 for the amount edward agrees to pay vivian for a week of her company , revealed in an interview with vanity fair that : ' the tone and ending are completely different
' most notably , in lawton 's original script vivian and edward do not find true love together
indeed , pretty woman 's cinderella ending that sees edward as a modern - day knight in shining armour , who ' rescues ' vivian from her apartment block would have been completely different
instead , lawton says : ' the film ends with kit [ vivian 's prostitute friend ] and vivian on a bus bound for disneyland ... with kit anticipating a fun day financed by vivian 's week with edward , as vivian ' stares out emptily ahead
'' this dismal ending was just one of the many changes that happened
lawton 's script also portrayed vivian as a drug addict and the six pages include focus on her locking down a deal to buy crack cocaine
the original script dictates that pretty woman ends with vivian and kit on a bus bound for disneyland as vivian ' stares out emptily ahead '
there is no ' knight in shining armour ' scene for vivian ( pictured ) in the original script , vivian is a helpless drug addict that must use prostitution to fund her crack addiction upon clocking the original script , even julia roberts described it as , ' a really dark and depressing , horrible , terrible story about two horrible people
she said : ' my character was this drug addict , a bad - tempered , foulmouthed , ill - humored , poorly educated hooker who had this weeklong experience with a foulmouthed , ill - tempered , bad - humored , very wealthy , handsome but horrible man and it was just a grisly , ugly story about these two people
' the lead characters ' adorable meeting on hollywood boulevard is no romantic affair either
the film 's version portrays edward comically and clumsily unable to drive his borrowed sports ' car and stopping to ask for directions from a chirpy vivian , who thinks he 's a potential customer
in the original script , edward is very much looking for a prostitute when he stumbles upon vivian pretty woman stars reunited on nbc show this morning , left to right : hector , laura san giacomo , director marshall , presenter matt lauer , julia roberts and richard gere pretty woman ! the original scriptwriter has admitted that the ending could never have stayed the same ' dark and gritty ' way once the film was cast , as richard gere and julia roberts ' just light up with each other ' the iconic shopping scene where vivian is given edward 's card and goes on a limitless shopping spree never happens in the original script in the film , richard gere 's character edward is constantly looking out for vivian and even enlists the help of shop assistants to help her with her new wardrobe
in the original script he never tries to protect julia roberts 's character vivian
he instead cruelly offers her up to his friend as if she were just a possession and magical shopping scene , with the soundtrack of roy orbison 's catchy pretty woman ? it never happens
the moment where edward defends vivian 's honour by hitting his sleazy friend stucky - who assaults her in edward 's hotel suite - is also a missing component in the original script
instead edward demeans vivian and offers her up to his friend as if she were a possession : ' you want her ? i do n't mind
you want to try her ? ' while the last words that the couple ever say to each other in the first script are definitely more than a little depressing
rather than defend her from his sleazy friend , the script sees edward offer vivian up like a piece of meat the movie version sees vivian having the confidence to gun for a relationship with the businessman before taking off to start a new life off the streets
inspired by her , he jumps into his white limo to declare his undying love , asking , ' so what happens after he climbs up and rescues her ? she replies : ' she rescues him right back
' they then kiss passionately on the fire escape as the credits roll
in the unrevised story , edward is supposed to drag vivian from his car , callously throwing her on the ground , where he first picked her up on hollywood boulevard
he throws money at her and heartlessly gets back in the car , saying : ' you 'll regret it tomorrow if you do n't take it
you 'll regret it the minute i drive away
' vivian responds by screaming at him : ' go to hell ! i hate you ! i hate your money ! i hate it ! ' in the unrevised script , richard gere never ' rescues ' julia roberts with roses up her apartment ladder , but instead throws her heartlessly from his car and chucks money at her the original script show the heated and horrid final exchange between the two characters , who clearly never end up together lawton 's script became hot property after it was pitched to disney 's production company , touchstone
but after it was given a large budget and big name director marshall it was largely rewritten as a rom - com
lawton suspects this rewrite was partially down to the casting of the leads julia roberts and richard gere
' they had auditioned al pacino , they had auditioned michelle pfeiffer , and it would definitely have been a different movie if had it been al pacino and michelle pfeiffer , ' he said
julia roberts described her original character as ' this drug addict , a bad - tempered , foulmouthed , ill - humored , poorly educated hooker , ' rather than the lovable and talkative vivian in pretty woman the pretty woman cast reminisced about making the movie 25 years after it came out on nbc 's today show julia roberts and richard gere have a laugh as they remember filming the 1992 blockbuster rom com ' it might have been closer to the original script and maybe not have had a happy ending
' but the chemistry between julia roberts and richard gere , it is palpable on the screen , it was palpable in auditions
' you ca n't really see how it could end any other way , because they just light up with each other , ' the screenwriter admits
marshall agreed , and has also revealed that he had a set vision for what he wanted his fairytale rewrite to capture
marshall admitted : '' my vision was a combination of fairy tales
julia roberts [ roberts ] was rapunzel , richard gere [ richard gere ] was prince charming and hector [ elizondo - who plays the kind hotel manager ] was the fairy godmother
' even before the rewrite , marshall described the film as a story about ' a girl who wanted to change her life , and did '
titanic : at the end of the film , instead of the elderly modern - day rose dropping the iconic ' heart of the ocean ' necklace into the sea without a word to anyone , she stands with the treasure hunter and launches into a cheesy speech about life being the only priceless thing
then she drops the necklace into the sea
thelma and louise : instead of the film ending mid-air during thelma and louise ' death dive off the cliff - which gives connotations of freedom and spirit - the car is seen violently tumbling down the mountain in a deathly fiery blaze
sweet home alabama : rather than the tame ending where the couple kiss and then celebrate with their friends , an alternate ending sees josh lucas carrying reese witherspoon 's lifeless body into the party
he is about to announce her sudden death , when they both reveal it 's a tasteless joke ... only then do they live happily ever after
rocky balboa : in the film , rocky ( sylvester stallone ) is defeated in his comeback fight by his younger and fitter opponent ( a realistic offering )
whereas rocky is victorious in the alternate ending
dodgeball : a true underdog story : the average joe 's team wins in the actual film , but an alternate ending sees them lose
this was changed after test audiences reacted badly to this first unhappy ending
at the end of the actual film , ben stiller references this by saying ' you happy now ? '
