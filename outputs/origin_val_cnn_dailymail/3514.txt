' i felt humiliated because i do n't think it is right to report me when i have tried to do something good
' i rang the hospital to get my medical records on my eye condition
i do n't see why people should put me down
' i feel really intimidated now
i am registered blind and ca n't see virtually anything out of one eye and shadows in the other
