rory mcilroy will set out on his quest to join the pantheon of golf 's greatest - ever players in a fortnight 's time
the world no 1 will arrive at augusta hunting the elusive green jacket he needs to complete a historic grand slam of majors
only five players have achieved the incredible feat , post-war
but victory at the masters will elevate the northern irishman into the company of legends gene sarazen , gary player , ben hogan , jack nicklaus and tiger woods
rory mcilroy hits the gym as he prepares for the masters at augusta next month the northern irishman has been pumping iron as he goes hunting for the elusive green jacket rory mcilroy shows off the open trophy to fans back in northern ireland four years ago at times , rory mcilroy has made it look easy
for the past 73 weeks he has been the leading golfer on the planet , landing open championship and the pga championship along the way
although the 25 - year - old still has a long way to go before surpassing tiger woods ' record of 683 total weeks as world no 1 , he is undoubtedly the american 's successor as golf 's heavyweight star - both on and off the greens
and his obsession with the gym is giving the star more than a helping hand
' it was when i started to notice results that i fell in love with it , ' said rory mcilroy , who has offered a fascinating and unique insight into his preparation off the course in this new nike training video , seen exclusively by sportsmail
indeed , rory mcilroy has bulked up considerably over the past five years with his transformation evident in both stature and presence on the course
since 2010 he has worked closely with dr mcgregor , a british exercise physiologist who has previously masterminded the fitness programmes for man city and the nba 's new york knicks
when rory mcilroy first started with mcgregor he could barely stand 10 seconds balancing on one leg
now , with 14 wins and four majors to his name , he has the muscle strength to last on one leg throughout an entire golf swing
rory mcilroy is setting out on his quest to join the pantheon of golf 's greatest - ever players the 25 - year - old needs a masters crown to complete a historic grand slam of golfing majors rory mcilroy won the 143rd open championship at royal liverpool in hoylake in july last year ' i was n't really big into the gym , ' he admits
' so my physical training was pretty much non-existent from when i turned pro at 18 until i turned 21
' i had three years when i was playing professionally on the tour , doing ok but not , i guess , maximising my potential by coming into the gym and doing the work that i needed to do
' i ended up having a few niggles here and there â a few little injuries which , had i let them go on longer , could have turned into serious issues that could have put me out for a while
' so it was definitely out of necessity that i started â for injury prevention more than anything else
then the more you get into , you find yourself wanting to get stronger
you want to see what your limits are and to test your body physically
i really started to get into it and it became part of my lifestyle
up to that point it had n't been â i 'd just played golf without really training much or watching what i ate
now , obviously , things are very different
rory mcilroy won by one stroke to clinch the 96th pga championship at valhalla in august last year ' it took me four years of training to get my body into the best possible shape for what i do , which ultimately is go out and play golf
i have no ambitions to try and squat 500 pounds like some guys do but i do enough and i 'm strong enough to control the golf club the whole way through my swing â that 's basically what i need to do
' for some people [ going to the gym ] it 's just looking in the mirror and feeling better about themselves , or tracking their numbers â lifting bigger , lifting heavier , being able to do more reps with more weight or whatever it is
' but for me it was being able to stand up , hit 50 drivers in a row and feel no pain in my back
that is what made me realise that training is something i need to do â i need to do this a lot , and if i want to prolong my career as much as i can , i need to keep doing it
' since 2010 he has worked closely with dr mcgregor , who masterminded man city 's fitness programme mcgregor devises programmes that stretch between six to eight weeks in order to get rory mcilroy in the best possible shape for major tournaments , with the focus on adding stability , strength and power
during tournament week , mcgregor attempts to control rory mcilroy 's desire to post a workout
the superstar will train , on top of his practice range sessions , nearly every day bar the tournament - ending sunday
at last year 's open at hoylake , mcgregor made rory mcilroy a deal that he could do a gym session if he shot a round of 67
' i 'll do my heavier sessions on monday and tuesday , maybe take a day off , and then do a couple of lighter ones over the course of the thursday , friday and saturday , ' said rory mcilroy
' i 'll always give myself sunday off just as it 's the last day of the tournament â maybe i 'll go in if i feel like some sort of warm - up session , but nothing more
so two heavier sessions and two lighter sessions
' when rory mcilroy first started with mcgregor he could barely stand 10 seconds balancing on one leg rory mcilroy believes his preparation for augusta has been perfect and the man who finished runner - up to formula one king lewis hamilton at last year 's bbc sports personality of the year contest is confident that he stands a good chance of triumphing in georgia
' obviously it 's the first really big tournament of the year and it 's even bigger for me this time round for a few different reasons , ' he added
' i think i 've had a good build - up to it
' we try to put a lot of work into it at the start of the year , around january and february time , going through different phases of training
endurance at the start , and then more into a strength phase , before maybe tapering off a little bit in the lead up to the masters
' we still work hard the week before but then the week of the tournament we try to taper it down so that i know i 'm in great shape and i know i 'm ready
i 'll have done the volume , i 'll have done the workload and i 'll just be ready to go out and play
' nick faldo , sandy lyle , ian woosnam ... now is it time for rory mcilroy to become the next british champion of the masters ? indeed , the nation hopes the hard work will ultimately pay off
a grand slam and golf folklore awaits if rory mcilroy can finally lift the big one
