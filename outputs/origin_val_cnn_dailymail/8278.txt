davidson has never been one to shy away from controversy
so it 's perhaps no surprise that the comedian looked right at home as he hobnobbed with farage during a plush charity ball in london last night
the celebrity big brother winner spent time chatting and sharing several jokes with the ukip leader at the inaugural care for combat ball at the dorchester hotel
even davidson 's wife appeared to have been taken in by the politician 's charm , happily posing for photos with the ukip leader during the event
farage , who donned a polka dot pink bow tie , attended the event alongside a host of other celebrities to raise money for the armed forces charity , which was set up by davidson last year
they included charity spokesman casey batchelor and luisa zissman , both of whom are also part of the celebrity big brother alumni
eastenders actresses barbara windsor and gillian telforth were also seen at the event
last night 's united front was not the first time davidson and farage have publicly appeared to join forces
in an interview earlier this year , davidson described ukip as ' the davidson of the political world '
he told digital spy that he ' felt for ukip '
he also revealed that farage was one of the first people to phone him following his acquittal over sex allegations
speaking at the time , he said : ' i got a call from the ukip leader , who i had never spoken to before , saying , " all right davidson , farage , i hope you do n't mind , i got your number from your agent
" i just wanted to say bloody good news , fantastic , marvellous , i never believed a bloody word of it , all the best " and hung up
' i could not believe it , what a nice guy ! ' the ukip leader ( left and right ) was pulling his classic grinning expression as he stopped and chatted in a polka dot pink bow tie and a smart black suit the comedian was first arrested in january 2013 by detectives from operation yewtree , which was set up after the jimmy savile scandal

he was then cleared in august 2013 after the cps ruled there was ' insufficient evidence '
even before his arrest , davidson 's brand of comedy divided tv fans in the past
the former big break frontman has been forced to defend his sense of humour on a number of occasions
the politician , who launched his election campaign earlier this week , shared a dance with ms michelle cotton he also appeared to be having a ball with davidson 's wife , michelle cotton , at last night 's event last year , he said in an interview : if i cured aids and fed africa and ended ebola and found that missing aeroplane i 'd still be that horrible racist , sexist , homophobic comedian
by people , with respect , who have n't seen me
or are judging me from the past
' during his time on ' cbb ' , he also provoked plenty of controversy , but eventually went on to win the show
meanwhile , farage was yesterday at the white cliffs of dover to launch his election campaign , which focuses heavily on immigration
