the foreign spy arrested on suspicion of helping three uk schoolgirls travel to syria to join the islamic state was working for the canadian intelligence service , it has been reported
turkish foreign minister cavusoglu earlier said the suspect works for the intelligence agency of a country that is part of the u.s. - led coalition fighting isis but did not identify the country , saying only that it was not the u.s. or a member of the european union
however , an istanbul - based newspaper has reported that the spy was working for the canadian government
mr cavusoglu , who was interviewed on turkish channel a haber tv , said he had shared the information with his uk counterpart - foreign secretary phillip hammond

it emerged earlier this week that the three girls had paid for their flights out of the uk after stealing jewellery from their family
police discovered they paid the Â£ 1,000 cost of their flights from gatwick airport to istanbul in cash
before they went missing , the girls are believed to have communicated with 20 - year - old aqsa mahmood , a notorious jihadi who left glasgow for syria last year
the former medical student has become the online contact of choice for those wanting to travel to syria and marry a militant fighter
one of the girls , shamima , used her twitter account to try to contact her directly , asking for her to open a private line of communication
friends suspect the girls were in touch with mahmood and islamic state recruiters via their mobile phones in the weeks before christmas
the girls were pictured going through security at gatwick airport last month , dressed in western clothes

they are understood to be in the isis stronghold of raqqa they were later seen on cctv in turkish , dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with syria

mark rowley , who has overall responsibility for police counter terrorism , said the three girls would not be arrested for terrorist offences if they returned to the uk
â we have no evidence in this case that any of the three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences , â he said
over the weekend it also emerged that letters from scotland yard to the girls ' families â explaining that the pupils would be part of the inquiry into their friend 's disappearance â had been given to the schoolgirls rather than their parents
metropolitan police commissioner sir bernard hogan-howe admitted that â with the benefit of hindsight â officers should have communicated directly with the families
but he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology
however , the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers ' actions when they appeared before a committee of mps earlier this week
instead , they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children 's potential radicalisation
they were led by their lawyer tasnime akunjee , once the representative of a close associate of the woolwich killers , who repeatedly demanded an apology
he accused scotland yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in february and their close friend in december

foreign secretary phillip hammond echoed the comments saying : ' parents have responsibilities , schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators
