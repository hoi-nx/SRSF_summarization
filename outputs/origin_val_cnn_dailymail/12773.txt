when one man sat down next to a second man in a st. louis light rail car and asked him his opinion on the shooting of michael brown , it was not the beginning of a discussion
it was the start of an assault , police said
the second man , who was white , did n't want to answer the question
then the first man , who was black , boxed him in the face
two more african-american men joined in the beating , according to a police report about monday 's incident
it was caught on surveillance cameras on the metrolink train and a passenger recorded it with a cell phone and posted the video online
police confirmed to cnn that the online images came from the attack
the victim , 43 , was commuting home when a young man in a red t - shirt and cap walked up to him
the victim asked not to be named in media reports
the man asked to use the victim 's cell phone
he declined , and the young man sat down beside him
" then he asked me my opinion on the michael brown thing , " the victim told kmov , " and i responded i was too tired to think about it right now
" the suspect , in his 20s , stood up
" the next thing i know , he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face , " the victim said
the video showed the suspect unleashing a barrage of punches at the head of the victim , who covered himself with his hand and forearms
the two other men , also in their 20s , joined in , police said
as the train pulled into a station , a security guard saw part of the beating and alerted police
the man in the red t - shirt could be seen on video kicking at the victim 's face before the train 's doors opened and the assailants ran out

police are looking for the three men
they face possible charges of third - degree assault , police said
it is a misdemeanor under missouri law
the victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead , police said
the first punch dug the frame of his eyeglasses into the skin of his nose , the victim said
he declined to receive medical treatment
but then there was the emotional pain
on the video , people could be heard laughing while the man was beaten
" i think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it , " the victim said
" and no one offered to help
no one seemed to call 911
