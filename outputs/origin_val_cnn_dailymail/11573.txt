warrington piled on the agony for leeds as the luckless yorkshiremen lost their star full - back as well as their 100 per cent super league record on friday the 13th
the rhinos left out england international zak hardaker after it emerged that he was the subject of a police investigation into an assault case , forcing leeds to throw teenager ashton golding in for his full debut
ashton golding performed admirably but little else went right for leeds as they fell from the top of the table and suffered a fifth consecutive defeat at the halliwell jones stadium in going down 18 - 6 to a warrington side starting to find their groove
kevin penny touches down over the line to score a magnificent solo try and get warrington on their way the rhinos trailed 18 - 0 until scoring what proved to be a consolation try through winger tom briscoe and skipper kevin sinfield 's goal took him to within three points of the 4,000 mark
the wolves , led by the magnificent chris hill in the absence of the injured joel monaghan , created the first chance when lively left winger matty russell produced a half - break but centre ryan atkins was pulled back for a forward pass
both sides were full of attacking intent but they virtually cancelled each other out and it took a moment of brilliance from right winger kevin penny to break the deadlock on 15 minutes
penny was forced to drop back to collect stefan ratchford 's wayward pass but that succeeded in fooling the leeds defence which was back - pedalling when the one - time basketball player cut a swathe through the middle for an opportunist score
joe philbin stops leeds ' kallum watkins in a game where excellent defenses trumped ambitious attacks the rhinos lost centre joel moon with concussion at that point but second rower carl ablett has plenty of experience in the threequarters and he demonstrated his nous on 25 minutes to create a clear - cut opening for winger hall , who uncharacteristically fumbled the pass
the wolves then struck another blow seven minutes before the break when stefan ratchford raced onto a perfectly - judged grubber kick from scrum - half o'brien
stefan ratchford kicked his second goal to make it 12 - 0 and warrington defended superbly to keep their lead intact up to the break , with leeds duo singleton and danny mcguire held agonisingly short of the line
leeds recovered a 12 - point interval deficit to win handsomely in their last match but any hopes of a repeat were dashed by an unlikely error from their inspirational captain
stefan ratchford dives on the ball to score his side 's second try , awarded after a decision from the tmo o'brien swooped on a stray pass from the rhinos stand - off 30 metres out from the visitors ' line to get ryan atkins over for a third try and stefan ratchford kicked his third goal
leeds grabbed a lifeline on the hour when hall broke clear on halfway and centre kallum watkins was in support to get tom briscoe away and they thought they had scored again moments later when singleton touched down after stefan ratchford had fumbled kevin sinfield 's high kick but the try was ruled out for a knock - on by mcguire
kevin sinfield went off injured 11 minutes from the end as warrington comfortably held on for a precious victory despite stefan ratchford missing with a penalty kick at goal and chris bridge putting a drop - goal attempt wide
kevin sinfield lines up his goal after leeds ' only try , but it failed to spark a late comeback
