not to be outdone by tom brady leaping off a cliff , adrenaline junkie levy can add wing - walking to his nerve - jangling offseason exploits
last year the lions linebacker hiked in macchu picchu for five days , swam with sharks in south africa and boarded down - and crashed on - an active nicaraguan volcano
but the 28 - year - old hit new heights in a biplane , leaving the cockpit to clamber along the aircraft before the pilot spins the plane 180 degrees at approximately 3,500 feet
levy was one of the success stories of last season and contributed to the lions ' fearsome defense not satisifed with that , the daredevil displayed pictures on his instagram account of him sat on top of the plane in a harness
levy has documented his adventurous experiences on instagram , saying : ' not ready for the offseason yet , but last year 's included riding horses in exotic locales , hiking and sleeping atop a dark cold mountain for two nights , volcanic craters , sledding down an active volcano , cockfights , and saving a woman from a rushing river , ' three months ago
and the thrill - seeker can now add walking in the troposphere to his antics
after last year 's win over atlanta , levy and the lions will once again travel to england ahead of their game with the chiefs at wembley on november 1 .
