angry parents alerted police after spotting a small drone hovering over homes and following their children home from school
grandmother bailey-ruiz , of alaska , said she spotted the drone flying above her while she was standing in the driveway with her granddaughter , two , on tuesday
after other parents and school children also mentioned seeing the drone , bailey alerted police , who told the parents the man operating the drone is not breaking any laws
parents were angry after a drone was seen hovering near their homes and following complaints from their children that it followed them home from school ( above file photo of the inspire quadcopter drone ) anchorage police said the man told them he was flying his $ 3,400 dji inspire quadcopter drone as practice for an impending business venture , according to alaska dispatch news
the man , who has not been identified , denied claims that he followed children or flew low enough to peer into people 's homes with the drone 's camera
he also said other drones operate in the area
when they responded to complaints , police told the man to respect other people 's privacy and to stop flying the drone near the school , eagle river elementary , and also near the children
as he formerly flew drones for the military and was curious about the capabilities of civilian models , the drone operator said he would not fly the drone when children were returning home from school
' there is no state or local law for the misuse of drones , ' said anchorage police department spokeswoman shell
' can we prove anything illegal has been done ? no. ' bailey-ruiz , who lives close the school , said she was outside with her grandchildren earlier this week around 3.30pm when the drone flew down in close proximity
she said : ' it came right down to us at the height of the light poles and just hovered there
and it was making a clicking noise and it was shifting around in the sky
' the grandmother said she decided to take action after speaking to a child headed home from school who said the drone followed kids , and had been out for a few days
authorities told the parents that the law prohibits them from shooting at the drones but that throwing rocks and firing slingshots were within their rights , according to ktuu
the man , who was concerned about residents damaging his drone , was advised to avoid flying it over people 's property to protect it from potential risks of damage
the man , who has not been identified , denied claims that he followed children with his drone and said he used to fly the device for the military ( above eagle river elementary school ) he was not charged or arrested following the incident
' he was n't committing a crime , ' said shell
' there was n't anything we could do but advise him of the neighbors ' concerns about following children home or flying near windows
' since the operator was warned , parents said when they saw the drone on wednesday , it was not following students and was high up above the school
shell said there has not been any complaints regarding him and his drone
the faa has estimated that there could be at least 7,500 civilian drone users in the next four years
while drone operation is banned for commercial purposes , there are few regulations for private drone use
however , current guidelines advise operators to fly the devices at a safe height away from crowds and airports
as for state regulations , operators are only banned from using drones for hunting or to locate animals while preparing for a hunt
the faa is conducting an investigation into the incident in eagle river elementary school , and are also working on rules for civilian drone use .
