rodgers looks on frustrated during liverpool 's goalless clash with rovers on sunday rodgers ( middle ) and counterpart gary bowyer greet the crowd ahead of the fa cup clash at anfield the reds boss had cause for concern after defender martin skrtel was taken off on a stretcher early on kolo toure ( left ) hit the back of the net for the reds in the first half but his strike was ruled out for offside ' in games like this sometimes in that opening 20 minutes , if you can get the first goal , it opens the game up
' adam lallana 's one looked a clear penalty
the defender is recovering back in , but he 's on the wrong side and he ca n't get to the ball , so for me , that was a penalty
' you could argue when [ rudy ] gestede handballs it off the header from the free - kick , we could have had another penalty , and sometimes you need that little bit of luck
' they have got some good players - gestede gives you a problem up front - but i thought in the main , we dealt with that really , really well
' i thought maybe the sharpness was just missing from our game and that wee bit of incision
but credit to the players , they kept a clean sheet and the objective was to be in the hat for the next round by the end of the evening , and that 's what we are in

he said : ' no , no , no , no. you have got to be tight to him
you give him a yard and he 's got that shot with no back - lift
maybe when i did give him that yard , he has got the shot off
' you have got to be tight to these players and that 's what i was
' things might have been worse for liverpool had it not been for a fine 49th - minute save by keeper simon mignolet to claw baptiste 's header out of the top corner

they mark zonally and i thought it was in , to be honest
