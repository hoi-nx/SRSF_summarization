sauber team principal monisha kaltenborn was able to leave melbourne with a smile , happy to see the end of what she described as one of the worst weeks of her career

you just do n't know how to shield it from them

' i 'm very glad it 's over - all the more glad with the outcome ( of the race ) - and we focus now on the future
' monisha kaltenborn conceded on friday the events of last week had resulted in ' a negative impact ' on the team , but she felt confident that , given the tremendous result , it had now been restored
' with what happened , the morale was affected , but you could feel they got themselves together , ' monisha kaltenborn added
