pierre gonnord said : ' people from the ghettos , the outskirts of the city , that flee from a globalized world from which they feel rejected ... set out with nothing more than what they have on their back and a dog as their own only travel companion , embarking on a grand tour as nomads , with no return ticket , turning their backs on a ( certain ) world that no longer interests them
' the protagonists are captured in the style of old masters paintings , with simple , dark sets focusing entirely on the subjects from the waist up
old masters were highly recognised and renown artists who would portrait their subjects , among other work , before the 1800s
framed as almost royal subjects , the photographs shown an intense strength and resilience , with direct eye contact to the camera and in natural poses
