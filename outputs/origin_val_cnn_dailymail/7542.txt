the name conjures up images of row upon row of dusty leather - bound books in some darkened corner of a stately home
but these days , it seems , you âre just as likely to find a â library â in a three - bedroom suburban house
the quiet allure of a room filled with books , a cosy chair in the corner and a lamp or two has become a new status symbol , estate agents say
status symbol : many home owners are turning under - used rooms into quiet refuges from the modern world and getting your own library is nât too difficult
many homeowners are simply redecorating their under - used dining rooms , which have become redundant as more families use a combined kitchen - diner for meals
estate agents say a library is â aspirational â and regarded as a retro retreat from the rest of our increasingly hi - tech homes
one in ten said there had been a rise in the number of homes being advertised with a library , the naea found
yesterday , hayward , of the naea , said : â having a library in your home can add a unique advantage when it comes to selling your property
it is a differentiator â a room by its very title that conveys peace , quiet and serenity that âs growing in popularity
â at the top - end property market , it adds a quintessential english touch , popular amongst overseas investors
â it follows a trend for â shelfies â â photographs of one âs bookshelves â which have become popular on social media websites
more than 160,000 images have been posted on the website instagram using the hashtag â shelfie â , with thousands more on twitter
mr hayward said many upmarket new - build homes now included library rooms as standard , while sellers were converting their spare rooms
he said : â the popularity of the kitchen - diner means many dining rooms are now dead space
filling it with books and calling it a library elevates it again
â the books you put on the shelves are intended to reflect a lifestyle
it is filled with the books you want people to think you are reading
â the name may evoke images of leather bound books and mahogany but libraries are increasingly common
