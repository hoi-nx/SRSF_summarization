they were originally convicted of murder and sexual assault in december 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively
after they served four years in prison a court in perugia threw out their convictions and declared them innocent
knox returned to the us before another u-turn in the sensational case in january last year when a court in florence reinstated the original 2009 conviction and increased knox 's sentence to 28 - and - a - half years
