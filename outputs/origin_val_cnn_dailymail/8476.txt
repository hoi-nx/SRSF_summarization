a powdered alcohol intended to be mixed up into drinks has gained approval from a federal regulator
the product , called palcohol , had received the greenlight from the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau briefly last year before the bureau backtracked and said the label approvals had been given in error
on wednesday , bureau spokesman hogue told the associated press the issues were resolved and that four varieties of palcohol were approved
but hogue noted that states can also regulate alcohol sales in their borders
dry booze : a brand of powdered alcohol has been approved by the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau
the maker of palcohol hopes to start selling the product by summer
a few of their flavors of powdered alcohol seen above the approval is a step forward for a small company whose product plans have already sparked controversy
several states have already moved to ban powdered alcohol , including lawmakers in colorado who last month advanced legislation to temporarily halt its sale
that bill has since morphed to ensure the regulation of powdered alcohol as if it were liquid alcohol once it gets federal approval
concerns have included abuse by minors , the potential to snort the powder and whether palcohol 's light weight would make it easy to sneak alcohol into public events or spike drinks
palcohol would come in a pouch , with water being added to the powder inside for the equivalent of an alcoholic drink
a statement on palcohol 's website says the company hopes to have the product for sale this summer
palcohol founder phillips noted the approval of his products in an email early wednesday morning , and said in a subsequent email that pricing has n't yet been determined
' we are n't commenting on production or distribution at this time , ' he wrote
the four products that have been approved include powdered versions of a cosmopolitan , a margarita , vodka and rum
phillips added that he expects another palcohol product â lemon drop â should also be ' approved shortly
' previously , phillips had said he came up with the idea for palcohol because he wanted a way to enjoy alcoholic drinks after hiking or other activities without having to lug around heavy bottles
hogue said the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau regularly reaches out to the fda to get determinations on whether a product might be considered ' adulterated
' if the fda says the product is n't adulterated , he said the bureau 's evaluation centers on whether labels accurately reflect what 's in the product
' potential for abuse is n't grounds for us to deny a label , ' hogue said .
