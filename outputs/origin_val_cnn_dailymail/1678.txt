last week he was the face of comic relief , fronting the annual fundraising telethon watched by millions that raised Â£ 1billion for good causes
but now the leftwing firebrand russell brand has launched an astonishing attack on the very same charity , claiming he felt ' compromised ' by accepting the gig
during his show at london 's proud archivist on sunday , russell brand , 39 , asked : ' is it right to do comic relief ? plus is any f * * * er watching it ? ' he said
and the answer is , ' no , not really '
' he then appeared to launch a scathing attack on uk charities , claiming they were ' part of the problem '
the comedian had enraged some viewers on red nose day when he joked about sharing syringes
during the charity telethon , russell brand said : ' i 'm in the unfortunate position of having to ask you to donate money to buy syringes , literally the exact opposite of how i spend most of my time , and the previous two decades of my life , ' he said
' fighting every instinct of my being
' do n't make ' em not work again , that 's terrible
although do watch out for infectious blood diseases
' met with nervous laughs from the audience he went onto compare the distasteful joke to the controversy involving jeremy clarkson ; s alleged use of the ' n - word '
the comedian and self - styled revolutionary said : ' ultimately taking responsibility away from the centralised powers of created government , corporations and alleviating that stress and tensions by placing the burden once more on ordinary people
' is charity part of the problem ? ' despite his bizarre rant , russell brand admitted those behind ' comic relief had ' good intentions '
his comments are made even stranger by the fact that vegetarian brand has been an open supporter of several charities including amnesty international , david lynch foundation , hillsborough family support group and peta
he is also the ambassador for the recovery group uk , a supportive body for addiction , and has joined protests against austerity cuts
dr karl wilding , director of public policy at the national council for voluntary organisations , said there had never been a clear answer to where the responsibility lay between state and charities
just two days after the comic relief gig , and asked an audience at his show at london 's proud archivist ( pictured ) if charity was ' part of the problem ? ' the comedian and self - styled revolutionary has been an open supporter of several charities and has joined protests against austerity cuts including occupy london last october ( pictured ) ' it 's not clear what mr russell brand 's proposed solution is
mr russell brand has , in his own particular way , highlighted an age - old philosophical debate about where the boundaries of the state 's responsibility should lie , which has never had a clear answer ' charities run high - quality , innovative services that are responsive to the needs in different areas
they also create a way for people to help support causes they care about , either through donating or volunteering
' a spokesman for comic relief said : ' russell brand has been involved in comic relief in many brilliant ways over the years and we 're enormously grateful
he was a fantastic addition to the night of telly last week , and we 're thrilled that he was able to give his time

but russell brand lost his temper when tv reporter o'brien asked him whether the super-rich buying up property in london was driving up prices for everyone else
the incensed star said he is ' part of the solution ' and called the reporter a ' snide ' for asking how much he pays in rent
asked about the value of his home , the 39 - year - old angrily replied : ' i 'm not interested in talking to you about my rent , mate
i 'm here to support a very important campaign
' simon cowell labelled russell brand a ' hypocrite ' last year accused of being ' part of the problem ' of rocketing housing prices , russell brand , 39 , said : ' i am part of the solution
' he suggested his fame meant he was able to ' amplify the voices of ordinary people '
asked again about his house , russell brand pointed his finger in o'brien 's face and said : ' it 's rented
we do n't know the value , you would have to talk to my landlord
blessedly , i can afford my rent and i 'm prepared to stand up for people that ca n't
' refusing to answer further questions about his own housing costs , russell brand terminated the two - minute interview and accused the reporter of trying to wreck his campaign , saying : ' snides like you , mate , undermine it

i 'm living in a $ 10 million mansion and i want a revolution ? give me a break
' the self - styled anti-establishment figure also faced fierce online backlash with social media users labelling him as the ' epitome of a champagne socialist ' when it emerged that he left a bonfire night protest to take his place alongside a host of celebrities invited to a west end press night brand had joined the crowd as thousands of masked anti-capitalist demonstrators descended on westminster for a protest which saw scuffles with police
