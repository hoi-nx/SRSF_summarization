a filter - feeding ' lobster ' as big as a human took the place of whales 480 million years ago , a new fossil find has shown
the 6.5ft ( two - metre ) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders
at this length it would have been comparable in size to athlete usain bolt , actor liam hemsworth and former wrestler hulk hogan
a giant filter - feeding ' lobster ' ( illustrated left ) took the place of whales 480 million years ago , a new fossil find has shown
the 6.5ft ( two - metre ) prehistoric creature was an early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders and at this length would have been comparable in size to athlete usain bolt ( pictured right ) the remains were unearthed in morocco and it is thought to be the oldest giant filter - feeder ever discovered
but while most of its relatives were shark - like apex predators with circular mouths ringed by sharp teeth , the new species , named aegirocassis , was a ' gentle giant '
the 6.5ft ( two - metre ) prehistoric creature belonged to the family of anomalocaridids that were the early ancestors of modern crustaceans , insects and spiders
like modern - day whales , it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food , using spine - covered ' limbs ' on its head
fossils also show that aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body
these were likely to be precursors of the unique double - branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans
like modern - day whales , it filtered seawater to trap tiny particles of food , using spine - covered ' limbs ' on its head
modern - day lobsters grow to around 19 inches ( 50cm ) and modern - day whales average at around 79ft ( 25 metres )
dr allison daley , from oxford university , who co-led a team studying aegirocassis writing in the journal nature , said : ' this would have been one of the largest animals alive at the time
' these animals are filling an ecological role that had n't previously been filled by any other animal
' while filter - feeding is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food , previous filter - feeders were smaller , and usually attached to the sea - floor
' we have found the oldest example of gigantism in a freely swimming filter - feeder
' a. benmoulae was named after the morocco fossil hunter who discovered it , mohamed ben moula
the 3d fossil , exposed using tiny needle - like tools to chip away the surrounding rock , is exceptionally well preserved

the three - dimensional fossil ( pictured ) , exposed using tiny needle - like tools to chip away the surrounding rock , is ' exceptionally well preserved '
other anomalocaridid fossils have been flat , like pressed leaves the fossils ( pictured left and right ) also show that aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body , which were likely to be precursors to the unique double - branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans
they also bear resemblance to gill flaps seen on the trunks of modern arthropods dr allison daley , from oxford university said : ' this would have been one of the largest animals alive at the time
while filter - feeding is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food , previous filter - feeders were smaller , and usually attached to the sea - floor
' the fossil 's individual parts are annotated above in contrast , other anomalocaridid fossils have been flat , like pressed leaves
' without these 3d remains we may never have got the insight into these animals ' anatomy that we did , ' said dr daley
the fossil shows that aegirocassis had pairs of swimming flaps along its body , which were likely to be precursors of the unique double - branched appendages seen in modern crustaceans
they also bear resemblance to gill flaps seen on the trunks of modern arthropods
the large size of this filter feeder suggests that the anomalocaridids were well - adapted to take advantage of a presumably rich source of plankton during the ordovician period , said the authors
the fossils were found in the fezouata biota formation region of central anti-atlas in morocco ( marked ) modern lobsters ( stock image ) grow to around 19 in ( 50cm ) and modern whales average at 79ft ( 25 metres )
