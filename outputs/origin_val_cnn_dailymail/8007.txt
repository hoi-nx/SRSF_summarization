a massachusetts teenager 's confession to police that he killed his math teacher can not be used in his murder trial , a judge ruled tuesday even as he allowed a bloody box cutter and other key pieces of evidence to be admitted
the ruling came in the case of 16 - year - old chism , who has pleaded not guilty to raping and killing 24 - year - old danvers high school teacher ritzer on school grounds in october 2013
chism 's lawyers had argued that police coerced their client , then 14 , into making detailed statements about the killing , despite invoking his right to remain silent
prosecutors maintained chism and his mother had never absolutely demanded a lawyer
calls to chism 's public defenders seeking comment were not immediately returned
ritzer 's family said in a statement it respected the court ruling and was confident that law enforcement ' acted responsibly and lawfully ' in investigating their daughter 's killing
the 48 - page decision came after days of arguments and testimony on the defense 's motion to suppress key pieces of evidence in the case
salem superior court judge lowy concluded that chism had willingly talked to police in the town of topsfield on the night of the killing , calmly answering questions and even correcting officers at various points
but chism 's demeanor changed when he was taken to the danvers police station and further interrogated in his mother 's presence , the judge noted
at that point , lowy said , chism grew uncomfortable and somewhat hostile
murdered : ritzer was a popular and enthusiastic math teacher at danvers high school
phillip chism has pleaded not guilty to her rape and murder charged : philip d. chism was indicted by an essex county grand jury today on charges of first - degree murder , aggravated rape and armed robbery in 2013 he twice indicated his disinterest in speaking with danvers police and ' did not appear to be fully engaged ' or to appreciate the seriousness of what officers asked him as they explained his miranda rights , the judge wrote
' it is clear that the defendant wanted to talk to the police without his mother present in the room , ' lowy said in his ruling
' it is also clear that he had no intention of talking while his mother was in the room
' as a result , the judge said , he would allow the statements chism made to topsfield police to be introduced as evidence but not his taped confession at the danvers police station
he also allowed items gathered at danvers high school , as well as those seized from chism 's pockets and backpack
they included ritzer 's id and credit cards , a bloody box cutter and women 's underwear

a short time later , the video shows chism pulling a recycling barrel through the school and outside
ritzer 's body was later found in nearby woods , naked from the waist down and with her throat slit and a note that read , ' i hate you all
' authorities said she was sexually assaulted with a stick
