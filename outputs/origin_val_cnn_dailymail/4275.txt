an american student has created a batman - style suit that can withstand assaults from punches , baseball bats and even knifes
jackson gordon , an industrial design student from philadelphia university , constructed the armoured suit with money raised through kickstarter â a global crowd - funding platform designed to aid creative endeavors
hoping to raise $ 1000 to begin the project , jackson gordon received backing from 17 enthusiasts and raised $ 1255 â more than enough to begin assembling the suit
without breaking a sweat : jackson gordon holds his hands behind his head as his friend tests the suit with some heavy punches made from kevlar and silicone moulds , the batsuit weighs in at just under four stone and took the 21 - year - old from wayne , pennsylvania five months to complete from start to finish
videoed testing the final product with a friend , jackson gordon is featured being repeatedly punched in the chest , back and sides while wearing the suit
despite jackson gordon flinching slightly under the impact of the punches , the suit is remarkably durable and the young designer even calls for his friend to hit him harder and with both hands
made from kevlar and silicone moulds , the batsuit is able to withstand the heavy punches that repeatedly rain in the suit weighs in at just under four stone and took the 21 - year - old five months to complete from start to finish laughing as the blows rain in , jackson gordon showcases the strength of the soft plates on the side and shoulder area alongside the harder ones , which also hold up well against the impact
smiling at the camera in admiration for his suit , the student says : â i could do this all day
i ca nât even feel it
â this is the second batsuit created by jackson gordon , who previously made one based on christopher nolan âs dark knight trilogy a year before
the student recently tested his new suit at maryland âs katsucon â an annual three day anime convention â in february , where he invited people to assault him , unsuccessfully of course
the video shows jackson gordon 's friend successfully testing the softer plates on the back and shoulder stunned : jackson gordon happily boasts that he could do this all day after claiming that he did not feel a single punch that was thrown at him
