director of public prosecutions alison saunders has announced a review of all forthcoming trials or retrials regarding the prosecution of journalists the prosecution of journalists accused of paying public officials for leaks was in turmoil last night after law chiefs announced a review of all forthcoming trials or retrials
alison saunders , the director of public prosecutions , made the decision as anger grew that a â witch - hunt â had been conducted to pursue reporters who exposed stories kept secret because they embarrassed those in power
last week , lord thomas , the lord chief justice , expressed misgivings that the obscure 13th century law of misconduct in public office was being used to haul journalists before the courts
police and prosecutors have faced criticism for spending up to Â£ 20million of taxpayers â money on operation elveden , an investigation into tabloid newspapers paying for information , rather than concentrating on terrorism and violent crime
scotland yard and the cps have brought to trial 24 journalists as part of the investigation , launched in the wake of phone - hacking allegations
but only three have been found guilty
and of those , a former news of the world reporter had her conviction for paying a prison officer for leaks quashed last week , while fellow journalist ryan sabey was given leave to appeal
the now reporter was the first journalist found guilty under elveden and received a six - month suspended jail sentence
but on friday , lord thomas overturned her conviction after finding judge charles wide , who presided over the trial , â misdirected â the jury over the â level of seriousness â required to have committed an offence
now it has emerged that the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , will not face a retrial
two co-defendants also had their convictions quashed but the prison officer is expected to be tried again
mrs alison saunders made the decision after holding emergency talks about the future of the prosecutions of the press with senior barristers and the metropolitan police
a cps spokesman said : â the court of appeal judgment from last week does not call into question the prosecution of the appellants concerned but considered that the jury needed greater direction on how serious offending must be to amount to an abuse of the public âs trust
â this ruling has been very carefully considered in relation to the cases against these three individuals and we have informed the court of appeal this afternoon of our decisions concerning retrials in each of those cases
â the spokesman said the cps would â consider the wider implications of last week âs judgment on this case and others within operation elveden â
legal sources said mrs alison saunders had been forced to consider an â exit strategy â after the so - called media crime investigations descended into chaos , with juries showing a reluctance to convict journalists who paid money for stories that were clearly in the public interest
earlier this month , four sun journalists were acquitted of making illegal payments for stories
former colour sergeant john hardy , 44 , was found not guilty of misconduct in a public office
pictured left to right : duncan larcombe , john hardy , geoff webster , fergus shanahan and john kay earlier this month , four sun journalists â john kay , duncan larcombe , fergus shanahan , and geoff webster â were dramatically acquitted at the old bailey of making illegal payments for stories
and in january , a jury failed to reach verdicts in the trial of four current and former sun journalists â chris pharo , jamie pyatt , ben oâdriscoll and graham dudman
their planned retrial in september will now be reviewed
two fellow defendants â the sun âs picture editor , john edwards , and former reporter john troup â were cleared of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office after a trial at kingston crown court
operation elveden has seen journalists â homes raided by police at dawn â a practice normally reserved for terror suspects and organised criminals â large numbers of arrests and reporters being kept on bail for up to three years
critics have described the investigation as a â waste of public money â and accused police and prosecutors of pursuing a â vendetta â against journalists
a new elveden trial was yesterday adjourned until april 24 in the wake of last week âs ruling
it involves a reporter who can not be identified for legal reasons and prison officer alan hagan , 48 , from liverpool
they deny misconduct in public office
eight trials and retrials involving tabloid journalists charged under operation elveden are scheduled between now and september
