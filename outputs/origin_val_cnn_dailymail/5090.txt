up in the expensive seats , gerrard looked down on another fruitless appeal for a liverpool penalty and blew out his cheeks
this was one of those days at anfield
for all their improvement in the second half of the season , liverpool are still capable of throwing in a performance like this from time to time
there are still days when the cogs in the machine do nât run smoothly , days when the absence of any kind of plan b hurts liverpool and hurts them badly
they defended brilliantly , ran hard and stuck to a game plan devised by manager gary bowyer to deny liverpool the space between the defensive and midfield lines that their playmakers love to work in
blackburn rovers defended stubbornly to stop players such as coutinho ( centre ) from having an impact for liverpool gerrard ( left ) was in the stands watching the game at anfield , as was former team - mate and sportsmail columnist jamie carragher gerrard did not play for liverpool due to injury but the supporters are desperate to get to wembley in his final season at the club martin skrtel ( right ) landed awkwardly and play was halted for eight minutes as he was treated by medical staff martin skrtel lies on the ground after contesting a header with the blackburn rovers forward gestede emre can ( centre ) stands over martin skrtel before calling for medical assistance for his liverpool team - mate martin skrtel was moving his arms as he was carried off on a stretcher in the 11th minute of liverpool 's fa cup tie a week earlier here at anfield , barclays premier league champions manchester city found it impossible to plug those gaps
as a result , liverpool âs brazilian coutinho won that game almost on his own
here , though , blackburn rovers found the key and , as a result , liverpool ran out of ideas
the visitors â formation squeezed the life out of liverpool while their two central defenders baptiste and kilgallon cleaned up everything that brendan rodgers â team did manage to throw in to the penalty area
on the break , blackburn rovers were dangerous too
without their much - discussed centre forward josh king â who was injured - the championship side relied heavily on the imposing figure of gestede and he worried liverpool âs back three all afternoon but especially in the first half
perhaps liverpool were unsettled by a nasty injury to their own defender martin skrtel in the very first minute
a header from baptiste ( second left ) brought a fine save from mignolet at the start of the second half mignolet ( centre ) made a superb save to tip the header from baptiste away at the beginning of the second half kolo toure ( left ) hit the back of the net in the first half but his strike was ruled out for offside kolo toure ( right ) replaced the injured martin skrtel and also hit the post with a header in the second half mario balotelli came on in the second half for liverpool but was unable to find a way through the blackburn rovers defence liverpool : mignolet 6.5 , johnson 6 , martin skrtel 6 ( toure 11 , 6 ) , lovren 6 , lazar markovic 6.5 ( mario balotelli 59 , 6 ) , jordan henderson 6.5 , can 6 , adam lallana 5 , raheem sterling 5.5 , sturridge 6.5 , coutinho 5.5 subs not used : lambert , sakho , moreno , williams , ward

happily he was okay by half - time and able to watch the rest of the game
no doubt he found it as frustrating as the majority crammed inside anfield
they were the better team
but by their own improving standards , their football lacked crispness and rhythm and as such they found it difficult to ever gather momentum
blackburn rovers were actually the first to show after martin skrtel âs injury and gestede was the game âs most influential player for 25 minutes
the manner in which he forced liverpool goalkeeper mignolet in to a mistake under a high ball seemed portentous while the dummy he sold raheem sterling to give conway a sight of goal on the overlap soon after was terrific
sadly for blackburn rovers , conway âs shot flew high and wide
there was the occasional moment of cohesion from the home team but far fewer than we would have expected
liverpool may have had a penalty in the 19th minute when kilgallon appeared to bundle over the largely ineffectual adam lallana in the penalty area
did the defender âs toe just touch the ball first ? perhaps
that apart , there were a couple of long shots from coutinho
after his recent success from distance , nobody could blame the brazilian for having a go
on this occasion , his range was set too high , however
martin skrtel âs replacement toured did have the ball in the net in the 34th minute after a free - kick dropped invitingly to him six yards out but he was a yard offside
then , during the eight extra minutes added for martin skrtel âs injury , lazar markovic and sturridge brought saves from eastwood
it was notable that they were the first two the blackburn rovers goalkeeper had been asked to make all half

as blackburn rovers âs energy levels dropped , they found it harder to break
still , though , blackburn rovers had the best chance as baptiste âs header from a corner in the 48th minute was brilliantly touched over by mignolet
beyond that fright , liverpool âs football was undeniably quicker , neater and indeed more progressive
still , though , they found it hard to penetrate the wall of blue
indeed , all that brendan rodgers â team really had to show for their efforts as the game reached the last 20 minutes was a shot by sturridge that was blocked by baptiste and a follow up from coutinho that must have landed somewhere in the environs of goodison park
blackburn rovers manager gary bowyer shouts instructions to his players during the fa cup game against liverpool liverpool manager brendan rodgers will be frustrated by his team 's lacklustre performance on a frustrating afternoon amid all this , though , there was a more convincing penalty shout , sturridge going down as kilgallon sought to impede his run with an outstretched arm
it was the type of penalty appeal that generally tends to be ignored
the use of the arm by defenders is not in the rules
in the last ten minutes there were two more saves for eastwood to make , one from substitute mario balotelli and one from jordan henderson
in all , liverpool had 21 shots
that , however , suggests liverpool were better than they actually were
there were some bright spots , such as the performance of emre can at the base of the midfield
the german has a superb passing range and it will be a surprise if he does nât develop in to a very good player
on this occasion , however , the glory was all blackburn rovers âs
they may have to be slightly more expansive when it comes to the replay in april but they deserved this draw and will relish 90 minutes against liverpool at ewood park
by then gerrard will expect to be back in the thick of it
if he wants to get to wembley for his birthday fa cup final , he is going to have to do his bit .
