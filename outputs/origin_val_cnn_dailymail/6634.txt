dunga also recalled sao paulo midfielder souza and santos forward robinho
striker diego tardelli was the only one of the three brazilian players who recently signed for chinese and arab clubs to make the squad
marcelo , the real madrid full back , is included in the squad having been left out in previous selections ' they are starting the pre-season , we have n't seen them on a daily basis , ' he said of the other two , everton ribeiro and ricardo goulart
