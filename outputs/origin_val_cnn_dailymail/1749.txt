bogarde has claimed that chelsea never asked him to take a pay cut on his Â£ 40,000 - a - week salary and the club also would n't send him out on loan for anything less than 100 per cent of his wages being paid during his ill - fated spell at stamford bridge
the dutchman defender joined chelsea in 2000 but rarely featured for the first team during his four - year spell in west london
bogarde was signed when gianluca vialli was chelsea boss , but the italian was sacked within a week to be replaced by claudio ranieri
bogarde spent four years at stamford bridge but hardly featured in chelsea 's first team despite his lack of playing opportunities , bogarde honoured the contract and continued to collect his Â£ 40k salary from the club
but , in an interview with the guardian , the 44 - year - old said he was never asked to take a pay cut and chelsea would n't loan him to another club unless they paid all of his wages
' no , they did nât try that , ' bogarde replied when asked whether chelsea considered cutting his wages
he added : ' gianluca vialli bought me and when i had been there a week he got sacked
you have to look who the new manager âs going to be and if you âre still going to get a chance
bogarde was signed under gianluca vialli , who was replaced by claudio ranieri ( right ) within a week ' they had to cut costs
my situation was not very good and we tried to solve it many ways
like to maybe go on loan or sell me , or whatever
but in the end it did nât work out
' a club could not pay my whole salary ( for a loan deal ) , they could maybe pay 70 per cent
and they asked chelsea to pay the other 30 per cent and chelsea said : " no. if you want to take him it âs going to be 100 % or nothing
he is going nowhere "
for a player , for me , it âs terrible not to play
yet i had to return for training
return looking for the next solution , you understand ? '
