" every day , we cried " -- these were the words spoken over and over to me by a colleagues as we sat down after another long day for a rare drink in monrovia , liberia 's bustling capital
she was reminiscing about the period in september and october when the ebola outbreak was at its peak
" of all the pain that we faced , the cremation was the hardest , " she explained
i knew exactly what she meant -- cremation was as far away from the norm for burials in african as one can imagine
as the ebola outbreak wanes in liberia , it is easy to imagine the heroes as the myriad of foreign doctors , nurses , epidemiologists and logisticians that have come to support the country in their days of need , and yes , these expatriates have definitely brought to bear much knowledge , expertise and resources on controlling the outbreak
but there is a group of heroes who are unlikely to make any headlines or be celebrated as such
they are the thousands of liberia citizens that have gone door - to - door asking questions , looking for the ill , offering advice , day after day , after day for months on end
when they do find an ill person who may have ebola , they begin the painful process of convincing them that it is safer to be an ebola treatment unit than at home
often the question that follows is : " what happened to all those that went in before me ? what happened to them ? " thankfully , liberia appears to be on its way back
it currently has the lowest numbers of confirmed cases of ebola since the onset of the second phase of the outbreak in the middle of last year
the streets are full of activity and schools have reopened
across the country , there is an unmistakable sense that people are desperate to get on with their lives
at the grand royal hotel , on tubman avenue , the main road through monrovia , the manager sits in the popular cafÃ© in the front garden
most of his guests are still members of the large contingent of development workers from all over the world , or members of the armed forces and police services that form part of the u.n. military mission in liberia , unmil
he admits that while this has been good for business , he would rather have his " normal " clients back
monrovia is an interesting place -- it feels very african
the food is familiar -- fish , plantain , rice ... with lots of red pepper
the power situation is still very poor and most people in monrovia rely on generators
it has a lovely but underutilized beach front ; the perfect setting for a cold bottle of " club " lager in the evening
there are quite a few restaurants and supermarkets -- mostly run by lebanese entrepreneurs
as we drive past the presidential " mansion " -- i ask why it looks empty and i am told that there was a fire in it a few years ago and that the renovation is not yet complete
president sirleaf uses the office of the foreign ministry , and otherwise lives in her private residence , i am told
from the outside , with all the horror stories of ebola in the popular press , it is easy to imagine liberia as a country on the brink , especially with its history of protracted conflicts and civil war
but there is nothing further from the truth
yes , it was ill prepared for an outbreak of this severity and magnitude , as many other countries would have been , but sometimes there is nothing as powerful as grief to unite people in seeking a better future
out of this crisis , must emerge a new country
while the stories of dictators , civil war and ebola are true , they can not be liberia 's " single " story
with a beautiful beach front right at the heart of the city , there is no reason for monrovia not to be the favorite destination of african 's emerging middle class
with lots of mineral resources , liberia has so much potential
but , its most obvious resource and probably its most underutilized are its human resources
the university of liberia is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in african , but has known better times
the government of liberia needs to think strategically and creatively on how to channel the goodwill of the world and the determination of its people into programs and projects that will put liberia on a new trajectory
it may be impossible to imagine in 2015 , but one only needs to look east to rwanda for how a country can emerge from the most tragic of circumstances to become a proud and resilient country
liberia will be back , but it will take leadership and courage
despite the long hours of work , the tedious meetings , the long nights writing reports and re-strategizing , my best memories of monrovia will be good ones ; of a beautiful county and a resilient people
