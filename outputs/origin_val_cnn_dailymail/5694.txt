seven months after he was forced to sell the l.a. clippers amid a racism scandal , sterling is still in a highly contentious lawsuit with the nba
the 80 - year - old real estate mogul has added his wife rochelle ( called shelly ) and two doctors to the $ 600 million lawsuit , according to the most recent filing last week
in this latest filing , sterling 's lawyers claim that shelly and two doctors worked ' secretly ' with nba commissioner adam silver to strip him of his team
' conspiracy ' : former l.a. clippers owner sterling ( right , in black ) has added his wife shelly ( left , in white fur ) to a $ 600million lawsuit , claiming she conspired to force the sale of the team last year
the sterling pictured above attended a l.a. clippers game in march 2005 claims : sterling also mentioned his former girlfriend stiviano in the latest filings , claiming the recordings she taped of his racist rant was edited but provided no evidence
stiviano pictured above walking around los angeles on august 5 , 2014 ' the nba and adam silver isolated rochelle from her husband and scared her into undertaking certain conduct hereinafter alleged , including the signing of papers ... that she did not understand , ' the complaint reads
' all of this conduct constituted elder abuse
' adam silver , who is also named as a defendant in the suit , banned sterling from the nba for life last year and hit him with a $ 2.5 million fine after tapes were released of sterling speaking racist slurs
the doctors mentioned in the suit , dr meril platzer and dr james spar , evaluated sterling last may and found him mentally unfit to continue controlling his family trust , which included the l.a. clippers
but sterling claims that his wife shelly ' fraudulently induced ' and ' fraudulently arranged ' the mental evaluations , and that the two doctors violated the hipaa ( hipaa ) by releasing his medical records
' [ the defendants ] colluded and worked toward a common goal in causing injury to sterling 's financial interests , ' the complaint reads
sterling also mentions v. stiviano , his ex-girlfriend who recorded the tapes that exposed his racism
' several of the statements on the recording were not made by sterling , ' the complaint reads
' the statements alleged to be those of sterling were apparently altered by stiviano or her agents
' it does not offer evidence as to how the tapes could have been edited
furthermore , he claims that the release of these medical records , and the subsequent loss of his team caused him to suffer ' extreme mental distress ... including worry , anxiety , anger , embarrassment , sleeplessness and fatigue
' shelly 's lawyer stephen smith told the los angeles times that the recent filing was ' desperate and frivolous '
sterling is asking for $ 600 million in addition to unspecified punitive damages
the nba counter-sued sterling last august , saying that shelly 's participation in the l.a. clippers sale means that sterling is effectively suing himself
some $ 1billion from the record sale is currently being held in an escrow controlled by the nba , in the event that sterling is forced to pay out to the league , sterling 's attorney bobby samini explained .
