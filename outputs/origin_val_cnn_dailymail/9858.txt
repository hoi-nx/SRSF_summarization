arsenal are searching for a fourth consecutive premier league win at queens park rangers on wednesday night as they look to chase down second - placed manchester city
with a nine - point gap to leaders chelsea , the title looks to be beyond arsene wenger 's men yet again despite their recent good form
but would finishing as runners - up to jose mourinho 's men be good enough for a club with 13 titles to its name ? arsenal fan lee hurley of blog daily cannon tells us whether coming second would be a success for the gunners
just four points from second place , arsenal have nât finished that high in the league for 10 years and it can be no coincidence that their surge to catch the oil - rich manchester city comes after the emirates - austerity period has ended
but while it represents an improvement in the eyes of fans , it ca nât be the end of arsenal âs ambitions and it wo nât be seen as success in its own right
this is a club that wins titles , 13 of them for those who think football was just invented in 2005 when chelsea decided to start buying trophies as they could nât win them any other way
arsenal players look dejected during the monaco defeat as they now face a daunting second leg comeback arsene wenger found it painful viewing as his arsenal side capitulated in a 3 - 1 defeat by monaco alexis sanchez has been a star performer for the gunners this season as they seek a top - two finish in a league that contains clubs who have been outspending arsenal significantly , to finish second is not to be sniffed at and had it not been for the crippling injury problems that afflicted arsenal , again , at the start of this season , who knows how much closer to chelsea they might have been
but that âs how it âs been with arsenal over the past 10 years â a severe case of the â might have beens â â what might have been had they not lost so many top players to manchester city and barcelona and manchester united , or if laurent koscielny and wojciech szczesny not been monumental idiots in the league cup final , or the oil money not flooded in as soon as the club lay the foundations for the emirates or eduardo âs leg not been snapped in 2008 when arsenal were running away with the league or last season when injuries did the same , albeit in a less dramatic fashion
or , or , or ...
if i âm honest , it 's all got a little tedious for many fans , which is why the fa cup success last season was celebrated so wildly â a nice little change of pace from finishing fourth and embarrassing ourselves in the knockouts
the departures of thierry henry ( left ) and cesc fabregas ( right ) to barcelona in the past were huge blows arsenal players mathieu flamini ( left ) , olivier giroud ( middle ) and aaron ramsey ( right ) celebrate fa cup success in may 2014 - the club 's ended a nine - year trophy drought arsene wenger has come under a barrage of criticism from arsenal fans after last wednesday 's defeat to monaco i ca nât speak for all arsenal fans
such is the divide between gooners , nobody could do that ( so do nât trust anyone who claims they do )
for some fans nothing short of a trophy every year would represent success to them , regardless of how stupid that expectation is
for others they recognise how hard it is to just get in the top four every year ( do nât believe me , ask spurs , liverpool , manchester united , even chelsea who dropped out for a season ) and how the footballing landscape has changed so dramatically over the past decade
ultimately , football is about what you can celebrate and while it âs great fun to get into the champions league every year , at least until the group stages are over , it âs just not the same as watching your captain lift aloft that great big trophy
after years of scrapping fourth , i âd be more than content should arsenal grab second place
i want more , though , and i think that is the one and only thing that unites arsenal fans â they all want more
how patient we all plan to be for it to arrive is another matter altogether
