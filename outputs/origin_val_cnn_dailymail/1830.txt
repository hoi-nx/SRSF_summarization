tinder users attending the south - by - southwest festival in austin , texas , have been left bitterly disappointed after a profile for an attractive young woman turned out to be little more than an elaborate marketing ploy for a new movie
the profile for a 25 - year - old female named ava first appeared on the dating app on saturday and soon male users in the austin area were keen to hook - up
one person eager to swipe right and make a connection with ava was a male called brock
as ava started to question brock it quickly became clear that all was not what it appeared to be
ava asked brock if he has ever been in love , then she explained that she had nât and asked him what it was that made him human
â what attracts you to me ? â asked ava , sounding increasingly like an automated chatbot
the conversation ended with ava telling brock that he has â passed my test ' and she invited him to visit her instagram account
unfortunately for meetava account turned out to be just a promotional tool for the forthcoming sci - fi movie ex machina and it featured a photo and video promoting the film
the face of ava is in fact swedish actress alicia vikander , who plays an artificial intelligence in the film which is released next month and was screened at sxsw on saturday
spare a thought for poor brock who was devastated at discovering that ava was n't real
it ' toyed with my emotions so hard , ' he told adweek
