â he has my complete support , â said arsenal boss arsene wenger
â we all have to respect the referee and make their jobs as easy as possible
it âs difficult enough for the referees â they are criticised a lot , and i include myself
i do remind my players but i do nât think we have a problem with that
greg dyke , pictured at the mel brooks bfi fellowship dinner on friday , promised to take action to protect referees from hoards of players surrounding them arsene wenger has promised to back the fa chairman over stopping ref intimidation â we have never been reproached so on that front i do nât question myself too much
i question myself on my individual behaviour , that âs true
â arsene wenger is often quick to let off steam at the fourth official and added : â even sometimes at half - time i think , â come on , stop that , my friend â , you know ? and i think in the second half i will not say a word to him any more
â sometimes it helps you to get your frustration out but i do nât think it is right , honestly
that does nât mean i do nât do it
i âve looked back on the tapes sometimes
â arsene wenger , who admits he needs to rein in his criticism of referees , talks to the fourth official on tuesday night the arsenal manager has word with the fourth official during the champions league match against monaco arsene wenger also fears the officials are getting drawn into the thick of the action when they could be more peripheral
â i have spoken about this with referees , â he said
â maybe they are too close today because sometimes they are in the way of the pass
i can show you situations where they hide the vision of the pass
because they are so directly involved they are surrounded sometimes when they should keep a bit of distance
â arsene wenger admits there are times when managers like to see their players showing desire and unity but agrees with greg dyke and uefa president michel platini , who is also investigating ways to banish the problem in european games
eight chelsea players surround the referee as they try to get zlatan ibrahimovic sent off for psg â we want everybody to be respected and the referees are part of everybody , â said the arsenal boss
â what we have to do is respect the decisions
the referees know the worst offenders but i like to think it does nât work
referees are prepared for that nowadays
they are warned and they can deal with it
â i agree completely that you want players to be ready to fight for each other
how far does that go ? you have to draw a line somewhere
you can not go after every decision of the referee
â in rugby it did nât exist
unfortunately since they have become professional i have seen signs of them starting to question the decisions of the referees
so it may be a result of the pressure of the professional game
