from the aroma of fresh coffee to the unpleasant whiff of the subway , new york has its own heady mix of signature smells
while this mixture can , at times , be overpowering , back in the 19th century , smells in the city were far more pungent and permanent than they are today
so much so , that the health authorities at the time decided to create maps of stenches to show the location of smells from areas such as oil refineries , fat renderers , slaughter houses and gas works
new york began complaining to the board of health about ' the most nauseous , foul , stinking , and pestilential odours '
as a result , many of the worst - smelling industries ended up in brooklyn , with the industrial landscape leaving its mark there today
for instance , the newtown creek area on the border of brooklyn and queens remains the site of a sewage treatment plant now citylab has found one of these historic maps from 1870 that shows different industrial sites across manhattan and brooklyn , as the five boroughs were yet to be consolidated
but it was n't just industrial smells that caused problems for new york
the map was produced at a time when new york was experiencing unprecedented growth
during the 1860s and 1870s , 2,000 new buildings were constructed each year , as immigration peaked at 200,000 to 300,000 people annually
the increase in population meant an increase in waste
public baths , drinking fountains , and restrooms were only built 1897 , and flies plagued the streets
as a result , new york began complaining to the board of health about ' the most nauseous , foul , stinking , and pestilential odours ' , in the 19th century , it was believed that these foul odors carried diseases , so the new york city metropolitan board of health created the map to highlight the areas affected
' trying to show smells , which are not concrete - they 're invisible , they 're ephemeral , they 're always changing - is just a really fascinating cultural project , ' says kiechle , a historian at virginia tech university told atlantic 's citylab
the map was produced at a time when new york was experiencing huge growth
during the 1860s and 1870s , 2,000 new buildings were constructed each year , as immigration peaked at 200,000 to 300,000 people annually

public baths and restrooms were built only after 1897 , and flies were everywhere

but it turns out it may be our language that is hampering our sense of smell
researchers found those who use english as their first language can take five times as long to describe an odour than they can a colour
however , native speakers from the jahai tribe in perak , malaysia , described odours far more consistently and in less time than colour
the jahai have at least 12 specific abstract words that relate to smells while the maniq , a tribe of hunter gatherers in southern thailand , have 15 words
tanvi misra notes how health officials at the time had to sniff the air to document where the smells were coming from and which way they were blowing
the map largely highlighted industrial smells and a new york times reporter at the time described their job with heavy sarcasm , according to a report by ms kiechle
' the homes of these [ sickening stenches ] are along the shores of the east river , and by dodging in and out of slips with a tug - boat , and by creeping and climbing over oil - lighters and rotten string - pieces , they were finally reached by the committeemen without loss of life or limb , ' he said
many of the worst - smelling industries ended up in brooklyn , with the industrial landscape leaving its mark there today
for instance , the newtown creek area on the border of brooklyn and queens remains the site of a sewage treatment plant
citylab notes that winds would still carry smells from brooklyn to manhattan , causing problems between regulators in each of the districts
manhattan had some of its own smells to contend with
meat marketing and processing facilities , for example , were established along the shoreline at the time
to reduce the smell , the board pushed slaughterhouses north of 40th street in 1868 and then banned them from between 40th street in 1870 , according to thechemical heritage foundation
while the idea that smells carry disease has long passed , authorities are still keen to map areas of the city that contribute to illness
last month , scientists from weill cornell medical college a unveiled ' microbial map ' of the city after spending 18 months swabbing turnstiles , ticket kiosks , railings and benches for dna on the world 's largest transport system
they found 15,152 different types of microorganisms that share the train with its 5.5 million riders , including bubonic plague , dysentery and meningitis
