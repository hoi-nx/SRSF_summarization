the terrorists gave no explanation for why they had chosen to free the 19 men and three women , who were packed on a bus in the isis - held town of shaddadeh , and arrived safely at the church of the virgin mary in the nearby city of hassakeh yesterday afternoon
the news provided a modicum of relief to a christian assyrian community that has been devastated by the abductions
