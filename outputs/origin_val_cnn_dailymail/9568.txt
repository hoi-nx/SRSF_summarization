the men appeared to have hooked a barramundi and were reeling it in when the massive mass of sharp teeth and scale got the jump on them
thrilled with the seeming size of their catch , one of the fisherman is heard saying ' he 's a good fish , mate ' to another man off camera
' did you get it yet , dad ? ' sean evans , who filmed the catch , can be heard asking just seconds before the dinosauric creature made its entrance
with one swift swipe the croc had knicked the catch from the fishermen , who were left to marvel at their close encounter , and be thankful they had n't been hanging a limb over the edge of the boat within biting range
