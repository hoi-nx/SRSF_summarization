toast of new york has been ruled out of the dubai world cup at meydan on march 31 after suffering a setback
a stunning winner of the uae derby on dubai world cup night last march , jamie osborne 's stable star ended his three - year - old campaign with a fantastic effort in defeat when beaten just a nose by bayern in the breeders ' cup classic at santa anita in november
sheikh joaan al thani 's al shaqab operation stepped in to buy the colt earlier this year , and jamie osborne had been preparing him for a tilt at the world 's richest race where he would have been ridden by frankie dettori
toast of new york , pictured here with trainer jamie osborne , is set for a spell on the sidelines toast of new york is , however , now set for a spell on the sidelines
the trainer said : ' he 's had a setback and , sadly , he 's going to miss the dubai world cup
i have to speak to the al shaqab team and i 'm sure we 'll be formulating another plan
' it 's very disappointing for sheikh joaan and his team , and obviously for everybody here but he 'll be back
