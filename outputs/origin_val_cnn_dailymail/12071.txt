things got very steamy this morning at the today show studios when host hoda and tv personality regis took part in new charity dare the twizzler challenge live on air , and shared a passionate - if very one - sided - kiss
hoda , 50 , looked as though she got rather more than she bargained for when regis , 83 , energetically took the lead on the act ; requiring them to each take opposite ends of one twizzler , place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle
when hoda 's quick peck on regis ' lips at the end of the challenge did not seem to satisfy her former nbc co-host , he grabbed her head with both hands and delivered her a passionate smooch , as hoda froze up in surprise
once the concept , which aims to raise awareness for autism , was explained to regis during his guest segment on the show this morning , he enthusiastically asked : ' are we going to kiss ? ' ' i 'm not sure , ' responded hoda , before timidly spritzing his open mouth with breath spray
' let me look at your lips , ' regis exclaimed , leaning in
' she could swallow me ! i 've never seen lips like that
honest to god , something 's going to happen
' and indeed it did
hoda nibbled at the licorice straw until she reached regis ' lips , before issuing him a conservative peck
too much ? today host hoda , 50 , ( right ) got more than she bargained for as part of this morning 's twizzler challenge , when former co-host regis , 83 , ( left ) smothered her with an enthusiastic smacker not finished : hoda gave regis a quick peck , before jerking her head away from him regis then launched in for a full - on smooch , as hoda darted her head away , only for regis to grab her back and give her a lingering mouth - to - mouth smacker
' boy you look like you went in there ! ' squealed kathie lee , as hoda recovered in stunned silence
' it was pretty good , ' attested regis , lipstick smeared over his face
' you got a boyfriend ? ' much like the now - infamous als ice bucket challenge , those who fail to complete the twizzler test after being nominated have to donate to manhattan - based charity new york collaborates for autism
last week at the nbc studios , matt lauer and kathie lee were nominated by fellow today correspondent meredith vieira
meredith vieira explained that she first took the challenge with today co-anchor willie the previous week on her talk show and later donated $ 5,000 to support autism programs nationwide
get away ! hoda tried to push regis away as he lunged in to take the kiss even further recovery : hoda was visibly shaken after the amorous display , which took place live on air ' this is clearly a transparent attempt by meredith vieira once gain to make out with her colleague , ' willie joked on the morning show
meredith vieira immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge matt lauer , but remained coy about who his partner would be
' is there anybody around that we can ask ? ' willie said
savannah , who was sitting next to matt lauer , quickly left her chair
' i am willing to get up out of this seat , ' she said as she made room for matt lauer 's partner
when kathie lee walked on stage , matt lauer enthusiastically told her : ' get over here
' panic : ironically , it was regis who was most concerned about the challenge before it began , telling hoda that he was worried she would ' swallow him ' because of the size of her lips kathie lee joked to matt lauer : ' your world is going to be on fire
' ' this is nothing compared to what goes on in the make - up room , ' she added
as kathie lee and matt lauer sat face to face , they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause
' and then we get to challenge somebody , ' matt lauer explained
kathie lee stared at matt lauer with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the twizzler that was in her mouth , quickly moving towards her partner
' really aggressive , ' willie commented from the sidelines
follow the leader : hoda and regis were officially challenged to take on the twizzler challenge by today hosts matt lauer and kathie lee , who themselves took part last week ( pictured ) matt lauer pulled away as kathie lee 's lips brushed his , only to move back into to give her another kiss
' i love you anyway , ' he said
' i would have done that for nothing
' someone else joked : ' who the lady and whose the lady and the tramp ? ' after their epic kiss , kathie lee nominated her former co-host regis and her current co-star hoda for the twizzler challenge
after their epic kiss , kathie lee nominated regis and hoda for the twizzler challenge
but matt lauer had a different pairing in mind , noting that the cast of mad men would be on the show on monday
fun moment : hoda 's fellow today show hosts willie and meredith vieira took the twizzler challenge on her talk show new nominees : daily mail online editor - at - large piers morgan and nina parker also took the challenge on access hollywood ' i 'm available , ' savannah said as soon as the good looking cast was mentioned
matt lauer ultimately chose actors jon hamm and john slattery to take on the challenge
' if john slattery needs an understudy for that twizzler challenge with jon hamm , i am available , ' savannah reminded matt lauer again
the twizzler challenge started earlier this month at comedy central 's night of too many stars benefit for autism , which was hosted by jon stewart
when someone on twitter dared willie and orange is the new black star uzo aduba to have a lady and the tramp moment with licorice in exchange for a donation , the twizzler challenge was born
access hollywood co-hosts billy bush and kit hoover also took up the same candy - based encounter on their show last friday before nominating daily mail online editor - at - large piers morgan and his fellow guest nina parker to do the same
' i got to say that was really enjoyable , ' piers morgan said after they completed the challenge .
