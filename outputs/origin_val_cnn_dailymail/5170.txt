while many of us will try and catch a glimpse of the solar eclipse tomorrow morning , the striking astronomical phenomenon may confuse animals
experts have warned that darkening skies could make nocturnal animals such as owls more alert and cause creatures that are usually awake during the day , such as sheep , to find a place to sleep - as well as possibly silencing songbirds
while animals may not react as strongly as during a total eclipse , zoos are still preparing for the partial eclipse that will see skies darken slightly across the uk at around 9.30am tomorrow morning

â here at zsl london zoo âs butterfly paradise , we âll amend the lighting slightly to counter this during the partial solar eclipse on the 20 march
â an expert from london told mailonline that the eclipse could affect the flight of nocturnal moths and diurnal butterflies ( an owl butterfly is shown ) tomorrow , the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun , casting a shadow over earth
the proportion of sun covered by the moon during the near - total solar eclipse will be higher in the north of the uk , so while there be an 84 per cent eclipse in london , manchester will see an 89 per cent eclipse and 94 per cent in glasgow , aberdeen and edinburgh , meaning that animals in scotland may react more strongly than those in the south of england
the most â complete â eclipse in the uk will be seen from lerwick in the shetland isles
timings will vary , so that in london , the partial eclipse - when the moon starts touching the sun 's edge - will begin at 8.24am
the eclipse will peak at 9.31am and this will be the point when the moon is closest to the centre of the sun. by 10.41am , the moon will leave the sun 's edge and the partial eclipse will end
for spectators in edinburgh , for example , the eclipse will begin , peak and end four minutes later
robin scagell , vice president of the spa ( spa ) told mailonline : ' it will still be broad daylight and no darker than if there were some cloud in front of the sun , â but anecdotes from past partial eclipses hint that animals will still notice the change
broom , emeritus professor of animal welfare at the university of cambridge , told mailonline that the most people will notice that many of the common birds might stop singing and some may move to higher perches or more secluded spots to feel safer
. ' farm animals out in the fields might stop grazing and move to a more sheltered place as they do at night , ' he said , before adding that because all animals have 24 hour body clocks , they know it is not night time but that something unusual is going on
professor broom also said that pet dogs and cats will probably be ' sightly disturbed ' by tomorrow 's eclipse
they 'll notice it will get dark , ' he said , before adding : ' although night happens every day , you do n't have a substantial change in light intensity in the morning , so it 's a bit disturbing for them
' dogs , for example , will probably be more alert and pay more attention to what 's going on around them more then usual because they will be ' sightly surprised '
the eclipse will see up to 84 per cent of the sun covered in london and around 94 per cent in glasgow , aberdeen and edinburgh
a partial eclipse will be visible across europe , africa and russia for about 90 minutes
this suggests that animals living nearer the arctic circle may react more strongly charlotte vermeulen , a biologist at the artis zoo in amsterdam told nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark , because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of â night - time â
for example , sheep ( stock image ) may find a place to sleep tomorrow projection : place a pinhole or small opening in a card , and hold it between the sun and a screen â giant sheet of white paper works â a few feet away
filters : the sun can be viewed directly only when using filters specifically designed for this purpose
such filters have a thin layer of aluminum , chromium or silver on the surfaces
telescopes with solar filters : there are sun - specific telescopes available for sale - or perhaps through a local astronomy club - that are also safe for viewing a partial eclipse
charlotte vermeulen , a biologist at the artis zoo in amsterdam told nasa that animals tend to act strangely when the sky turns dark , because they are disorientated by the sudden appearance of â night time â
she said : ' diurnal animals - those that are awake during the day - do what they usually do at night : sleep ! â dragonflies hide under a leaf , ants return to their nest , sheep walk back to their sleeping place , cattle egrets ( heron - like birds ) return to their nocturnal roost , diurnal grasshoppers chirp more slowly and then stop
â â nocturnal animals become active : owls hoot , bats fly , blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning , cocks crow , nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping , and so on
â bees may become more active during the partial eclipse , based on a study conducted in india
experts at the zoological survey of india studied rock bees during an eclipse in june 1955 and found that when the sun was hidden behind the moon , 150 bees buzzed out of a hive , instead of the normal 25 or so , the atlantic reported
â it would appear that during the partial solar eclipse on the 20th june , the rock bees became distinctly restless and more active , â ml roonwall , who led the study said
during a partial eclipse in 2001 , desert cicadas in arizona fell silent in a break from their normal calling , suggesting similar insects such as crickets may do the same in the uk
the solar eclipse is set to block out nearly 90 per cent of sunlight across parts of europe
on the morning of the 20 march the moon 's orbit will see it travel in front of the sun casting a shadow over earth - and the eclipse will be the biggest event of its kind since 11 august 1999 ( pictured over germany ) â nocturnal animals become active [ during an eclipse ] : owls hoot , bats fly , blackbirds sing like they do in the early morning , cocks crow , nocturnal grasshoppers start chirping , and so on , â one expert said experts think this may have happened because of a drop in temperature under the eclipse âs shadow and because calling takes a lot of energy , it was impossible for the insects to keep up their method of communication
in 1973 , researchers found that captive squirrels became restless in the run up to and during an eclipse , indicating that native squirrels may notice tomorrow âs unusual astronomical spectacles
in the study , the animals increased the length of this â non-stop running sessions â
there is also evidence that blue bulls changed the amount of time they spent eating and resting , hinting that cows â daily lives may be disrupted during tomorrow âs partial eclipse
during a 2001 solar eclipse in africa , self - proclaimed eclipse chaser , todd thompson witnessed strange animal behaviour in zambia
it is guesswork as to how some birds may react tomorrow
some evidence points to blackbirds ( stock image ) singing during the astronomical event , while other other birds have fallen silent when the moon has blocked out the sun the eclipse could disrupt solar power supplies across europe , energy experts have warned
the spread of huge solar arrays across the eu means that more than 10 per cent of the continent âs electricity now comes from solar panels
with power supply so reliant on the sun âs rays , the solar eclipse on 20 march might lead to blackouts
electricity system operators have warned that the eclipse poses â an unprecedented test for europe âs electricity system â
the european network transmission system operators for electricity , a group of power supply organisations , said : â the risk of incident can not be completely ruled out
â solar eclipses have happened before but with the increase of installed photovoltaic energy generation , the risk of an incident could be serious without appropriate countermeasures
â the organisation said it had been planning so - called â countermeasures â for months , with suppliers across europe set to help balance the load with more energy from other power stations as solar electricity drops off
the eclipse is not expected to cause blackouts in uk because so little of our power comes from solar power
despite a boom in uk solar arrays in recent years , particularly in southern england , solar power today provides just 1.5 per cent of our electricity needs
the national grid said it expected solar power output in uk to halve from an average march figure of 3,000 megawatts to 1,700 megawatts
he said in a blog post that birds went to roost as the sky darkened , crickets and cicadas fell silent and even mosquitoes vanished
paul murdin , visiting professor of astronomy at liverpool john moores university , collected observations from 250 members of wildlife and environment zimbabwe ( wez ) during the same eclipse
he wrote that hippos looked nervous and alert in a river , unsure if it was dawn or dusk and once the eclipse ended , there was a â crescendo of loud dawn chorus - like calls â from turtle doves , after they had fallen silent though the event
â by contrast frogs in the river called at totality and ceased calling when the light reappeared , â he wrote
this observation may suggest that birds could cease singing in parts of the uk tomorrow during the partial eclipse , while frogs may call loudly .
