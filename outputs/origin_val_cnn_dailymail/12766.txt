" the school called her to say the costume was not appropriate and that scholes would not take part in the book day event or appear in any photographs , scholes told the paper
a teacher from the school had dressed as the fictional serial killer dexter , scholes said : " i do n't see why sex is more offensive than murder

" scholes told the bbc the costume was light - hearted : " it was a laugh , it was tongue in cheek and there was no offense

' i thought fifty shades was the most talked about book character for the past few years
" sale high school issued a statement saying its actions reflected its " high standards in terms of student behavior , welfare and safeguarding
