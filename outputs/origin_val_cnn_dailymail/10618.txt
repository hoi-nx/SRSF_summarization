george north has been warned he could put his career in jeopardy if he plays again this season after suffering a third confirmed concussion in the space of four months
the northampton and wales winger , who sustained two head injuries against england in february but was controversially allowed to play on after medics missed the incidents , was knocked unconscious again on friday night in northampton saints ' aviva premiership win over wasps
northampton director of rugby jim mallinder indicated after the game that the 22 - year - old could still be considered for next saturday 's european champions cup clash with clermont , but brain injury experts insist he should not play again this season

if he does play again too soon it could be the end of his world cup or even his career
' the people looking after him , including northampton and the welsh rugby union , should be recommending some time out and the experts he is seeing should recommend some time out
' no - one should be talking about playing him next week
i know at this time of year we 're getting into the thick of it for trophies and championships but it 's also getting into the sharp end for george north 's brain
' i would be surprised if he makes another appearance
' the people who are minding him and looking after his career should be saying to him that in world cup year , even if he feels 100 per cent better in six weeks , it is not worth risking his chance on the highest stage

earlier this week former wales international jonathan davies said he feared for leigh halfpenny 's career if the full back did not improve a tackling technique that contributed to him being concussed in his side 's final six nations win over italy
the north and brown cases have again raised questions over rugby 's return - to - play protocols , which can permit concussed players to play again within six days if they are shown to be symptom free
in professional boxing , a sport with a concussion rate comparable to professional rugby 's , any fighter who loses consciousness for less than a minute faces a mandatory 90 day stand down
a loss of consciousness of more than a minute leads to an enforced 180 day rest period
north was also knocked out twice during wales ' six nations defeat by england earlier this year the winger played on that day but missed the next match as wales medics were criticised for their decision
