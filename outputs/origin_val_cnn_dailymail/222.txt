' it dramatically emerged today that the co-pilot of the a320 that crashed into the alps locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane
the final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by france prosecutors who said it was 28 - year - old lubitz 's plan to ' destroy the plane '
the qantas review comes as airlines and aviation regulators around the world have begun taking steps to ensure there are always two people in the cockpit
tragedy : it emerged today that germanwings co-pilot lubitz ( pictured ) locked the plane 's pilot out of the cockpit and ' deliberately ' crashed the plane into the alps , killing 150 people on board lubitz was sitting in this cockpit , pictured , when he commanded the jet to crash into the alps at 400mph the civil aviation authority urged airlines to review their policies to avoid the pilot or co-pilot being alone at the controls and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it ' mandatory ' across airlines
in the uk , easyjet and virgin atlantic announced plans to change their aviation policy on staff numbers in the cockpit
monarch and thomas cook also confirmed they had changed their policies , while ryanair , jet2 and flybe said they already required two crew members to be in the cockpit at all times
elsewhere around europe , the continent 's third - largest budget carrier , norwegian air shuttle , said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons
a civil aviation authority spokesman said : ' following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic germanwings incident , we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the easa ( easa ) and have contacted all uk operators to require them to review all relevant procedures
horror : after voice recordings emerged from the doomed a320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door , easyjet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet ' all uk airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence
as part of this , aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot 's mental health at each medical examination which , for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot , is undertaken annually
' these detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards
' we will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident
' doomed : the captain of the ill - fated flight - named by local media as german father - of - two patrick sonderheimer - left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter ( file photo ) ' deliberate ' : marseille prosecutor robin said lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent , something that can only be done manually it also transpired today that the germanwings co-pilot who flew the plane into the alps at 400mph had to stop his training because he was suffering from depression and ' burnout '
mr lubitz - whose family were at the scene of the crash in seyne today - postponed his pilot training in 2008 due to mental health issues and a friend said he was ' in depression '
airline bosses confirmed lubitz had taken several months off work and had to retrain to join the firm but insisted he was ' 100 % fit to fly '
german police have since raided lubitz 's â¬ 500,000 family home in montabaur in german as well as his apartment in dusseldorf
heart - broken : family of the victims of the crash gathered near the scene in le vernet near the alps today , as rescuers tried to recover the dead bodies of their deceased relatives rescue : helicopters lowered investigators down to the scene of the obliterated plane where debris and human remains were scattered at an extraordinary press conference earlier , marseille prosecutor robin gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box
he said lubitz locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck
at that point , lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent , something that can only be done manually - and deliberately
he said : ' the intention was to destroy the plane
the plane hit the mountain at 700kmh ( 430mph )
' i do n't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds '
raid : german police have investigated lubitz 's â¬ 500,000 family home in montabaur in german as well as his apartment in dusseldorf killer 's home : a france prosecutor in marseille said mr lubitz 's breathing was normal as the plane descended rapidly before crashing into the france alps earlier in the flight , mr robin said lubitz 's responses were initially courteous , but became ' curt ' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane
the captain - named by local media as german father - of - two patrick sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter
mr robin said : ' we hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something
' so the co-pilot is on his own , and it is while he 's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane
' at this altitude , this can only be done voluntarily
we hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in , speaking through the intercom system , but there 's no answer from the cockpit
