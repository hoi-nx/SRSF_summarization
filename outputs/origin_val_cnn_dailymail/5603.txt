poyet could not have looked more despondent at the final whistle had the fans who tried to storm his dugout in the first half got to him , vented their ire in his face and made it crystal clear they felt that he was to blame
â i am responsible , â he said , looking as gloomy as at any point since he became sunderland âs manager in october 2013
â i âm extremely disappointed
i was nât expecting this to happen
but it âs football , i suppose
â it âs football , too , that woeful form and defeats like these lead to managerial sackings
poyet âs job prospects looked more dire by the minute as this match wore on
villa striker christian benteke slotted home the first goal in the 16th minute to end villa 's goal drought on the road gabriel agbonlahor ran on to ciaran clark 's long ball and beat sunderland keeper costel pantilimon to make it 2 - 0 sunderland ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) : costel pantilimon 4 ; reveillere 3.5 oâshea 3 , wes brown 3 , van aanholt 3 ; bridcutt 4 ; alvarez 3 ( wickham 46 , 5 ) , sebastian larsson 4.5 , rodwell 5 , fletcher 3 ( graham 82 ) ; defoe 3

â that was good , â said their manager tim sherwood
â we knew we could hurt them on the break with our pace and we used it â¦ i âm delighted with that
â thus villa leapfrogged sunderland and now look up towards safety while sunderland âs position remains precarious just above the relegation zone , no signs of revival in sight
the fans are revolting already , several of them apparently intent on launching physical attacks on poyet at 3 - 0 down
they were escorted from the dugout but other dangers remain for poyet
the pre-match narrative anticipated a dour 0 - 0 but the result and manner in which it was achieved left that not so much turned on its head but stumbling dazed to the exit
like many home fans even before half - time
a shocking lack of goals has characterised both teams all season , villa particularly
at the start of the day they had 38 league goals â between them
sunderland now have one league win in 12 games and villa have two in two , and three wins on the bounce in all competitions
tim sherwood âs appointment has had the transformational effect owner randy lerner envisaged and that many observers were sceptical would happen
gabriel agbonlahor cut inside wes brown before calmly slotting the ball past costel pantilimon for a second time in the 37th minute christian benteke extended the lead a minute before the break when he powered a header home from a bacuna cross christian benteke celebrates scoring their fourth goal against sunderland on saturday villa had scored a measly 15 premier league goals this season before kick - off and an even more pitiful four of those away from home , in seven months
it took 45 minutes to add another four
tim sherwood affected ignorance about the extent to which villa had been goal - shy before his arrival
â to be honest , i âd not taken too much notice of villa before i came here , â he said
â but we âve not had trouble scoring goals since i âve been here â¦ losing becomes a habit
â tim sherwood and poyet played together at tottenham and asked if he had sympathy for his old friend âs plight , tim sherwood said : â always
it âs not good when you get beaten heavily at home
but poyet will bounce back
he âs got a bigger heart than anyone
â poyet âs players lacked heart , application and attention as they were steamrollered by tim sherwood âs revitalised side before the break
in a sustained flow of one - way villa traffic and atrocious sunderland defending , the visitors put the game to bed nice and early
bacuna set up the opener with a square ball to christian benteke , who side - footed with his left foot low into the net
aston villa'smanager tim sherwood , right , celebrates as sunderland 's manger poyet , left , stands dejected thousands of sunderland fans left the stadium of light before the break as their side crumbled stewards and members of sunderland 's backroom staff attempt to stop irate fans getting to the dugout sunderland fans attempt to storm poyet 's dugout as the home side fell behind to villa that brought to an end a villa goal drought away from home that stretched back to december 2 last year : it had endured for six full league games and 614 minutes
it was something of a shock â and a source of joy bordering on delirium for their supporters â when villa doubled the lead inside two minutes
centre back ciaran clark sent a hoof the length of the left flank to gabriel agbonlahor , who ran with it and slotted home diagonally
villa might well have been three ahead when bacuna , again , made swift , easy progress down the right and crossed , to sinclair
but sinclair could only blaze over the bar from close range
the third goal came via a nâzogbia pass to the edge of the box , from where gabriel agbonlahor slalomed past wes brown and patrick van aanholt before slotting home
with a minute remaining before the break , bacuna was supplier again from the right , this time a high ball with pinpoint accuracy onto the head of christian benteke , who nodded home past costel pantilimon
the game was over as a contest
when sebastian larsson failed to appear for the second half , with play ongoing for three and a half minutes before he came from the tunnel , some wags in the crowd joked he may have feared getting back out there
in fact he had needed stitches in what poyet said was â a massive cut â in his leg
by the time he arrived nâzogbia , set up by christian benteke , had already tested pantilimon again
sunderland âs anthony rã©veillere and villa âs fabian delph both had shots saved
but sunderland never threatened to get back into this , not remotely
â we âre gon na win 5 - 4 , â chanted their fans
those who were left .
