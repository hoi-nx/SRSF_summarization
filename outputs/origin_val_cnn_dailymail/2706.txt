hudson , 22 , left bennett with life - threatening injuries after attacking him without warning as they walked out of a marquee set up in the grounds of a luxury farmhouse
mr bennett was left with shards of glass in his neck narrowly missing a vital artery and was aided by two trained nurses attending the wedding before being rushed to hospital and operated on
he said he was lucky to survive the attack given the nature and location of his injuries
in a victim impact statement mr bennett said : ' i hope he recognises his reckless actions could so easily have been fatal
' hudson never gave an explanation for the incident or give any indication as to why he had attacked his friend at the wedding of his sister chantelle and brett gregson
at preston crown court , lancashire , self - employed plasterer hudson , of kirkham , was found guilty of wounding after a trial
the incident took place in may last year at a Â£ 500,000 farmhouse owned by the bridegroom 's parents in the rural village of wrea green
a marquee had been erected at the farm for the guests attending the event following the wedding of hudson 's unnamed sister
the court heard hudson went after mr bennett with a glass and confronted the victim before smashing it against his neck
prosecutor mr haworth said : ' the complainant wishes he could understand why it took place and hopes the defendant is remorseful and regrets what he has done
' he recounts how he lies in bed at night and relives matters and thinks about the consequences
he expresses his gratitude to the surgeons at the royal preston hospital to remove the shards of glass still in the very vulnerable area of the neck
random attack : the court heard how hudson ( pictured ) went after mr bennett with a glass and confronted the victim before smashing it against his neck ' he describes having problems sleeping , taking prescription sleeping tablets and describes how he awakes often in distress
his self confidence had hit rock bottom and feels very self conscious as to the scar on his neck
he feels on edge when he is out and aware of stares and finger pointing
' he is paranoid that everyone is looking at him and does from time to time wear clothing to hide it , scarves to avoid people asking questions
he does n't want to go out at all
' he added that mr bennett attends therapy and may need plastic surgery in the future for the ' raised and angry scarring '
he added : ' the impact upon his social life , he avoids get togethers and family meals and hates being the centre of attention
he is embarrassed and vulnerable to questions put to him about how he is
' mr haworth added that he had been an avid manchester city fan and had held a season ticket for many years travelling to home , away and even abroad games
however since the attack he is no longer confident enough to go
left lasting scars : since hudson ( pictured ) attacked bennett , the victim has suffered paranoia and has struggled to sleep
he may also need plastic surgery mr haworth added that it was ' a huge change to what his social life used to be ' and that his circle of friends has reduced
mr bennett also suffered at work and found it difficult dealing with customers , feeling self - conscious and said his business had suffered
hudson had two convictions in the last six years for battery and disorderly behaviour and nine years ago he was given a caution for assault occasioning actual body harm
his counsel iain simkin said the single but ' damaging ' blow had occurred whilst he was drunk
he added : ' he does present as a docile character whilst in drink he behaves in a wholly different way
' there is genuine remorse even though there was a trial , particularly as he considers the victim was a friend
' his judgement was skewed by drink
he has the support of a loving family , they understand what is going to happen to him and understand he is going to prison for what he has done
' passing sentence judge stuart baker told hudson : ' you now realise the enormity of what you did and realise how close mr bennett came to possibly losing his life ' passing sentence judge stuart baker told hudson
' you now realise the enormity of what you did and realise how close mr bennett came to possibly losing his life
' quite why you behaved in the way you did , no one is likely to know
others who speak well of you are at a loss as to why you behaved the way you did
' your conduct is not excused by being in drink
committing an offence whilst fuelled by alcohol is aggravating to the offence , it is not an excuse
' you committed the offence when mr bennett was leaving the premises where the party had taken place
' he was beyond the gateway , he was on the road walking away from the property when you attacked him when you had a glass in your hand
it may have been that when you left you did not have in your mind attacking him with the glass
' you went after him , when you did confront him for reasons known only to yourself you struck him with the glass to the side of the neck that caused not only life threatening injuries but very unsightly scarring he will have to live with for the rest of his life long after you have served your prison sentence
' the effect on his has been quite substantial
he realises how close he came to losing his life
he is troubled at night
hudson was sentenced to three and a half years at preston crown court , above , today ' he ca n't fully understand why it happened
his confidence is at a very low ebb , understandably he is very self conscious
i have no reason to doubt it has had a significant impact upon his social life
' you used a glass as a weapon , thankfully it was not a weapon which was already smashed but even in its state it was still a weapon
' he added that he must also bear in mind hudson 's previous convictions
' you have resorted to violence rather than walking away from violence
this incident occurred at what should have been an extremely happy event
' many people were present , they would have been understandably shocked by what they saw when mr bennett returned in his injured state
' all those who saw mr bennett would have been greatly shocked by the scene
