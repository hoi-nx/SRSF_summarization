russian president putin has described a secret meeting with officials last year when russian decided it would take crimea â the black sea that moscow annexed from ukraine last march
in a trailer for an upcoming documentary , shown on state - owned television late sunday , putin said that he met with security officials in february to make plans for saving ukraine 's then - president viktor yanukovych , who fled power after months of pro-european protests in the ukraine capital
' we got ready to get him right out of donetsk by land , by sea or by air , ' he said
' heavy machine guns were mounted there so that there would n't be much discussion about it
' the minute - long trailer was overlaid with dramatic music and sweeping shots of the crimea coast
the channel , rossiya - 1 , did not specify when the full film would be released
the kremlin originally denied that it had sent troops into crimea , though putin later announced on state television that russian troops had been sent in
viktor yanukovych was safely on russian soil by late february , when russian 's military was establishing its presence in crimea
putin said that he met with security officials in february to make plans for saving ukraine 's then - president viktor yanukovych , pictured the virtually bloodless seizure of crimea - a black sea peninsula with an ethnic russian majority and where moscow has a naval base - was followed by a pro-moscow insurgency in the east of ukraine
about 6,000 people have been killed in the fighting in eastern ukraine
a fragile ceasefire , greed last month in minsk , has largely held so far

novaya gazeta , a newspaper often critical of putin , published details last month of what it said was a document presented to the presidential administration some time between february 4 and 12 last year
it said the document described a plan to annex crimea and eastern ukraine
the kremlin called the newspaper 's report nonsense .
