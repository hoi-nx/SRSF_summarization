the paris is often captured in all its beauty with a series of images that show off its romantic side
but an american filmmaker has created a three - minute video that presents paris in an entirely unique way
sean collins , a 31 - year - old from la , used special effects to make the french capital 's famous landmarks , including the eiffel tower and arc de triomphe , and pedestrians look like miniature toys
the video is the work of photographer sean collins , who studied at the american school of paris the american video maker captures a shot of the eiffel tower in the distance of his unique film sean collins filmed the scenes over the course of eight days while visiting his girlfriend , a boston university student who is studying in paris
he said : â when i went to visit her we decided to make this video
on her days off she accompanied me to the sites to film
â we could n't film on rainy , cloudy or days with poor air quality and we had to go to each location multiple times
â sean collins , who was educated at the american school of paris , but later studied at a film school in california , explained that his intention was to present the french capital in a way it has never been seen before
sean collins experimented with effects that make paris famous landmarks look like small toy sets the people captured underneath the eiffel tower in a timelapse shot appear to look like figurines he said : â my goal was to show paris to the world in a new light for those who have never had the experience or never managed to make it those sites
â the video opens on a landscape shot of the city , with the eiffel tower and army museum appearing to be positioned almost too close together
the champ de mars is presented in beautiful saturated green colours with people walking around it , appearing to look like figurines
sean collins spent two weeks testing different ways to change the texture of the different images a train is captured in the film and appears to look like a toy being controlled by a child shots of boats travelling under bridges tie paris ' natural beauty with its urban iconography a couple of timelapse shots of the eiffel tower continue this theme before a train , which looks like it could be being controlled by a child , travels across a bridge
more landscape shots show a breakdancer looking like a puppet on a string and a group playing football
as darkness descends on the paris streets the landscapes become more beautiful , before daylight is reinstated and the traffic begins to swell
sean collins recorded the video over eight days with the help of his girlfriend who he was visiting in paris the arc de triomphe is momentarily captured before more close - ups shots of people looking like toys a distant shot of the arc de triomphe is momentarily captured before more close - ups of people negotiating busy streets
eventually the video concludes with footage of pigeons , a boat travelling under a bridge â which ties paris â beauty as a natural landscape and an urban city together â and a casual shot of the eiffel tower
discussing the difficulties faced while filming , sean collins explained that the final result is the product of much experimentation
sean collins 's goal was to show paris in a new light for those who have never had the chance to experience it sean collins had to prepare for each shot and was unable to film on rainy or cloudy days or days with poor air quality â it 's not as simple as just adding blur to the top and bottom to achieve the effect
i spent two weeks testing different ways to change the " texture " of the image , â he said
â i experimented with some really distorted toy - like effects but eventually settled on this more subtle effect
this was a combination of noise reduction and sharpening
