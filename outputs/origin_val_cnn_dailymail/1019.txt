' it was november 2012 and my youngest son had gone off to university - as a family we always sat at the table to eat , but my husband craig and i had pizza and were sitting with it on our knees
' i dropped some on my shirt and went to brush it off and felt a lump
' i had never noticed it before
' it was n't big
but it was substantial and i could definitely feel it - it was n't just like when you have a spot on your skin
' the next morning she phoned her gp - and was given an appointment within the hour
' they referred me to royal lancaster infirmary and i had an appointment later that day , ' said mrs melanie thorpe
' i met with a surgeon and they did scans
it was all so fast
' just five days after finding the lump , mrs melanie thorpe ( pictured before her illness ) , was given the devastating news she had cancer
she underwent a mastectomy , breast reconstruction and chemotherapy scans revealed she actually had two lumps , both of which were cancerous
in january 2013 , mrs melanie thorpe underwent eight - and - a - half hours of surgery
mrs melanie thorpe , who is mother to adam , 29 , alex , 27 , and niall , 20 , said : ' i had to have a full mastectomy , but they did reconstructive surgery at the same time

' doctors deemed the surgery to be a success and mrs melanie thorpe went on to have six rounds of chemotherapy
she now has six - monthly check ups to make sure the cancer has not returned
she added : ' the doctors told me had i not found the lump so early it would have grown and been terminal

breast lumps are common and have a number of different causes - and 90 per cent of them are benign
although most lumps are n't breast cancer , any unusual changes to the breasts should be checked by a gp as soon as possible , explain experts writing for the nhs choices website
if your gp finds a lump on examination , they will routinely refer you to be seen by a hospital specialist
while 90 per cent of breast lumps are benign , experts stress it 's important to be breast aware and take note of any changes or warning signs there are several types of benign ( non-cancerous ) breast lump , most of which are harmless and are caused by hormonal changes that occur at different times in a woman 's life , such as during the menstrual cycle
common types of benign breast lump include : * a fibroadenoma â a firm lump that moves around easily in the breast and is more common in younger women * a breast cyst â a smooth , firm fluid - filled lump most commonly seen in women aged 30 to 60 * a breast abscess â a painful collection of pus that forms under the skin of the breast , usually as the result of a bacterial infection the website advice stresses it 's important to be ' breast aware ' so you can identify any problems in your breasts and get them checked out as soon as possible
this means being familiar with your breasts and what is normal for them , and examining them regularly for any changes
if you are 50 years or over , it 's also important to attend breast cancer screening appointments every three years
but do n't wait until your next screening appointment if you notice any problems in your breast
you also should see your gp if you notice any other changes to one or both of your breasts , such as : * an area of thickened tissue * nipple discharge , which may contain blood * a change in the size or shape of your breasts * dimpling on the skin of your breasts * a rash on or around your nipples * a change in your nipple 's appearance â for example , becoming sunken into your breast * persistent pain in your breasts or armpits * a lump or swelling in your armpits source : nhs choices
