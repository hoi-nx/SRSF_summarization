a golden opportunity to register a rare victory on the pga tour slipped through the fingers of paul casey and poulter on monday
but their failure opened the door for an even more heart - warming outcome : victory for two - time open winner harrington at the second play - off hole of the honda classic at palm beach gardens in florida
the crushing decline of harrington has been documented well enough in the past six years
harrington celebrates his honda classic golf win on monday at palm beach gardens harrington tips his hat to the crowd as he walks to the green on the second playoff hole poulter plays his shot out of a bunker on the 14th hole during the honda classic with harrington in danger of falling outside the world âs top 300 , it seemed a mystery why he did nât put his name forward last month as a candidate to be europe âs captain at the ryder cup in minnesota next year
but the model irishman , now 43 , had the last word on monday with his first win in seven years on one of the two main tours
reduced to asking for invitations to play in america these days , he made full use of one at the honda classic
he led at halfway , and then in a see - saw final round he got the better of rookie america daniel berger having needed a birdie at the 18th to force a play - off
jack nicklaus opined that he could see tension in the harrington swing during the third round , which was hardly surprising given all the problems he âs had on the course these last few years

while the irishman managed just one top - five finish in majors over the next five years , his ranking plummeted from world no 2 to 297 at the start of this year
after yesterday âs win , harrington moves up to no 82 and qualifies for this year âs masters
and some of the putting woes that have contributed to his fall re-appeared during the final round , only for harrington to hold his nerve with a level - par 70 that set up the win
harrington said : â hopefully this is nât an isolated win
i think i have found that mental edge i had been missing and hopefully i can be consistently contending
believe it or not , when i get in contention i can still hit the shots
â for paul casey , it was the second week in a row he had experienced such frustration , after losing a sudden death play - off in the northern trust open last week
for poulter , who went into the water five times in a final round of 75 that left him tied third with paul casey , it means the long wait to register a stroke - play success on america soil , stretching back over 150 events and more than 10 years , goes on

â it âs just bitterly disappointing to put myself in the position i have , to play as well as i âve played ... and a couple of loose shots has cost me this tournament , â said poulter
â it âs a shame to hand tournaments away
â a monday finish at the honda classic proved a necessity after violent storms had wreaked havoc on friday and saturday

for paul casey , it âs further evidence that his career is now firmly back on track
the 37 - year - old turned his back on the european tour to concentrate on america this year and his decision has been vindicated by his golf over the past fortnight
barely inside the world âs top 100 at the beginning of february , he is on the verge of earning an invitation to play in the masters in april
the scene now switches 60 miles south to miami and the first event this year in which all the world âs best players are in the same place at the same time â the wgc cadillac championship at doral .
