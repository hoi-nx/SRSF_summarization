while he says retirement ' is not what i 'm thinking about ' , his teammates want to help him end his career with a win
' he 's been an outstanding contributor for us , ' brendon mccullum said
' he 's played for new zealand for half his life
' ( a win ) would be a great way to potentially send him off
' vettori is still a key member of the new zealand team and has demonstrated his value throughout the cricket world cup with a series of frugal bowling performances and cameo innings '
he was at the crease on 7 not out when grant elliott hit the winning runs in tuesday 's semi-final against south africa
vettori was at the crease with grant elliott ( right ) as he hit the winning runs against south africa vettori ahead of his test debut in wellington as a 17 - year - old way back in 1997 ' i guess it was potentially his last game on home soil and for him to be out there at the end and be as instrumental and as calm as he was under pressure , it was superb , ' brendon mccullum said
' he was struggling a bit with his back , too
he 's played a lot of his career with bumps and bruises and niggles and strains
he 's a tough customer and he 's been an amazing servant
' but vettori does n't want his swansong to distract new zealand from its aim of winning the cricket world cup for the first time
' it 's not what i 'm thinking about , ' he said
' it 's just about having some fun and enjoying the game and enjoying the build - up to a cricket world cup final , ' he said
' no - one else in new zealand cricket history has been able to experience that before so it 's pretty exciting to experience a grand final week
' the chance to play a cricket world cup final regardless of where you are in your career is something everyone dreams about
