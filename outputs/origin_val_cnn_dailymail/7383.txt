while messi , who was in london on sunday night with girlfriend antonella roccuzzo and former barcelona team - mate cesc fabregas and his partner daniella semaan , is continuing to break records this season morrison is just a mere spectator
the 22 - year - old , who has signed a pre-contract agreement with lazio , is a free agent
ravel morison has had his contract terminated at west ham ahead of his summer move to serie a side lazio however , the midfielder can not represent another club this season as he has played in two countries - england and wales - this term and fifa do n't allow a third
morrison only made two appearances under west ham boss sam allardyce this season ; with his last outing coming in a 3 - 1 home defeat to southampton back on august 31
a series of disciplinary problems had hampered his progress at upton park and he was loaned to birmingham , queens park rangers and cardiff city - with his three - month deal at the latter cut short earlier in december
however , the england under 21 international will now look to resume his career in italy next season
