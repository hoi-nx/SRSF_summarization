the 21 - year - old son of a utah doctor found guilty of murder in the 2011 death of his cancer researcher ex-wife has spoken out about how he fought for three years for his father to be convicted
salt lake city pediatrician john brickman wall , 51 , was convicted of killing uta von schwedler in september 2011 amid a bitter custody dispute
he faces up to life in prison
the case was highly contentious , with prosecutors alleging john brickman wall had murdered his wife while defense attorneys claimed von schwedler killed herself
their son , wall , said that though his father told him and his three siblings that their mother had killed herself , he did n't believe it
' as i thought about ... my dad 's behavior before and after her death , it became more and more apparent to me that - that he was responsible for killing her , ' wall told cbs 's 48 hours
prosecutors alleged john brickman wall attacked 49 - year - old uta von schwedler with a knife , dosed her with an anti-anxiety drug xanax and drowned her in her bathtub
defense attorneys countered that the theory was unbelievable , and it was more likely von schwedler killed herself
her death initially was treated as a suicide
but family and friends pushed for more investigation , saying the researcher showed no signs of wanting to end her life
wall told cbs that he feared for his and his sibling 's lives , worrying that they might be living with a murder
' part of the reason i was concerned for my safety as well as my sibling 's safety - was that i saw this anger that he had towards my mother , ' wall said
' it did n't die with her
it jumped and it expanded
' the couple 's oldest son , wall ( left ) had testified at the trial claiming that his father was acting bizarre after the family learned von schwedler had died
john wall ( right ) was found guilty of murdering his ex-wife in march uta von schwedler 's body was found in an overflowing bathtub in september 2011 and her death was initially ruled a suicide but further investigation led to the conviction of her ex-husband john brickman wall salt lake city officials made no effort to remove the children from john brickman wall 's home and the investigation was put on hold
on the day before his 18th birthday in january 2012 , wall moved out of his father 's house into the home of his best friend , jessica oglesby , and was welcomed by her parents with open arms
but he had left his siblings behind
' i realized that my presence there was not protecting my siblings , ' he told cbs , adding that his father was upset that he had moved out
' and once i had that realization and i moved out , then i could take active steps to protect them
' wall then fought for custody of his siblings and eventually won
the children were all moved into homes of family friends
his father sued him for a number of family scrapbooks that had been treasured items within the family
one of the books had been found next to von schwedler 's body
wall countered his father 's lawsuit with a wrongful death suit , holding his father responsible in the death of his mother
john brickman wall was eventually arrested and put on trial for the murder of von schwedler
the evidence in the case was unusual : a medical examiner thought the shallow cuts on von schwedler 's wrists and leg looked like she was defending herself from an attack , but he could n't explain the fatal level of xanax in her system
forensic experts had very different interpretations of the scene

he said now he wants a confession from his father for the prosecution , spilled antihistamine pills on the floor , a house in disarray and bloodstains in von schwedler 's bed showed she was attacked
the defense said the home revealed signs of a troubled woman who died trying to calm herself with medication
' the state just ca n't throw up a whole bunch of theories , ' john wall 's lawyer fred metos said during closing arguments thursday
he added self - injury is a rare side effect of xanax
prosecutors said von schwedler studied childhood leukemia and recently made a discovery that could help find new treatments for the disease
she had no prescription for xanax , but john wall filled a large one for his mother months before his ex-wife 's death
' he resented her efforts to see the children , to talk with the children , to text the children , to email the children , ' prosecutor nick d'alesandro said during closings
' he just could n't stop talking about how much he hated her
' the night of their mother 's death , the former couple 's four children were staying at john wall 's house
the next morning , he was n't at home when they woke up
instead , he went to a car wash and had the interior of his car cleaned , including a pinkish stain , according to prosecutors
von schwedler was a cancer researcher who studied childhood leukemia and recently made a discovery that could help find new treatments for the disease he came to work with a scratch on his face and injury to his eye ; he said the family dog scratched him while he slept
police knocked on john wall 's door that night , hours after von schwedler 's boyfriend found her body
during an intense interrogation , john wall denied having anything to do with her death
the couple 's oldest daughter , 19 - year - old malkie wall , testified that her father returned home deeply troubled and asking his children if he was a monster
his lawyers said he broke down after police made him question his sanity , but there 's no proof he was in von schwedler 's house
the jury of three women and five men deliberated for about seven hours before reaching a guilty verdict
after the verdict was read , the wall thanked police for years of investigation and ' uncommon persistence
he spoke at the courthouse in salt lake city surrounded by more than two dozen supporters
' we have spent the last three and half years seeking justice for my mother , and today that quest is finally at an end , ' he said
the victim 's sister , almut von schwedler , said the john brickman wall children will never be the same , but the verdict is the first step toward closure
' johnny never succeeded to destroy uta von schwedler 's joy for life , but he ended up taking her life , ' she said

prosecutor matthew janzen said wall played an important part in the case , one of many pieces that formed the largely circumstantial case
as the verdict was read , john wall sat with his hands folded and shoulders bent , staring down and blinking rapidly as his frown deepened
the defendant 's sister , wendy wall , maintained her brother 's innocence
' this verdict will not bring uta von schwedler back , ' she said in a statement
' now , to that tragedy has been added the conviction of an innocent man
' though wall has no regrets in fighting for his father 's conviction , wendy wall is disappointed with what wall has done to his father
' i think that johnny felt devastated when , you know , when wall - in some ways you could say turned on him , i suppose , ' she said
' everybody in our family johnny included still very much loves wall , and i think that we 're all trying to remember that â¦ he 's gone through incredible trauma
' wall will be sentenced on july 8
wall said that he expects he will speak to his father ' once he 's in prison '
' i mean , i think i can ask him the questions
but , i do n't expect that he 'll answer
he 'll just , you know , shake his head ... and , basically , maintain the victim stance that he 's always maintained , ' he said .
