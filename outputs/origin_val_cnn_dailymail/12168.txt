the attack on mark lippert , the u.s. ambassador to south korea , allegedly by a knife - wielding south korea progressive activist at a breakfast meeting in seoul , was a rare and shocking reminder of the ongoing conflict that continues to divide the korean peninsula
despite the ever - present backdrop of inter-korean tensions , security in downtown seoul is typically quite relaxed
but on thursday morning local time , the alleged assailant , who has been tied to south korea nationalist and anti- u.s. protests , reportedly shouted his opposition to annual u.s. - south korea joint military exercises and called for south korea reunification as he cut the ambassador on the face and hand with a 10 - inch knife
this breakfast meeting with mark lippert was taking place at a building directly across the street from the u.s. embassy in seoul
and the scene was probably not too different from a similar breakfast meeting i attended with the ambassador at a downtown hotel only a week before the attack
mark lippert moved freely without a security detail or security screenings at the entrance to the venue , and was accompanied by only one or two embassy staff
indeed , even since 9/11 , it is relatively easy to enter most large buildings in downtown seoul , and security procedures have been generally perfunctory
in part this is because direct confrontations between south korea citizens and u.s. government representatives in south korea have been rare , and violent political attacks are unusual
true , there have been periodic group protests against the u.s. military presence in south korea or against u.s. policy
but these protests have generally been conducted peacefully , a far cry from the environment of the 1980s , when pro-democracy protesters against a then - authoritarian south korea government attacked and burned u.s. government facilities
yet although downtown seoul has been relatively safe and public security has often been lax , violent attacks on public figures in south korea are in fact not unprecedented
the attack on mark lippert brings to mind a may 2006 attack by a knife - wielding assailant on park geun-hye , south korea 's current president , while she was campaigning in local elections in daejeon
( her calm demeanor despite receiving a facial laceration contributed to her reputation as a politician and future president who is cool in the midst of a crisis
) the attack on park was n't the only time the dangers inherent in south korea 's lax security environment have been exposed : back in 2008 , a lone arsonist burned to the ground seoul 's unguarded namdaemun , or south gate , a south korea cultural treasure
and of course , there is the backdrop of the ongoing inter-korean confrontation , which plays out within south korea democracy in the form of a bitter confrontation between progressive and conservative factions
there is speculation that some members of south korea 's progressive movement have ties with north korean , and some of them have allegedly been somewhat willing to foment violence to stir up conflict within south korea society
most recently , some members of south korea 's left - leaning united progressive party , which had won seats in south korea 's national assembly , were disbarred and convicted of plotting a violent insurrection , leading to the dissolution of the party itself
and while this hard - core group represents a fringe element within south korea society , it still remains active in part due to north korean ideological and financial support
all this said , the overwhelming initial south korea public response to the attack on mark lippert has been one of outrage , condemnation and sympathy
indeed , far from revealing gaps in the u.s. - south korea alliance or fomenting discord over whether joint military exercises should move forward , the incident is likely to strengthen south korea feelings of support for the alliance with the u.s.
still , the incident also serves as a reminder that even in the most seemingly safe and pro-american environments around the world , there is a risk that some zealous critics of u.s. policy may resort to violence against official u.s. representatives overseas
and that 's especially so in regions such as the korean peninsula , where longstanding tensions still cast a shadow over security considerations .
