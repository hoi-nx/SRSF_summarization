sanaa , yemen the u.s. military has pulled its remaining personnel out of yemen due to the deteriorating security situation , the state department said
the evacuation involved about 100 special operations forces members from the al anad airbase , sources in the region familiar with the situation told cnn
the state department called it a temporary relocation
those evacuated , which include navy seals and members of the army 's delta force , were the last u.s. forces stationed in the arab nation , which is home to aqap , the terrorist group also known as aqap
" we ... continue to actively monitor terrorist threats emanating from yemen and have capabilities postured in the area to address them , " state department spokesman jeff rathke said late saturday
" as we have in the past , we will take action to disrupt continuing , imminent threats to the u.s. and our citizens
" the u.s. closed its embassy in sanaa last month , after houthi rebels took over the yemen capital
and hundreds of aqap members escaped two yemen prisons thursday and friday , raising further security questions
" there is no military solution to yemen 's current crisis , " jeff rathke said
" we urge the immediate cessation of all unilateral and offensive military actions
" the united nations is taking the situation seriously
the u.n. security council will meet at 3 p.m. et sunday to discuss yemen , the french mission said saturday via twitter
for years , the u.s. military has worked closely with yemen 's government to go after aqap , together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent aqap figure anwar al-awlaki
and u.s. president obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign
" yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability , " obama said in january , promoting the policy of " partnering and intelligence - sharing with that local government " as the best approach in a bad situation
" the alternative would be for us to play whack - a - mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , " the president said
but while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month , these cooperative efforts have been hampered by yemen 's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace
these include the rise of the houthi , their battles with forces loyal to ousted president hadi and the presence of not only aqap fighters but other militants
on friday , for instance , isis purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in sanaa what , if true , would mark that group 's first large - scale attack in yemen
the claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried isis proclamations , but could n't be immediately authenticated by cnn
those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others , according to yemen 's state - run saba
while isis and aqap are both sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of islamic and violent opposition to the west , that does n't mean they will be working together anytime soon
in fact , aqap strongly rebuked isis in a video released in november , characterizing its leader abu bakr al-baghdadi 's declaration of an islamic caliphate as illegitimate
more than anything , the idea of the group calling itself the islamic state violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there
with no one really in control , that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the west -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over
meanwhile , the main players for control of yemen 's government -- those siding with hadi , who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year , and the houthi , a minority group that 's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds
just two days ago , a yemen jet commanded by the capital 's houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing hadi in the port city of aden
no one was injured , but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides
the airstrikes came on the same day opposing yemen military forces -- some under the houthi , others led by officers loyal to hadi -- battled in aden , said aden gov. hobtour
at least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes , according to hobtour
hadi took to the airwaves of adan tv , a station he recently started , on saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest
he called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the saudi capital of riyadh , condemning the aden strike and urging yemen troops to refuse orders from houthi officials
hadi tied the houthi to iranian , which he was said supported the " coup " that led to his departure from aden
" the iranian agenda of the houthi will not last , " he said
after hadi spoke , the houthi - run saba news agency responded , saying the supreme revolutionary committee has decided to mobilize forces and " directed security and military institutions to carry out their duties to confront ( the ) dirty war
" " the committee announces the decision to call proud sons of the yemen people in all regions to unite , collaborate and cooperate with members of the armed and security forces in the face of terrorist forces in all parts of the country , " the report said
al bukhaiti , a top member of the houthi political council , said hadi 's speech wo n't help yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last september to transfer power
" we blame hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved yemen 's ongoing crises , " al bukhaiti said
" hadi will be held responsible for the country 's failures and that chaos that could follow
