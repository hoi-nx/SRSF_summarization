an archive of highly - classified test reports has come to light revealing how the nazis killed thousands of germans citizens by bombing their own cities with v-2 rockets - for target practice
the top - secret ss. documents , much of which are written in coded germans , are said to offer proof hitler used his own towns and cities to test the scale of the devastation caused by the ballistic missiles
the incredible 20 - page archive is made up of reports which were only issued to ' kommandostelle s ' , a unit so secret that hardly anything is known about it
an archive of highly - classified test reports has come to light revealing how the nazis killed thousands of germans citizens by bombing their own cities with v - 2 rockets - for target practice the top - secret ss. documents , much of which are written in coded germans , are said to offer proof hitler used his own towns and cities to test the scale of the devastation caused by the ballistic missiles the burn marks are said to be proof of the documents ' sensitivity , as someone clearly tried to torch them the incredible archive is made up of reports which were only issued to ' kommandostelle s ' , a unit so secret that hardly anything is known about it deadly : a v - 2 rocket launched in germans from a fixed site in the summer of 1943 they show how the desperate nazis used their own settlements as targets while developing the deadly weapons during second world war
it means thousands of germans died at the hands of their own leader in 1944 and 1945 - who then blamed the carnage on allied forces
the v-2 rockets - the v-2 standing for vengeance weapon , or vengeance weapon - were fired at london and the south east of england , as well as targets on mainland europe , killing over 7,000 people
the warheads were launched in the final months of the war as britain advanced closer to victory and were considered hitler 's last role of the dice
however , it is widely agreed that if the nazis has developed the rockets sooner they may have won the race to develop the atomic bomb and gone on to win the war
the v-2 rockets - the v-2 standing for vengeance weapon , or vengeance weapon - were fired at london and the south east of england , as well as targets on mainland europe , killing over 7,000 people the documents show that hitler fired v-2 rockets from a test centre in what was then pomerania into surrounding cities , killing his own people royal air force reconnaissance photograph of v-2 rockets at a test stand the remarkable archive was rescued from the flames at the end of the conflict and has remained in the possession of a germans collector ever since
now it is set to go under the hammer at chiswick auctions , in london , on march 18 , where it is expected to fetch Â£ 2,500
on wednesday , chiswick auctions spokesman westwood-brookes said : ' the v-2 was the first truly ballistic missile which might have brought victory to hitler had he won the race to develop the atomic bomb in 1945
' a note which comes with the archive from a researcher indicates that these were final test firing reports for the rockets and were issued in very limited numbers of no more than 10 to 12 copies
' the present archive could prove to be a highly important new source of information on what was by far the most important technological and scientific development to have come from the second world war
' the v-2 was the first real ballistic missile
powerful : the first v - 2 attack on britain hit chiswick in london in september 1944 and left a gigantic crater ' had hitler been successful in developing the technology of the atomic bomb then he would have had the capability of firing it long distances
' with the use of this rocket - unquestionably this would have led to the nazis winning the war
' the document , which is typed on sheets of v-2 paper , shows a large number of v-2 rockets were fired from the peenemunde region where experimental devices were tested
they were fired against the allies with missiles claiming thousands of lives in london , antwerp and liege
but shockingly , the reports also reveal many of the original test firings were at germans towns and cities - mainly in the area of pomerania
it is believed special units were then sent to evaluate the extent of the damage caused and report back to the fuhrer about their effectiveness
mr westwood brookes added : ' perhaps the most remarkable fact which comes from these papers is that many of these test firings were fired at germans targets
devastation : a v - 2 rocket attack left this block of flats in limehouse , london , in ruins ' this is evidence enough of how desperate the nazis were becoming after d-day and the relentless advances of allied forces across europe
' many of these test firings at germans towns and cities resulted in considerable casualties and substantial damages to houses and other properties
' i have never seen such concrete evidence to substantiate that hitler actually used his own towns and cities as target practice
' after the war the majority of v-2 - related documents were destroyed by the germans before the allies moved in by orders of the ss. mr westwood-brookes said : ' the fact that several of the sheets in the present archive have clearly been in a fire suggests that these very papers were rescued from such destruction
' this really is an exceptionally rare find and one that offers a chilling insight into hitler 's war efforts during his final months
' the v - 2 rocket was developed by wernher von braun , a germans aerospace engineer and space architect
he was a member of the nazi party but after the war went to work in us for nasa and eventually helped develop the technology that put man on the moon in 1969
the v-2 was the most advanced weapon used in the war until the us dropped atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945
launched from mobile units , the 46ft ( 14m ) tall rockets were powered by liquid ethanol and oxygen and weighed almost 13 tonnes , fully fuelled
the v - 2s were also hitler 's answer to his country 's disappointment that the v1s ( or doodlebugs ) did n't knock britain out of the war
they were launched vertically and could travel at 3,335mph to hit targets more than 200 miles away , making it the world 's first long - range combat - ballistic missile .
