chao hu , anhui , chinese six - year - old lu is a handful
one minute , he 's on the concrete roof of his two - story house , the next he 's fiddling with fireworks
now , he 's skating down an alley
" come back here ! " yells his grandmother
" i have such a headache raising this child , " 72 - year - old old tang confides
lu 's mother abandoned him after he was born and his father works as a carpenter in shandong province hundreds of miles further north
he comes back perhaps once a year
in chinese , lu is what 's called a " left - behind child
" conservatively , there are at least 61 million such children in chinese -- that 's a staggering one in five
they struggle at school , have higher rates of mental health issues , and suffer from more behavioral problems than their contemporaries
" i tell him ' your father is working and your mother does n't want you , ' " says an exasperated tang
in chao hu , a village in the inland province of anhui , a dead - end track passes by half - finished housing projects and abandoned fields
a yellow haze hangs in the air leaving a metallic taste in the mouth
chinese 's industrial pollution made it out here , but the jobs have n't
everyone of working age in chao hu has gone to the cities to find work , leaving the old and very young behind
lu holds my hand as we walk through the tiny village
a group of old women sit on three - legged wooden stools listening to chinese opera on a small radio
some old men make bootleg liquor in an oil drum
" we do n't have fields that we can farm , if you do n't go out to work , then how do you earn an income ? " says tang
" their parents have to work outside of town and they can not bring their children with them
" the all china women 's federation , a state - backed organization , paints a bleak picture for left behind children
a steady stream of state media reports highlights the abuse suffered by left behind children
and crimes are often blamed on them
" it has a huge impact on society and the generation of people who grow up without parents , " says ines kaempfer , of the center for child - rights and corporate social responsibility
" there is a generation of chinese society that lacks security and trust
it could have a potentially disastrous effect
" unintended consequences of mass urbanization and migration are not unique to chinese
but draconian rules have made the problem worse
chinese 's much - hated hukou system registers families as either rural or urban
most migrants ca n't change their household registration when they move
they struggle to access healthcare and other social services in urban areas
their children ca n't go to public schools -- even if they are born in the cities
critics say the hukou system has created a vast underclass of cheap labor to help drive chinese 's manufacturing revolution
recognizing some of its failures , the chinese communist party has proposed reforms of the hukou system including doing away with temporary residence permits
the topic is under discussion this week at the annual meeting of chinese 's national people 's congress , the country 's rubber - stamp parliament
" though it is better than before , the hukou system is a huge problem , " says professor fan bin , of the huadong technology institute
" migrants ca n't afford to keep their children in big cities , the rent is high and the wages are low , and they ca n't pay the tuition for private schools
" in chao hu village , tang is cooking a meal of rice and spinach for her grandson
she swirls peanut oil on her simple stove top
" i ca n't teach my grandson well
this boy should be educated by his father and mother , " she says , " i can not catch him when he runs away from me
i can not discipline him when he misbehaves
" tang is convinced she ca n't give her grandson the support he needs
" we do n't have a choice , even if the situation is n't good
if i do n't take care of him who will , " she says
