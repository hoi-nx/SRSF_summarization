bosses at the harry potter studio tour have been accused of mistreating owls
animal rights campaigners said camera flashes were extremely distressing for the birds , which have highly sensitive eyes
they are also kept in small cages for long periods and forced to perform â demeaning â tricks , a report added
undercover footage shows birds chewing at their tethers and shaking their heads , apparently in alarm
a harry potter tour that keeps owls in cages and allows fans to touch them is ' cruel ' and ' demeaning ' , animal rights campaigners have claimed secret footage obtained by the peta ( peta ) at the end of february shows how the owls are treated at the making of harry potter tour the owls are part of warner brothers â making of harry potter tour in leavesden , hertfordshire
in the books and films , harry potter has a pet snowy owl called hedwig that was given to him as a birthday gift by gamekeeper hagrid
among its tasks was to fly into hogwarts school to deliver harry potter âs letters
at the studio tour , which costs Â£ 33 for an adult ticket , fans can meet â hedwig â as well as other animals from the franchise
the owls are a hit with visitors , many of whom take pictures with the birds to post on social media
but peta ( peta ) said flashes from cameras terrified the owls , while trainers encouraging people to stroke the birds left them agitated
the owls also perform tricks - like picking up a ' passport ' with their beak - in front of crowds the charity launched an undercover investigation after receiving complaints from concerned visitors to the attraction
it has called for the tour to stop using live animals
in a letter to warner brothers , peta âs yvonne taylor said : â the â trainers â supervising the tour showed gross negligence both in handling the birds and in ensuring public safety
as well as the tricks , they actively encouraged flash photography
â owls have especially acute vision and find blinding camera flashes extremely distressing â this can be seen in peta âs footage as they respond by desperately chewing at their tethers and shaking their heads
â a trainer cajoled people to touch the frightened birds , ignoring signs telling people not to ... as well as being stressful for the owls this also interferes with the natural oils in their feathers that keep them warm
â a lot of the owls at the tour are tethered to posts
the findings have prompted peta to send a letter to warner brothers , which runs the tour , calling on the company to commit to a ban on using live animals a tour spokesman said : ' the owls ' welfare is of paramount importance to us and they are exclusively handled by the experts at birds & animals which owns and trains them ' harry potter author jk rowling has previously warned against keeping owls , saying : â if anybody has been influenced by my books to think an owl would be happiest shut in a small cage and kept in a house , i would like to say as forcefully as i can , you are wrong
â a harry potter tour spokesman said the owls â welfare â is of paramount importance to us and they are exclusively handled by the experts at birds & animals , which owns and trains them â
a spokesman for birds & animals , which provides animals for the entertainment industry , added : â during their appearance at the studio tour the owls were given regular breaks , they were not exposed to any situations that would make them distressed and they were checked by a vet
