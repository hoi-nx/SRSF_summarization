chomping on a piece of gum , arms folded tightly , everton âs manager looked like a man who was feeling the tension of the day
the scene that was unfolding around him , however , was completely at odds with his demeanour
in one corner of goodison , ross barkley was being mobbed by a group of ecstatic team - mates , while the stands were abuzz with exultant supporters
ross barkley had just gracefully and gleefully ensured everton had equalled their biggest win of a bewildering premier league campaign , a 3 - 0 slaying of a wretched newcastle team who finished with 10 men , but , for a second , roberto martinez appeared reluctant to embrace the moment
james mccarthy ( right ) opened the the scoring for everton on sunday at goodison and was congratulated by lennon romelu lukaku , having set up james mccarthy for the opener , netted everton 's second from the penalty spot after lennon was brought down ross barkley celebrates after giving gloss to the victory with a stoppage time strike to make it 3 - 0 to the home side at goodison everton ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : howard 7 ; coleman 7 , phil jagielka 7.5 , alcaraz 6.5 , baines 7 ; james mccarthy 8 ( besic 86 ) , darron gibson 8 , leon osman 8.5 ; lennon 7.5 ( christian atsu 83mins ) , romelu lukaku 8 ( ross barkley 74 , 7 ) , arouna kone 7

soon , though , the magnitude of the result dawned and roberto martinez was smiling
this was a big victory
the spectre of a relegation battle has been tormenting everton during what has been a wretched 2015 but here was a scoreline and a performance to ease tensions
james mccarthy set the ball rolling , the excellent romelu lukaku secured the win from the penalty spot and ross barkley provided the gloss when waltzing on to christian atsu âs pass in injury time
true , newcastle âs resistance was meek but here was a significant step in the right direction
â we performed with real desire , â said roberto martinez
â i thought we were very much in control , and most important of all we played well and wanted to win
in the past we have had a fearful approach in not wanting to lose but we showed what we can do
we dealt with the extra pressure
â big efforts on a thursday night have tended to zap everton on a sunday and a return of eight points from a possible 24 immediately after europa league games has shown what kind of impact progress in that competition has had domestically
significantly , roberto martinez was able to shuffle his pack and inject some freshness with five changes to the team that had beaten dynamo kiev ; it worked perfectly
the return of darron gibson , leon osman and lennon , especially , made everton a much more vibrant proposition
ameobi breaks away from james mccarthy down the wing with the two sides goalless at goodison during sunday 's first half ameobi fights back gallantly as the winger attempted to stop everton 's on - loan winger lennon in his tracks james mccarthy fires in his shot from the edge of the area as fabricio coloccini chases , but the effort found the net and eased everton nerves finding form in the premier league has been difficult for the everton who showed their relief in the goal celebrations roberto martinez and carver share a laugh on the touchline as their two teams do battle on merseyside jonas gutierrez , who was again a newcastle substitute , goes in for a challenge on james mccarthy in midfield as newcastle chase the game a side with more class than newcastle might have made things more problematic for everton and it would have been interesting to see what had happened if either gabriel obertan or mike williamson had turned in the respective chances that came their way in the second minute
yet that was as good as it got from newcastle
acting manager carver argued that his side finished strongly but the reality was they were comfortably beaten and had they returned to tyneside having lost by six , there could not have been any argument
as soon as james mccarthy opened the scoring , the outcome was never in doubt , the republic of ireland wrong - footing krul from 20 yards after romelu lukaku had laid phil jagielka âs long - ball into his path
krul , really , should have done better but everton were not complaining
it was , incredibly , james mccarthy âs first shot on target in the premier league for 10 months but it could not have come at a better time , as the relief around goodison was almost tangible
this stadium can be unforgiving when things are going badly but here they were ready to enjoy themselves
being unable to get a second goal before the interval caused a few murmurs but , with newcastle âs play becoming more abject by the minute , there was never any sense everton would get pegged back and they ended the contest in the 56th minute
referee martin atkinson had no hesitation pointing to the spot after yoan gouffran got into a tangle and upended lennon and romelu lukaku did the rest , rolling his kick into the gwladys street , just as he had done against kiev
the belgian had taken 20 penalties in training on wednesday and scored 17
newcastle âs task was made impossible when fabricio coloccini was dismissed for clattering into lennon â carver said he would appeal if he felt newcastle had a case but when he studies the video , he will realise an appeal would be futile â and that prompted the visiting fans to again barrack mike ashley
it was another one of those days for newcastle but carver , to his credit , would not throw in the towel
romelu lukaku steps up to slot home his second penalty of the week after also netting in the europa league on thursday night at goodison krul dived the wrong way and romelu lukaku simply had to find the net with his spot - kick , which he duly did to double the lead the big belgian forward celebrates after effectively sealing everton 's first win at goodison of the calendar year on sunday afternoon fabricio coloccini lunges in on lennon within three minutes of everton 's second goal and is shown the red card by referee martin atkinson mike williamson slides in to deny arouna kone as everton surged forward in search of a third goal against their 10 - man opponents ross barkley rounds krul during stoppage time to add everton 's third after an impressive performance from the substitutes ' bench â there was a lot of disappointment after the game , usually , we leave them for a couple of days , but i asked the guys if they had anything to say , and two or three did , â said carver
â it was sensible , i wo n't name names , but they had something to say
there were n't tea cups thrown , they were sensible , and examined it well
i ca n't be down
i have never thrown the towel anywhere , and i wo n't do it here
i want them to be positive
â on this evidence , that will prove easier said than done
