roughly 70 percent of strawberries grown in australia are being treated with a pesticide that is supposed to have been banned across the world because it depletes the ozone layer
nine strawberry growers in victorian 's yarra valley are still using methyl bromide to fumigate crops , despite it being banned by the united nations montreal protocol more than two decades ago , the abc reports
the odourless gas was meant to have been phased out in australia by 2005
roughly 70 percent of strawberries grown in australia are being treated with a pesticide that is supposed to have been banned across the world because it depletes the ozone layer but the victorian growers , who produce 100 million strawberry runners a year , are still using almost 30 tonnes of the pesticide annually
they claim alternatives would drive business into the ground and cost 15,000 jobs , so they regularly apply for a critical use exemption from the united nations
methyl bromide , an odourless and colouless gas , was banned because it depletes the ozone layer ' internationally , we 've gotten rid of 85 per cent of methyl bromide , and it 's a great win for mankind â in fact it 's the best environmental gain that 's been made , ' dr ian porter , united nations methyl bromide technical options committee 's co-chair , told the abc
' it 's frustrating ... but we do n't want industries to fall over economically or technically
we do n't want more disease or pests in australia
' growers suggest their costs could soar by 500 percent if they were to stop using the pesticide , which could see a punnet of strawberries soar to more than $ 10
the victorian farms still using methyl bromide - who are part of the toolangi certified strawberry runner growers ' cooperative - said the industry had spent $ 700,000 on research to find alternatives to the pesticide
' the soils at toolangi are clays with high organic matter , and alternative treatments used in other parts of australia do not work well in these conditions , especially in cold temperatures , ' they said
they said banning it would mean consumers have less availability to strawberries and more berries would be imported - implying the health standards may not be the same as in australia
