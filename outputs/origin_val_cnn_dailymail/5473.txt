a zoo in australia claims it is home to the biggest and oldest common wombat in captivity
patrick the wombat weighs in at an astonish 79lbs ( 36kg ) despite the average for its species being somewhere between that figure and 32lbs ( 15kg )
at 30 years old patrick has also lived a lot longer than the expected age of a wombat
patrick 's handler , julia leonard , said : â we believe he is the oldest common wombat in captivity
â to live that long is pretty good going
in the wild they probably only average 10 to 15 years
â but you know , he has got a happy home , good food and lots of cuddles so he is thriving
â a resident at the ballarat wildlife park in victoria , australia , the wombat initially appears to be an average size when it first features in the video
peek-a-boo ! when patrick the wombat first features in the video he appears to be an average size but once it is picked up by its handler , the sheer size of the mammal is striking
however , according to ms julia leonard , the wombat is actually lighter than it used to be
â well he was 40kg in his heyday
of course , as you get older you lose a bit of weight so he is about 36kg now , ' said ms julia leonard
according to patrick 's handler , julia leonard , in its ' heyday ' the wombat weighed a whopping 40kg quite a handful ! at 79lbs , patrick is a lot heavier than the average wombat who weighs somewhere between that figure and 32lbs patrick has been in captivity nearly his entire life at the ballarat wildlife park as â rather surprisingly â he could nât defend himself against other wombats in the wild
hand - raised after being orphaned as a baby , the wombat is famous in the park for greeting visitors while being pushed around in a wheelbarrow â as seen in the video
with hundreds of thousands of fans , patrick also has his own facebook page and he was named the 3rd best ' city mascot ' in the world back in 2014
