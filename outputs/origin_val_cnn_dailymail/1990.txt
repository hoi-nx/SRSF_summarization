in a case involving another teacher in 1987 , dr paterson said he sent a 15 - year - old student to the library to ' think about what he said ' after the teen confided in him about being abused - describing the student as a ' dramatical boy ' who ' liked to exaggerate stories '
dr paterson also said it never occurred to him to contact police after a balaclava - clad ' intruder ' broke into a boarding house and sexually assaulted a year 8 student in 1988
