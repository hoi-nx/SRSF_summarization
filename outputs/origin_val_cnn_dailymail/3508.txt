but the popular 17 - year - old student was told he had post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( ptld ) in january - a devastating cancer that affects the white blood cells in around one in 50 people
medical staff were initially confident that chemotherapy would cure him
but he failed to respond to treatment and died on monday surrounded by family
his mother janet , from bodham , norfolk , said last night : ' david acott had a strength and depth that just amazed me
' he was kind , good - natured , had a lovely smile , was very well - mannered , and caring and considerate to his younger brother howard - they were best friends
' the 48 - year - old added that david acott had become her friend as well as her son over the last couple of years
she said : ' we would walk and run together - he was someone who was really nice to hang out with and we are all going to miss him so much

the disease affects the white blood cells and is often associated with epstein-barr virus
some of the cells affected may undergo mutations that render them malignant , giving rise to a lymphoma , or group of blood cell tumours
there is no uniform consensus regarding the best treatment for the disease
antiviral drugs can be used as can chemotherapy in more serious cases
it is mainly fatal in cases where it progresses to a lymphoma
around one in 50 people develop the disease after surgery

' david acott was a hard - working and diligent student
' it is a very sad loss and we have been supporting staff and students , particularly those who were on the same course

his family learned that a genetic defect had caused the illness , which prevented his liver from being able to metabolise copper
the deadly copper build - up was poisoning his liver , brain and other organs
within weeks of the operation david acott was well enough to jog more than three miles with his mum
ms acott , who has now become one of the parkrun organisers , said : ' we basically walked most of it the first time but it was such an achievement
