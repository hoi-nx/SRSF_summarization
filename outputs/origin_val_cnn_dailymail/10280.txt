a lot has changed since paul oâconnell played the first of his 100 tests more than 13 years ago
professionalism has been the key to the former shelf - stacker âs longevity , although the irishman has not always been surrounded by such healthy company
on the week of his debut in 2002 , the young and enthusiastic second - row had to share a room with former munster team - mate peter
sam warburton of wales and paul o'connell of ireland pose with the six nations trophy paul o'connell will lead ireland out at the millennium stadium on the occasion of his 100th international cap paul o'connell prepares to offload the ball during the ireland training session ahead of the game last week paul o'connell 's importance to ireland can not be overstated as he wins his 100th cap against wales on saturday
over the past 13 years , the iconic munster lock has become the side 's beating heart and captain
' he 's an outstanding leader , ' says ireland fly - half sexton
' when he speaks to the squad during the week the hairs on the back of your next stand up
' their billets were turned into an irish cards den in the days leading up to the six nations visit of wales ; a stark contrast to the preparations for this meeting at the millennium stadium
â i was woken by the smell of cigarette smoke in my nostrils every morning , â recalled a laughing paul oâconnell
â â the claw â used to have a cigarette the moment he woke up
i was well aware from peter that this was not the way forward ! â obviously it âs changed a lot since then
it âs funny , there âs a lot more guys to copy now then when i made my first cap
now in the irish camp i take a lot of advice from ( strength and conditioning coach ) jason cowman
sexton is obviously a great guy to copy and follow
â it is testament to paul oâconnell âs longevity that half of the current welsh coaching set - up were playing against him in that match â a record 54 - 10 victory at landsdowne road
both mcbryde and rob howley have since escaped to the warm comfort of the tactical box where â along with warren gatland , neil jenkins and shaun edwards â they will be hoping to plot ireland âs downfall at the millennium stadium this afternoon
paul o'connell powers over for a try in the 54 - 10 victory for ireland over wales back in 2002 , his debut half of the current welsh coaching set - up were playing paul o'connell at landsdowne road in his first game all eyes will be on the battle of the skies as the hosts look to end ireland âs grand slam push and keep alive their own championship hopes
they have been working overtime to nullify the aerial bombardment from sexton and conor murray , with scrum - half webb promising not to repeat the mistakes that england made in dublin two weeks ago
â i do nât know if england did much analysis on them , â said webb
â they did nât seem to put much pressure on nine and 10 whatsoever
we need to be on the money and we know there is no margin for error
â the heavily influenced kicking strategy has been criticised for lacking entertainment value
webb admits attractive rugby will come second as wales look to derail ireland 's grand slam hopes all blacks boss steve hansen recently said that rugby is â geared towards defences that inhibit attack â and mcbryde is predicting another war of attrition in the welsh capital
â attractive rugby will come second , â said the 44 - year - old
â that âs the nature of the game at the moment and unfortunately the spectators have got to pay a price for that
â it promises to be an intense tactical battle between warren gatland and counterpart joe , with the former subjected to a bitter personal attack by retired ireland lock neil francis during the week
warren gatland was said to have â the intellectual properties of a tub of flora â , although paul oâconnell holds the kiwi in much higher regard
webb says wales need ' to be on the money ' in their six nations - defining clash with ireland wales captain sam warburton makes his way into the stadium for wales training ahead of six nations clash â for as long as i can remember we âve being trying to poach ideas from warren gatland , â said paul oâconnell
â we played wasps with munster in 2003 or 2004 and they were so far ahead in terms of how they were playing and how the players were prepared from an s&c ( strength and conditioning ) and nutritional point of view
it was a rude awakening
he makes complicated things very simple and he probably pioneered that way of thinking
â at the start of the championship , joe said the wales - england game was going to be the standard - bearer
two years ago ireland beat them in the first game and they just built and built and built until they absolutely erupted in that final game against england
â they âll feel the same thing is happening now
â kicking game in conor murray and sexton , ireland have the world âs in - form kicking half - back combination
their aerial game - plan was predictable against england yet stuart lancaster did not have the players at his disposable to stop it
wales , however , have one of the best defensive back - threes in the world and halfpenny is a master at limiting the space to kick into
how well ireland anticipate that - perhaps using sexton as a looping runner , if the wingers drop back - will be highly significant
set - piece at 6ft 9in and 6ft 11in , luke charteris of wales and devin toner of ireland are two of the tallest players in the competition
they are both extremely difficult to beat on their own line - out throw , while they can be equally disruptive towards their opponents â
their long limbs are used to try and steal ball , although that can leave the defending side open to attack from the driving maul , where both wales and ireland are particularly effective
picking the right moments to challenge will be pivotal ; a responsibility that falls on the shoulders of alun-wyn jones and paul oâconnell
breakdown welsh defence coach shaun edwards claims his players are the best in the world at contesting the post-tackle area
however , they will face their toughest breakdown battle yet against ireland , who won 23 turnovers to nine against england in round three
warren gatland âs game - plan relies heavily on quick recycled ball and ireland will look to slow that down to limit the risk from the likes of jamie roberts and george north
getting on the right side of referee wayne barnes will be key , because halfpenny and sexton are two of the world âs leading goal - kickers .
