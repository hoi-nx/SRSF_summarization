the delphina valle dell'erica resort in sardinia is huge
even the name is on the big side and when i looked at its website i had misgivings , not least because i have stayed in so many unwieldy hotels around the world that i always long for something small and personal
i had visions of elbowing fellow holidaymakers at the breakfast buffet and setting the alarm to grab a sun lounger that might actually face the sun. mum 's the word : jodie and her son indio enjoyed their first trip to sardinia what 's more , this was to be an important holiday for my three - year - old son , indio , and neither of us had been to this italy island before
but , from the moment we set foot in the 28 - hectare resort near santa teresa gallura , i realised my worries were entirely misplaced
frankly , we were bowled over
yes , it is big - in fact it is really two hotels joined together - but it never felt big and there were days when we hardly saw a soul
it helps , of course , that there are five or six different beaches to choose from , four swimming pools ( three with salt water ) , five restaurants , five bars , a mini football pitch and golf course
our room faced the sea
on clear days we could see corsica looming over the strait of bonifacio and every evening we were treated to spectacular sunsets
whoever designed this place should take a bow
there were children 's areas , adults - only areas , family areas and ones where no one seemed to go at all
everywhere there was an abundance of trees , shrubs and pots spilling over with all the colours of the mediterranean
you could potter about for hours along shaded walkways as if wandering around your own private garden
the word that kept coming into my mind was ' tranquil ' , which , given there are more than 250 rooms , is amazing
even the staff seemed completely relaxed , but they were also highly efficient and went out of their way to make everyone feel special
on a couple of occasions i arranged for a babysitter for indio and , believe me , i am not a mother who readily leaves her child with a total stranger
but i trusted them completely and indio seemed to look forward to their arrival
there were very few british people staying - and lots of italy
i took that as a good sign because italy love children
they also love food and wine and are at their best in the sunshine
come to think of it , food , wine and sunshine rate high on my own list of priorities â especially food , after masterchef , where to my astonishment i reached the final
the big morning decision was whether to make camp by the pool or on one of the beaches
bolts from the blue : the hotel sits on the serene waters of the strait of bonifacio i liked having that choice and what i liked especially was that the beaches were quiet and not overrun with jet skiers
one day , i dropped indio off at the kids ' club and booked in for a day of windsurfing and kitesurfing
i learned to windsurf in barbados , where my mother and brother still live and where i try to visit as often as i can
but i had never attempted kite - surfing
kite - surfing is great fun once you get the hang of it - and you need a good teacher
it 's also fantastic exercise , because it depends a lot on core muscles and , as we are relentlessly told by fitness gurus , it 's those core muscles that form the basis of a well - toned body
with kitesurfing , you first have to learn how to fly a kite , which means getting to grips with the direction of the wind
in fact , there 's a lot of preparation work to do before going on the water and having a board strapped to your feet
i seemed to get the hang of it
perhaps our best day was when we went out on poseidon , one of the resort 's fishing boats
we went exploring around the north point and then visited the island of santa maria maddalena
it was magical - and the ice creams were the best ever
we called in at the church of santa maria maddalena and then i swam back to the boat and was met with drinks and canapes
delphina has a thalasso spa , where i spent as much time as i could
it has lots of jets that pummel your body into submission but afterwards you feel amazingly invigorated and ready to conquer the world
actually , i think indio and i both felt ready to conquer something or other after our a week at delphina
more importantly , our holiday worked brilliantly for both of us
i know we will be back and just hope it 's soon
