the investigation into claims of a vip paedophile sex ring widened dramatically yesterday after police raided the home of a disgraced tory mp
harvey proctor , 68 , had been named on a list of politicians passed to police by campaigning labour mp mann
scotland yard officers spent two days searching his grace - and - favour home at belvoir castle in leicestershire after a police team arrived on the estate on wednesday
harvey proctor insisted he was a ' discreet ' man and had never been part of ' any rent boy ring ' with cabinet ministers , mps or military top brass former essex mp harvey proctor , who quit parliament in 1987 after admitting â spanking sessions â with rent boys , was forced to deny any knowledge of the abuse and deaths of three young boys
he said he did not attend westminster â sex parties â at an exclusive address near parliament and claimed to be trapped in a â kafka-esque fantasy â
it is understood that investigators now have up to nine current and former senior politicians on mr mann âs list in their sights as the sensitive inquiry gathers pace
speaking last night , mr mann said he was pleased at the progress of the investigation and insisted that â no stone must be left unturned â
â it is encouraging to see that the metropolitan police are continuing to fully investigate allegations of child abuse and prominent people , â he added
mr harvey proctor today said he knew nothing about the allegations and wanted to talk to police at the ' earliest opportunity ' harvey proctor faces being interviewed under caution within weeks by detectives with the metropolitan police âs operation midland squad â which was set up in november to investigate claims of a westminster child sex abuse ring in the 1970s and 1980s
victims have come forward to claim men in powerful positions abused boys at the luxury dolphin square apartments in pimlico
they are also examining allegations that figures in politics , the military and law enforcement abused children at other locations
at the centre of the inquiry is an eyewitness described by police as â credible â who claims three of those abused were murdered
in addition , detectives are examining a list passed to them by mr mann last december which identifies 22 potential suspects across the political spectrum
it is believed that harvey proctor âs name has been repeatedly given to police by at least two alleged victims
on wednesday , detectives arrived at belvoir castle near grantham â the seat of the duke of rutland â where harvey proctor has lived since 2003
they searched at least two properties on the 16,000 - acre estate including a red ramshackle building he moved out of in recent months
a metropolitan police spokesman confirmed the search
harvey proctor quickly proclaimed his innocence yesterday , denying any knowledge of abuse or murders
standing in the grounds of belvoir castle , he said he is â helping police with their inquiries â
earlier he told bbc radio 4 : â i find myself in a very kafka-esque fantasy situation
i have never attended sex parties at dolphin square or anywhere else
i have not been part of any rent - boy ring with cabinet ministers , other members of parliament or generals or the military
â mr harvey proctor , 68 , lives in the 16,000 - acre grounds of belvoir castle ( pictured ) , near grantham in leicestershire he added : â i was a discreet person and regarded in the house of commons as a very independent mp and a loner
â harvey proctor also said he was keen to be interviewed by police as soon as possible to clear his name
mr harvey proctor said that he had pleaded guilty to four charges of gross indecency in 1987 for offences relating to to the age of consent for homosexuality , which has since been lowered from 21 to 16 he added : â i believe the number of victims grows by the day , and the number of alleged perpetrators â through death â diminishes
it âs certainly a problem for me
my problem is that i am still very much alive
â harvey proctor , who represented basildon and nearby billericay , was an outspoken hard - right tory but left parliament after pleading guilty to gross indecency
the mp â who was given the nickname â wacko â â would order rent boys as young as 17 to call him â sir â or â keith â and pretend he was a headmaster as he caned them
he was fined just Â£ 1,450 but the case signalled the end of his career because his confession followed years of vehement denials
two months before his court appearance it was revealed how harvey proctor was caught by security staff on holiday in morocco with a naked 15 - year - old local boy hiding under his bed
he later went to work for the duke of rutland as his private secretary and in recent years has been responsible for â public and park events â
the 1987 offences would no longer be crimes under current laws after the age of consent for homosexual activity changed from 21 to 16
campaigning mp mann passed his dossier naming suspected westminster paedophiles to police in december last year
the explosive list identifies 22 potential suspects across the political spectrum who are allegedly linked to historic child abuse between 1970 and the late - 1990s
of these , nine are still alive , and are said to include four serving mps , three former mps , a member of the house of lords and one high - ranking town hall figure
the document also includes the names of 13 ex-ministers , including at least two who allegedly went to â abuse parties â
the report names 14 tory politicians , five labour and three others
as a young councillor in london , mr mann uncovered evidence a tory cabinet minister was allegedly involved
he alerted police but was told three months later that the inquiry was being shelved on the orders of â those at the top â
