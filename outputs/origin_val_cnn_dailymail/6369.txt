' watson had scraped her way past goerges in the last round , and looked set for another tough encounter under the california sun. both players exchanged two breaks each in the first set - much like watson 's match against goerges - but things settled down soon after as they made it 4 - 4 , with the briton then holding serve with relative ease
giorgi saved a set point at 40 - 15 on her serve but pulled a forehand wide to hand watson the opening set
giorgi was clearly off her serving rhythm - she hit 10 double faults in the first set - as she conceded an early break in the second , and watson made it seven straight games to race into a 5 - 0 lead
the italian , who is yet to win a singles title on the wta tour , kick - started the recovery with a smooth service game , and had watson running to all corners as a deciding set looked on the cards at 5 - 5
however , it was all in vain as watson held serve to make it 6 - 5 , and then needed just one of her three match points on the giorgi serve to seal victory with the italian firing a backhand long .
