a dating website which claims to cater for only the world 's best looking single people has dumped more than 3,000 members for letting themselves go
the cull was conducted by beautifulpeople.com of members whose looks they say no longer come up to the ' rigorous standards expected ' of the ' exclusive community ' and who now need to look for love elsewhere
one member , tawnie , from la who previously underwent a make - over herself so that she could win a place on the site says she is glad they are being so tough
tawnie ( pictured ) says if they did not make the cuts people would leave tawnie , who poses seductively in a bikini for her profile pictures said : ' if the management failed to maintain the quality of the site by polluting the gene pool , most members would leave
' it would make beautiful people just like every other dating site - full of the kind of people you would n't want to share an elevator with , let alone date
' the most often cited reason for members being removed from the site were piling on the pounds and ' graceless ' ageing
more than 500 brits , the second largest nationality , were among those axed
the people behind the website say they cull has sent a ' very clear message ' to its good - looking members : ' you do n't just need to be beautiful to join ; you need to stay that way , or you are out
' the global website periodically reviews the suitability of all its members , to make sure that quality is maintained
beautiful people is run by married couple greg and hodge and was started in 2003
since then there have been over 7.5million people rejected from the site
tawnie was previously kicked off the site herself but had a make - over so she could stay , now she says that the site needs to keep their standards up tawnie , was originally rejected by the members of beautifulpeople.com but underwent a make - over so that she could use it managing director mr hodge said : ' if members fail to maintain their beautiful appearance , we take the most recent photos of them and put them back in the rating system
' they are forced to go through the same 48 - hour rating process as when they initially applied , where once again they are judged by their peers
australia : 59 ' if their looks are n't up to our members ' exacting standards and they do not secure a majority of positive votes , then their profiles are immediately removed
' mrs hodge said : ' this may sound harsh , and it is the most difficult part of managing the business
' we take no pleasure in removing members , but it is a necessary evil in order to maintain the beautiful community and our prized business model
' mr hodge added : ' we regret the loss of any member , but the fact remains that our members demand the high standard of beauty be upheld
' letting unattractive people populate the site would compromise the very concept for which beautifulpeople.com was founded
' he said that , as ruthless as it may sound , the website has been ' kind ' in breaking the news to former members
mr hodge added : ' each has received an email encouraging them to re-apply when they are back looking their best
' they are also offering free mentoring with one of the site 's beauty mentors , who have volunteered to give their time to help improve the looks , style and confidence of anyone who wants join or rejoin the site

entry to beautifulpeople.com is only possible after passing a democratic rating process , where members of the opposite sex vote ' yes definitely ' , ' hmm yes , o.k ' , ' hmm no , not really ' and ' no definitely not ' based on photographs and a brief profile submitted by new applicants
despite the cull , more than 800,000 members remain on the site , representing 190 countries and almost every ethnic and cultural background
new applications rose over christmas and new year , with a global average of just one in 10 applicants being accepted
the majority of successful new members were from the united states and france
tawnie is not the only person to take the site seriously , as we have previously reported many rejectees have slimmed down , or buffed up to win a place on the site .
