a coalition government made up of labour and the snp could break up the uk , sir john warned last night
with the result of may âs general election looking very close , the former conservative prime minister said that a labour - snp coalition would be a â lethal cocktail â and â a tragedy in the making â
polls suggest that , with no party likely to win enough seats to govern alone , a labour - snp coalition is a likely outcome from the election
a coalition government made up of labour and the snp could break up the uk , sir john ( pictured ) warned last night sir john , who was prime minister between 1990 to 1997 , last night urged ed miliband to â summon the courage â to formally rule out any deal
the labour leader , who has so far failed to do so , is due to address labour âs spring conference this weekend
sir john said : â the snp would enter into any agreement with labour with one overriding aim : to break up the uk
it is shameful that labour have not already ruled out even the suggestion
â they would be relying on support from a party that will use every strategy it can to break free from the uk
â labour now have to make a choice , â he wrote in today âs daily telegraph
â they must summon the courage of their convictions and declare their intent
â the uk people â north and south of the border â do not deserve to be misled
â if the outcome of the general election is inconclusive , will they refuse to govern with the support of a party whose principal aim is to break up the uk ? â sir john , who was prime minister between 1990 to 1997 , last night urged ed miliband ( pictured ) to â summon the courage â to formally rule out any deal as prime minister , sir john warned that devolution could lead to scotland âs independence
he said he was now speaking out as â an englishman with a profound admiration and respect for scotland â
â at westminster , snp minds would not be focused on the well - being of the uk , but on their own party interests , â he added
â in collaboration , the two parties would make common cause at the expense of their natural enemies
for labour , that will be to pick the pockets of the tory shires ; and for the snp , to boost scotland at the expense of the rest of the uk
â ed miliband is facing increasing demands from senior labour figures to rule out a power - sharing deal with the snp
senior mps are demanding the labour leader uses a keynote speech at the labour conference in edinburgh tomorrow to make his position clear
mr ed miliband is said to be â waiting for the right moment â to rule out a deal
but there is concern that he may only be prepared to rule out a formal coalition â leaving open the possibility of the snp propping up a labour - led government in key votes in exchange for concessions to scotland
david cameron has branded an electoral pact between labour and snp â the ultimate nightmare â .
