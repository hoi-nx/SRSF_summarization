beer is one of the world 's most ancient brews and has played an essential role in society - both for its nutritional and ritual importance - for millennia
now , 5,000 - year - old fragments of pottery used by ancient egyptian to make beer , have been discovered on a building site in tel aviv , israel
it was also drank by rich and poor , adults and children
this was because it was cleaner than water , which came from a river or canal and was often polluted
beer was considered as staple , along with bread , reshafim.org reported
workers were paid with bread , oil , beer and vegetables by their employers
the standard ration was two jars containing three - and - a - half pints ( two litres ) of beer
just like today , the egyptian liked their beer cooled and kept jars in water
â among the hundreds of pottery shards that characterise the local culture , a number of fragments of large ceramic basins were discovered that were made in an egyptian tradition and were used to prepare beer , â he said in a statement
the vessels were made with â straw temper â and other organic material to strengthen them â a method which was not in local potteries
the excavation is the first to offer evidence of an â egyptian occupation â in the centre of tel aviv 5,000 years ago
as well as the basins , a bronze dagger and 6,000 - year - old flint tools were uncovered
dr barken said : â this is also the northernmost evidence we have of an egyptian presence in the early bronze age
â until now we were only aware of an egyptian presence in the northern negev and southern coastal plain , whereby the northernmost point of egyptian occupation occurred in azor
fragments of pottery that are around 5,000 years old and were used by ancient egyptian to make beer , have been discovered on a building site in tel aviv

a total of 17 pits have revealed finds as well as the basins , which were pulled from pits in the centre of tel aviv ( pictured left ) a bronze dagger and 6,000 - year - old flint tools were uncovered
a flint blade is pictured right last year , the tomb of a leading ancient egyptian beer brewer was discovered
the tomb of khonso em heb , who lived 3,200 years ago , was found by a japanese team and has been been described as ' one of the most important discoveries ' made at the thebes necropolic site in the city of luxor
egyptian 's antiquities minister mohamed ibrahim described khonso em heb as the chief â maker of beer for gods of the dead '
he was thought to be the head of a warehouse and judging by the decorations in his tomb was an important and wealthy man
the walls of the tomb contain paintings showing everyday life and rituals
â now we know that they also appreciated what the tel aviv region had to offer and that they too knew how to enjoy a glass of beer , just as tel avivians do today â
according to the antiquities authority , â beer was the egyptian national drink and was a staple along with bread
â it said beer was consumed by the entire population of egyptian , regardless of age , gender or status
â it was made from a mixture of barley and water that was partially baked and then left to ferment in the sun. â various fruit concentrates were added to this mixture in order to flavour the beer
â the mixture was filtered in special vessels before serving
previous excavations carried out in egyptian 's delta region uncovered breweries that indicate beer was already being produced in the mid-fourth millennium bc , the israel authority said
the fragments were discovered in pits on ha-masger street in central tel aviv ( marked on the map )
excavations are taking place before the construction of an office building the vessels ( pictured ) were made with â straw temper â and other organic material to strengthen them â a method which was not in local potteries
this one dates to the bronze age ( 3,500 bc ) dr barken said : â this is also the northernmost evidence we have of an egyptian presence in the early bronze age
