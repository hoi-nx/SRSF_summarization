miliband 's insistence that ' hell yes ' he is tough enough to be prime minister has secured labour a bounce in the polls
the first full survey since mr miliband and david cameron faced a tv grilling shows labour has opened up a four - point lead over the conservatives

but today labour was accused of ' letting the cat out of the bag ' on plans to increase state borrowing
election campaign vice-chairwoman powell said the party ' may use some investment borrowing '
labour has promised only to eliminate the current deficit on day - to - day spending by the end of the next parliament , leaving open the option of borrowing money to invest in capital projects
the institute for fiscal studies says labour 's plans allowed them to maintain an overall deficit as high as Â£ 30 billion by 2020 - at a time when the tories aim to be running a surplus of Â£ 7 billion
' ms powell later insisted she did not recognise the Â£ 30 billion figure , telling the bbc 's sunday politics : ' we are going to balance the books for current expenditure by the end of the parliament
we may use some investment borrowing for much - needed investment but not for day - to - day spending
' those figures are other people 's figures
it depends on what the books are like
' conservative treasury minister priti patel said : ' the cat 's out of the bag - labour have finally had it dragged out of them that they 'd borrow more if miliband gets into downing street
