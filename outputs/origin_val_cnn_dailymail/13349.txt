reading the headlines out of madison , wisconsin , it 's hard not to think about ferguson , missouri
but law enforcement 's response to the shooting of 19 - year - old tony robinson will not unfold in the same chaotic , violent and distrusting way as the shooting of 18 - year - old brown , madison 's top police leaders vowed
" i think it 's very clear that madison , wisconsin , is not ferguson , missouri , " said jim palmer , the executive director of the wisconsin professional police association
the head of the state 's largest law enforcement group told cnn monday that the madison police department , unlike the ferguson department , has a strong relationship with the people it serves
madison police chief koval has been out front and outspoken about tony robinson 's shooting since it happened late friday night
the chief said he understands people are angry and want answers
" we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold , " he said
here are some ways madison law enforcement appears to be responding differently than what was seen in ferguson : difference in what police chiefs did after shooting madison : within hours of the shooting , koval went to tony robinson 's mother 's home
" we need to start as any healing or any reconciliation should with an ' i 'm sorry , ' and i 've done that privately , and i 'm attempting to do that publicly and that 's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years if at all to mend , " the police chief said
the mother did n't want to meet with him but the chief talked and prayed with the biracial teenager 's grandparents in the driveway , he said
they told koval to hold off on trying to talk to the mother because emotions were too intense
" i could n't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences , " koval said
" nineteen years old is too young
" he stressed that " the effort has to be there , " in reaching out to the family
" we have to acknowledge it , we have to own it , we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold , as it were
" ferguson : a day after brown , who was african-american , was killed , protesters took to the streets of the missouri town
they were incensed that witnesses said brown 's hands were up and that the teen 's body had remained in the street , in the sun , for four hours
a month went by before ferguson police chief jackson apologized to brown 's family
" i 'm truly sorry for the loss of your son
i 'm also sorry that it took so long to remove brown from the street , " he said , in a videotaped message
a day after brown 's killing a vigil for him devolved into violence
police tried to keep the crowd under control but clashes erupted
one officer was seen holding the leash of a barking dog , and st. louis alderman antonio french said some officers wielded shotguns
four days after brown was killed and more than a day after riots erupted in ferguson , jackson spoke at a community forum , saying , the situation " has been a tragedy for the city and the country
" responding to criticism that he 'd missed immediate opportunities to address tension in the town that turned into violence , he said , " it breaks my heart [ that ] some think i 'm part of the problem
" the police chief promised the crowd he would be part of the solution
but issues with how the department interacted with protesters and media continued
" keep moving " was a common refrain that police told protesters and law enforcement threatened to arrest anyone who stood along sidewalks , whether they were resting or a reporter taking notes
in some cases , officers told demonstrators they could n't stand for more than five seconds ; some protesters were yelled at for walking too slowly
such a tactic was a violation of the constitution , a federal judge later ruled
in his videotaped message , jackson apologized for that , too
" the right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect
if anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry , i feel responsible and i 'm sorry , " the police chief said
five ways the ferguson police chief is in hot water difference in investigation procedures : madison : under wisconsin law , an outside agency is tasked with investigating police - involved shootings
in the case in madison , that would be the dci
once dci completes its work , findings will be delivered to the local district attorney , chief koval said
on monday , gov. scott walker issued a statement saying that another layer of investigation will come from the wisconsin department of justice , which will conduct an independent investigation -- a requirement of all officer - involved deaths
ferguson : chief jackson asked the st. louis county police department to conduct an independent investigation into brown 's killing
it was only a few days that passed between the shooting and when belmar , the chief of st. louis county police department , told media what led to ferguson police officer wilson shooting brown
" the genesis of this was a physical confrontation , " belmar said
brown " physically assaulted " the officer , belmar said , and the teen tried to get the officer 's weapon
differences with timing of releasing the officer 's name madison : chief koval released the name of the officer who shot tony robinson within hours of the incident
he is 12 - year department veteran kenny
the chief volunteered that the officer had shot and killed a man in 2007
kenny was cleared on any wrongdoing in that incident , the chief said , because an investigation determined that the man was killed in a " suicide by cop " situation
during the incident involving tony robinson , kenny suffered a blow to the head , koval said
he has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation
ferguson : three days after brown was killed , ferguson police backtracked on a promise made a day earlier to release the name of the officer
the reason the department gave ? threats made to another officer who was falsely accused on social media of shooting brown , jackson said
the chief said he thought the threats were " credible " and that " the safety factor far outweighs the benefit from releasing the name , which is minimal
" lawyers representing brown 's family blasted the decision , and accused the police of protecting their own and ignoring standard procedures
difference in how authorities described victim 's past madison : wisconsin circuit court documents indicate tony robinson pleaded guilty in december to an armed robbery that occurred last april
but when koval was pressed for more details , he refused to talk about the teen 's record or any run - ins with law enforcement
" i could but i choose not to , " the chief said
" i frankly think it is , for our purposes today , wholly inappropriate and i am not going to blemish anyone 's character , particularly someone 's as young as his
" ferguson : six days after brown 's shooting -- on the same day police released officer wilson 's name -- police released surveillance video of a convenience store robbery in which brown was allegedly involved before he died
the decision to release that video frustrated many , including others in law enforcement
missouri state highway patrol capt. johnson stated the robbery and shooting of brown " are separate issues
" " i told ( chief jackson ) i think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go , " johnson told cnn
" today is about taking care of this incident here , getting to those facts that are there , and brown and his family
" differences in mayor 's reaction immediately after shooting madison : less than a day after the shooting , mayor paul soglin vowed that " there will be answers , " the wisconsin state journal reported
" we all deserve to know the facts in this case , " he said
" tony robinson 's family deserves that , our community deserves that , and the madison deserve that
when the answers come , we will be open and transparent in communicating them
" the promise to be transparent in sharing results of an investigation were repeated on the city 's web site
ferguson : ferguson mayor knowles urged the community to stay calm and not escalate the situation
" we do n't know what happened and there are lots of conflicting stories , " knowles said
" unfortunately there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened
hopefully we will get to an understanding and justice will be served
" speaking a day after a vigil for brown devolved into a riot , knowles said on cnn that " the events of last night are not indicative of who we are , " and that the chaos was " not constructive " and only " bringing down the community
" difference in size and tone of rallies and tone madison : on friday night , dozens of demonstrators gathered in madison
" who do we trust ? " some called out , prompting the response , " no one ! " and in another refrain , they chanted , " black lives matter , " a phrase that ferguson protesters coined
online the # willystreet hashtag , referencing to williamson street , where the shooting happened , trended
" praying for madison tonight , " wrote one activist
" stand up , sit in , walk out - until u get answers
and until there are no more hashtag eulogies
" the demonstrations , which have been constant , have remained peaceful
watch protesters outraged over police killing ferguson : just hours after brown was killed , a vigil for him turned violent as people hurled bottles at officers and kicked police cars parked on the streets
the often - violent demonstrations continued off and on for weeks , and protests around the country were held in solidarity
while many protesters were peaceful , in late november buildings were set on fire and destruction spread after a grand jury said it had decided not to indict officer wilson
