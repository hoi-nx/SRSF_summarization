sturgeon has vowed to join forces with labour after the general election to ' lock david cameron out of downing street '
in a speech in glasgow tonight , she said that scotland mps would vote to stop a tory government ' even getting off the ground ' in the event of the snp getting a majority north of the border
speaking to 3,000 delegates ms sturgeon also put forward policies which would increase public spending , including an end to austerity , a rise in the minimum wage , and increased payouts to youngsters who stay on at school past the age of 16
in echoes of conservative adverts showing ed miliband in the pocket of alex salmond , she also talked about the snp ' forcing labour 's hand ' and giving the labour party ' backbone and guts '
she said : ' let me said it loud and let me make it clear - the snp will never put the tories into government
' as long as there are more anti-tory mps-labour or snp - than there are tory mps in the house of commons , we can keep them out of government
' if there are more anti-tory than tory mps after the election , the only way the tories get back into power is if labour lets them back in
' so in the interests of total clarity , let me make this promise today
if there is a hung scottish parliament , snp mps will vote to stop a tory government even getting off the ground
she also said that the snp would ' force labour 's hand ' in government , giving ed miliband 's party ' guts and backbone ' ' i call on labour , today , to match that pledge - to make clear that if labour and the snp combined have more seats than the tories , they will join forces with us in a vote of confidence to lock david cameron out of downing street
' ms sturgeon said a vote for the snp was ' a vote to make sure that the tories are replaced with a better alternative
' she told the conference : ' if you want a labour government to have backbone and guts , you need to elect snp mps to provide it for them
' and if you want a labour government that wo n't just be a carbon copy of the tories , but will instead deliver the real change scotland needs , then you must elect snp mps to force labour 's hand and keep them honest
' snp mps at westminster would back a Â£ 2 rise in the minimum wage , taking it to Â£ 8.70 by 2020 , the end of the next britain parliamentary term
she also set out her goal of making scotland a ' living wage nation ' , with a target of having 500 companies paying this to their workers in the next 12 months
to help youngsters stay on at school and college , she announced the educational maintenance allowance would be extended
while 35,000 teenagers currently receive the payments of up to Â£ 30 a week , she said more school pupils and part time college students would be eligible for the grant
' from next year a total of 57,000 16 to 19 year olds will be entitled to receive and educational maintenance allowance , ' she stated
she also announced a new fund of Â£ 20 million would be set up in scotland in a bid to tackle violence against women
ms sturgeon also talked of offering ' the hand of friendship ' to the rest of the britain after the bitter independence battle of last year
she said the snp 's goal was still to make scotland indepedent , but until that could be achieved she was eager to work with ' like - minded ' parties throughout the country
she added : ' to people in england , wales and northern ireland , i make this promise
the snp stands ready to work with you in making that positive change for all of us
' addressing scotland voters , she said : ' we will work every day to protect scotland 's interests and to make your voice heard
' we will seek to use whatever influence you give us to call a halt to ever deeper austerity , to protect our nhs and to say loudly and clearly that the precious resources of our country should be invested in the future of our children , not in nuclear bombs
' we will use our influence to win for our scottish parliament the full financial and social powers that it needs to grow our economy and create more jobs
' and we will work in a spirit of friendship and co-operation with others who share our ideals - we will work with everyone , wherever they may be in the britain , who wants to see greater fairness and prosperity at the heart of their communities too
' while her speech was met with a six - minute standing ovation in glasgow , her critics rounded on her policies saying they would ' wreck the economic recovery ' , adding that she ' had n't learned the lessons ' of previous years
scottish liberal democrat party president malcolm bruce mp said : ' sturgeon 's Â£ 180 billion borrowing plans threaten to wreck the economic recovery across the britain
in an effort to put the bitter campaigning of the independence referendum behind her , she said she was ' extending the hand of friendship ' to the rest of the britain , while still advocating scotland independence ' we know that the cost of interest repayments alone would be equivalent to a new secondary school every other day
they have n't learnt the lessons of the last economic crash
' it is not liberal or progressive to leave an ever growing mountain of debt for future generations to pay
we will not spend today what our children should have tomorrow
' labour leader jim murphy added : ' no - one will be fooled by sturgeon 's claims to be the britain 's best friend when the snp 's entire purpose is trying to break up britain
' there was no mention today of the austerity max that would be inflicted on scotland if the snp were to follow through on their policy of full fiscal autonomy
' the first minister knows , but wo n't admit , that snp sums do n't add up and her economic plans would lead to a Â£ 7.6 billion black hole in tax revenues
