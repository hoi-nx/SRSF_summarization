a woman with multiple sclerosis was forced to get out of her power wheelchair and carried on stage to speak at a disability conference
speaker haygarth was hoisted out of her chair and escorted by two people up the four stairs between the floor and the raised stage
disability rights advocate jax-jacki brown was at the national disability summit at melbourne 's sheraton hotel last thursday and was outraged by the oversight
speaker haygarth , who has multiple sclerosis , was forced to get out of her wheelchair and carried by two people on and off the stage ' i thought ' they 're going to pull out a ramp , they obviously planned for this ' , ' she told daily mail australia
' no ramp was forthcoming so the next best thing is they are going to move the table and microphone so she can sit with everyone else , but they did n't do that
' they suggested she move out of her chair and be carried on by two people
' ms brown - who is a wheelchair - user herself - said it was degrading to see a person in a wheelchair be treated like that
' it just removes your agency and your power to move around the world , ' she said
' it makes you dependent on someone to give assistance
to add further insult , chairs were stacked inside the disabled toilets , preventing people from using it ' it 's not the way you want to be able to be seen
it 's not an empowering way to enter a stage
' to add further insult , the disabled toilet at the venue had been stacked up with chairs , preventing people in wheelchairs who had to go to the bathroom from using it
ms brown said disabled toilets were often seen as secondary storage spaces
' to use a toilet is quite crucial and a fundamental right that non-disabled people take for granted , ' she said
' it speaks volumes about the space the national disability summit was held in
' i mean we do n't even have the right to pee
' susan ryan , who is the disability discrimination commissioner at the australian human rights commission , said she had written to the organisers of the summit
disability rights advocate jax-jacki brown was at the national disability summit in melbourne and said it was a degrading sight to see the sheraton hotel in melbourne has apologised for the incident , saying they ' fell short ' of delivering all their duties , and vowed a similar incident would not reoccur
' on behalf of sheraton melbourne hotel , i would like to apologise for the incident that took place at the national disability summit
we fell short of delivering all of the necessary requirements and this is disappointing , ' hal philp , general manager at sheraton melbourne hotel said
' at sheraton melbourne hotel , the comfort and safety of our guests is of paramount importance to us
whilst these are isolated incidents , it is nonetheless a lesson learnt
' we will ensure every effort is made to further improve the accessibility in our hotel premises , so that such incidents do not re-occur , ' mr philip added
but this is not the first controversy the national disability summit has attracted
this year , only seven people with a disability were allowed to attend the two - day conference , causing a social media outrage
daily mail australia has contacted the organisers and sheraton hotel for comment on the matter .
