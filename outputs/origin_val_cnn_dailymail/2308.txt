he wants to be the most powerful man in the country
but according to his local paper , miliband is n't even the most powerful man in doncaster , where he is an mp
in a blow for the labour leader , he has been ranked just fourth in the town 's power list , behind more influential figures like the mayor and one direction 's louis tomlinson
mr miliband has been mp for doncaster north since may 2005 , but a decade representing the town and now on the cusp of running the country is not deemed significant enough to topple more significant local dignitaries
ros jones , the elected mayor of doncaster , topped the charts as the most powerful person in the town
the former public sector accountant , first elected in 2013 , is a keen marathon runner and a school governor
second on the list was jo miller , chief executive of doncaster
third place went to louis tomlinson , the one direction star who grew up in the town and last year launched a doomed bid to by doncaster rovers football club

mr miliband 's history in doncaster was laid bare earlier this year in the memoirs of former mayor winter
it included an incident in which he nearly killed himself when he accidentally set fire to mr winter 's office and , inexplicably , bought the family a Â£ 25 muslim prayer mat for christmas to cover the hole burnt in the carpet
mr miliband also nearly missed a meeting with gordon brown when he locked himself into his own house
the labour leader later tried to ridicule one of mr winter 's most damaging revelations , that he miliband told him in october 2007 - a year before the british financial crash - that the british economy was about to ' fall off a cliff '
it was claimed that labour had wanted to call an early election to cling to power before voters found out
' i am apparently mystic mili , ' said the labour leader sarcastically
' i kept the global financial crisis from everyone and revealed it to only one person - not the head of the world bank , the imf , or the governor of the bank of england , but someone at the epicentre of global finance - the mayor of doncaster
