arfield believes burnley have it in them to shock city again when the premier league champions visit turf moor on saturday
the burnley pulled off arguably their most eye - catching result of the season at the etihad stadium in december when they fought back from two down at half - time to claim a 2 - 2 draw thanks to goals from george boyd and ashley barnes
it epitomised burnley 's against - the - odds fighting spirit and the memory will spur them on this weekend

' we know it 's going to be difficult
we 're not in a fairyland where we think it 's going to be easy , but we know what we 've got in the dressing room
we know we 're going to work for each other and technically and ability-wise we 've got that as well
' last time at half - time we knew one goal could change it , and it did , and we had chances to win it as well
first half they were superb and we knew if they got the next goal it was going to be very difficult for us
' but you get a goal and , no matter who you 're playing against , it 's going to take its toll
we started getting control of the ball and passing it about and then barnesy turned up with a wonderful finish
' burnley followed up the point against city by claiming a draw at newcastle and then beating qpr but since then times have been tougher
they are without a win in two months after failing to turn good performances into points , although they did hold chelsea to a draw in a game now better remembered for ashley barnes ' controversial challenge on nemanja matic
the fixture list has not been kind , with the burnley facing manchester united and liverpool along with chelsea over the past month while matches against southampton , tottenham and arsenal follow the city clash

' when you 're playing against your cities , liverpools , uniteds , they 're the games you look forward to at the start of the fixture list , the ones you want to play in
' every game 's enjoyable in this division but when you 're playing the big boys you want to get on the ball and show what you can do
' burnley 's fate is likely to be decided by their home form , and arfield knows they can not afford more of the slips that saw them fail to turn leads against crystal palace and west brom into wins
' it 's massive , ' said the scot
' with the fans behind us , last season it was a fortress at times , people did n't want to come and play against us at home
' this season we need to get back to that
the fans have been different class and we need to get more points
