on trial : jerice hunter ( pictured left in court wednesday ) , 41 , is facing murder charges in the death of 5 - year - old jhessye ( right ) , who went missing in 2011 bad parenting : hunter is accused of keeping her daughter in a bedroom closet at the family 's apartment in glendale , arizona , depriving her of food and water , and beating her harsh : prosecutor gallagher told jurors hunter threw her 5 - year - old away ' like trash ' â the defendant threw her away like trash , â prosecutor gallagher told the jury in her opening statement
' all that is left of jhessye is her blood on the carper in her mother 's closet
' hunter has maintained her innocence
she reported jhessye missing in october 2011
police say the mother told them she left jhessye with the girl 's older siblings while she ran errands , and returned to the family 's glendale apartment to find the child gone
about 100 police officers who fanned across hunter 's neighborhood knocked on doors and stopped motorists to see if they knew anything about the disappearance
an amber alert was issued
a 96 - day search of a landfill ended without finding jhessye 's remains
authorities say hunter was arrested after inconsistencies with her account were mounting and after witnesses came forward
hunter also came under scrutiny during the investigation for an october 2005 arrest with her then - husband on child abuse charges in california
in that case , the mother pleaded no contest to corporal punishment and served about four years in prison before she was released on parole in may 2010
her oldest child , then 14 , told police his mother routinely beat the children
criminal record : hunter ( left ) was arrested in october 2005 with then - husband , george shockley , ( right ) for child abuse recovery mission : 280 officers sifted through more than 9,500 tons of trash from early february to late june at a phoenix land - fill site , but jhessye 's remains were never found hunter looked squarely at jurors as the prosecutor laid out her case
she did n't kill jhessye and believes her daughter is alive , said hunter 's attorney , shoemaker
â there is no body
there is no proof she is dead , â said shoemaker , who offered no alternative theory on what became of the child
shoemaker said two people saw jhessye at her apartment complex within hours of the report of her being missing
the defense attorney also told jurors to take a hard look at the upcoming testimony of jhessye 's older sister , who is now 17
the teen did n't allege abuse when she first spoke to police , shoemaker said
the sister was in charge of jhessye when she disappeared and changed her account because of guilt , the attorney said
while in foster care after jhessye 's disappearance , the oldest daughter was isolated from her siblings and â started to internalize those feelings , â shoemaker said
the prosecutor said it 's unknown whether jhessye died from malnutrition , dehydration or injuries she suffered
â the answer to that question will never be known , â gallagher said
in the weeks before the child was reported missing , hunter explained her daughter 's 19 - day absence from school by saying she had pinkeye and ringworm , gallagher said
hunter 's attorney said his client did n't kill jhessye ( left and right ) and believes her daughter is alive the mother also provided inconsistent details to the girl 's school on efforts to get her medical treatment , gallagher said
authorities say hunter instructed her other children to falsely tell police that jhessye left the apartment while the mother went to a check - cashing business
the older sister later revealed she witnessed her mother 's abuse of jhessye , the prosecutor said
the teen said she found the younger girl beaten up and told authorities the closet where jhessye was held smelled like death , gallagher said
the prosecutor said hunter got a neighbor to drive her to a tempe apartment where hunter said she was going to sell a suitcase full of clothes and shoes
once they arrived , hunter told her neighbor that the buyer was n't there and that the items for sale could be left in a trash bin , gallagher said
the neighbor saw hunter put on plastic gloves before she removed a suitcase from the vehicle 's trunk and dropped it in the trash , she said
authorities believe the suitcase contained the child 's remains
the trial is expected to conclude in early may .
