new zealand coach steve hansen flew out of dublin three weeks ago bemoaning boring european rugby
after saturday âs spectacular conclusion to the 2015 six nations , you hope his television was nât on the blink at his home in christchurch and that he caught every single second of an engrossing 240 minutes spread across the three round five matches
the three teams who entered denouement day on six points apiece â england with a +37 points difference , ireland +33 and wales +12 â all wound up on eight points each but with one crucial photo finish difference â ireland âs calculus was revised upwards to +63 , six better than england âs +57 and 10 clear of wales â +53
mere numbers , though , ca nât properly tell the tale of this nerve - shredding afternoon where credit must go to wales for transforming a slender 14 - 13 interval lead in rome into the 61 - 20 thrashing and igniting the subsequent thirst for points at murrayfield and twickenham
sexton ( left ) and paul o'connell ( right ) arrive at dublin airport with the trophy fully in their grasp ireland 's fans got a chance to touch the coveted six nations trophy outside dublin airport when it all ended , with england a metre short of the french line in forlorn search of the title - clinching converted try , steve hansen âs eyes should have been watering with the wonder of it all
a whopping 27 tries â after just 36 in the four previous rounds â dozen games â in a 221 - point attacking rugby harvest
with eight - try wales 48 points clear of azzurri , a margin that would have set ireland the target of a 28 - point win in edinburgh , a vital late twist had the air of 2007 revisited ( azzurri scored a late try eight years ago to cut ireland âs margin and france won the title by a points difference of +4 )
azzurri winger leonardo sarto proved unstoppable from his 10 - metre line , touching down on 79:24 for the converted try that saw ireland âs desired goal suddenly become a more manageable 21
rob kearney ( centre ) holds the six nations trophy in front of a mixture of youthful and experienced fans having scored just four tries in 320 minutes , they doubled that tally through oâconnell âs fifth - minute opener and oâbrien âs 25th and 72nd - minute brace either side of jared payne âs 50th - minute effort
then , jamie heaslip won a seemingly lost cause , marvellously knocking the ball from stuart hogg as he went to ground for a consolation scotland try
it set england the chase of a 26 - point victory and they fell short , referee nigel owens penalising them on 80:12 at a ruck for sealing off
ireland were champions and it was just as well
if england had pounced for that deciding converted try , the finger of blame would have been pointed in scotland at both sexton and madigan
with ireland 20 points ahead and needing another score to jump ahead of wales on the table , sexton inexplicably missed two penalty kicks in quick succession
jamie heaslip ( centre ) poses for a photograph with a young fan after returning to ireland the first effort , from in front of the posts close in , collided with an upright and the second , from the 10 - metre line , drifted wide to the right
he eventually recomposed himself , landing the pole - taking penalty on 62 minutes before signing off nine minutes later with cramp having energetically applied pressure to earn the lineout that was a foundation for the revitalised oâbrien â s second try
there was still time for another sloppy penalty miss , a nervous madigan pulling his close - in attempt to the left , but it would have been cruel had this hat - trick of missed penalties come back to haunt them a few hours later
unlike wales , who needed a last - second penalty to secure a one - point stadio olimpico half - time lead , and unlike england , 15 - 10 in arrears until the 27th minute in london , ireland hit the front early and resolutely stayed there against the winless scots , their only defensive aberration being rob kearney âs error which left robbie henshaw defending a three - on - one overlap down the blindside of the ruck for finn russell âs converted try on the half hour
ireland were crowned six nations winners after a dramatic final day that saw them edge england and wales other than this repeated weakness in shackling breakdown ball quickly shifted from right to left ( france and wales scored against them in the same corner and england came within a whisker of doing the same ) , ireland fixed the issues that betrayed them in wales
they did nât get stuck at the murrayfield ruck , did nât start lethargically , didn â t trail by a dozen points 14 minutes in due to poor indiscipline , did nât tactically kick inaccurately and did nât blow up damagingly at the lineout due to talismanic oâconnell taking on the responsibility of calling a plethora of ball on himself
exuding pride in his team âs resilience to overcome the disappointment of blowing their grand slam chance , joe schmidt hailed his skipper for grabbing the team by the scruff of the neck post â wales and engineering the title - winning response
ireland powered to a 40 - 10 victory over scotland at murrayfield that won them the six nations title england beat france 55 - 35 at twickenham but it was n't enough to overhaul ireland â you could see them starting to bounce back on thursday
i texted the players on tuesday and just said , â training was nât flash today but get a day âs rest and let âs start from scratch on thursday and really launch ourselves into this last challenge â , â he said
that 24 - word missive had the desired effect
â you know when you ask something of them they are going to give it their very best shot
it âs funny , we took a fair bit of confidence out of cardiff
â you give wales a 12 - point head start , a lions pack team , get to within four and really put pressure on them â that in its own way gave us a little bit of confidence even though we did nât get the result
â seven days later , that grand slam - destroying outcome was forgotten
ireland were back - to - back champions for the first time in 66 years and their spontaneous celebrations , just like the calibre of their rugby , were anything but boring and anything but one dimensional .
