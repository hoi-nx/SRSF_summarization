the snp will force ed miliband to abandon planned spending cuts from labour 's very first budget if the party holds the balance of power after the election , alex salmond said today
the former scottish first minister said the snp would hold all ' the power ' if a labour government needed its votes to survive â and even claimed the party 's surge in support showed it had been the real winner of last year 's independence referendum
he said the party would demand an end to austerity â with billions of pounds more borrowing and debt â as the price of propping mr ed miliband up in power
appearing alongside the former scottish first minister on the bbc 's andrew marr show , ms anna soubry said : ' the thought that we are in a position where you can be actually controlling in the way that you have described this uk fills me with absolute horror
' the audacity is atonishing
there was a wonderful debate in scottish , you lost it
we are a uk , that is what the people of scottish wanted
' but mr alex salmond , who is standing to re-enter parliament in the gordon constituency , boasted that the party was set to dictate what was happening in westminster
he said it would be ' very good for scottish ' if there was a decisive number of snp mps after may 7 , adding : ' if you hold the balance , then you hold the power , ' he said
asked if that meant ed balls or another labour chancellor would have to negotiate their budget with the snp , he replied : ' yes , any minority government has to negotiate in order to win a majority for its proposal
to deny that is to deny reality
' if the snp are in these circumstances it will be very good for scottish , certainly
' tory defence minister anna soubry said mr alex salmond 's remarks were ' terrifying '
she said : ' the thought that we are in a position where you can be actually controlling in the way that you have described this uk fills me with absolute horror ' mr alex salmond mooted an example where he would propose an amendment to budget legislation in order to create a high - speed rail line to edinburgh
' what would ed balls do ? ' he asked
pressed on what kind of deal was possible with labour , mr alex salmond said : ' the labour party have ruled out a coalition but have n't ruled out a confidence and supply arrangement , where you have a set programme ... i think it is more likely to be a vote by vote arrangement
' the former snp leader said : ' i think it 's a very bad idea in politics to bend under pressure
' mr alex salmond went on : ' hopefully that decisive bloc of snp mps will move the labour party in a different direction
ed miliband has vowed not to form a formal coalition with the snp after the elction ' i think there is lots of people - certainly lots of people in scottish
. but i think people across these islands are pretty fed up with the duopoly at westminster and might want to see politics a bit more interesting , where parties have to work for their votes and have to justify things on a vote by vote basis to the people of the country
' i think lots of people will find that a much more exciting and productive system of politics
' mr alex salmond told pienaar 's politics on bbc radio 5 live that mr ed miliband had been ' very foolish ' to rule out a formal coalition with the snp
the mistake was ' not because it was likely to happen but because he did it under pressure from the conservative party '
' i think it 's a very bad idea in politics to bend under pressure , ' he added
mr alex salmond said he believed scottish independence was now ' near inevitable ' , and hinted that a commitment to a new referendum could be included in the snp manifesto for the 2016 elections north of the border
' the story is not finished
i think the direction is now as near inevitable as anything can be in politics , ' he told the marr show
' i think what has happened is that we have established the gold standard of how you have a process for scottish becoming independent
' what you have to have is a party or parties have to put it in their manifesto for the scottish election , they have to win a majority in that proportional parliament to hold a referendum and then the decision of course lies with the scottish people
' mr alex salmond also appeared to rule out taking over as leader of the snp 's westminster group in the new parliament
' no , angus robertson is leader of the group at westminster , ' he said
' the snp has a collective approach on these things but the person who calls the ultimate shots is nicola sturgeon
' labour leader murphy said the snp would have ' no bargaining chips ' to control a minority government headed by ed miliband as they had already ruled out working with the tory pushed on whether renewing trident was a ' red line ' for the snp that would prevent a deal with labour , mr alex salmond said : ' you could n't have a coalition or a confidence and supply , but a vote by vote is what comes up in the house of commons
' labour leader murphy said the snp would have ' no bargaining chips ' to control a minority government headed by ed miliband as they had already ruled out working with the tory
and he warned scottish that they could not vote snp to get a labour government ' by proxy '
alex salmond insisted his successor nicola sturgeon would lead the negotiations with labour after the election ' people are coming more to the understanding that the biggest party gets to form the government , ' mr murphy told the bbc 's sunday politics
' it is either labour or the tory
you can not vote for a labour government by proxy ... it is one or the other
' asked about polls suggesting labour faces losing dozens of seats to the snp in scottish , mr murphy admitted his party had not been ' good enough ' over recent years
but he argued that the public was ' starting to listen ' to what they had to say
' we have got a long way to go , ' he said
' if these polls are repeated on election day this will be a bloody , awful showing for the labour
' but much more important it will be a dreadful day for scottish because by accident we would re-elect david cameron ... ' david cameron would cling on to power
he would be an accidental prime minister
' john lamont msp , scottish conservative chief whip said : ' four weeks before postal ballots go out , alex salmond is taking the votes of people in scottish for granted and planning back - room deals with labour from a tv sofa in london
even for him , this is stunning arrogance
' now he is talking up the prospect of a vote - by - vote deal with labour - one ed miliband still refuses to rule out
' that would mean the snp holding a weak labour party to ransom on every vote , every day , all with the aim of trying to weaken the uk
' a year after scottish gave a clear and unequivocal no to the snp 's separation plans , alex salmond would be back at the heart of westminster trying to sow chaos with our future
