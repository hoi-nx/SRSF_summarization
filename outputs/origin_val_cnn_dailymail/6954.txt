for fans of mcdonald 's breakfast menu who have dreamed of the day it was served outside of morning hours , the time has come ... but only as a test run in san diego
select locations will serve all - day breakfast with the partial menu featuring some of the chain 's breakfast sandwiches and hash browns
the exact sandwiches have not been revealed
depending on how successful the test is , the chain could expand the all - day breakfast menu to other markets , according to business insider
last month , the fast - food chain began looking at how it could make breakfast available later in the day , said jeff stratton , head of mcdonald 's usa
offering both the breakfast menu past 10.30am alongside the lunch menu had been considered logistically impossible , given the tight kitchen spaces of the restaurants
mcdonald 's even tweeted about the topic in february , saying it does not serve breakfast all day because its grills ' just are n't big enough for breakfast and lunch
' on their website in response to why they do not serve breakfast all day the company wrote : ' here âs the thing : it comes down to the sheer size of kitchen grills
' they simply do nât have the room for all of our menu options at one time â especially considering we use our grill to prepare many items on our breakfast menu
' the push to make breakfast available outside normal hours partly reflects how mcdonald 's is working to keep pace with shifting habits
in particular , executives have noted that customers increasingly want foods personalized to their tastes and schedules
breakfast also accounts for about 25percent of sales at mcdonald 's , and is the strongest part of the day for the chain , according to the chicago tribune
if the test is successful , mcdonald 's could expand the all - day breakfast menu to other markets ' we look forward to learning from this test , and it 's premature to speculate on any outcomes , ' wrote spokeswoman terri hickey in an email , according to cnbc
' we 're excited to serve our customers in this area some of mcdonald 's great - tasting breakfast sandwiches , hash browns and other favorites all day long
' mcdonald 's said on monday that it was too early to speculate on any outcomes from the test
janney had released an analyst note earlier and said that their industry sources had told them mcdonald 's planned to test all - day breakfast in the u.s. the analyst note was released before mcdonald 's confirmed the report
' having those breakfast items available to sell all day would also serve as a reminder to customers ( and the media
) that mcdonald 's does indeed have craveable food to sell , ' janney analyst mark kalinowski wrote .
