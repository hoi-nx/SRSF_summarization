england and france will meet in a winner - takes - all showdown on tuesday to determine which nation makes july 's european championships in greece
both recorded victories on saturday to maintain their perfect records and take their elite round qualifying group to the wire
england squeezed past azerbaijan 1 - 0 in bayeux thanks to a first - half winner from manchester city 's smith-brown , his second decisive goal in two matches
smith-brown scored england 's winner as they recorded a vital result over azerbaijan france , meanwhile , beat denmark 2 - 0 to lead the way on goal difference , meaning that sean o'driscoll 's young lions must beat them in saint-lo to take the group 's only qualifcation spot
as expected , england dominated possession and chances against azerbaijan , but could only convert one of them
it came eight minutes before half - time when smith-brown collected the ball wide on the left , cut inside and curled a lovely shot into the far corner
confidence was high in the england camp after twice coming from behind to beat denmark 3 - 2 on thursday and this game reverted to type almost immediately
faced with an azerbaijan team with 11 men behind the ball , england knew they would have to be patient and their first effort came from range when fulham 's patrick roberts saw a 25 - yarder tipped over by goalkeeper tolga sahin
sean o'driscoll 's england side must now beat france on tuesday to qualify for the european championships lewis cook , of leeds united , fired narrowly off target when debutant aaron kuhl , of reading , picked him out on the edge of the penalty area
that pressure eventually told when right - back smith-brown marauded forward to score what would prove to be the game 's decisive goal
the second - half , unsurprisingly , followed a similar pattern , with patrick roberts and kuhl going close during its early stages
azerbaijan 's one and only attack of note culminated in elnur jafarov firing wide of the far post when well - placed
