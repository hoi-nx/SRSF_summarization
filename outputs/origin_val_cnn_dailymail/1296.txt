i had a baby shower and got lots of girly things

james radley said : ' we found out on clair 's 20 week scan that we were expecting a girl
' two weeks later we named her eden-elsie and we spent the next 18 weeks buying pink clothes
' we moved house just three weeks before clair was due so it was a massive rush to get our pink nursery decorated in time
' clair had a pink baby shower and we had a wardrobe full of pink outfits for our new arrival
' we spent around Â£ 400 on our unborn baby girl so when clair went into labour we had no idea that we were about to meet a boy
' we just turned to each other and laughed when we were told he was n't a girl
' obviously we were thrilled to have a son but it was a huge shock
' all the outfits we had bought to the hospital were pink so i had to dash out and buy him something blue to go home in
' our parents thought we were joking when we said we had a boy and we had to send them pictures for them to believe us
' we named our baby boy hugo and we are now waiting to redecorate his nursery
' our three year old , liv , keeps calling him eden though as she 's still a little confused that he 's actually her brother , not sister ! '
