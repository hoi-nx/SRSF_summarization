the death friday of sgt. andrew joseph doiron marked canadian 's first casualty as part of the u.s. - led coalition 's war on the extremist islamic state group
canadian officials could not be immediately reached for comment sunday on the peshmerga claim , though canadian 's defense minister previously acknowledged andrew joseph doiron 's death came as a result of ' a case of mistaken identity
' peshmerga spokesman hekmat said a group of canadian soldiers showed up unannounced friday to the village of bashiq , in iraqi 's nineveh province near the militant - held city of mosul
the area had seen heavy fighting against islamic state militants the previous day
' when they returned , the peshmerga asked them to identify themselves , ' hekmat told ap
' they answered in arabic , that 's when peshmerga started shooting
' hekmat added that he does n't know why the canadian were there
' i consider it an improper action by the canadian and illogical , ' he said
