tourists and new york have been slammed for taking selfies while visiting the scene of last week 's devastating gas explosion in the east village
the blast last thursday set four buildings ablaze , killed two men and injured 25 people
but some people believed it was still appropriate to smile and pose for a social media picture as emergency crews surrounded the charred site
the photograph was posted to the twitter account eventsphotosnyc and drew a barrage of criticism
one commenter said : ' everything that âs wrong with new york summed up in one photo
' another of those condemned was freundlich , who describes herself as a political communications professional on linkedin and was a communications director at the iowa democratic party
caught in the act : one man decides to take a self - portrait from the top of a nearby building as the thick smoke rises from the scene the blast last thursday set four buildings ablaze , left 25 people injured and caused the death of two men ben foecke , executive director of the iowa democratic party , told the daily mail online : ' freundlich left employment with the iowa democratic party over thee weeks ago
march 6th was her last day on payroll
' her actions since then are completely outside our control and oversight
' freundlich reportedly resigned to ' seek opportunities elsewhere
' she was also a field organizer for barack obama 's florida campaign for change in 2008
she uploaded an image of her giving a peace gesture in front of the police barricades surrounding the burnt - out part of the block
some people said the photo was ' disgusting ' while others told her to leave new york
a reporter from spanish - language channel univision was spotted by newsday reporter michael chayes talking a selfie as the press gathered
one social media user said : ' disgraceful
no place for a selfie in face of disaster
' other instagram users who had taken the selfies quickly took them down when they realized their error in judgement
