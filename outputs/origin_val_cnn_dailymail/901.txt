the new rangers regime have suspended llambias , leach and sandy easdale from the club âs football board pending an investigation
the move against the last remnants of the old order at ibrox came four days after dave king and his allies swept to power with an emphatic egm victory
that shareholder vote saw chief executive llambias and finance director leach â associates of ashley - removed from the plc board
sandy easdale was not a plc director but had been chairman of the football board
it âs understood all three are no longer welcome to visit ibrox
chief executive llambias ( left ) has been suspended by rangers ' pending an investigation ' details of the investigation under way have not been disclosed , but dave king pledged last friday to take a thorough look into how the business had previously been run and to examine contracts already in place
leach was last month criticised after a disparaging remark about the three bears consortium â who made a rival funding offer to ashley âs Â£ 10million loan - appeared in leaked minutes of a meeting with the rangers fans board
the consortium then called for leach to â become subject to his employers disciplinary processes and ultimately dismissed for gross misconduct â , adding that â it is our view that he has brought the club into disrepute â
a statement from rangers yesterday confirmed the suspensions and the new make - up of the football board
dave king 's new era post-mike ashley ( left ) has started with direct action to the board of directors â rangers announce today that llambias , leach and sandy easdale have been suspended from their duties pending an investigation , â it said
â it is also noted that mr llambias and mr leach , along with sandy easdale , have been advised that a resolution to remove them as directors of the company has been received by the company
a meeting may be required for this purpose but it is hoped that this will not prove necessary
â acting chairman murray , fellow directors douglas park and gilligan , and the club âs head of football administration andrew dickson have been appointed to the board of the company
â in response , sandy easdale âs spokesman insisted they were â surprised â at the announcement , adding : â we also note that they talk about an investigation
sandy easdale welcomes that as he has absolutely nothing to fear
â the development came as rangers beefed up their new - look plc board , with the appointment of london - based financial businessman bennett â once a member of the blue knights consortium - and rangers supporters trust spokesman graham as non-executive directors
solicitor james blair â of rangers first - has also been announced as company secretary to further recognise the work done by the two main fan ownership groups

dave king has delayed his own appointment but intends to become chairman subject to gaining â fit - and - proper â approval from both the financial authorities and the sfa
sandy easdale âs brother james was previously a plc director but resigned along with chairman david somers prior to last week âs egm
llambias and leach still have executive contracts with rangers and were viewed by dave king and his allies as being ashley âs representatives on the board
