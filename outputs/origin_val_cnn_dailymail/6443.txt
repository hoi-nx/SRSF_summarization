the number of drivers hauled before the courts for using their mobiles at the wheel has plummeted by nearly half
despite alarming evidence that growing numbers of motorists are committing the offence , the number of prosecutions has fallen by some 16,000 over three years
in one area , greater manchester , the fall has been even more sharp , and is down by 80 per cent
official figures also showed worrying falls in the number of court cases brought against other driving offences , including those for drink drive offences , and dangerous driving
that is despite evidence deaths occuring as a result are on the rise
the number of drivers hauled before the courts for using mobile phone at the wheel has plummeted by nearly half
stock photo the figures were compiled by labour , which warned that reckless drivers were â getting away with it â and blamed cuts to the police front line
shadow roads minister richard burden said : â road users have had enough of reckless drivers getting away with it
â under the conservative - led government progress on road safety is slowing while more and more drivers go unpunished for dangerous and drink driving
â the hands - off approach to enforcement is not working
crashes from mobile phone use are on the rise but thousands fewer drivers are being punished for this deadly offence
â the research follows calls from britain âs top traffic officer for drivers caught using their mobiles at the wheel to be banned
gloucester chief constable davenport said the rise in offending meant tougher punishments were needed , and accused ministers of failing to act for fear of offending voters
an estimated 500,000 motorists break the law every day but ordinarily using a hand - held mobile at the wheel usually attracts only a Â£ 100 fine with three penalty points
figures also showed worrying falls in the number of court cases brought against other driving offences , including those for drink drive offences
stock photo the new data shows police are using formal powers to prosecute much less often
across england and wales , the number of prosecutions for using a mobile at the wheel fell from 35,255 to 19,650 between 2013 and 2011
that is a fall of 15,605 , or 44 per cent
in greater manchester , the number of prosecutions fell from nearly 2,000 in 2010 to just 329 in 2013
falls of more than 60 per cent were seen in the cumbria , merseyside , south yorkshire , west midlands , warwickshire and kent police areas
research has suggested using a mobile slows reactions more than cannabis or alcohol use
drivers â reactions fell by half while holding their phone and on a call , more than a third when texting and by a quarter during a hands - free call
the number of crashes attributed to mobile phone use has grown by 12 per cent , from 378 in 2012 to 422 last year
the alternative to a formal prosecution is a fixed penalty notice , but the number of these handed out is also down by 26 per cent
drink drive deaths rose by one fifth from 2011 - 12 and while the numbers prosecuted for drink driving offences is down nine per cent
miss davenport , who speaks for the association of chief police officers on road issues , told the bbc on sunday : â if someone is caught twice using a mobile phone within a period of time we should be considering things like disqualifications
â if we do nât do something fundamentally different we are going to have lost this
i have had those conversations with ministers
i would take a much harder line in terms of outcomes from enforcement
the minister does nât like my proposal
â ministers rejected the claim they were blocking road safety reform for electoral reasons and accused chief constables of taking the easy option of using speed cameras instead of deploying more traffic officers .
