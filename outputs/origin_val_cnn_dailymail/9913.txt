the green party is set to unveil its big weapon for the general election campaign â a sultry , pouting , middle - aged â boyband â comprising cameron , miliband , clegg and farage
the party , which is languishing at six per cent in the polls , is recruiting lookalikes to portray the four main party leaders in a cringe - inducing party political broadcast due to be screened next month
strangely , the greens are even hiring an actress to play their own leader , the gaffe - prone natalie bennett , and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates
strategists stipulate that her doppelganger be in her late 30s to mid- 40s â although bennett is 49 â and be â like a schoolteacher , life experience under her belt
she must also be â the voice of reason , friendly , warm and approachable but has a message to get across â
the full excruciating details of what the greens believe is â a fun , clever and refreshing idea â is revealed in a leaked casting brief
fake that : our mock - up of ( left to right ) party leaders cameron , clegg , miliband and farage as a boyband it adds that four male party leaders â lookalikes â should be unnaturally intense , emotional and passionate â like a boyband
loads of smouldering stares , deep thinking and soulful singing
thick lashings of powerful slow motion movements and pensive gazes will help intensify the drama
â they may be leaders of different parties , but they seem to know the same lyrics to the same song and be in perfect harmony
i like the idea that as the song builds and climaxes , they are literally finishing off each others sentences â¦ that is how ridiculously in harmony they are
â above all , they should all look incredibly pleased with themselves
it will be amusing to have disgruntled reaction shots of the other leaders at the end as the green party âs common sense message is delivered
â on the lookalikes , it adds : â it would be great if the leaders were slightly better looking , more buff and hunkier than the actual leaders in real life
kind of how they see themselves inside their own minds
but this is not a priority
first and foremost they need to register as politicians
â less kind critics might suggest that the greens need to register as politicians themselves
some of the cringe - inducing lyrics of the green party âs song spoof it âs sweeter when we agree , a party political harmony ( oh baby ) lose your voting inhibitions , join the one true coalition ( ohh - ahh - lii - shuuuuun ) let âs frack this green and pleasant land
come on eddie , join the band the public wo nât know what to do , if they have to pick from me and you - uuuu the choice between us could nât be clearer
oxford ! cambridge ! diversity for ya whether it âs trident or high speed 2 , the lesser of four evils is up to you mos man : how i gatecrashed world 's unfunniest send - up by adam lee-potter it is unusual enough to be in the same room as messrs cameron , miliband , clegg and farage
but to be in a backstreet soho studio with 13 versions of them gyrating , pouting and cavorting around was beyond bizarre
welcome to the casting session for what must go down as the most toe - curlingly awful party political broadcast ever
i secretly infiltrated the green party audition under the flimsy guise of being an ersatz cameron
it was clear they were desperate
i emailed , just hours before the audition , telling them â truthfully â that gok wan once told me i looked like the pm
do n't call us : our reporter adam lee-potter goes to the hideously awkward audition for the green party broadcast did i say they were desperate ? i heard back within minutes â and the woman did nât ask if i was a professional actor or had an agent
i âm not , clearly ! i was told that i would be auditioning for cameron at 2pm the next day and that the fee â just for turning up â was Â£ 250
but the email warned i should be prepared to â boyband it up â â possibly the four most upsetting words i have ever received
at the offices of die-cast , all 13 of us were told to learn our lines â which seemed a tad rich of the green party when its own leader could nât remember hers in a â car crash â interview with london âs lbc radio station
i hurriedly attempted to memorise the lyrics of take that âs greatest day â the mawkish pop video for which we were set to recreate
then five minutes later , it all changed : we were told to forget that and instead mug up on a â it âs sweeter when we all agree â version
this was rapidly becoming more confusing than a green party conference , not least because despite being middle - aged and suited , i do nât look at all like cameron
but then the other three in â my â boyband looked nothing like their supposed doppelgangers either
â give me some smoulder , â the director implored
â be as seductive as you can
â i âm 44 years old , for pity âs sake
i did try to smoulder , which is hard enough at the best of times , but painfully embarrassing when you âre told to lip - sync to a tepid backing track
i could nât help thinking this was part of the democratic system our forebears died for
that the law requires the nation âs broadcasters to actually screen this rubbish
chaos loomed when some portly chap â i have no idea whose lookalike he was supposed to be â admitted he did nât have a suit with him
desperate : the greens are even hiring an actress to play their own leader , the gaffe - prone natalie bennett ( pictured ) , and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates the sweet woman in charge duly dispatched him to marks & spencer , telling him to take it back for a refund â after the gig â
then the internet went down
oh , and they could nât work out how to play the track
then it was the volume control
i rang my wife at this point
â is this april fool âs day ? â came her reply
finally , after an anxious , 30 - minute delay during which the pros gargled noisily and massaged their vocal cords , and i â um â did nât , we were on
the brief rehearsal was over and this was the real audition
i was in the first batch of hopefuls , which i took as a promising sign
we were escorted into a small , bright room
behind the camera were an assortment of trendy types in lumberjack shirts and lots of facial hair
we read out our names and posed for profile shots
we then had to mime along to the song
â try to emote like a real boyband , â said the director patiently
â really go for it
â i did try to channel my inner one direction but i ended up looking like i was having a fit in the deep end of a swimming pool
we carried on prancing about , nonetheless
then , worryingly , the clegg double cuddled me â i do nât quite know why â as we moved into the second verse
truly hideous : reporter adam lee-potter described his efforts as ' david brent at a teenage disco : excruciating and slightly off ' shakespeare it ai nât , but the greens clearly hope this song will ram home their point : when there âs little to divide the main party leaders , vote for us instead
next , we were told to â seduce â the camera , one by one
i pouted , foolishly , and even tried a little growl
one of the crew tittered , not unreasonably , as i awkwardly caressed my chest and even smoothed my eyebrow with a licked finger
yes , it was truly that hideous
imagine david brent at a teenage disco : excruciating and slightly off
finally , we had to mime to camera as if we were making a political speech
we all flapped the air and did that funny pointy thing with our thumbs that cameron likes to do
the miliband lookalike â the only one even remotely like his famous â double â â got especially carried away , letting out an impressive glottal volley of gibberish
eventually , we were done , much to everybody âs relief
â you âll be hearing from us if you âve been successful , â said an assistant
we could say the same of the green party
they should nât hold their breath .
