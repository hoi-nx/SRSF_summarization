wenger has branded jardim a liar after the monaco coach accused the frenchman of a lack of respect following arsenal 's exit from the champions league
jardim , whose side beat the gunners on away goals in the last 16 of the competition , said wenger left for the changing rooms early rather than shaking his hands after the ligue 1 side 's impressive 3 - 1 win at the emirates stadium in the first leg
the portuguese boss thus decided not to thank the 65 - year - old following arsenal 's 2 - 0 victory in the return fixture
