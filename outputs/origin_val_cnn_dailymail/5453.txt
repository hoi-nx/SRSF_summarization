today might be mother âs day but when it comes to staying slim women ca nât afford to put their feet up , according to a study
for they burn far fewer calories watching tv on the sofa than their partners do
doctors who measured how much energy three couples expended during day - to - day activities found large differences between the amounts men and women used
no time to relax : women burn far fewer calories watching tv on the sofa than their partners do all six ate a 600 - calorie fry - up before each couple was assigned a different activity : an hour in the gym , three hours of cleaning , or lounging about
their energy use was then assessed
patrick and roma burn were lucky enough to spend the morning on the sofa
but while patrick burned up 640 calories just by being a couch potato , roma used only 292
the results are to be shown in a bbc1 programme , the truth about calories
presenter dr van tulleken said women tended to burn fewer calories at rest than men because they did not weigh as much and had less energy - hungry muscle mass. â bigger people burn more calories than smaller ones , â he said
but patrick and roma were extreme examples , he noted , as mr burn was â 100kg of lean muscle â and his wife â probably weighed half that â
a morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout , the programme found the programme also found a morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout , which left the couple exhausted
jim norris got through 834 calories and his wife elaine 729 during the morning , in which they spent an hour in the gym lifting weights
meanwhile , nick and margaret shenkin burnt 862 and 629 calories respectively cleaning the house
dr van tulleken said : â moderate continuous activity uses more calories , and body size and lifestyle â what you do with your day â also play a much more important part than you might think when it comes to calorie consumption
