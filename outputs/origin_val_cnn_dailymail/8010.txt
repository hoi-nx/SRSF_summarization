professor michael kelly , pictured , was one of 43 fellows of the royal society who wrote to the president to warn that it was in danger of violating its founding principle five years ago , i was one of 43 fellows of the royal society â the first and arguably still the most prestigious scientific organisation in the world â who wrote to our then - president about its approach to climate change
we warned that the royal society was in danger of violating its founding principle , summed up in its famous motto â nullius â â or â do nât take another âs word for it ; check it out for yourself â
the reason for our warning was a royal society document which stated breezily : â if you do nât believe in climate change you are using one of the following [ eight ] misleading arguments
â the implication was clear : the royal society seemed to be saying there was no longer room for meaningful debate about the claim that the world is warming dangerously because of human activity , because the science behind this was â settled â
we hoped we would persuade the society to rethink this position
that document was revised so that the uncertainty involved in trying to model the climate was admitted
but since then the royal society has become more , not less dogmatic â despite the fact that since we sent that letter , it has become evident that there is even more uncertainty than previously thought
carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have continued to rise , but since 1998 there has been no statistically significant rise in global temperatures at all
this flies in the face of the confident predictions made by nearly all the climate computer models that the temperature would continue to rise as it did from 1975 to 1998
more than 60 different explanations have been proposed to explain why this â pause â or â hiatus â has happened , and their sheer number is the clearest evidence that the system that climate scientists are seeking to model is irreducibly complex
human - sourced carbon dioxide is at best one of many factors in causing climate change , and humility in front of this complexity is the appropriate stance
yet the royal society continues to produce a stream of reports which reveal little sign of this
the latest example is the pre-christmas booklet a short guide to climate science
last year also saw the joint publication with the us national academy of sciences ( nas ) of climate change : evidence and causes , and a report called resilience
through these documents , the royal society has lent its name to claims â such as trends towards increasing extreme weather and climate casualties â that simply do not match real - world facts
both the joint report with the nas and the short guide answer 20 questions on temperatures , sea - level rises and ocean acidification
but a report today by the academic council of the global warming policy foundation , which includes several society fellows and other eminent scientists , states the royal society has â left out â parts of the science , so the answers to many of the questions ought to be different
i have personal experience of this selectivity
last year , at the request of the president , i produced a paper that urged the royal society âs council to distance itself from the levels of certainty being expressed about future warming
i said it ought at least to have a â plan b â if the pause should last much longer , so calling the models into still more serious question
i got a polite brush - off
prof michael kelly said the royal society , pictured , was founded on the principle â nullius â â or â do nât take another âs word for it ; check it out for yourself ' professor michael kelly fears the royal society has become more dogmatic when considering climate change the great 20th century physicist , richard feynman , wrote in his autobiography : â details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given , if you know them
you must do the best you can â if you know anything at all wrong , or possibly wrong â to explain it
if you make a theory , for example , and advertise it , or put it out , then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it , as well as those that agree with it
â this the royal society has failed to do
the reason for this lack of nuance seems to be that policymakers say they want â scientific certainty â
as an engineer , i find that amazing : we remain legally liable for what we say professionally , so will always qualify our statements
but the misleading lack of qualification in the statements made by the royal society and others is creating policy nonsense
the climate change act requires the uk to cut its co2 emissions by 80 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050 â at mind - boggling cost
generating electricity from windmills has contributed to electricity prices increasing by twice the level of inflation over the last decade , with further huge rises to fund renewable energy to come
aluminium production is highly sensitive to energy prices , and most of the uk smelters have closed down â helping us reduce uk emissions , but also exporting jobs
he claimed the commitment to slash co2 levels by 80 percent from their 1990 levels by 2050 is mind - boggling no one describes the consequence : we now import that aluminium from chinese , leading to co2 emissions from shipping it here
worse , most electricity in chinese is produced by coal , not gas , as in the uk
we are exacerbating the original global problem of global co2 emissions , yet also pointing fingers at the chinese
we really are leading the world in climate change hypocrisy
the project to â solve the climate change problem â is a modern version of the biblical tower of babel
we do not know how much the project will cost , when it will have been completed , nor what success will look like
during my time as a government departmental chief scientific adviser , i was always aware that politicians made the final decision on any issue on the balance of all the evidence
for this reason , civil servants are trained to draw their attention to all the upsides and downsides of taking a particular course of action
those who fail to provide balance are not giving advice , but lobbying
it is with the deepest regret that i must now state that this is the role which has been adopted by the royal society
and when scientists abandon neutral inquiry for lobbying , they jeopardise their purpose and integrity
