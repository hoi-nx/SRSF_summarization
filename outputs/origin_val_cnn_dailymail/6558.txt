henderson has insisted the vast majority of england youngsters will want to play in the european under-21 championship this summer â but that pressure from club managers can make it difficult
henderson says that his time with the under-21 was a huge learning curve , even though when he played in under - 21 euro 2013 as captain , england lost all three games in a deeply disappointing tournament
henderson also played in the 2011 european under 21 championship , in which england also failed to win
england midfielder henderson played in under - 21 euro 2013 as captain but with a club versus country row already developing over the availability of harry kane this summer , henderson has urged the current generation to take their chance to play if they can henderson said : â i would tell any of those young lads to go out there and play in tournament football for their country at any level
â i thought i gained a lot of experience doing that
it was nât all good as i had two under - 21 tournaments and we did nât do that well in either
we could have done a lot better with the team we had â but i learnt a lot from playing in those games
club versus country row already developing over the availability of harry kane â there was never any doubt for me
all i wanted to do was go and play
obviously people get injuries , which you ca n't help , but if you 're fit , i wanted to go
you 've got to manage it with the club managers , who think about the best interest of the player
and you 've got to understand that
but for me personally i want to play every game for club and country and if i 'm fit i 'll want to play at a tournament whatever the level
henderson says that most of the players do want to play â but that pressure from clubs is the reason why sometimes are withdrawn from age - group squads
â i 'm not sure it 's players needing convincing , â said henderson
â if you asked all the lads they 'd want to play
but managers of clubs have to manage the player the best they can and their best interest is the player
â if they feel the player is playing a lot of games and are afraid they 'll burn out , that 's an issue
but for me i just wanted to play as much football as i could , whenever for , and though the tournaments did n't turn out how we wanted , i gained a lot of experience
