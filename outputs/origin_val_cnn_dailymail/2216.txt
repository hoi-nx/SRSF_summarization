within weeks of samsung releasing its waterproof galaxy s5 last year , apple filed a patent that took its rival âs technology a step further
called â methods for shielding electronic components from moisture â , the filing awarded today describes a way of making the inside of a phone waterproof rather than the outside
individual components would be covered in a thin film designed to stop liquids damaging the phone , even if it manages to penetrate the outer casing
the patent said protective cases have â little value â once water has entered the phone and details a system of adding â hydrophobic coating to components â
this coating would be applied using plasma - assisted chemical vapour deposition in which thin films are applied from a gas , or vapour , states to a solid state samsung âs galaxy s5 is ip67 rated thanks to a hydrophobic coating and cover that clips into place to protect the handset
the firm also added a rubberized gasket behind the back cover and added a waterproof coating inside the headphone jack
ip67 stands for ip67 , and was created by the international electrotechnical commission
it is used to classify how much a coating provides protection from ' intrusion or immersion '
the rating is typically followed by two numbers - the first is the level of dust resistance , the second is water resistance
dust resistance ranges from zero to six , and water resistance ranges from zero to nine
if an x is included , the device does n't offer a classified rating for that substance
a rating of seven on the waterproof scale means : ' ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water ( up to one metre )
' as a result , the galaxy s5 can be submerged for up to half an hour at around 3ft ( 0.9 metres )
however its latest models , the galaxy s6 and s6 edge , have removed this feature
apple âs patent would instead involve coating individual components inside a phone , and within an already assembled circuit board
this coating would be applied using a method called plasma - assisted chemical vapour deposition ( pacvd ) , which desposits thin films from gas , or vapour , states to solid states
the plasma is typically created between two electrodes where reacting gases are added to form the solid
in the case of the fully - assembled circuit board and its electromagnetic interference ( emi ) shields , apple proposes perforating â portions of the shields that overlay water sensitive electronics
â the coating would be applied through these perforations , and the board - to - board connectors would be covered by a silicone seal
the filing said : â people who rely on electronic devices tend to carry them along to locations in which the electronic devices can incur damage
â one form of damage that can be detrimental to an electronic device is water damage

the firm also added a rubberized gasket behind the back cover and waterproof coating inside the headphone jack
as a result , the galaxy s5 can be submerged for up to 30 minutes at 3ft ( 0.9 metres ) in the case of the fully - assembled circuit boards and electromagnetic interference ( emi ) shields , apple proposes perforating â portions of the shields that overlay water sensitive electronics
â the coating would be applied through these perforations , and the board - to - board connectors would be covered by a silicone seal â many electronic devices are susceptible to water damage because they are not fully sealed and include various openings for charging , connecting peripherals , and inputting and outputting audio
â while bulky cases have had a certain amount of success at mitigating water entry through the aforementioned openings , a protective case is of little or no value once water has entered a device housing
â when water enters into the device housing , some high powered components and wiring are often subject to damage even when a minimal amount of water enters the electronic device
â in particular , corrosion of soldered components is quite common and can lead to device failure
â meanwhile the board - to - board connectors inside the phones ( components illustrated left ) would be covered by a silicone seal
despite adding waterproof features to its galaxy s5 , samsung removed this for its latest galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge handsets unviled at mobile world congress on sunday ( right )
