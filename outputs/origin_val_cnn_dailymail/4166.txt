south africa won their first knockout match ever in a world cup as they cruised to a nine - wicket victory over sri lanka in their quarter - final on wednesday
in what proved to be kumar sangakkara and jayawardene âs final one - day international matches for sri lanka , south africa showed they are not a side willing to hold on to the tag of â chokers â
an immense display with the ball , from spinners imran tahir and jp duminy , and in the field helped south africa bowl out their opponents for a paltry 133 , before the under - pressure quinton de kock hit a sublime unbeaten 78
jp duminy leaps in celebration as he claims the wicket of kaushal on his way to a hat - trick south africa celebrate the opening wicket of perera in their dominant quarter - final win over sri lanka proteas fast bowler kyle abbott jumps for joy after catching the edge of sri lankan opener perera keeper quinton de kock claims the catch as sri lanka 's first wicket falls for just three runs with all the pre-game talk being dominated about south africa âs failure to win a single knock - out match since their reintroduction into international cricket 20 years ago , they looked like a team intent on proving they have the ability and nerve to go all the way
after rangana herath was ruled out for rest of the tournament , kaushal became only the second player ever to make his one - day international debut in a world cup match as he took his place
following sri lanka winning the toss , captain matthews drew a likeness between the mystery spinner and muttiah muralitharan
but it was tough introduction to international cricket for the 19 - year - old as sri lanka wilted under the pressure of a knockout game , a scenario south africa are more than accustomed too
at a sun - bathed scg , choosing to bat first seemed like it gave the 2011 world cup finalists the edge but they collapsed to 4 - 2 after just four overs
thirimanne showed intent to reach 41 from 48 deliveries against a quality south african attack leg - spinner imran tahir celebrates after taking a catch off his own bowling to dismiss thirimanne perera , who had been pushed to the top of the batting order in an attempt to take the attack to the south african bowlers , fell to the increasingly impressive kyle abbott
de kock took a sensational one - handed diving catch , at the second attempt , after perera edged behind for just three
and fellow opener tilakaratne dilshan fell for a duck as he edged a sharp dale steyn delivery that was caught by faf du plessis at slip , despite the ball dying on him
lahiru thirimanna then joined kumar sangakkara as the pair looked to resurrect and rebuild sri lanka âs innings
despite having four consecutive hundreds to his name coming into the match , kumar sangakkara looked more like a player terribly out of touch and searching for runs
having taken 16 balls to score his first run , it took 42 to hit his first boundary as the south african pushed for further breakthroughs
at the other end , thirimanne was batting far more fluently and despite his partner âs troubles , sri lanka were finding their way back into the quarter - final
however , the introduction of the south african spinners proved to be the turning point
kumar sangakkara , in his last odi match for his country , attempts to hold the inning together as wickets fall also in his final world cup match , jayawardene fell cheaply to the south african spinner for four jayawardene trudges off the scg after faf du plessis took the catch from imran tahir 's bowling south african all - rounder jp duminy celebrates as he takes the wicket of sri lanka captain angelo mathews kumar sangakkara 's incredible form continued as the sri lankan veteran got off to another top start but after three successive hundreds at the world cup , morne morkel ended his innings on 45 off 96 balls the constantly excitable imran tahir took a simple caught - and - bowled as thirimanne threw away his wicket to bring jayawardene to the crease
despite being 69 - 3 , with two sri lankan legends at the crease playing alongside each other in an odi for the 150th time , there was a feeling that they could still post a competitive total
but having made just four off 16 balls , jayawardene walked off the cricket field for the last time in his career as imran tahir had him caught at short midwicket
and it was south africa âs fifth bowler , jp duminy , who caused the greatest damage as he became the eighth player in world cup history to take a hat - trick
a poor shot from matthews , after he looked set , as he tried to whip a flighted delivery from outside off through midwicket was the 30 - year - old âs first scalp from the last ball of his eighth over
nuwan kulasekara walked after the thinnest of edges was caught by de kock before debutant kaushal tried to play around the ball and was trapped plumb in front
quinton de kock opens up his shoulders as the south africa opener takes to the sri lankan bowling the left - hander sweeps on his way to 78 runs from just 57 balls as the proteas chase down 133 de kock , keen to hit his way back in to form , celebrates reaching a sublime half - century with kumar sangakkara âs batting partners deserting him the left - hander attempted to open up but having made 45 he holed out to deep mid-wicket off morne morkel
as sri lanka âs leading run - scorer trudged off the scg in his last one - day international for his country there was a sudden downpour , as if even those in heaven were crying tears of sadness
even with south africa âs dismal knockout record , failing to score 134 seemed even beyond them and when hashim amla hit the first ball of the innings for four the omens seemed to be good for them
despite having a previous high score of just 26 thus far in the world cup , de kock played fluently , hitting 12 fours on the way to making 78 off 57 - balls
at the close of the match , south african captain ab de villiers asked for jayawardene âs shirt , a sign that every player knew the magnitude of losing a great player
for south africa they executed their game plan perfectly , ticking every single box possible to show the watching world that they are serious world cup contenders .
