it is the favourite winter holiday of the middle and upper classes - a week in a europe ski resort , with days spent exploring the mountain slopes and evening tucking in to local food
but for some , the time spent at some of the highest spots in europe is focused more on drinking , sex and partying into the small hours
welcome to the andorran resort of pas de la casa , where it seems holidays are all about boarding , bargain booze and budget holidays
and the series , currently airing , has proved so popular that viewing figures doubled over the first two episodes
with pas de la casa having the reputation as having the one of the best nightlife scenes of any ski resort , it 's certainly an eye - opening experience
the four main bars , that are packed out during ski season , are the milwaukee , underground , paddy 's bar and the shamrocks
from downing shots in the bars , to having an early morning skiing lesson with ' dreadlock dave ' and partying with craig , the ' pete tong of pas ' , all things are covered
and it 's not just the visitors behaving badly
the 30 or so british workers at the resort will often drink and part as much as the tourists , with one worker admitting she will have about ' 20 shots ' while working behind the bar
fellow barman danny admits that in the previous season he slept with 15 girls , but says he is aiming for 22 - 25 this season
despite the cold weather , there 's always time to take to the jacuzzi , and these tourists from wales take the plunge following a night on the tiles , it would n't be wise to miss your early morning ski lesson with ' dreadlock dave , ' pictured here with bar worker beth it seems skiing is not particularly high on the agenda for visitors , despite the high costs of booking winter holidays
two lively party girls from irish find themselves on holiday for five days longer than they planned in episode three , while competitive craig organises an alcohol - fuelled snowman - building competition , and three hungover resort workers go heli - skiing
' we were meant to book it for five days , ' say the two irish visitors
' but we hit the wrong button on ryanair and we 're here for ten
' ' everyone keeps saying to us ' you 're total p * * * * * * * s and you 're not going to make the slopes , ' but realistically probably all we 'll make is one day on the slopes
' group trips are particularly popular at the bargain resort
fierce drinking battles between essex and bournemouth - a groups of friends who had swapped sand for snow to party hard - take place in the resort 's bars
both sides of life at the ski resort are show here , from necking beers and shots on a wild night out , to a moment of romance as joe proposes to his girlfriend michelle on the slopes a group of party animals from yorkshire get into the spirit to celebrate one of their birthdays meanwhile three brothers from kidderminster , who are travelling to the resort for the first time without their parents , are under no illusions what they 're there for
engineer scott , 19 , says : ' this year we 're allowed to go mental , completely mental
just go out there and get smashed , every night , just drink hard and ski harder
' twenty bottles of jã¤germeister and a further 20 of vodka are sold every night in the resort 's bars , so it 's little wonder party animals flood the venue
the resort is very male - dominant , with 95 per cent of those who stay there being men
and where alcohol and pride is concerned , this can lead to a tense atmosphere at time
episode four shows how things can take a turn for the worst as skiing takes a back seat for most of the holidaymakers , replaced with drinking , vomiting and fighting
a group of lads from leeds talk through how the drinking games fit into skiing
this pair from essex are forced to show their drinking prowess when they come up with some rival holiday - goers from bournemouth ' if you fall over it 's a shot , if you fall over coming off a ski - lift that 's two shots , if you mack ( take ) somebody out that 's a pint , ' says byron
' if you 're sick that 's five shots , ' adds his friend johnny
' it 's just a vicious circle basically
' the show also explores those much - discussed resort relationships , from bar workers danny from paddy 's and milwaukee 's beth
despite being on , off and then on again , the pair work out how they are going to surprise each other for valentine 's day
and in the latest offering , the other side of life at the ski resort is revealed when joe from stevenage pops the question to his girlfriend michelle , complete on bended knee in the snow
brits on the piste is shown on 5 * and the next episode is sunday , march 8 at 11pm .
