when it comes to style , few would argue that top designer tom ford has it in spades
so no surprise that the fashion guru 's former home in chelsea , london , has a certain je ne sais quoi
the stylish apartment , where the american lived between 1994 and 2004 whilst heading up gucci , is now on the market for a cool Â£ 1.15m with estate agents strutt and parker - who say having a famous former tenant is proving a big draw for the property
inside the apartment , where tom ford lived between 1994 and 2004 , while heading up gucci the apartment located in redcliffe gardens in sw10 has a master bedroom , and a stunning roof terrace post apparently still arrives for the designer , pictured , from time to time the designer is now based across the pond but there are still plenty of stylish neighbours to rub designer shoulders with - adele , kylie minogue and frank lampard among them
arranged over two floors and flooded with light , the 900sqft apartment has a bright and airy feel
the apartment has been updated since the designer left more than a decade ago
when the current owners did refurbished the property they claim that they found a number of gucci material samples with handwritten notes
the cool apartment located in redcliffe gardens in sw10 has a master bedroom and en - suite , an open - plan reception room and kitchen and a stunning roof terrace
up the spiral staircase there 's a further bedroom and shower room and access to the roof terrace with view across the city
wooden floors and industrial style lamps and staircase give the pad a the cool factor - as does the muted colour palette
the 53 - year - old designer has a degree in architecture , so perhaps it 's the apartment 's stylish split - level structure that appealed
apparently parcels apparently still arrive for the designer from time to time - so you never know what unexpected extras might be thrown in for the Â£ 1.15m price - tag
simon rose , head of strutt & parker in west chelsea , said : ' this flat is special for a number of reasons
' a stone 's throw from the kings road , it 's been recently refurbished , it split over two levels linked by a cool spiral staircase and features a fabulous private roof terrace perfect for summer parties
' having a famous ex owner always helps generate a buzz and it 's certainly providing a talking point with prospective buyers
' up the spiral staircase there 's a further bedroom and access to the roof terrace with view across the city a bird 's - eye - view of tom ford 's former chelsea pad , which is now on the market for a cool Â£ 1.15m
