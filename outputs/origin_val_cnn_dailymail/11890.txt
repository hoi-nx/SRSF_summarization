the parents of a young girl with leukemia who want to build their daughter an outdoor playhouse have been blocked by their homeowners association
pete and schultz , who live in the kansas city , missouri , suburb of raymore , say they need the playhouse for their 6 - year - old daughter , ella , because her health keeps her from playing with other children
' she 's earned this â she deserves it , ' pete schultz told the kansas city star
' she ca n't get out and play with other kids
this playhouse is what she would have
when make-a-wish asked what she would like she asked for a playhouse , but the local homeowners association said no. ella and her family live at this home in raymore , a suburb of kansas city , missouri , and had wanted to erect a ' barn - style ' playhouse outside it the make-a-wish , which grants wishes to children with life - threatening illnesses , contacted ella 's parent offering to grant a wish to ella
the young girl said she wanted a playhouse and at first everything seemed to be going well
the shingles of the house were even going to match the ones throughout the neighborhood
but the homeowners association said no. ' the proposed plan they 've given us is a violation of our covenants , ' stonegate board president stacy bayers told kctv
the homeowners group has since published a statement on its website saying the proposal for a ' barn - style ' playhouse was denied because it did n't have enough details to merit an exemption
