' the amount of emotion we shared on thursday and we got back very late - we 've found it very difficult this season after europe
' we are adapting towards being a team that can cope with being in europe
' coping with the goal threat that queens park rangers are going to throw at you takes a lot of character and guts
it was n't a day for a technical performance on the ball , it was about being a strong group and showing we have a strong will
