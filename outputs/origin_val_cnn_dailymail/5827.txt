the wonderful thing with horses is that they know so little
coneygree did nât know he was a novice , did nât know he was fragile , did nât know he was nât worth anything at all
he did nât know a first - timer had nât won the gold cup since 1974 , or that winners of blue riband races are rarely so gauche that they lead from start to finish
and what he did nât know could nât hurt him
it is different for humans
bradstock , wife of winning trainer mark , and daughter of racing legend lord oaksey , who bred coneygree , remembers every doubt , every raised eyebrow , every cruel remark on the road to one of the most remarkable victories in the history of this race
nico de boinville kisses the gold cup following coneygree 's length - and - a - half victory de boinville and trainer mark bradstock are all smiles with the 2015 trophy on november 17 , after two years out with injury , coneygree was withdrawn by a vet at the start of the sis live novices â rsa chase at plumpton
after 660 days off the track injured , the veterinary professional inspecting horses before the race decided coneygree showed signs of lameness
â i said to him , â it âs not just any horse that you âre f * * * * * * me about with here â , â said mrs bradstock , with a countryside earthiness that contrived to sound jolly , sporty and bloody furious at the same time
â and do you know what he said to me ? he said , â he âs had two years off , he âs not worth anything anyway â
â no doubt there is a vet in the south downs area of sussex who is feeling a little sheepish this morning
the diagnosis aside â mrs bradstock felt so angry about it she threatened to get her brother , a qc , to sue â coneygree was worth something after all
he was the horse that could , overcoming newness , shyness and an ability to pick up the strangest injuries to beat a field that included ap mccoy on his last gold cup ride , carlingford lough
to be fair , not even the love of the common people was present for ap mccoy âs horse , which went off at 14 - 1 and never contested , and some will say that coneygree âs victory was evidence of a poor field
mark bradstock insisted there was no such thing â just the odd gold cup that was more open than in other years , and either way , the manner in which coneygree came home made him one of the bravest , if not the best , cheltenham festival has seen
there is something so marvellous about a front - runner
it is the honesty , for a start
it is why the public warmed to paula radcliffe
by the time coneygree came up the hill , any onlooker not financially involved will have been yearning for him to hold on
doubly so if they knew his history coneygree clears the last hurdle to set up a grandstand finish at the cheltenham festival showpiece de boinville and coneygree clear a fence on their way to victory at the gold cup â this little mare that only cost Â£ 3,000 , â said mrs bradstock of coneygree âs mum , plaid maid
she had been bought to give her father , who suffered from alzheimer âs late in life , a little interest in his retirement
he bred coneygree from her , and another horse of note , carruthers , which won the hennessy gold cup at newbury in 2011
â all of the big yards spend telephone numbers on horses , â mrs bradstock added
â people quoted statistics at us , but this shows anyone can do it
i always said , when we win the gold cup we âll win the lottery â it feels that amazing
dad is nât here , but he is looking down on us today , i know
â before the race i spoke to nico , the jockey )
i was reminded of what david said about desert orchid
nobody thought he could step up from two miles to three for the gold cup but david said , â if you go 20 yards clear , go 30 â
that âs what i told nico
if he wants to go clear , let him go clear
â and he went clear
not by much , nothing like 20 lengths
the winning margin was one and a half lengths and coneygree was made to fight by djakadam and road to riches
de boinville was told he did it the hard way
he said he did it the easy way
â he could go again , â he said , admiringly
in the distance , coneygree steamed happily
they are proper horsey people , the bradstocks , and not just because bradstock âs father was a rider and later a brilliant journalist and broadcaster
it is a small stable , no more than 10 horses , and whatever mark spends the proceeds on , it is nât a stylist
his hair looked like he had been dragged through a hurdle backwards
he said he was nât good at watching races and had spent coneygree âs three miles , two furlongs and 110 yards pacing and smoking
bradstock had the air of a man who could have given alex higgins a run for his money in a smoke - off
his wife said he had nearly been arrested by security when his horse won
de boinville celebrates following his 2015 gold cup triumph at cheltenham festival coneygree became the first novice to strike for 41 years when making most of the running in the betfred cheltenham gold cup de boinville is overcome with emotion on his way to the parade ring following coneygree 's thrilling victory de boinville is congratulated by the cheltenham festival faithful as he makes his way to the winner 's enclosure coneygree had been led up by the bradstocks â daughter lily , whose junior riding career was curtailed by a neurological problem in her left leg following a kick from a horse
she would nât have been able to walk two years ago , said bradstock
their son alfie , who has a showjumping background , is credited with a lot of work , too
coneygree jumped beautifully , testament to the effort alfie has put in , along with rider de boinville
bradstock said they had sent the horse over hurdles four times this week to prepare him for the gold cup
one imagines bradstock is the real driving force in the family
â i âm drinking champagne and bradstock will be washing him down in his box , â mark said
â she does most of the work behind the scenes
â for there to be 41 years between novice victories at the gold cup â the last one was captain christy â suggests this was a win steeped in horse sense
the bradstocks knew coneygree âs injuries made it more experienced than the average novice , and chose to run it here rather than in wednesday âs rsa chase
the wet weather , and the result it helped produce , vindicated the call
captain christy was seven when he outran the dikler in 1974
coneygree is a year older
mrs bradstock talked about his perceived fragility â the â ridiculous â long legs and a feisty temperament she believes can be expressed at the wantage stable , but would make him shrink in a big yard
â he âs different , â she explained
â he got an injury to a small muscle at the top of one of his legs
the vet said he had never seen a horse hurt that muscle before
this was a different memory , without the sneer of that afternoon at plumpton
that vet said coneygree had been nodding his head
â of course he was , he was excited to be on a course again , â mrs bradstock explained
he did nât know he had won the gold cup
but whatever the hell had just happened , it definitely seemed like fun the 2015 gold cup champion punches the air as he is led past the grandstand coneygree trainer bradstock is overjoyed following his horse 's cheltenham festival result coneygree ( right ) did just enough to beat djakadam and road to riches in a thrilling finish ap mccoy looks dejected after carlingford lough finished ninth at the gold cup it was the 19 - times champion 's final ride in the gold cup before his retirement chanelle mccoy ( left ) and gillian walsh were full of hope at the off and urge on husbands ap and ruby as the race hots up zara philips ( right ) was in attendance for the gold cup ruby walsh ( centre ) had to contend with second place as djakadam finished a length and a half behind coneygree
