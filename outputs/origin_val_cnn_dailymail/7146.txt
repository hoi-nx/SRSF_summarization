an inquest heard melanie stoddart , 38 , died of decompression sickness shortly after arriving in the indian ocean island for a 12 - day holiday with her boyfriend
there was a delay in ms melanie stoddart receiving medical help because there was initially no boat or plane to take her to hospital
and upon her arrival at hospital , medics did not even treat her for decompression sickness , the inquest into her death was told
her parents , peter , 68 , and irene , 64 , slammed the ' sheer incompetence ' of the authorities in the maldives and warned other tourists to ' take note ' before booking a similar trip
the inquest in chesterfield , derbyshire , heard how ms melanie stoddart , an experienced diver from prestwich in greater manchester , had arrived in the maldives on april , 1 , 2012 with her boyfriend steve greathead
she had been on the same holiday the previous year
on the third day of her organised trip , she was in a party of 12 holidaymakers and two instructors who went to vaavu atoll for the last scuba dive of the day just after 3pm
the inquest was told she returned to the surface after about 30 minutes and asked for medical help as she was feeling unwell
doctors were called and she was taken to the exclusive alimatha aquatic resort nearby
when it became clear her condition was deteriorating the resort 's doctor said she needed to be taken to a decompression chamber , but there was no transport available
a speed boat only arrived from neighbouring bandos island , more than 40 miles away , when insurance checks had been carried out
a doctor sedated ms melanie stoddart , but decided she was not stable enough to be put in a decompression chamber
she was then transferred for a second time by boat six miles to the capital of male where ct scans of her head and chest were taken at the adk hospital
but at 2.15am the next morning she went into cardiac arrest and died half an hour later
doctors were called and she was taken to the exclusive alimatha aquatic resort ( pictured ) nearby the court heard how ms melanie stoddart , an experienced diver , had arrived in the maldives on april , 1 , 2012 with her boyfriend steve greathead
she had been on the same holiday the previous year initially a post-mortem examination proved inconclusive and it took specialist tests carried out on samples of brain tissue to detect damage caused by nitrogen bubbles being present in her blood stream
divers ' disease , or ' the bends ' , is a condition caused from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation
consultant pathologist dr andrew hitchcock told the hearing that the minute damage caused by the bubbles and a ruptured left ear drum suggested ms melanie stoddart had decompression syndrome
her father , peter stoddart , of holmeswood , derbyshire , told the court his daughter was a qualified diving instructor and member of a club who had dived all over the world
' nothing was too much for her , she never failed and was never fazed , ' he said
he said the family had spotted ' discrepancies ' in the reports from police and tour company scuba tours worldwide which raised serious questions about the safety procedures in place
' it 's my opinion there were no proper safety procedures in place on these islands , ' he said
' for a people and a country that relies on diving for its main income i would assume there would have been
' the time lapse was nine hours and that is just not acceptable , ' he added
' if she had been in a chamber within an hour she would have been stable enough to deal with it
' melanie stoddart was diving from the mv sea spirit ( pictured ) in the maldives when she was taken ill the adk hospital in the maldives capital of male where ms melanie stoddart died in the early hours on april 4 , 2012 recording a narrative verdict , coroner paul mccandless said : ' melanie stoddart was a practiced and experienced sea diver who took unwell on a dive
due to a lack of appropriate transport at that time of day there was a delay in taking her to an appropriate facility
' once there , there was a partial misdiagnosis that she was not suffering from compression sickness
she was deemed to be too unwell to go into the chamber and was transferred to hospital ' it is possible that if her condition had been diagnosed sooner that she would not have died when she did
' he added : ' holidaymakers need to be aware of what emergency procedures are in place should any particular difficulties arise
' after the hearing melanie stoddart 's mother irene , 64 , said : ' my daughter 's death was down to sheer incompetence
she received no treatment for nine hours , how can that be right ? ' mailonline has contacted tour company scuba tours worldwide for a comment .
