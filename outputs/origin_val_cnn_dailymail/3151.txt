the widow of the first victim of jihadi john has called for a british ' bounty on his head ' to encourage his isis associates to give him up
haines ' husband aid worker haines , 44 , was the first british hostage to be killed on screen by jihadi john in an isis propaganda video released last september
mrs haines said she believes the british government should have put up a bounty at the time of her husband 's death
last week jihadi john was named as emwazi , a 26 - year - old university graduate from london who was able to flee to syria despite being on an mi5 watchlist
haines ( pictured with haines and their daughter ) said she would like to see the british government stump up a bounty for information about jihadi john , who brutally executed her husband after footage of the first of the brutal killings emerged last year the u.s. senate approved a $ 10million reward for information leading to his arrest
now mrs haines , who lives with her four - year - old daughter in athea , is calling for the british government to follow suit
she told benedict moore-bridger at the evening standard : ' i am sure some of his mates would sell him
i know they are dedicated to some cause but also not all are so honourable , whatever that may mean for them , and they should go for that ' carrot
'' scottish aid worker mr haines , 44 , was brutally executed by emwazi in september after being seized in syria in 2013
mrs haines has previously said she would like to see jihadi john captured alive so he can face justice
she said she would also like to try and find out why he carried out the brutal killings of her husband and other hostages
she added : ' a british bounty should have been put on his head at the time
' scottish aid worker mr haines , 44 , was executed by emwazi in september after being seized in syria in 2013 the widow said she felt david cameron should have acted to put up a reward for information before more people were murdered
she also said she had a ' mess of feelings ' for emwazi 's family who she said must have had ' high hopes ' for their son , but she was baffled as to if they could ever be able to forgive him
mr haines ' other daughter , bethany , 17 , has previously said she would like to see her father 's murderer killed
she said : ' i think all the families will feel closure and relief once there 's a bullet between his eyes
' emwazi was unmasked as the brutal isis executioner last week
victim : haines ( left ) was killed by ' jihadi john ' last september
his daughter bethany ( right ) said families would only feel closure once ' there was a bullet his eyes ' the 26 - year - old , who studied computer programming at the university of westminster , is said to have travelled to the middle east three years ago and later joined isis
after graduating from university in may 2009 , emwazi flew to tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in dar es salaam and sent back to british
en route he stopped in amsterdam , where he claimed to have been accused by an mi5 officer of trying to reach somalia , home of the militant group al shabaab
emwazi : jihadi john ( pictured left and right ) and his asylum - seeking family have milked the british benefits system for 20 years , with westminster city council still paying rent on their Â£ 600,000 home he claimed he was harassed by the security services , and even complained to the independent police complaints commission
emwazi is also said to have featured as jihadi john in the execution videos of british aid worker alan henning , as well as u.s. journalists james foley and steven sotloff , japanese reporter kenji goto and syria soldiers
since his identity was uncovered it has emerged that his father , jasem , disowned him when he learned he was going to fight in syria
emwazi 's family claimed asylum in the british and won refugee status in 1996 and have claimed thousands in benefits
housing the islamic state executioner and his relatives in affluent parts of london has cost taxpayers up to Â£ 400,000 .
