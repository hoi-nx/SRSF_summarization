he told the mailonline that he had ' sought solace ' in the app during an opening speech by conservative deputy council leader samuel
' councillor samuel was giving a speech in a bombastic and aggressive manor and , to be somewhat blunt , i 'd run our of budget agendas and i unwisely sought solace in the scrabble board , ' he said
' i admit it could be seen as ( not representing those who voted for him )
i do apologise unreservedly if it created the wrong impression
the councillor and keen scrabble player said the incident had put him off playing the game for the foreseeable future ' in fact i was listening to every word he said
' mr samuel , who was opening the annual budget and council tax meeting , called mr elengorn 's behaviour ' outrageous '
' he is paid , not an inconsiderable amount of money , to represent his residents and not play silly games
' this is typical of his arrogant attitude and the flippant way he takes his public duties
' if it was me , i would consider stepping down
' conservative councillor helen hill , who took the photograph , said she was ' shocked ' when she noticed him playing the game

' councillor helen hill said she decided to take the photograph as ' a comment on what he was doing when he should have been listening
' he is just an eccentric individual , ' she added

tory mp mills was forced to apologise after he was caught playing games on his ipad during a select committee hearing last december - as the commons authorities launched a mole hunt for whoever caught him on camera
photographs published by the sun showed mills enjoying online hit candy crush during a work and pensions committee evidence session
the amber valley mp , who has been issued with a tablet at the taxpayers ' expense , initially told the newspaper he would merely ' try ' not to be diverted by the game again
but in a statement he said : ' i apologise unreservedly for my behaviour at the committee meeting and realise it fell short of what is expected of a member of parliament
' ' but i 'd like to think people would be more interested in the content of the meeting than whether people were playing scrabble
' councillor elengorn , who was a ' competent ' scrabble player said the whole incident had put him off wanting to play again
' i have a routine , once a fortnight my brother and i play scrabble - but he usually wins
' ' but i did n't look at the game again for a few days after this , i was rather put off it for a while
' john o'connell , director of the taxpayers ' alliance , said : ' councillors receive a hefty allowance to represent the views of their constituents and hold the council to account â neither of which are achieved by playing scrabble
' a spokesman for richmond council said they would not be commenting on the incident

mr nicholson , who was elected in 1997 , admitted after the meeting that he had been using his phone but insisted he was still ' concentrating '
