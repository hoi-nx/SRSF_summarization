the ' crackers ' tv licence can not survive for another decade , johnson warned today as he insisted the bbc uses it to ' demolish ' its competition
the senior conservative said changing viewing habits mean it is harder to justify the ' full whack ' of the levy on every family with a television
he admitted that he now never watches tv news , although he admitted that this is in part because he struggles to turn his television on
bbc director general lord hall has said he is open to the idea , even though it would mean an estimated 500,000 extra households having to pay for a service they do not use or currently get free
but mr johnson today insisted the idea of funding the full slate of bbc output was now in doubt , and the bbc ' needs to think about its future '
speaking on lbc radio , the johnson said : ' many people now no longer get their news , many young people in particular , no longer get their news from tv
' they do n't listen to the today programme
i do n't watch tv news now , i 'm afraid to say , i get it all on the web
so the bbc needs to think about its future
' he went on : ' i have to say i ca n't see how it can go on forever having a tax on tvs that not everybody uses any more
' i can barely make my tv work
frankly i come down and i sit at home wait shouting pathetically for some child to come and help me turn it on
' the culture , media and sport select committee suggested the licence fee could continue for another decade , before being reformed in the 2020s
but mr johnson insisted : ' that seems to me to be too long not to be taking account of the very rapid changes
' at the moment every house pays Â£ 150 in a levy on their television which is crackers
this thing needs to be rethought , the licence fee is plainly anachronistic
' it needs to be trimmed , it needs to be cut but you are never going to get away from the situation in which people feel the certainty that we are supporting really , really high quality broadcasting in this country
' bbc director general lord lord hall has said he believes the licence fee ' has got at least another ten years in it ' he said there would be a case for some money raised from taxpayers to be used to ensure a very high standard of public broadcasting
but he said he doubted whether this meant the ' full whack of the licence fee ' was necessary
' there is going to have to be a change
i think that we are moving in that direction
' the basic question is do you need public sector broadcasting
should we be putting taxpayers ' money into broadcasting ? the argument would be we put taxpayers ' money into supporting all sorts of arts , and they would die in this country if you did n't have support for the arts
' i think you probably do need to support quality broadcasting , proper fantastic productions that the bbc specialises in
' whether you need to support the whole machine â¦ the bbc can be extremely anti-competitive
they take huge sums of money from the taxpayer , from the licence payer , and use it to cross-subsidise businesses that demolish local newspapers , local websites
' a bbc spokesman said : ' we agree with johnson on supporting high quality public broadcasting in this country , and that it would be a shame to lose that , which is why it is important that the bbc is able to continue offering the high quality news , drama , and entertainment the british public loves
' the corporation insisted that 96 per cent of people use bbc services every week
changing viewing habits , including watching online and subscription services , mean the tv licence has become harder to justify bbc boss lord hall yesterday defended the licence fee and said the corporation 's opponents have to be ' honest about the consequences ' of their plans for the organisation
in a speech at new broadcasting house in central london , he said the corporation was at ' a crossroads ' and the licence fee - which is not currently required to watch catch - up tv on iplayer - must be amended to cover ' catch - up television as soon as possible '
the director general said : ' we 've always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times
i welcome the committee 's endorsement of our proposal to require people to pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch - up television
the committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee - a universal household levy
' both proposals have the same goal in mind : adapting the licence fee for the internet age
because i believe we need and we will need what the licence fee - in whatever form - makes happen - more than ever
' in fact , i 'm going to go further and argue that if we did n't have a bbc funded by a licence fee , such is the world we face , we 'd have to invent it
