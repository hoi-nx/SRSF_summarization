the emotion of gaining a career breakthrough and striking a blow for the less gilded outfits at festival proved too much for warren greatrex
the unsung 40 - year - old trainer was unable to blink back the tears behind his spectacles after cole harden had provided him with a first festival winner , and in the biggest race of the day , the world hurdle
it was a victory for an emerging trainer , ridden by his freshman jockey gavin sheehan on a 14 - 1 horse owned by former customs and excise investigator robin eynon and his wife jill from winchester
cole harden makes every yard of the running to win the ladbrokes world hurdle at the festival gavin sheehan celebrates winning the ladbrokes world hurdle , his first victory at the festival gavin sheehan gets to work on cole harden as he wins from the front on the third day of the famous festival 1 cole harden ( g sheehan ) 14 - 1 2 saphir du rheu ( sam twiston-davies ) 5 - 1 fav 3 zarkandar ( n d fehily ) 6 - 1 suddenly the winners â enclosure looked less the preserve of the fabulously wealthy and the heavyweights of the industry they employ
there was incredulity among the victorious names that they had elevated themselves to the kind of company more regularly associated with names like jp mcmanus , mullins and mccoy
cole harden had struck out for the front from the off and stayed there for three miles , winning by three - and - a - quarter lengths
â if you âre going to break your duck you may as well make it a big one
anyone that knows me will tell you i can talk all day long but i âm stuck for words , â said warren greatrex , who eventually managed to articulate his achievement
â i âm small , i âm a youngster at this
i âve got nine runners here , we âre breaking through â we âre trying to compete with the big guys and hopefully this will help
we âve beaten the best
you look at the next two horses behind and they âre trained by paul nicholls ... unbelievable

he now works out of uplands , the former premises of legendary jockey and trainer fred in lambourn , where he has built up a mid-size yard of 75 horses
â i am sure the duke ( nicholson ) is looking down from somewhere with pride and i hope fred would have been proud as well , â said warren greatrex
his faith in cole harden was tested when , after a win at wetherby in november , he struggled in the january âs cleeve at festival and so , less than two months ago , was sent for an operation
â i was struggling with him early season , having trouble with his wind , but then he won at wetherby
he was nât right at the cleeve , so we had it done
it was a soft pallet operation , not a big thing , but i knew we needed to do something
â trainer warren greatrex and jockey gavin sheehan celebrate their first ever success at the festival gavin sheehan takes the acclaim of the crowd as he heads for the winners ' enclosure on cole harden if greatrex is a different name to conjure with then so is eynon , who comes from a less ostentatious school than the increasingly select number of tycoon owners who dominate national hunt racing , like jp mcmanus , ryanair boss michael oâleary and american rich ricci , with his permanently attached sunglasses
cole harden is one of two horses he owns , along with a half - share in paint the clouds , running in today âs foxhunter âs chase
he is the kind of enthusiast who makes a pilgrimage to festival at least once a year , regardless of whether he has a horse running or not
â we âve had horses since 1996 and this is the best day we âve had so far , â he said
â we âve been lucky , every horse we âve had has done quite well
i âve forgotten how much we spent on cole harden , it was nât much ; we do nât spend a lot on horses
â i âve been retired a few years but i worked for many years as an investigator for customs and excise in london , in a department that does nât exist anymore because gordon brown closed it
â when you get something like this it âs really special
we always come to festival once a year and if they got rid of the traffic we âd be here every time
â while cole harden âs victory provided the romance , the powerhouse yard of mullins notched his sixth winner of the meeting after vautour destroyed the field in the earlier jlt novices â chase
ruby walsh and vautour romp home to leave trainer mullins dreaming of next year 's gold cup the irish trainer , now just one short of nicky henderson âs record of winners for the meeting , could scarcely contain his excitement about the 6 - 4 favourite âs potential , which could exceed that of faugheen â the machine â
â this is the real machine , â said mullins
â he is a gold cup horse
â jockey ruby walsh was equally effusive after his 15 - length victory
â he jumped like a gazelle and quickened up so impressively off the bend , it was flawless , â he said
â the horses behind are very good and he ran them ragged
