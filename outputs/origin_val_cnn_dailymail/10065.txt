british mother alpin has not heard from her daughter emma venier since she prepared to face cyclone pam in vanuatu an anxious british mother has not heard from her 18 - year - old daughter for five days after cyclone pam struck the oceania island of vanuatu
alpin , 54 , said she last received a text message from her daughter emma venier - a former head girl at norwich high school - as she prepared to face cyclone pam before it ripped across the tiny island
the storm has killed at least 24 people and left more than 3,300 homeless in the south pacific island
ms alpin , from norwich , said : ' i have to assume that emma venier is ok because i do n't want to think anything else
' she let me know that they were boarding up windows and were on red alert
' as the days go on i 'm just getting worse and worse
i should be at work but i ca n't go because i just ca n't concentrate
' miss vernier flew out to vanuatu , about 1,250 miles from brisbane , australia , last month to take part in a volunteering project in ambae , one of the little nation 's outer islets
she was due to remain in vanuatu until july
the area was ravaged over the weekend by the cyclone as raging 185mph winds destroyed homes , boats , roads and bridges and wrecked power and phone lines
the remote outer islands are not thought to have been as badly hit as the central areas and vanuatu 's capital port vila but radio and phone lines were still down last night
vanuatu has a population of 267,000 people spread over more than 80 islands
about 47,000 people live in the capital
miss vernier flew out to vanuatu , about 1,250 miles from brisbane , australia , last month to take part in a volunteering project in ambae , one of the little nation 's outer islets cyclone pam has destroyed or damaged 90 per cent of the buildings in vanuatu 's capital of port vila this photo taken today shows the widespread devastation caused by the cyclone which struck on saturday a boy called samuel kicks a ball as his father searches through the ruins of their port vila home vanuatu was in the path of the category five storm when it unexpectedly changed direction a family who lost their home in the cyclone carry their belongings on the outskirts of port vila the tiny village of yaohnanen on the southern vanuatu island of tanna - where prince philip is a divine being - has been ' totally devastated ' by the cyclone
villagers have revered the philip after catching a glimpse of him standing on a ship during a royal visit to vanuatu - known then as the new hebrides - in the 1970s
in his fine white naval uniform prince philip looked like a deity and so he was ' adopted ' as the tribe 's personal god
the village , of about 200 people , consisted of little more than wooden huts with thatched roofs - and it was in one of these flimsy dwellings that historic signed photographs , personally sent to the tribe in the 1970s , were being held
rina george , who has relatives living on the hillside where the village is located , said : ' from what we have heard , everything has been smashed down
very little has been left
' ms alpin , a sonographer , said that she was keeping in contact with the parents of other volunteers that her daughter travelled with
' we are all as worried as each other
they are so young - one of the other girls is 17 and emma venier is only 18 ' , she said
' they might not even have any idea how bad things are as the lines are all down
' it has been so sad - people have lost their homes and places are devastated , they need so much help
' vanuatu 's president baldwin lonsdale said the storm had ' wiped out ' all recent development and his country - one of the world 's poorest - and it would have to rebuild ' everything '
he estimated the ' monster ' had destroyed or damaged 90 per cent of the buildings in the capital of port vila
a foreign office spokesman said : ' we are in close contact with the local authorities in vanuatu
' we have not yet been asked but we stand ready to provide consular assistance to any british people who need our help
' any british person who has been affected by the cyclone can get in touch with us on 020 7008 1500
' a massive international relief effort , involving the red cross and unicef , has been launched as vanuatu struggles to get back on its feet
