dolphins are said to have many human - like social traits ; including the predilection for recreational drugs it seems
hidden cameras captured a pod in action as they got ' high ' from nerve toxins released by a pufferfish in waters off southeast africa
in the incredible scene , filmed for a discovery channel special , the sea creatures are seen rolling on their backs with their eyes closed in an apparent state of bliss
at one point the dolphins are seen floating just underneath the water 's surface , apparently mesmerized by their own reflections
to release the substance , the bottlenose dolphins were caught chasing the pufferfish along the ocean floor
in a bid to escape attack , footage shows the fish quickly inflating into a ball shape
the playful dolphins then grab the puffer between their teeth and pass it around until it eventually lets out a burst of poison
a brown - colored cloud is seen dispersing and diluting in the water
as the dolphins drift off into their own world , the weary pufferfish seizes the chance to deflate and slip away into the deep blue
getting in on the act : though large doses of a puffer 's neurotoxinthe can be deadly - 100 times more potent than cyanide - in small amounts it is known to produce a narcotic effect the footage , from dolphins : spy in the pod , was taken by wildlife filmmaker john downer - who has previously used hidden cameras to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television screens
john downer designed underwater cameras disguised as squid , tuna and even other dolphins
zoologist and series producer rob pilley said that it was the first time dolphins had been filmed behaving this way
he added : ' we saw the dolphins handle the puffers with kid gloves , very gently and delicately like they were almost milking them to not upset the fish too much or kill it
' as a result the fish released various toxins as a defense
the dolphins then seemed to be mesmerized
' he insisted that the scene could n't have been a one - off encounter , saying : ' the dolphins were specifically going for the puffers and deliberately handling them with care
' the series , which aired on the discovery channel on saturday , follows the success of penguins : spy in the huddle , which used similar tactics of disguised cameras , documentary producer john downer was eager to create a range of cameras disguised as sea creatures to offer viewers unprecedented proximity to their favorite species

with the help of the cameras , viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water , as well as finding themselves at the center of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once
some 900 hours of raw footage was collected over a 12 - month period from locations including america , coasta rica , south africa , argentina and australia
the pufferfish footage was filmed in waters near mozambique
the film crew also dived some 1,500 times , spending nearly 3,000 hours at sea filming with the spy creatures in all types of weather
speaking of the project , john downer said : ' unlike penguin - cams , this time our spy creatures had to keep pace with fast - moving dolphins , often out in the deep ocean
' the dolphins were very curious about their new neighbors and allowed them into their lives
' john downer 's last project , spy in the huddle , took viewers inside the world of penguins by deploying 50 cameras to the arctic for almost a year .
