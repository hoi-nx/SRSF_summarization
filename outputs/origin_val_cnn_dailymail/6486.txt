the owner of a property near gchq where banksy daubed his â spybooth â artwork has claimed that the mural had made his life a misery after being given listed status
possee could have expected a windfall after the work was sprayed onto the side of his end - of - terrace property close to britain 's surveillance centre in cheltenham , gloucestershire
but after the stencil was granted grade ii - listed status , mr possee , 45 , has been unable to remove and sell it - and can not carry out building work to make the house habitable
he claimed he has been harassed by â malicious busybodies â and now just wants to sell the property - so he can â get on with my life â
mr possee said : â if cheltenham want it , they can have it
just buy the building off me , i just want to get on with my life
cut me free , you can have the cheltenham banksy
â spybooth features three 1950s - style agents , wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats , using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box on the side of the Â£ 300,000 property
it appeared last april before soaring in value when banksy confirmed it was one of his pieces
the wall was boarded up but a bidding war ensued as locals tried to raise an estimated Â£ 1million to secure it for the town
a businessman claimed to have raised enough , but his bid fell through
protection : scaffolding was put up over the artwork after it was vandalised
after the stencil was granted grade ii - listed status , mr possee , 45 , has been unable to remove and sell it covering : it was feared the chunk of wall could be removed and sold , but last month cheltenham borough council voted to incorporate the mural into the building âs existing grade ii - listed status it was feared the chunk of wall could be removed and sold , but last month cheltenham borough council voted to incorporate the mural into the building âs existing grade ii - listed status
this means mr possee - whose home is thought to have tripled in value since the mural was painted - now can not carry out urgent repairs to strengthen and re-render the walls
he said : â if this had been any other artist , it [ the listed status ] would have been laughed out of the chambers
i have no idea where i go from here
' mr possee said he could fight the decision , but that would mean him spending his own money to launch a case at the high court
he said the council â agreed in principle â to protect the mural when he first approached them for help

so i suggested perspex but they said it âs against listed consent
spybooth : the banksy piece in its vandalised state
mr possee said he has had ' substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork ' â they just said â you ca nât put that on there â and i was threatened with a fine
' he added : ' i think it deserves to stay in cheltenham , but obviously it is difficult to re-render a house that has that artwork on it
â it âs sat empty now , and it ca nât stay that way forever
at the end of the day , we can sit and let gravity take an effect and the decision will be made for us
â mr possee has even been targeted by men posing as â millionaire architects â trying to buy the building , who turned out to be frauds
controversy has surrounded the piece since its arrival , leaving the landlord inundated with â malicious messages â from locals desperate to keep it in the town
he added : â some busybody from cheltenham even came up with this idea that i did nât own that part of the house
' there âs not a " pretty strong certainty " that i own it - it is certain that i do
i take a bit of umbrage with people getting involved with my business when it âs nothing to do with them
â i âve had substantial offers from people who collect this kind of artwork - and if it was about money for me i âd have sold it by now
â after listed status was granted last month , the council 's case officer martin chandler said : ' it will be afforded a greater level of protection than it has currently
' but it does n't mean we wo n't be faced with future applications to consider other changes to it
it [ planning consent ] does n't automatically mean it 's going to be retained in situ
' seeing the banksy for the first time when he returned from holiday in april 2014 , mr possee said he thought it was â quite nice â and liked the new addition before the problems began .
