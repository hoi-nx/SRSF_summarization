it 's outrage time again
this time it 's over a " saturday night live " commercial parody that aired over the weekend
the subject ( take a deep breath and prepare to be shocked ) : isis
yes , that barbaric terrorist group was ridiculed in a parody of a toyota commercial
the original toyota ad depicted a father driving his daughter to the airport
he then tearfully says goodbye as his daughter heads off to join the army
in the " saturday night live " parody , the daughter is played by johnson , star of the hugely successful s&m film " 50 shades of grey
" ( good to see america has gotten over being offended by the mainstreaming of s&m
) as the parody commercial ends , however , it 's revealed that the daughter is not joining the army , but isis
we then see a pickup filled with isis fighters drive up as a worried dad comments to his daughter : " you be careful , ok ? " johnson replies reassuringly : " dad ! it 's just isis
" the father then turns to an isis fighter and says , with emotion , " take care of her
" in reply , the militant whispers : " death to america
" and ... cue the outrage ! ! twitter lit up instantly
twitter user @ ematrudo called nbc and " snl " " tasteless scum ! " and steve bucci of conservative think tank the heritage foundation even went as far as to tweet : " isis skit also draws a moral equivalence between isis murderers and the u.s. military ( based on the spoofed commercial ) , that is wrong
" some , apparently in the minority if the media coverage is any indication , also praised " snl " : but my favorite tweet was this one : @ kmorrison is 100 % correct
the sketch mocked isis and on some level those who would fall for its sales pitch , like , perhaps , the three young british girls who reportedly headed to join them
comically skewering isis is exactly the right thing to do -- it should be done even more
in fact , in lebanon , the united arab emirates and even in iraq , where isis is slaughtering people , brave muslim comedians are ridiculing isis on tv , in youtube videos and in cartoons
and i can assure you that if isis were to catch these comedians , it would n't just tweet about its outrage , it would kill them
so why do these comedians take the chance ? because , they say , it undermines isis , and also , for many , it is cathartic to laugh at the terrorists , as opposed to shivering in fear about them
this is the same reason brooks featured " springtime for hitler " in his hit musical comedy , " the producers " : it was a way of using comedy as revenge
brooks saw it as a way to rob hitler of his power ( even if posthumously ) by causing audiences to laugh at him
what 's more , the " saturday night live " parody makes an important but subtle point
on the side of the isis pickup , the arabic writing does not state a religious expression
rather it says , " i love cats
" as someone who worked at " snl " for eight years , i can assure you this was not happenstance , but rather was by design
to me , the " i love cats " line shows that " snl " grasps what many on the right refuse to
as i heard firsthand when i attended the white house summit on countering violent extremism two weeks ago , isis will despicably use any means to recruit people
consequently , as ludicrous as it may seem , saying " we love cats " to young girls is not beyond isis
when i look at the outrage over this " saturday night live " political parody , i have to wonder : were n't we all " je suis charlie hebdo " just a few weeks ago ? remember when we stood firmly with political satirists
well , apparently that sentiment ended for some as soon as they saw political satire they did n't like
i understand that some will be offended by political comedy with which they do n't agree
but in a time when freedom of expression is under attack , if you are offended by political satire on tv , then change the channel .
