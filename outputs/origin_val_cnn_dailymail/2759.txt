' i did n't want to look in the mirror â i did n't like what it the weight loss had left , ' she said , adding she was disgusted with her ' saggy ' breasts
' every bra i put on , the skin just sat in there
i 'd never lost my boobs throughout any diet , so it was a shock
' in 2014 , she decided to use part of her mum 's inheritance to get a breast uplift and 34f implants
mrs thair-white , from grays , essex , said : ' i was n't sure about spending part of the inheritance on the operation but my husband shane encouraged me , ' she said
' he said : ' you 've always put the kids first , now it 's time for you
' mrs thair-white told how she struggled to shift the pounds she had gained while pregnant with her children eva , 16 and max , 10 , but her binge eating spiraled out of control after she lost her beloved mother ethel to brain cancer in 2009
emma , pictured here with her two children eva ( left ) and max ( right ) decided to lose the weight in 2013 after she became so big that she could n't tie her shoelaces without food coming up into her mouth emma proudly shows off her weight loss holding up an old pair of her jeans , she was previously a size 22 but has now slimmed down to a size 12 emma is now a keen exerciser and a slim size 12 , after realising in 2013 that she needed to do something about her weight she was so devastated by the loss that she secretly turned to drink to ease the pain
' it started off that i had a bottle of wine to toast [ my mum ] , and things seemed a little bit rosier and it was n't so painful , ' she said
' that one glass in the evening turned to two , then three , then four and then before i knew it i 'd be ordering three bottles of wine in the shopping then , unbeknown to my husband , going and buying another three
' i used to make sure if there was a lot of bottles in the recycling bin i 'd put the rubbish straight in after
he did n't have a clue
' in 2010 , she broke down and confessed all to her gp , who prescribed her a course of anti-depressants
' one day i just woke up and decided i was n't going to do it anymore and i needed help , ' she said
she cut out drinking straight away
emma was suffering from depression when she decided to give up drinking , however , she then turned to take - aways eating them two or three times a week emma is now happy to show off her slimmer figure in a variety of outfits , including this fancy dress costime however , mrs thair-white was still battling with her weight â a fight she believes was made harder by her anti-depressants
' the takeaways went from weekends to two or three times a week , ' she said
it was n't a few scoops of ben and jerry 's , i 'd have the tub
' with my appetite , there is no off button
it is all down to my self control
' classmates at son her max 's school even made cruel comments about him having a ' fat mum
' the final push she needed to kick - start her weight loss came in december 2013
she had been stocking the house with sweets and chocolate in the run - up to christmas , but could not resist binging on the treats
' i stacked up my cupboards and i used to sit and eat every night until i felt sick , ' she said , ' we were going somewhere and i bent down to tie my shoes then all my food came back into my mouth because my tummy was so big
' i just remember saying to my husband : ' i ca n't do this anymore
' emma used some of the inheritance money left by her mother to pay for a boob job after her chest was left sagging following her weight loss regime emma 's two children and husband encouraged her in her weight loss , they joined their mother on her healthy eating regime , promising her they would lose weight as a family her 42 - year - old husband and two children also joined in with her new healthy regime , promising they would lose weight as a family
mrs thair-white threw herself into exercise , taking the family 's dog morris with her on speed walks
progress was slow at first
when she had only managed to shed a stone after several months , she turned to forza raspberry k2 diet supplements
' at the beginning when i was n't on [ the supplements ] , it was very slow , ' she said , ' but after i started , it came off in leaps and bounds
' the shape change spurred me on
i had a waist â it was a good feeling
the biggest thing is excuses
' i 've had so many people approach me and say they want to do it but there 's all these ' buts ' , and i 'll say to them that they 're not ready
' you 've got to be in the frame of mind to do it
i 've proved that you do n't have to run â i speed walk
' even just walking helps , it 's just making yourself active
i just want people to know there is always light at the end of any tunnel no matter how big or small , and looking after yourself really does make all the difference
