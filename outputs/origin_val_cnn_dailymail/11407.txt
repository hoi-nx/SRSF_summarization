the story of an abandoned puppy who was beaten so badly that he had to have his leg amputated has prompted donations of almost Â£ 18,000 for charity after users read about it on the internet
ralf , owned by sue , 66 , from sheffield , yorkshire has over 1,300 facebook friends and his story has raised the substantial sum for rain rescue , the charity that rescued him
he was found on christmas eve , 2012 , savagely kicked and discovered dumped in the street , crying in agony
since having his leg amputated , little ralf has become an internet sensation and raised around Â£ 18k for the charity that saved his life , rain rescue a vet gave two heartbreaking options â the pup should either be put down or face a gruelling leg amputation
experts could n't be sure that the little dog would adapt to having just three legs
but he was given the chance , and today ralf is an internet star who has even saved other pooches on doggie death row
owner sue says : ' ralf was just four months old when he was found dumped in the street in rotherham by a volunteer from rain rescue , a local dog charity
' i 'd been a dog foster carer for them and offered to take him in for a while
the poor lad was in a bad way , crying in pain from an injury to his front leg
born fighter : rain rescue paid for ralf to have his leg amputated from the knee down , but vets could n't say how he would cope with life on three legs brutal : ralf had been kicked so badly that it had shattered his left elbow and dislocated his right shoulder ' ralf had been kicked which had shattered his left elbow and dislocated his right shoulder
' i could n't believe someone would hurt a puppy
the vet 's news was stark - put him to sleep or operate
' rain rescue paid for ralf to have his leg amputated from the knee down , but no - one really knew how he would cope with life on three legs
mrs sue said : ' i knew that ralf would try to nibble at his stitches , so that day i bought him a baby 's t - shirt to wear , meaning his stump would be covered up
' she and her husband pete , 67 , found it tough watching ralf struggling to walk
' it took him ages to realise his old leg had been removed and he was constantly falling over
eventually this caused a haematoma in his stump , ' she says
sadly the vet then had to remove his shoulder , but luckily ralf 's feisty spirit pulled him through and mrs utley was smitten
sue fostered ralf and decided to set up a facebook page in his name , uploading photos and sharing his escapades with his now 1,300 friends little charmer : sue writes ralf 's facebook updates in a broad yorkshire accent allowing his mischievous character to shine through ' fostering was supposed to be short term but as people offered to adopt him i just could n't bear to let him go , ' she said
' he was such a character , always hiding things and getting up to mischief
' she decided to set up a facebook page in ralf 's name , uploading photos and sharing his escapades
she wrote ralf 's updates in a broad yorkshire accent and his personality shone through
' helped me mam with the dishes today , ' he barked
' she were n't happy though , shouted at me to get out the dishwasher and stop lickin ' the plates
' she also uploaded photographs of ralf wearing his tiny t - shirts
as he grew , so did his collection
she said : ' he had stripy ones , superman ones , sailor boy ones
' his facebook friends loved seeing what he was wearing every day
ralf is now raising money for the charity rain rescue and helping save the lives of other animals ' many of these dogs ( in local dog pounds ) are traumatised , injured , or sick and needing vet treatment , ' says sue , ' but thanks to ralf and rain rescue they 're alive
' ' soon he was boasting nearly 2,000 friends and i decided to put his popularity to use and get him his own justgiving page , meaning people could leave donations for rain rescue
' to date , ralf has raised nearly Â£ 18,000 and mrs utley could not be prouder
' ralf had been left to die on the streets , and now he 's helping save the lives of other animals , ' she said
' he 's a little hero
he may hobble about on three legs , but to me he 's just perfect

' many of these dogs are traumatised , injured , or sick and needing vet treatment
