a teenager who pulled out so much of her hair she was left nearly bald has shaved her head in an effort to tackle her condition
eden cahill , 15 from county antrim , northern ireland , suffers from trichotillomania
the condition means she is compelled to pull out her hair , eyelashes and eyebrows â something she has done since she was six years old
by the time she was a teenager , eden had hardly any hair at the top and the sides of her face , only a layer of hair at the base of her neck
however , in a bid to battle trichotillomania , she has recently shaved off her hair and set up her own youtube channel to document her journey
by the time she was a teenager she was almost bald ( right ) eden said : ' i remember the moment i started to pull my hair out
i was at my grandma 's watching television and i felt an odd hair
' i pulled it out and it felt right so i carried on pulling a lot more after that
' the day i shaved my hair i felt a major release , i felt so much better about everything and my head felt free

some experts think hair pulling is a type of addiction , while others believe it may be a way of relieving stress and anxiety
by her teenage years , eden was bald all bar some hair at the side and back of her head
this led people to ask if she had chemotherapy , or alopecia , comments she says were upsetting
at school , she wore a headband 24 hours a day to hide her baldness , and clipped hair extensions on to her remaining hair

the more you pull your hair out , the more you want to keep doing it
trichotillomania may be a reflection of a mental health problem
psychological and behavioural theories suggest that hair pulling may be a way of relieving stress or anxiety
in some cases , trichotillomania may be a form of self - harm , where you deliberately injure yourself as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress
the most effective treatment is therapy to change your hair - pulling behaviour , combined with a network of emotional support
