a follower of the church of the flying spaghetti monster claims he was discriminated against when he was told he may no longer wear a colander on his head in a driver 's licence photo
last year , moodley , 20 , was issued a provisional driver 's licence by staff at service nsw parramatta , in sydney 's west
he was photographed for the licence wearing the spaghetti strainer on his head after asking staff whether it was ok to wear a religious symbol
moodley , 20 , was issued a provisional driver 's licence last year while wearing a spaghetti strainer on his head , which he said is a symbol of his religion , the church of the flying spaghetti monster
' i put my colander on
she just stared at me , did n't say anything , ' mr moodley recalled in an apparent poke at organised religion , pastafarians say they believe in the ' spaghetti monster ' and adherents say their religion is as legitimate as any other
mr moodley received a letter from service nsw parramatta last tuesday , march 3 , and was informed he would have to have his licence reissued so a ' photograph can be retaken without any item on your head '
' rms ( rms ) have advised that this photograph does not meet the current requirements , as you were wearing a colander on your head , ' the letter to mr moodley said
' church of the flying spaghetti monster is not a recognized ( sic ) religion and as such the wearing of the colander in this photograph does not meet current requirements
' it warned ' further action may taken ' if he failed to comply

a ' church of the flying spaghetti monster ' , the western sydney resident has started an online petition requesting roads minister duncan gay mr moodley , a science student at the university of western sydney , said he was ' frustrated ' and surprised by the demand and has pledged to fight the ruling
' they do n't do this to any other religion , ' he said
his supporters have started an online petition calling for church of the flying spaghetti monster to be allowed to ' wear their religious headwear and observe their religion as they see fit '
' even though it looks like a joke and ( that ) we 're trying to take the mickey out of them , we 're completely serious , ' mr moodley said
' to an outsider who does n't know our goals , we look like a bunch of crazy people wearing colanders , eating spaghetti , and drinking beer
' we 're completely serious about what we 're doing and i would not go this far for a practical joke
we really want church of the flying spaghetti monster to be treated as equally as islam , christianity , hinduism , etc. mr moodley secured media attention after managing to obtain his license with the colander on his head last year
' when it came to getting my photo done , i asked if religious headwear was allowed in the photo
she ( the staff member ) said yes
' i put the colander on
she just stared at me did n't say anything
i put it on and that was it

' followers of the church of the flying spaghetti monster movement , known as church of the flying spaghetti monster , are not part of a religion recognised in nsw or other areas of australia , ' a rms spokeswoman said
