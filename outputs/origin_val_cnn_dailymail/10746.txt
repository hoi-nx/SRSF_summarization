a teenage boy has described the bizarre moment he was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test
byron geldard , from huntingdon , cambridgeshire , was given the test by doctors because the disease can cause the body to make the same hormone produced during pregnancy
after getting a positive result , the 19 - year - old was given the devastating news he had the disease and began seven months of treatment
now , after surgery and intensive chemotherapy , he is in remission - and has become an ambassador for teenage cancer trust
the disease can cause the body to produce the same hormone as produced during pregnancy after the ' positive ' result , the 19 - year - old began months of treatment at addenbrooke 's hospital , cambridge mr byron geldard said : ' it was all very surreal to be honest
' there i was with a positive pregnancy test and something growing inside me
i thought i was going to end up in a documentary
' home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta
experts say beta hcg can also signal testicular cancer
dr danish mazhar , consultant medical oncologist at cambridge university hospitals , said : ' the pregnancy hormone ( hcg ) is often ( but not always ) produced by testicular tumours
' where it is produced , it can used for diagnostic and monitoring purposes
' in cases where the cancer has spread , the level of the hcg can be very high and if the clinical picture fits with a testicular cancer then a pregnancy test , which effectively is a test for hcg in the urine , can be used to make the diagnosis
' home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta
experts say beta hcg can also signal testicular cancer
cornes , male cancer information nurse at the charity orchid , told mailonline : hcg is one of three blood tests performed in all men with testicular cancer - it identifies how active and possibly widespread the cancer may be
' it can also be used to help monitor treatment and determine how well treatment is working and to identify men who may need more intensive treatment
' however he stressed there are two types of testicular cancer - and hgc is not present in the majority of cases of the most common form
and any man worried should not use a pregnancy test as a diagnostic tool
mr cornes added : ' to be picked up by a urine pregnancy test , the level of hcg has to be very high which will not be the case for many testicular cancers
' it is not and never has been a standard test ' hcg can also be raised in the presence of other things such as illegal performance enhancing drugs ( used by athletes etc. ) ' mr byron geldard claims his hospital experience was as bizarre as his diagnosis
' when i was about to go into surgery , i had to have an epidural like a pregnant woman - it was all very weird
' it 's really hard to describe how it felt - you do n't really come to terms with what 's going on , you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me
' i 'm relieved to be in remission , and now i want to help raise awareness
' cancer is no longer a death sentence , and i would like to spread that message
' mr byron geldard had just returned from a boy 's holiday in kavos last august , when a niggling pain in his side became too hard to ignore
after visiting his doctor , who could feel a mass in his abdomen , he was referred to his local hospital for an ultrasound
he said : ' before i went to kavos i 'd been getting this weird pain on and off , but i did n't think much of it
' i went to the gp about it , but because i was going to the gym it was just put down to muscle pain
' but when i was referred to the local hospital scans showed that i had a tumour that was spreading into my lungs
' i was told that it was cancer - but they were n't sure what type - and that i would probably need chemotherapy
' mr byron geldard was referred to the teenage cancer trust unit in cambridge , where doctors tried to determine what type of cancer he was suffering from
it was there that he was asked to provide a sample for a pregnancy test , to determine if the tumour was producing the hormones linked to both pregnancy , and testicular cancer
looking back , mr byron geldard said : ' it 's really hard to describe how it felt - you do n't really come to terms with what 's going on , you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me ' after getting a positive result from the pregnancy test , mr byron geldard was diagnosed with stage four testicular cancer - which had spread to his abdomen and lungs
the news came just a day before he received his a-level results
in 2012 , a man credited the popular social news site reddit with helping him catch his testicular cancer at an early stage
the patient , who was not identified , took the test left in his apartment by an ex-girlfriend as a joke - but was shocked to discover two pink lines indicating pregnancy
the incident was turned into a crudely drawn black - and - white comic strip by a friend , who put it up on reddit where it attracted more than 1,300 comments from concerned users
' if this is true , you should check yourself for testicular cancer
google it , ' one commenter wrote
the reddit user who put up the cartoon passed on the concerned comments to his friend on monday , the man made an appointment with a doctor who diagnosed him with cancer after detecting a small lump in his right testicle
he said : ' i gave the hospital a urine sample , the pregnancy test came back positive , and i started chemotherapy the day after i was diagnosed
' i would go in for five days in a row and have the chemo constantly
' it really took it out of me - my brain was muddled and i found it hard to concentrate on long films or books
' i suppose i did have some thoughts about death , but i did n't want to approach cancer in a negative way
' for me , the cancer diagnosis was a positive thing , because it meant that a plan could be put in place to get rid of it
' throughout my cycles of chemo the hospital would monitor the " pregnancy hormone " through blood tests
' the hormone had been really , really high , but it was gradually declining which was great news , and the tumours in my lungs and abdomen were shrinking
' in december , mr byron geldard had surgery to remove the growth in his abdomen ( and the surrounding lymph nodes ) and a testicle
in january , tests revealed he was cancer free
he said : ' it was a really strange feeling to be told i was ok again - you 're just sort of expected to go back to normal , but my mindset has completely changed
' before all this happened i thought my life was pretty much guaranteed until i was about 85
' but it gave me the realisation of my own mortality - i sort of had an early midlife crisis
' he now plans to attend university and says he ' just wants to enjoy life '
' i 'm doing stand up comedy about testicular cancer , as i think people need to be educated about it more
after chemotherapy , which caused him to lose his hair ( right ) , byron geldard is focusing his energy on living life to the full and raising money for the teenage cancer trust ' i hated hearing people talk about cancer all the time , and i just thought this is a different way to approach it
' it 's something a bit different , and a way to show that cancer does n't always have to be a death sentence
' throughout his cancer journey , he was supported by teenage cancer trust
he said : ' the teenage cancer trust ward was great , the ward is kitted out with a tv , pool tables and free wi-fi
' everyone is going through the same thing so you get a lot of support
' i even had the opportunity to meet john bishop and stephen fry when i was there
' it gave you an aspect of normality through everything that was going on

testicular cancer ( pictured ) is one of the most treatable forms of cancer cancer of the testicles most commonly affects men aged 15 to 45 , with around 2,200 cases diagnosed each year
around 47 per cent of men diagnosed with the disease will be under 35 years old
despite it being a relatively rare form of cancer , it is one of the more treatable
if caught at an early stage , men can expect a high cure rate with 98 per cent of sufferers disease - free a year after treatment
if caught at any stage , 96 per cent of men will still be alive 10 years after their treatment
unlike many cancers , there are few known risk factors for testicular cancer
men born with an undescended testicle , are at a slightly greater risk
around 10 per cent of sufferers will have a history of this condition
having a brother or father affected by testicular cancer can also increase a man 's risk
some research has suggested the disease is slightly more common in men with fertility problems and men with hiv are more likely to develop testicular cancer
