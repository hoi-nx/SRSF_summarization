within minutes of the final whistle at every champions league tie , the two managers are in possession of a full statistical analysis of the match
sadly , the temptation is still to look at the scoreline
at the sharp end of european football english teams can not keep the ball
on the continent , this is considered to be a crime
it is the primary reason all four english teams - liverpool , chelsea , arsenal and manchester city - were eliminated from the champions league before the quarter - final draw
manchester city 's players leave the nou camp looking glum after being eliminated from champions league messi stole the show on wednesday , taking 116 touches , 42 more than any other manchester city player manchester city had goalkeeper joe hart to thank for keeping the score to just one at the nou camp messi joins in the celebrations with goalscorer ivan rakitic and luis suarez during the first half will we ever learn ? probably not
over two legs in the champions league second round , manchester city did not have a single player who touched the ball on more than 74 occasions
where was david silva ? where was samir nasri ? where was yaya toure ? nowhere , absolutely nowhere
in the nou camp on wednesday , when barcelona won 1 - 0 and it would not have flattered them had they scored eight , nine or 10 , messi touched the ball 116 times
that âs what we are in the game for , to be spellbound by players who want to make things happen with a clever twist or spin or flick
at the etihad , when barcelona won 2 - 1 in the first leg , messi settled for 107 in the barclays premier league champions â backyard
james milner was manchester city âs highest with 64
martin jol always encouraged his players to â be the boss of the ball â when he was head coach at tottenham
english football still looks to be terrified of it
former tottenham manager martin jol always encouraged his players to ' be the boss of the ball ' guardiola 's bayern are joint top for passing accuracy with barcelona ( 89.2 per cent ) this season to those who followed the fortunes of the four english teams in the champions league , it will not come as a surprise to anyone that none of them are in the top five for passing accuracy
barcelona , who toyed with manchester city during wednesday âs 1 - 0 victory in the second leg , are joint top with guardiola âs bayern ( 89.2 per cent )
next come 10 - time champions real madrid ( 88.3 ) , followed by psg ( 88.1 ) and another team entrenched in the obsession with possession , ajax ( 87.5 )
the elite teams rely on possession , keeping the ball in circulation until they can carve out an opening and move in for the kill
we will hear some tripe over the next few days , with people convinced that we must continue to refine a mangled , hybrid system to suit english football
well 40 years in and it âs not working
arsenal were dumped out on tuesday despite being favourably drawn against monaco in the last 16 arsene wenger saw his arsenal side crash out of the champions league despite a 2 - 0 win in the second leg our national team went out of a world cup in brazil without even winning a game because they could nât keep the ball in an average group comprising italy , uruguay and costa rica
at euro 2016 , even with some of weakest teams in european football at the table , england will fail dismally because of their inability to retain possession
our champions league teams are heading the same way because they are incapable of flipping between the demands of the barclays premier league and the tactical subtleties of european football
at this point there will be those who cite the classic counter-attacking teams , such as jose mourinho âs inter milan ( 2010 ) and roberto di matteo âs chelsea ( 2012 ) , who went on to win the champions league
they are the exception , not the rule
barcelona âs chasing of manchester united in rome ( 2009 ) and the more humiliating defeat at wembley ( 2011 ) was another wake - up call for english football
sadly , we forgot to set the alarm
talk to barcelona âs players and they are happy to share the secrets of the champions league , the magic formula that has been refined over the years at their training ground on the outskirts of the city
chelsea were eliminated by psg despite jose mourinho 's side having a one - man advantage for 90 minutes david luiz celebrates after his header took the tie to extra-time before psg went through on away goals brendan rodgers ' liverpool were sent crashing out at the group stage of the champions league a dejected raheem sterling slumps to the floor after a 1 - 1 draw at home to basle sealed liverpool 's fate â when we have the ball we keep it at all costs , â admitted iniesta ahead of wednesday âs second leg at the nou camp against manuel pellegerini âs team
â and when we lose it , we do everything we can to win it back
â iniesta has won the champions league three times - in 2006 , 2009 and 2011 - since he broke into the barcelona team under the dutch coach frank rijkaard
spain âs world cup winner knows his stuff
barcelona have two speed settings - quick , and very quick - and their entire system is designed to provoke the opposition into making mistakes
manchester city routinely gave the ball away within five seconds
arsenal ( 57.1 per cent ) are the only english team to feature in the top five clubs who keep the ball in the champions league this season
in the stade louis on tuesday they moved through the gears , with santi cazorla ( 141 touches ) and mesut ozil ( 126 ) running the show in their impressive 2 - 0 victory
england failed to make it out of their modest world cup group in brazil last summer england manager roy hodgson watches on in anguish as his side are beaten 2 - 1 by uruguay joao moutinho , so influential for monaco in the first leg , fell short in the centre of their midfield with 72 touches
his midfielder partner jeremy toulalan had 56
bayern ( 67 per cent ) , who are moving into a new phase of possession - based football under guardiola , head the list of teams dominating games , followed by barcelona ( 64 ) , porto ( 60.9 ) and juventus ( 59.6 )
those four teams , possibly the most entertaining to watch in the competition this season , are all in the draw for the quarter - final
this stuff is staring us in the face and yet we will choose to ignore it because we will be back in thrall with the thrills and spills of the barclays premier league this weekend
we love its combative nature , the ability to throw up surprises because of its rugged composition , an unpredictable mix of styles , and its raw pace
for english football to succeed in europe , the top teams must evolve , playing a possession - based game and learning to pick their moment in the biggest matches
until they do , we all know the score .
