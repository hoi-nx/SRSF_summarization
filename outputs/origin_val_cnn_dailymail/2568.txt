the pair stole everything from expensive jewellery , to random items such as a victim 's dressing gown , woman 's make - up set , a duvet and even a tin of mackerel
other items recovered from the pair included a cigarette lighter , several packets of chewing gum and even a bottle of hand disinfectant
judge leigh jailed the pair for six years at basildon crown court after they admitted the thefts
judge leigh said : ' you both committed highly organised offending that had a devastating effect on people and violated their homes
you are a modern - day bonnie and clyde
' palmada and mariana sandra even stole one victim 's make - up bag worth an estimated Â£ 100 - but far less second hand police initially questioned the pair about two burglaries but using the latest forensic techniques , they linked plamada and mariana sandra to a string of other crimes
detective sergeant brett hagen , of the metropolitan police , said : ' plamada and mariana sandra were a prolific burgling duo who committed a vast number of residential burglaries over a relatively short period of time
' they were clearly committing burglary for financial gain , but also stole some strange items such as a tin of mackerel , women 's make - up and a duvet set , suggesting they were actually using victims ' personal property to furnish their home and their lifestyles
' the jail sentence reflects the scale of their offending and will provide them with plenty of time to reflect on the dozens of victims who continue to suffer the effects of having been targeted by thieves
' i would like to thank dc trevor guy of the metropolitan police and dc steve cunningham of essex police who both led their respective strands of the operation with tenacity and determination
' the overwhelming evidence gathered by these officers has resulted in society being afforded a well - earned rest from the activities of two habitual thieves
' in addition , as a result of this investigation a large number of victims have been reunited with their property
' chief inspector mike hamer of the metropolitan police added : " this represents a fantastic result for the team and highlights the benefits of police constabularies working together to combat serious crime
' the effects of becoming a victim of burglary run far deeper than a loss of property
' i hope that the sentences bring a measure of closure to the vast number of people victimised by these criminals
' other victims lost a lighter , some costume jewellery and even a usb charging point for a car 's lighter the pair were both jailed for six years after admitting the burglaries at basildon crown court , pictured
