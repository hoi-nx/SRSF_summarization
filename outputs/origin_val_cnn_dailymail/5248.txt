yasir abdulla , a security guard from keighley , west yorkshire decided to go to iraq and fight against isis after hearing they came within six miles of taking control of his home village in kurdistan , which he left in 2000

mr yasir abdulla returned to the british last week but told the sun how an elderly kurdish woman , whose son was captured by isis and taken to mosul , went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body
slaughter : mr yasir abdulla with a member of isis who he said was killed after he beheaded a kurdistan the father of four told the newspaper : ' she was determined to find her son and went to isis headquarters and asked to see him
' the isis men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son
' they brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat , rice and soup
she thought they were kind
' but they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said " you 've just eaten him
" ' during his time on the front line , mr yasir abdulla revealed how isis are terrorising locals by calling them and threatening to kidnap them and bury them alive unless they surrender
he also told of how the terror group kill prisoners they capture by throwing them on a ' human bonfire ' and that he saw his own cousin killed in an isis attack
but despite returning back to his family in west yorkshire , mr yasir abdulla is keen to go back to kurdistan saying he wants to finish the job in defeating isis
the new details about the cruelty of isis come as iraq 's prime minister called on tribal fighters to abandon the jihadis ahead of an offensive to retake saddam hussein 's hometown of tikrit from extremists

investigative journalist thomas said al qaeda has used the tactic of ' steganography ' - concealing messages in audio clips or images widely available online - to encode items listed for sale on the auction site
it works by manipulating a sound waveform or the order of pixels in a small or invisible part of an image , a process not unlike the way teletext used to be delivered on analogue tvs
now israeli intelligence service mossad believes isis militants are doing the same , according to mr thomas
one intelligence source told him messages are often hidden on reddit or ' x-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target '
the claims are contained within new chapters of mr thomas ' book gideon 's spies , an extract of which was published yesterday by the new york post
however , shiite militias and iraq security forces have stationed themselves around tikrit as state - run media has warned that the city ' will soon return to its people
