this real life big bad wolf forced the residents of one netherlands town to keep their doors firmly shut
in a scene that could have come straight out of one of the grimm fairytales the large grey animal was spotted peering into gardens as it stalked the streets
but instead of threatening to huff and puff and blow their homes down the hungry animal was looking for scraps of food after travelling over 300km
eyewitnesses told how it strutted along the road for around 30 meters , stopping from time to time to look into gardens
although running at a brisk pace , those who saw it said it did not seem dangerous and was possibly looking for a new home
wolves have not been seen in the netherlands for more than 150 years
local experts believe it may have travelled to the city from germany - up to 300km away
oguz acioz , 35 , who spotted the animal while driving to work called the police
the salesman said : ' the last wolf was seen here about 150 years ago
' i was about a meter behind it
i could see the mouth and the teeth and i knew it was n't a dog so i started filming straight away
' i was so surprised
