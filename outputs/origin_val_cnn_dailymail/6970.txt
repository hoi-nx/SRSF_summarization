a genetic condition has left jen scheuermann paralyzed since 2003 , but revolutionary new technology is allowing her the ability to feed herself chocolate , give high fives and even fly a fighter jet
last week , the darpa ( known as darpa ) , unveiled the amazing results of a two - year experiment involving the 55 - year - old quadriplegic woman , which they carried out in conjunction with the university of pittsburgh medical center
jen scheuermann agreed to let the super-secretive agency surgically implant pea - sized probes into her brain as they sought a way to turn her thought to actions
in addition to moving a robotic arm , jen scheuermann was also able to experience piloting a plane with the same technology
the research team let jen scheuermann connect to a flight simulator , where she had amazing results flying an f - 35 jet and cessna airplane not with a joystick - but with her thoughts alone
while the results give hope to anyone who suffers from limited mobility , they also draw up questions about whether the technology could be used for destructive purposes - such as soldiers controlling surrogate versions with their minds , out of combat
the ability to fly : researchers also found a way to hook jen scheuermann up to a flight simulator , and she was able to use the device to fly a f-35 and cessna with her mind ' in doing that work , we can now see the future where we can free the brain from the limitations of the human body , ' darpa director arati prabhakar said at the new america foundation forum in washington last week
' we can only imagine amazing good things and amazing potentially bad things that are on the other side of that door
' while the research was initially aimed at helping soldiers with motor problems , prabhakar says they will continue to look into other ways it can be used in the military
' we do n't want to only go play in the safe places
that would be a violation of our mission , ' prabhakar said
the future : the breakthrough technology brings hope to those who suffer from limited mobility
