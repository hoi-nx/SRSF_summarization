health bosses in north wales are urging patients to buy simple painkillers , laxatives and hayfever treatments rather than relying on free prescriptions patients in the nhs are being told not to use their free prescriptions â because of labour 's ' funding cuts '
hundreds of thousands of people who live in north wales were yesterday urged not to ask their gp to prescribe a range of medicines for minor complaints , such as painkillers , laxatives and hay fever treatments
instead , patients are encouraged to ' self - care ' and ' purchase some of the simple and inexpensive products over the counter for the treatment of minor ailments '
the restrictions are being imposed because of the ' economic climate ' and to ' cope with the funding cuts ' , the largest health board in the principality said yesterday
labour , which runs the health service in wales as a result of devolution , has cut health funding by more than 8 per cent since 2010
but in england , where the nhs is under the control of the coalition , spending has risen slightly in real terms since the election
the mail has focused on some of the adverse effects of the cuts including longer waits for ambulances , far more people waiting more than four hours in a&e than in england , and poor cancer care â with some nhs patients being forced to move to england to get cancer drugs
in january the strain on the nhs was highlighted when the furious wife of a paramedic posted online a photograph of at least ten ambulances â together with three rapid response cars â waiting outside morriston hospital in swansea to unload patients at its overwhelmed a&e department
last night the leader of the welsh conservatives , andrew davies , said : ' labour 's savage cuts to the nhs have come at a time when spending has been protected in other parts of the united kingdom , with obvious consequences
' not only have we recently witnessed the worst ambulance response times since records began , more patients than ever are waiting over 12 hours in a&e , and nhs cancer patients continue to be denied access to life - saving drugs which are available in england under the coalition 's cancer drug fund
' prescriptions are free to all in wales , scotland and northern ireland , but in england a charge of Â£ 8.20 is applied unless the patient is exempt
how the mail exposed the crisis : ten ambulances queue to unload patients at an a&e in swansea pensioners and children are among those who do not pay for their prescriptions in england
yesterday betsi cadwaladr university health board , which covers much of north wales , urged people no longer to ask their gp to be prescribed medicines they could buy over the counter at their local pharmacy
betsi cadwaladr has asked gps to reduce ' unnecessary prescribing of simple medications ' , including painkillers , laxatives , vitamins , hayfever and head lice treatments
they say patients can purchase these drugs at a ' minimum cost ' , often more cheaply than it would cost the nhs to supply the drugs
the board said in a statement that , with the ' current economic climate putting a sharp focus on public spending ' , the local nhs needed to take ' tough decisions ' to help address ' gaps in funding '
dr owen , clinical director of pharmacy and medicines management , said : ' many of these [ over-the - counter ] products can be purchased at a minimum cost and often much more cheaply than it would cost the nhs
' we spend Â£ 4million every year on over-the - counter medicines and this year we are experiencing a significant growth in their cost
a 2 per cent reduction would reduce our costs by an estimated Â£ 80,000 , which at a time when the nhs is under constant pressure is a significant amount
' we can make savings through encouraging patients to ' self - care ' and to purchase some of the simple and inexpensive products over the counter for the treatment of minor ailments
' he added that community pharmacists are highly trained and are in ' an ideal position to assist with ' self care ' , and offer advice on the most appropriate product for patients
they say patients can purchase these drugs at a ' minimum cost ' , often more cheaply than it would cost the nhs to supply the drugs
the board said it spends four million pounds a year on over the counter drugs dr owen added that the board have asked gps in the area to reduce unnecessary prescribing of these simple medications
' however , be reassured that if your gp considers it essential that you take the medication for your condition , it will be prescribed to you , ' he said
' this will not only free up your gp 's time , but will also reduce waste through the prescribing of additional quantities for use on a future basis or ' just in case '
conservative shadow health minister darren millar seized on dr owen 's comments , telling the bbc they are ' recognition that labour 's universal free prescriptions policy is unaffordable and wastes vital funds which could be spent improving patient care '
geoff ryall-harvey , chief officer for the north wales community health council said : ' our members welcome this drive by health boards , both locally and nationally , and see it as a positive way forward in reducing the huge amount of waste that comes from repeat prescriptions and stockpiling of medications by patients
' however , it is also reassuring that in some situations the doctor can still prescribe these medicines on the nhs
' Ã· doctors from the clwyd north division of the british medical association have passed a vote of no confidence in the same nhs health board over its plans to downgrade the maternity unit at glan clwyd hospital in bodelwyddan for 12 months .
