aaron ramsey has suffered from fitness problems this season but could return against qpr the welsh midfielder has not played for the gunners since their clash against leicester in early february gunners medical staff will make a late call on his availability and if coquelin is selected , he 'll be fitted for a protective mask to ensure no further damage is caused

the wales international has n't played since february 10 , limping off during the closing stages of arsenal 's 2 - 1 win over leicester
but aaron ramsey returned to training towards the end of last week and should be available for selection on wednesday night
