this incredible photograph from war - torn syrian shows a remarkable bus barricade built to protect civilians from government forces ' sniper fire
three single - decker buses can be seen turned upright to form a wall in the middle of a street in aleppo , as a lone child walks past the makeshift barrier
the city has been ravaged by the country 's civil war , with forces loyal to syrian president assad controlling much of the north of the settlement while the rebels occupy the south
an estimated 31,000 people are said to have died in the city , however this number could be far higher , while the syrian observatory for human rights says at least 215,518 people had been killed throughout syrian since the uprising began four years ago
aleppo has only 90 minutes of electricity a day and conditions are of ' grave concern ' , the international committee of the red cross said
last week the red cross evacuated 17 disabled people across frontlines in aleppo for treatment , as well as restoring a hospital generator
there are fresh hopes that fighting could soon cease , at least temporarily , after us secretary of state kerry said the time had come to ' negotiate ' with assad
despite earlier insisting the the iron - fisted leader 's days were numbered , kerry said : ' well , we have to negotiate in the end
we 've always been willing to negotiate
' destruction : syrian civilians search for survivors in the rubble of a building knocked down by a bomb fired by forces loyal to president assad rescuers hack through the rubble as they try to find any survivors following a strike by syrian government forces , who continue to pound aleppo with bombs kerry acknowledged that it would need increased pressure on assad , ' to make it clear to him that there is a determination by everybody to seek that political outcome and change his calculation about negotiating '
' that 's underway right now
and i am convinced that , with the efforts of our allies and others , there will be increased pressure on assad
' the conflict began as an anti-government uprising , with protesters taking to the streets on march 15 , 2011 , inspired by similar revolts in egypt and tunisia
but a fierce government crackdown on the demonstrations prompted a militarisation of the uprising and its descent into today 's brutal conflict
the united nations refugee agency unhcr says syrian is now ' the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era ' , with around four million people fleeing abroad
fight back : the rebels ( pictured ) control swathes of the south of the city with the help of their own firepower , but pockets of opposition - held territory in the north could soon be captured by the syrian army attack : the rebels ( pictured ) fire on the syrian army as the battle for aleppo continues , four years after the civil war started during the arab spring an estimated 31,000 people are said to have died in aleppo ( pictured ) , however this number could be far higher as tens of thousands more are missing more than a million are taking refuge in neighbouring lebanon , while others are sheltering in jordan and turkey - placing a huge strain on those countries
inside syrian , more than seven million people have been displaced , and the united nations says around 60 percent of the population now lives in poverty
the country 's infrastructure has been decimated , and experts say the economy has been set back by some 30 years
despite international outrage at the death toll , and allegations that his regime used chemical weapons against its own people in august 2013 , assad has clung to power and does not look likely to be deposed any time soon
his forces have consolidated their grip on the capital damascus , where 18 more people were killed and more than 100 were injured in air raids yesterday .
