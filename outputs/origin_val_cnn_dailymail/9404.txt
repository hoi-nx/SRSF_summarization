how did iron become scattered throughout earth 's 2,000 - mile thick mantle more than four billion years ago ? that 's a question that has puzzled scientists , with most thinking asteroid impacts were the cause , but now a new theory has been presented - iron rain
by re-analysing the vapourisation point of iron , a study has determined that conditions on early earth would have caused iron to rain down on the ground
scientists in new mexico have a new theory for the origin of earth 's iron
research suggests iron would have turned into vapour when meteorites hit the young earth , as shown in the artist 's impression above
the vapour would then have drifted up in plumes , condensed and then rained down on the surface of our planet the research was conducted with the z machine at sandia national laboratories in albuquerque , new mexico
the machine is the most powerful producer of pulses of electrical energy on earth
by studying the shock pressure required to vapourise iron , they found the value was 40 per cent less than previously thought
astrophysicists say this lower pressure - 507 gigapascals ( gpa ) compared to 887 gpa - was easily achieved during the latter stages of earth 's formation
' because planetary scientists always thought it was difficult to vapourise iron , they never thought of vapourisation as an important process during the formation of earth and its core , ' said principal investigator dr kraus
the researchers created a target - consisting of an iron plate 0.008in ( 5mm ) square and 200 microns thick - against which they launched aluminum flyer plates travelling up to 16 miles ( 25km ) per second
at this impact pressure , the powerful shock waves created in the iron cause it to compress , heat up and vapourise
the results showed that the vapourisation threshold for iron is 40 per cent lower than previously thought
' but with our experiments , we showed that it 's very easy to impact - vapourise iron
' the result of this would have been that a solid piece of iron , after impacting earth perhaps as part of an asteroid , would disperse into an iron vapour due to the force of the impact
earth is thought to have been pummelled by asteroids during the late heavy bombardment period , 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago
forming clouds across the surface , the vapour would then rain down onto the ground and mix with the mantle , which was molten at the time
' this changes the way we think of planet formation , in that instead of core formation occurring by iron sinking down to the growing earth 's core in large blobs ( technically called diapirs ) , that iron was vapourised , spread out in a plume over the surface of earth and rained out as small droplets , ' said dr kraus
' the small iron droplets mixed easily with the mantle , which changes our interpretation of the geochemical data we use to date the timing of earth 's core formation
' the research , which found iron vapourised at values 40 per cent lower than thought , was conducted with the z machine ( pictured ) at sandia national laboratories in albuquerque , new mexico
the machine is the most powerful producer of pulses of electrical energy on earth in previous theories , it was thought that iron arrived from collisions between earth and planetesimals - rocks ranging in size from several metres to hundreds of kilometres in diameters
this would have happened in earth 's late formative stages more than four billion years ago , with the iron being sent bullet - like into the region between the core and crust - the mantle
but if that were true , then the moon would also have similar amounts of iron in its mantle , as it underwent the same bombardment - but this does not appear to be the case
this led the scientists to their new conclusion - and they add that the moon 's gravity would have been too weak for it to have held onto iron rain - bearing vapour , like earth
this accounts for the lack of iron seen scattered in the moon 's mantle
