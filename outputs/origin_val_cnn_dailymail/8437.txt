impeccable style is n't something you 'd necessarily associate with someone who crunches numbers for a living - let alone a man living in 16th century northern europe
however , long before kim kardashian turned selfie taking into an art form , germany accountant matthaeus schwarz was busy piecing together the world 's first fashion book
in an incredible project that appears to be unique , style - obsessed matthaeus schwarz - who was born in augsburg , germany , in 1497 - commissioned 137 watercolour paintings of himself over a 40 year period
he initially commissioned 35 images to document his sartorial choices from childhood up to his early 20s but ended up with 101 more pictures
the extraordinary undertaking ended up spanning over 40 years and only ceased when matthaeus schwarz reached the age of 63
as no other pictorial record like this exists , historians believe matthaeus schwarz created the first ever fashion tome - similar to 21st century online blogs
unlike today 's fashion bloggers , matthaeus schwarz , who spent a large part of his income on clothing , did n't have instagram filters and photoshop to rely on
he opted for surprisingly elaborate outfits which were an example of cutting - edge fashion of the time and used his clothes to make a political statement
he bound all his outfit paintings into a volume called the book of clothes he boldly combined patterns , colours and decoration in a variety outfits in a unique lifetime project matthaeus schwarz , who was born in 1497 , is now regarded as the first fashion blogger matthaeus schwarz donned a red and yellow outfit ( echoing the colours of the holy roman emperor âs flag ) when charles v returned to germany , as a show of his allegiance to catholicism
after amassing an extensive collection of paintings , the fashion innovator had the pages bound and made into the ultimate vanity project , a volume titled book of clothes
among the portraits are pictures of him in festive clothing for the emperor maximilian i 's visit to augsburg in 1518 , dressed up for a rich banker 's wedding in 1527 , and in mourning garb for his father 's death in 1519
he added comments to each of the images explaining when the outfit was worn along with his latin motto omne quare suum quiam - every because has a why
now the tome has inspired a new set of photographs of fictional male dandies by artist and photographer maisie broadhead
maisie broadhead , alongside her fashion designer sister bella newell and professor ulinka rublack , has created five modern photographic recreations - printed to large scale - telling the fictional story of matthew smith , a young man from north london , who is obsessed with clothes
the modern photographs are based upon images commissioned between 1520 and 1560 by matthaeus schwarz
a young man 's progress is a free exhibition held at the fitzwilliam museum in cambridge
it runs from tuesday 24 march until sunday 6 september
artist maisie broadhead was inspired by matthaeus schwarz 's life work to create a series of pictures portraying a modern dandy for an exhibition called a young man 's progress some of the illustrations captured matthaeus schwarz in everyday activities , like opening a door matthaeus schwarz combined different - coloured stripes , yellow stockings and a voluminous coat in this look
