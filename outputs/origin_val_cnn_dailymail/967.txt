a mother has described how her teenage son woke from a coma addicted to cheese and compulsively swearing
kai thomas , 15 , suffered a sudden , potentially life - threatening brain bleed in june last year
he had surgery to relieve pressure on his brain and doctors at sheffield children 's hospital put him in a coma for nine days so he could recover
when he woke up he was unable to move or speak , a result of the trauma his brain had endured
while he has since regained the ability to walk and talk again , kai thomas has been left with some unusual side - effects
he has become so addicted to cheese that he munches on several blocks of it a day - and even puts it on his cereal
and previously well - mannered , he now regularly swears , to his mother 's horror
kai thomas , 15 , suffered a sudden , potentially life - threatening brain bleed in june last year
since then , he has become ' addicted ' to cheese and swears profusely his mother tracey , of chesterfield , said : ' he 's addicted to cheese â and he ca n't stop swearing
' the 35 - year - old explained that before falling ill , kai thomas was a good - natured , well - manned young man
' he did n't swear and minded his manners , ' she said
' then in june last year , he came home from school rubbing his head and saying it hurt
' mrs thomas called 999 and kai thomas was taken to sheffield children 's hospital
' doctors carried out scans and the results showed a bleed on the brain , ' she said
' they told me it could have just come out the blue or he could have knocked himself
' kai thomas spent six hours in theatre where surgeons battled to save his life
thankfully , doctors were able to stabilise his condition - and they put him in a coma to give his body a chance to recover
nine days later he woke up
' his face was blank and he could n't speak , ' said mrs thomas
' doctors said the trauma of the bleed and subsequent surgery had caused him to regress
he 'd also lost his power of speech and movement
' to her relief , his condition gradually began to improve - and a few weeks later he started speaking again
last september , he finally got to go home - but there was more drama to come
mrs thomas said : ' one day i was in the kitchen , when i heard kai thomas yelling in his bedroom
' he was screaming " f * * * , b * * * * * * , s * * * "
' i wondered what on earth was going on - the expletives were coming thick and fast
' kai thomas 's mother , tracey , said while he always liked cheese , her son has now become ' obsessed ' with it - even putting it on his cereal
his mild - mannered temperament has also been replaced with aggression experts say every patient reacts differently
' no two cases are the same and there can be physical , cognitive , emotional and behavioural problems as a result of a head injury , ' said a brain charity spokesman upon going upstairs to see what was happening , she found kai thomas munching on an entire block of cheese
then , over the next few weeks , she noticed all types of cheese going missing from the fridge
' he had always like cheese but now he was obsessed with it - he even added it to his cereal , ' said mrs thomas
' we asked the doctor about it and apparently it 's quite normal for people to develop inappropriate or aggressive behaviour after waking up from a coma
so while that explained the swearing , no one can explain the cheese
' kai thomas 's condition is gradually improving and he now undergoes home tutoring as well as attending mainstream school for an hour each day
a spokesman from headway , the brain injury charity , said : ' there can be physical , cognitive , emotional and behavioural problems as a result of a head injury
no two cases are the same
