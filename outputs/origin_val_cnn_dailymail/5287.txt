it takes practice to perfect shuffling a deck of cards in a fast and flashy way
but a mathematician has pointed out that card aerobatics do not guarantee a random and well shuffled pack
peri diaconis compared different shuffling techniques and it seems that the ' riffle shuffle ' , which involves cutting a deck in half and shuffling the halves into each other , is the most time effective - if done well
but if they use a flashier overhand shuffle , which involves quickly inserting random chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other , they will need to do it 10,000 times to achieve similar results
this could still be fast in the hands of experts , but still slower than the riffle method
â there 's a third way of mixing cards - used in poker tournaments and monte carlo - i call that smooshing , â dr peri diaconis said
in a video for numberphile , dr peri diaconis compared shuffling styles to explain their efficiency ( illustrated ) if a dealer uses an overhand shuffle ( pictured ) , which involves quickly inserting random chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other , they will need to do it 10,000 times to achieve similar results to the riffle shuffle riffle method technique : cutting a pack of cards in half and quickly shuffling them into each other
efficiency : a dealer needs to repeat the process seven times to ransomise the pack and this can be done in less than 30 seconds
overhand method technique : quickly inserting chunks of cards from one hand into the majority of the deck of cards held in the other
efficiency : a dealer needs to do this 10,000 times to achieve similar results
smooshing method technique : randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again
efficiency : one minute of smooshing guarantees a random pack of cards
simple method what : taking one card from the top of a deck and inserting it at random
efficiency : it takes 200 or so ' pokes ' to randomise a deck , making progress slow
the method , which is also known as wash , corgi and chemmy , involves randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again
it is used in professional poker tournaments
the method looks random and is â if it is done for a long enough period time
â if you smoosh for a minute it passes every test we 've ever thrown at it
â if you smoosh for 30 seconds , it seems ok , but less than that it starts failing tests and someone could make money against you or guess cards , ' dr peri diaconis said
this means that while the method is thorough , if done for a minute , it too is slower than the riffle method
a technique called smooshing ( pictured ) also known as wash , corgi and chemmy , involves randomly laying the cards face down on a table and messing them up with the hands over and over again
it needs to be done for around one minute for the cards to be truly random and difficult to guess dr peri diaconis explained in the video how mathematicians check that shuffling is random
he said that there are a staggering 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000 configurations in a perfectly random deck
â it 's more than the number of particles in the universe , â he said
one way of defining randomness is that all card configurations should be equally likely
he said that if a deck of cards is perfectly shuffled , you may expect to guess between four and five cards correctly as they are pulled out one by one from a pack
but if they are not shuffled enough â for example , if a pack is riffle shuffled four times instead of seven - people might guess nine or ten cards correctly
in the simplest form of shuffling , where a person takes one card from the top of a deck and inserts it at random , it would take â 200 or so pokes â before the deck is random .
