thicke âs monster hit blurred lines has made a profit of more than $ 16 million since it became the biggest song of 2013 , an los angeles court heard on tuesday
the song , also created to pharrell and t.i. , is currently at the center of a legal battle over copyright infringement and the song âs alleged similarity to marvin gaye âs 1977 funk / disco classic got to give it up
the financial profitability of a song is typically a highly guarded secret and tends only to be revealed when the track is at the center of a $ 40 million lawsuit
that was divided with $ 5,658,214 going to thicke , $ 5,153,457 to pharrell , $ 704,774 to rapper t.i. and record companies pocketing the remainder
during opening arguments in the case , richard busch , the attorney representing marvin gaye 's children frankie and gaye had tallied the alleged damages at approximately $ 40 million
besides seeking profits â including a claimed $ 4 million from 50 percent of the publishing earnings of blurred lines â the gayes are seeking damages for a reduction of the fair market value of the worth of licensing got to give it up , reports the hollywood reporter
the singer âs children frankie and gaye are also targeting touring money too , with about $ 11 million attributable to the song 's success
strangely , the gayes filed the claim to counter a suit filed in august 2013 by thicke , t.i. and pharrell in which they asked a judge to declare that the song did not infringe on gaye 's copy written work
changing story : thicke claims now he only said that he was inspired by marvin gaye 's song to make it sound like he was involved in writing his hit , when in fact pharrell did ( seen here with model emily ratajkowski ) thicke is arguing that he did n't rip off marvin gaye 's 1977 song got ta give it up for mega hit blurred lines
marvin gaye is pictured here in 1983 - one year before his shooting death the gayes also claim that thicke and his estranged wife paula patton 's co-written track love after war stole its sound from their father 's song after the dance
that song , according to more testimony brought home $ 895,374 in profits
earlier in the trail , thicke had entertained the court when he danced and played keyboard from the witness stand to show that a number of pop songs have the same chord progression including u2 's with or without you , â michael jackson 's man in the mirror and the beatles ' let it be
according to court papers filed last year , thicke said he was high on painkillers and alcohol when blurred lines became a hit , and he exaggerated his contribution to writing the song
thicke , 37 , said in a deposition in april that he had been largely absent during the composition of blurred lines , due to being under the influence of opioid painkiller vicodin mixed with alcohol
' i had a drug and alcohol problem for the year and i did n't do a sober interview
so i do n't recall many things that i said , ' thicke said in the deposition
he added that he was no longer taking vicodin
the song was created by r&b artist and producer pharrell , who said in deposition two days before thicke 's that he had composed the melody and written the lyrics for the hit , and that thicke had ' embellished ' the origins of the song
the previously sealed depositions were filed in los angeles federal court in may in connection with a lawsuit by the estate of late soul singer marvin gaye against thicke and pharrell , accusing them of stealing from the motown legend 's 1977 song got to give it up .
