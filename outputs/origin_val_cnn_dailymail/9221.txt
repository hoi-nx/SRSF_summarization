uefa president platini has defended a ban on third party ownership of footballers - labelling the practice ' shameful ' and a form of ' slavery '
super agent jorge mendes , who includes cristiano ronaldo and jose mourinho among his clients , has claimed the ban is illegal and will kill competition in europe
the spanish and portuguese leagues have also opposed the ban
tpo is a practice which takes place in several countries , particularly in south america , where companies own the economic rights of players and benefit from their transfer fees
it has been banned in the premier league since 2008
uefa president platini has defended a ban on third party ownership ( tpo ) of footballers platini , who pushed fifa to impose the ban - said the ban would stop huge sums of money disappearing from football
speaking on a uefa video forum in response to a question from paris st germain manager laurent blanc , platini said : ' i have put a lot of pressure on fifa to stop third party ownership
' today , it 's shameful to see some players with one of their arms belonging to one person , a leg belonging to a funds pension located who knows where , and a third person owning his foot
' it is shameful ; we 're dealing with a type of slavery that belongs to the past
' everyone earns money on such transfers , and while we are trying to find money to invest in football , that money goes in the pockets of i do n't know who , and i do n't know where
' it 's about time that the world of football wakes up , and that the money coming into football remains in football , and does n't disappear
' joorabchian , head of media sports investments , part - owned a number of high - profile players platini also said in the forum that the biggest misconception about him was that he alone took major decisions about football
he added : ' i think that the people in europe , or in the world , they think that i take my decisions alone
but you have to understand one thing , i am very democratic and very transparent , and i never take a decision alone without the support of the executive committee or with the congress of the uefa
' i listen to everybody very carefully and i take my decision , when it is necessary to take a decision , always for the good of the game and for the good of football
do n't think that i am very despotic
