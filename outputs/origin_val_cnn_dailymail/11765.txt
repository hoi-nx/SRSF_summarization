berra dedicated his third scotland goal to dave mackay â the day after the hearts and spurs legend was laid to rest
berra came through the ranks at tynecastle where the legendary midfielder ruled supreme in the late 1950s
hampden park paid tribute to dave mackay with a minute 's applause before wednesday night 's game with northern ireland - and ipswich town defender berra , who replaced russell martin at the break , ensured the night also had a fitting ending by heading home a winner with five minutes remaining
berra gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for scotland berra celebrates his late goal , which was one of the few memorable moments in a game lacking intensity the ipswich town centre back celebrates with his team - mates after securing the win five minutes from time ' i met him a couple of times when i was at hearts , ' berra recalled of dave mackay
' he was a confident person
i think it was the way he played , he was n't shy and had a great career with scotland , hearts and spurs
' a great deal of respect has been shown to him in football , especially british football
' so i 'm especially pleased i scored tonight
he was strong and could bully people and was a player people could relate to
he had a great career and that minute 's applause was great for him and his family
' it was good to get a goal
that was my first scotland appearance in a long time and it meant a lot to get 45 minutes
to also score a goal was even better
' i 'd almost scored from a corner five minutes before the goal when i had a header at the front post
i maybe should have done better
' i said to matt ( ritchie ) to hang it up a bit and it was there to go and attack
i stuck my head on it and thankfully it went into the back of the net
the teams observed a minute 's applause for the late dave mckay before the game at hampden park ' it 's my third goal for scotland and my sixth of the season
as a defender , it ' s good to add goals to my name
' despite heading his second career goal against northern ireland , berra believes he will return to the bench when gibraltar come calling on sunday
' obviously i am down the pecking order , ' he added
' i just have to be patient and play well for my club and hopefully my international chance will come again
' until berra 's late intervention , it was a night of missed opportunities in more ways than one
fletcher , without an international goal since his one and only strike against iceland almost six years ago , saw a couple of decent chances come and go
had the occasion been anything other than a friendly , he would have been beating himself up about it
but perhaps the prospect of what should be a turkey shoot against gibraltar on sunday allowed him a degree of comfort
' i 'm looking to get back on the score sheet as soon as possible , ' he said
' it ' s been a while
for me , tonight was just about getting some minutes under my belt
' i 've not played too much this year so it feels good to get back out there
it does n't prey on my mind
if i was n't getting chances , i 'd be complaining but i ' m getting them so i just need to start taking them
' crowds clap whilst the hearse carrying the coffin of dave mackay leaves tyncastle stadium for his funeral asked if becoming the first scotland player since colin stein to net a hat - trick come the weekend was an added incentive , fletcher quipped : ' i need to get a goal just now never mind a hat - trick
listen , if we get the opportunities hopefully we can take them
' if that means one of us getting a few then great
first and foremost , we just want to get the goals that give us a win and push up the table
' so much for two celtic nations nipping the life out of each other as they sought a miniscule psychological edge to take into their remaining euro qualifiers
friendly was what it said on the ticket and , by heavens that is what we got
at the conclusion of a remarkably featureless and benign game it was tempting to ask if much had been gained from it
but , despite the lack of goals , fletcher believed it was the perfect work - out ahead of gibraltar on sunday
scotland captain darren fletcher issues instructions from his position in front of the back four ' it was good preparation , ' he insisted
' a few of the boys like myself having been playing too much football so it was good to get a few minutes
' it 's another win which keeps the momentum going
there 's another big game on sunday which we are all looking forward to
' if we 'd got an earlier goal , it would have been a bit more comfortable but at least we got one
' we could have been ahead earlier
we 'd a few chances in the first half â i 'd a few myself
' i 'm going to blame the goalie for the one i missed and not myself
in fairness , he pulled off a few good saves although it was frustrating we never got the goal before we did
but the win keeps us going for the weekend
' both teams obviously had one eye on the games that really matter at the weekend
you could see that with the changes that were made
' both managers wanted to keep everyone 's legs fresh
both nations have got two big games coming up
' fletcher attempted to temper the expectation that sunday 's game will be a total formality
' we 're not going in there thinking we 're going to run them into the ground , ' he insisted
' we just want to put on a performance that the gaffer sets us out to do and if we do that hopefully we can get the win
' goal difference does n't matter against them but it will matter in terms of confidence
we 've got a massive game against ireland in the summer so if we can get a win and a few goals it will be happy days
