friends say pippa middleton has decided against taking the full - time job in the u.s. it was billed as the dream job that would make pippa middleton a household name in u.s.
but more than four months after the headline - grabbing announcement that she was to join the nbc network as a special correspondent in a Â£ 400,000 deal , she has yet to be seen on screen â and friends say she has decided against taking up a full - time job in the u.s.
the duchess of cambridge âs sister has shot a series of reports for the long - running today show in rural wyoming , but none has seen the light of day
and it was only when the mail on sunday asked why the footage had not been aired that a source close to pippa middleton explained that she was not ready to commit to the demands of a job in the u.s.
the source said : â there were talks and pippa middleton did a test shoot which went really well
but for various reasons , a regular show with pippa middleton is nât going to happen
ultimately she did nât want to commit herself to a big job in the u.s.
she âs got a boyfriend in geneva and her family in the uk
it was too much for her to pack up and leave them behind
â she will be working with the network on an ad hoc basis
â nbc were really pleased with the test shoot , but she is not going to be signing a major deal to be a special correspondent , which is what nbc wanted
it was pippa middleton âs decision not to go ahead
it âs not where she sees her future
â one nbc insider said : â pippa middleton â or the lack of her â has been the talk of the company
everyone is wondering what has happened to her ? â there was all that fanfare when she went off to wyoming , and the word then was that she would start doing segments as a roving reporter here and occasionally appear in the studio
but there âs been nothing but silence for months
it âs clear that someone has had reservations â but whether that âs from nbc âs side or her side , who knows ? â it seems odd that they should make such a fuss of her and be so public and then go so silent
â normally , after a big build - up like that , you âd get the talent on air fast and give her a big push
it does nât feel right at all
â in wyoming , pippa middleton donned tight jeans , a flannel shirt and cowboy boots to twirl on the dance floor of a western bar , rode a horse in the shadow of the teton mountains , and visited tourist sights in a cowboy town
interviewees were told the story would air within about ten days of the shoot last november â but have been left disappointed
â we âre wondering what happened to the report , â says jim waldrop , manager of the wort hotel in jackson hole , where pippa middleton filmed
â i contacted the producer , but they do nât have any information about when it might air
she seemed quite at home , relaxed and enjoying herself
â novelist nanci turner steveson , who attended pippa middleton âs filming session , says : â pippa middleton seemed tiny and sweet , but maybe a bit overwhelmed there were so many people there â two or three cameramen , producers , sound technicians and bodyguards , all on a fairly small dance floor , dancing to the band one ton pig
a cowboy taught her to dance a two - step and she picked it up pretty quickly
but nbc seemed to be making a lot of fuss over a very small story
â chris koch , 66 , a regular at the silver dollar bar , said : â i was asked by nbc if i âd be filmed dancing with pippa middleton
i had no idea who she is
my daughter told me , â she âs kate middleton âs sister ! â and i said : â who âs she ? â i do nât know what happened to the today story , and i do nât much care â i do nât have a tv
â pippa middleton âs nbc deal was initially touted as â provisional â , although the network has a history of signing those related to the great and the good
other nbc correspondents have included sarah ferguson , bill clinton âs daughter chelsea , and princess diana âs brother charles spencer
the abortive u.s. tv career is another false start for pippa middleton , after her party - planning book celebrate and column for the daily telegraph both flopped .
