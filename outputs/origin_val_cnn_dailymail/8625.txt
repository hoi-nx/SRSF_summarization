the grand spanish port of vigo , with its high - rise apartments overlooking the north atlantic , is no match for brentford on a winter âs night
but that was when jota â or jota for short â announced himself to england football and gave brentford fans a first inkling that they could end a 68 - year wait to return to the top flight of england football
now , after a mid-season stumble following the bizarre news that their manager warburton was going to be replaced at the end of the season regardless of whether the club earn promotion , they are entertaining realistic hopes of becoming one of the smallest clubs to have graced the premier league
brentford playmaker jota has been one of the club 's standout players this season as they fight for promotion the spaniard joined brentford from celta vigo last summer and has impressed in england 's second tier jota dribbles with the ball ahead of watford 's ikechi anya ( right ) during the match at griffin park in february brentford manager warburton will leave the club at the end of this season regardless of how they finish the winter âs night was last november when jota left fly a stoppage - time winner over arch rivals fulham
it was their first premier league meeting for 18 years and made sure brentford âs neighbours knew there was a change of the guard in west london
quite something for a 23 - year - old who struggled at celta vigo and then with real madrid âs reserves
â that derby was intense , a special moment for me
it felt i âd really arrived at brentford that night , â said jota , who will face fulham again at craven cottage on friday
â as soon as i came here everybody was telling me about fulham
after the goal everybody was stopping me in the street saying , â you âre a hero , thank you , thank you ! â people work all week and we want to put a smile on their faces
â jota is relishing the competition in the championship and hopes to help brentford return to the top - flight jota strikes the ball at brentford 's training complex during his interview with mailsport speaking in spanish , jota sits inside a hut at their modest training complex with seven games â or possibly more in the play - offs â to achieve what appeared unobtainable
he was relaxed , at ease with the club âs situation despite the upheaval in their management structure and laughed in agreement at the notion that no team appear to want to take charge of the promotion race , such is the absurdly close top eight
just one point separated the top five a fortnight ago
jota was open on the serious problems they encountered after february âs shocking developments regarding warburton âs future
the popular boss will leave at the end of the season to be replaced by a foreign coach who buys into owner matthew benham âs continental philosophy and jota admitted the news seriously affected the squad
â for a week or so we dropped our levels , â he said
â you hear rumours â¦ you do nât know what âs going to happen
it was a short period of confusion but we âre now focused
â we âre all still united but it âs never the best thing for something like that to happen in the middle of the season
â jota celebrates scoring the winning goal for brentford against rivals fulham at at griffin park in november they have levelled just in time and are one point off the play - offs
brentford have an ace up their sleeve , too
it was jota âs winner against alaves to seal tiny eibar âs rise to la liga this time last year
he wants to do it again but in front of 90,000 at wembley
â everyone has told me about this final at wembley , â he added
â achieve that in front of these supporters who have been so good to me ? it âd be amazing
this would be truly historic , just as it was for eibar
but we won the league there so this would be more dramatic
â the similarities between brentford and eibar are stark
both have populations of 27,000 and while brentford have not seen the top flight since 1947 , eibar embarked on their first premier campaign in august
using his best england , jota is trying to draw on last year âs experience and explain it to others in the squad
learning the language has not come naturally but assimilating to our game has
â there âs probably more space here than in spanish , â he said
â there âs plenty of opportunity to construct attacks here , create chances
that âs the way we want to play at brentford
being able to play in a similar way to back home has helped me integrate into the game over here
we âre given time on the ball , told to express ourselves
we play some of the best football in the championship
â there are a lot of teams who are trying to play a more beautiful style of play
i âve been most impressed by derby county
jota believes that the championship is ' among the best five leagues in europe ' and has praised its intensity â everything is massively competitive
it comes down to the mentality of the clubs here
they âre all big stadiums , famous clubs
they want to get to that next level
it âs probably more intense than i was expecting
everybody has expensive players , too
â jota did not come cheap , costing progressive brentford Â£ 1.5 million in the summer , and has been watched by premier league clubs
the top flight is where he wants to be and his girlfriend is in the process of moving over to london
â england is famous for having the best league in the world and the championship is also a brilliant division , â he said
â it âs more intense , physical
i âve watched all this from afar and knew what i was getting myself into
â this has great clubs with top facilities â everyone has one goal
the championship is among the best five leagues in europe
â brentford shelled out Â£ 1.5 million to sign jota from la liga club celta vigo last summer
