my hair is thin and flat , and it never seems to grow longer than just past my shoulders
do you have any tips for adding much - needed volume ? karen , 53 , cheshire
mother - of - four karen was fed up of trying to make her limp hair look and feel thicker
like many busy women , she had found her hair had thinned , thanks to hormonal changes , but this can also be caused by stress , a poor diet or illness
before : mother - of - four karen ( pictured ) is fed - up with trying to make her long , limp hair look thicker while karen had used clip - in hair extensions in the past , and found that they worked well , she wanted a longer - lasting solution
the most important thing with hair extensions is that they look natural
it âs equally important that they do nât damage your real hair or prevent it from growing
so , we visited the real hair salon in chelsea , south-west london , where stylist chanelle applied beauty works semi-permanent hair extensions
with 46 shades to choose from , it was easy to match them to karen âs hair colour
the strips of hair have a bonded keratin tip , which is attached to your hair
the keratin is transparent , which means that the joins are barely visible
chanelle blended four different shades into karen âs hair to create a natural look
then , she cut them , so that they blended in with karen âs natural hair
after : karen ( pictured ) had semi-permanent hair extensions put in at the real hair salon in chelsea , south-west london , they should last six months the finished result promises to last six months
the keratin bond can withstand washing , drying and brushing â however , good aftercare is essential
to keep her extensions in top condition , karen was advised to use a nourishing shampoo and conditioner , along with a serum , heat protection product and weekly deep conditioning mask
