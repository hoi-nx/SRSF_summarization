itv 's morning faces an investigation over a fifty shades of grey feature named ' bondage for beginners ' where they discussed and tested sex toys at 11am
ofcom said today it had received 120 complaints about the february 3 show where a scantily - clad couple were seen on a bed playing kinky games on live television
presenter schofield had said before the segment it would be in ' good taste ' , but viewers disagreed , calling it ' pornographic ' and ' highly inappropriate ' for morning television
several complained that they were forced to answer questions about bondage from their children , who had been watching it with them
investigation : itv 's morning segment called bondage for beginners , which featured a live demonstration of fifty shades of grey inspired sex toys , now faces an ofcom investigation presenters christine bleakley and schofield giggled their way through the segment , but maintained it was in ' good taste ' an ofcom spokesman said today : ' ofcom has opened an investigation into whether an item about ' bondage for beginners ' was suitable for broadcast before the watershed
' the ' bondage for beginners ' session was inspired by the new film of the controversial erotic novel fifty shades of grey , which opened in cinemas in mid-february
presenters christine bleakley and schofield giggled their way through the show , which also featured a discussion about sex toys
two models in their underwear were shown in bed using a ' feather tickler ' and discussion moved on to other sex toys like nipple - clamps
mr schofield , 52 , had warned viewers shortly after 10.30am that they would be discussing bondage equipment in three stages â beginners , intermediate and advanced â throughout the show with ' sexpert ' annabelle knight
however he assured them it would ' be done in good taste '
yet at one point he was so distracted by the romping models that he missed his cue to introduce the next section , while miss bleakley , 36 , who is engaged to footballer frank lampard , found herself laughing uncontrollably
campaigners said it was an error of judgment to air the discussion at that time of day
vivienne pattison , director of mediawatch uk , said the show had set a dangerous example : ' it 's not enough to say most children will be at school [ at that time ] because that 's just not good enough
' quite apart from issues of taste and the fact that people might not want to speak to their children about this , i think it is dangerous to normalise this kind of behaviour
[ fifty shades of grey ] is putting across ideas that humiliation is pleasurable and torture is gratifying and i do n't think those are healthy for anybody at all
' but if it is dangerous for adults then it is doubly dangerous for children watching this '
pre-watershed : at 11am on valentine 's day two models in their underwear were shown in bed using a ' feather tickler ' and discussion moved on to other sex toys like nipple - clamps
viewers were not impressed either and expressed their anger online
tracey johnson tweeted : ' used to love this morning but today was final straw , sitting with my mum , on comes the bondage # nothanks
' mother nikki wrote : ' ok bondage for beginners had to be turned over , ca n't cope with questions from the nine - year - old
' another said on twitter : ' # bondageforbeginners is ridiculously inappropriate
this programme is on at my health club where there are children
' a friend added : ' too early for this talk # bondageforbeginners
this is porn now @ itvthismorning # fiftyshades # inappropriate
' itv defended itself at the time and said it had warned viewers
a spokesman said : ' this morning is a lifestyle programme that cover a diverse range of human interest topics
' the programme has dealt with advice on sexual matters many times in the past , and a suitable announcement was given at the start
