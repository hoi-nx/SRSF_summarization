the premier league will have to wait at least three seasons before video technology can be possibly be introduced
it is the dutch fa ( fa ) who are leading the way in trials of a system to aid referees
however , their bid to introduce the technology in cup matches from next season was rejected by the ifab ( ifab ) last month
referees chief mike riley has called for the arrival of video technology into the premier league given the increasing number of controversies in the premier league , referees â chief mike riley has called for its arrival in the english top - flight
but the ifab have delayed any decision for 12 months at least , meaning the earliest we could see video assistance for referees will be the 2017/18 season
the dutch are certainly confident their process could work
it involves a fifth official located in a video room with access to instant replays
during eredivisie games they have been trialling how long it would take that official to make a correct judgment on key incidents only , such as red cards , penalties and fouls before goals
they have found that an average of two to three crucial decisions per game can each be resolved within five to 20 seconds , with the official having a direct audio link to the referee
should the ifab give the go - ahead for trials of this system â or another one â in competitive matches during the 2016/17 campaign , they would then want to see it used in a fifa age - grade tournament before giving permission for video technology to be implemented in the premier league and elsewhere around the world
with goal - line technology in use , and calls for videos to help with penalties and red cards too have risen too meanwhile , the notion of a â challenge system â for managers has been rejected for fear of it being used for tactical gain
fa chairman greg dyke will offer his full backing to any attempts to expand the use of video technology and will even volunteer english football to operate trials
â in 20 years we âll look back and say : â was nât it quaint that we did nât use video technology ? â â said greg dyke
â when we discussed it at ifab , even the ones who were most against it accept it âs going to happen
â if we âre going to do it sometime , why do nât we do it now ? we are 100 per cent behind it
i suspect we would like to do an experiment , but you âd have to get that throu fa chairman greg dyke has backed any attempts to expand the use of video technology in football
