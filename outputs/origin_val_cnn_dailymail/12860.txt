boston she knew something awful had happened
it was smoky and all she could hear were muffled screams
her foot was turned sideways and her legs would n't work right
and her good friend , campbell , was just lying there on the ground
karen rand -- she 's mcwatters now -- dragged herself across the pavement
she wanted to get closer to campbell so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos
" i got close to her , " she recalled
" for some reason , i got close to her head and we put our faces together
" campbell said that her legs hurt
they were the last words she 'd speak
the two women held hands until campbell 's went limp
mcwatters was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused boston marathon bomber tsarnaev , who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the united states for policies they believe inflict suffering on muslims
three people were killed in the blasts : campbell , a 29 - year - old manager for a restaurant chain ; martin richard , an 8 - year - old boy ; and lingzi lu , a 23 - year - old grad student
more than 250 others were injured
and the first day of the trial -- after opening statements -- revolved around a number of survivors of the attack , who recounted in detail the chaos of that day
prosecutors called them to the stand to paint a picture of the havoc and pain the bombings inflicted
tsarnaev 's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors
mcwatters fought her emotions as she looked at a photograph that showed her and her friend of eight years lying amid a heap of dazed and broken people
their two faces , side by side , stand out among the jumble of limbs
campbell 's mouth is open , but she is very pale
" i was really scared , " mcwatters testified , " and i remember screaming for someone to help us
everybody was screaming , everybody was screaming for help
it seemed like a long time before help got to us , but it probably was n't
" by the time first responders reached campbell , it was too late
" they were doing cpr on campbell and i started to think she did n't make it , " mcwatters said
she grabbed her friend 's cell phone and tucked it in her pocket
by the time she arrived at the hospital , shock had set in
for a while , that phone led hospital staffers to believe she was campbell
when campbell 's parents rushed to her bedside and saw she was n't their daughter , they were heartbroken , mcwatters said
campbell 's boyfriend recognized her and called her parents
two days later , doctors told her they were taking her leg
her body was broken , and it hurt like crazy , she said
but not as much as losing her friend
campbell 's death was the first to be described in detail at tsarnaev 's trial
but descriptions of the other two deaths at the marathon and the death of a police officer at the massachusetts institute of technology will come soon
there were runners conquering a 26.2 - mile feat nearby , but noah 's attention was elsewhere , playing with rocks and pretending to be a scientist
the 5 - year - old thought it was a very cool idea to handle the rocks , his mother , rebekah gregory , told jurors
gregory recalled that she thought it lucky that noah was happy playing scientist
the next thing she remembers is being hoisted and thrown back
other witnesses used similar phrases : blown through the air , deafening explosion , cries for help
o'hara , the manager at marathon sports , a running store near where the bombs went off , said it sounded like a loud cannon , followed by an instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows
o'hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair
the decisions about whom to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunts him , he said
there were cries , sirens and screams , he said in answer to prosecutors ' questions
he sniffled as a photo of the blown - out storefront was shown in the courtroom
he told the jury the plea he heard : " stay with me , stay with me
" outside , gregory tried to sit up , but could not rise much
" my first instinct as a mother was where in the world was my baby , where was my son , " gregory said
she could n't see her legs , but she saw her bones lying next to her on the sidewalk , she testified
" at that point i thought that was the day i would die , " she said
gregory lifted her arms and her bones were sticking out of her flesh
somehow , over the cacophony , she heard noah calling for her
she was n't imagining it
colton kilgore , who was also part of gregory 's group and another of wednesday 's witnesses , remembered the terrified boy looking for his mother
boston marathon bombing timeline the day 's testimony was dramatic and emotional , most likely as the prosecutors wanted it
anyone who follows the news has seen footage of the bombings and read accounts of what happened
the power of the survivors ' testimonies in the courtroom was in the details that made what some would call an unimaginable crime into something very real
they shared small memories , like what people said in the immediate aftermath of the attack
gregory told the jury about how she knew noah was being cared for
then she focused on the tourniquet that was being twisted on her leg by aid - givers
" we have an amputee , " she saw one of them mouth
what they told her aloud was something along the lines of " this is really , really bad , but we will help you
" another survivor , sydney corcoran , testified that after the blasts -- which left her ears ringing " just like leaving a concert " -- she was hurt but did n't know that she was severely injured
she limped to a railing , grabbed it , and passed out , she said
eyes open again shortly afterward , she found herself on her back , with a group of men applying pressure on her thigh , trying to figure out where she was bleeding
" i remember a man putting his forehead to my head and telling me i 'd be all right , " she said
corcoran was a senior in high school
after the one man told her she would be ok , another said he could see her eyes going white
" i could feel my body going tingly and i was getting increasingly cold
i knew i was dying , " she testified
in court , she was asked if she knew why she was feeling cold
the blood was leaving my body
i was bleeding out , " she answered
it felt like she was sliding into sleep
almost peaceful , corcoran said
like she was going to go to sleep and fade away
doctors saved the teen , but her life was not spared the pain of the attack
corcoran awoke in a hospital and saw her father , she testified
because she was intubated , she motioned for a pen and a paper and wrote a question for her father
was her mother alive ? " once he looked at what i 'd written he started to cry , " corcoran told jurors
the father responded : " she 's ok , but her legs are gone
