banks have experimented with card readers and even fingerprint scanners but in the near future you could access your accounts using your heartbeat
halifax has recently completed a successful trial of ' cardiac authentication ' for its online accounts using the nymi band
nymi reads the wearer 's heart rhythms , which is said to be as unique as a person 's fingerprint , to authenticate who they are
halifax ( branch pictured ) recently completed a successful trial of ' cardiac authentication ' for its online accounts using the nymi band
nymi reads the wearer 's heart rhythms , which is said to be as unique as a person 's fingerprint , to authenticate who they are a built - in proximity sensor can then detect where they are , and when the wearer is close to a paired device , will automatically confirm their identity and unlock the account
in particular , the bracelet contains a heartid sensor that measures the amount of electrical power generated by a human heart , called a cardiac rhythm tracked on an electrocardiogram , or ecg
this ecg differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart
nymi only works with a registered person 's cardiac rhythm , meaning if the bracelet is stolen it ca n't be hacked
the technology was developed by toronto - based bionym
a built - in proximity sensor can then detect where the wearer is are , and when they are close to a paired device , will automatically confirm their identity and unlock the account
the bracelet contains a heartid sensor that measures electrical power generated by a human heart tracked on an electrocardiogram , or ecg when the wearer clasps the nymi around their wrist , the bracelet powers on
by placing a finger on the topside sensor while the wrist is in contact with the bottom sensor , it completes an electrical circuit
when the wearer clasps the nymi around their wrist , the bracelet powers on
by placing a finger on the topside sensor while the wrist is in contact with the bottom sensor , it completes an electrical circuit
nymi will then vibrate and built - in leds light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them
users will stay authenticated until they remove their nymi and the electrical circuit is broke
the nymi functions on a three - factor security system - the bracelet , a unique heartbeat and an aad ( aad ) , which is a device registered with the app. nymi vibrates and built - in leds light up to tell the wearer the device has successfully authenticated them
users stay authenticated until they remove their nymi and the electrical circuit is broke
the nymi functions on a three - factor security system - the bracelet , a unique heartbeat and an aad ( aad ) , which is a smartphone or device registered with the app. when the nymi authenticates a user it looks at the shape of their ecg wave , not their heart rate
it can therefore adjust to typical variations in heart rate , even if the wearer has an irregular ecg as a result of a medical condition
the product 's site said : ' nymi offers security without compromising convenience , putting you , and only you , in control of your identity
' as you head out the door , you âll be able to interact with the world around you through the power of simple gestures
' with accurate and convenient authentication technology there is no end to the possibilities
' the nymi can replace everything from the pin on your credit card to the account information on your gaming console without sacrificing security , privacy or convenience
' in the first - of - its - kind trials by a uk bank , halifax asked customers to use the wristband to login to their online accounts
when connected to an account , the band could also be used to pay for goods using contactless readers too
marc lien , halifax 's director of innovation and digital development , said : ' exploring innovative technology is a real focus for us at the bank
in the first - of - its - kind trials by a uk bank , halifax asked staff and customers to use the wristband to login to their online accounts
when connected to an account , the band could , in theory , be used to pay for goods using contactless readers too ( example shown ) an ecg differs from person to person and depends on the location and size of the their heart
nymi only works with a registered person 's cardiac rhythm , meaning if the bracelet is stolen it ca n't be hacked
the technology ( pictured ) was developed by toronto - based bionym the bank said the band ( illustrated ) only works when worn by the account owner and it must be paired with the device being used ' we are in the very early stages of exploring potential uses for the nymi band and wearable technology more widely
' the bank - owned by lloyds - said the technology only works when worn by the account owner and the band has to be paired with the device being used to access the account
lloyds recently updated its online banking app with a similar feature that pairs and recognises the phone or tablet it is being used on
this removes the need to enter the username , password and memorable information every time
instead the app just asks for the latter
the nymi bracelet can be pre-ordered for $ 79 ( Â£ 50 )
devices were due to ship in december but the site has not updated when it will go on general sale .
