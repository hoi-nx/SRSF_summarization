she grew up in kenyan under colonial rule , when women did n't get an education
now in her 90s , priscilla sitienei is changing that , attending elementary school -- and inspiring a generation
she started five years ago as a kindergartner at a boarding school near eldoret
she 's in fourth grade today
" i had grandchildren and great - grandchildren who shunned school , " she says by phone from ndalat
" that made me mad
i decided i have to show them that education is important
" during colonial times , some kenyan hospitals did not keep birth records
priscilla sitienei 's exact age is unclear , but she says she was born around 1923 , when a famine plagued her hometown
growing up , relatives told her she barely survived that famine as a toddler , which gave her a rough estimate of her birth year
if confirmed by the guinness world records , she would be the oldest pupil in elementary school
the last such honor by the guinness world records went to another kenyan , kimani maruge , who in 2004 was named the oldest person to begin primary school
five years later , he died at age 90
though priscilla sitienei worked as a traditional midwife for decades , she says there 's still a lot to learn
" my favorite subject is math , " the nonagenarian says
" now that i 'm in school , i know the right dosage to give the women who i help deliver their babies
" priscilla sitienei got married at a young age and focused on raising her 10 children
" i could not go to school even if i wanted , " she says
" in my time , educating a woman was considered a waste of time and money
" she enthusiastically describes her love for school and her fellow pupils , some of whom she helped bring into this world
" they call me ' gogo , ' " she says , using the word for grandmother in her local kalenjin tribe
" we play in swings during recess , we talk
" priscilla sitienei has a special dorm room tucked away in a corner , where she doles out wisdom to her proteges
outside her door is a sign that says " education has no age limit
" kinyanjui , the principal of leaders vision preparatory school , describes her as a model pupil
" she advises our girls , she advises our boys , " kinyanjui says
" she participates in everything , including pe ( physical education )
she 's also good at math and science , and she 's such a good storyteller
" priscilla sitienei 's enthusiasm is already paying off
her three great - grandchildren are her classmates
they have friendly competitions on who 'll make the best grades
last year , priscilla sitienei was the leading student in third grade
" her great - grandchildren could not believe she did better than them
that really motivated them ; one of them even cried , " the principal says
now they work even harder to beat her
