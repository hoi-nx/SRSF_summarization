the best of british come face - to - face on saturday afternoon when austin 's qpr take on harry kane 's tottenham at loftus road
and austin , who has scored the most goals of any english player in the premier league this season , is keen to put his past behind him to be viewed as a footballer and not an ex-builder
the 25 - year - old came up through the ranks in lower league football , before getting his break in the big time
to fund himself while playing for clubs like kintbury rangers and hungerford town , austin was a builder by trade , but now the time has come for a change in mentality
austin ( right ) thinks he has scored enough goals to be considered a footballer rather than a builder austin has come up through the ranks , starting in non-league and working his way to the top ' i have scored 100 - odd career goals now , ' austin told the sun , ' and think i have done enough to be considered a player rather than a builder who plays football
i know where i have come from but i feel like i have done enough to be known as a footballer now
' the only blisters i have on my hands these days are from the gym
laying bricks was about five or six years ago now
' his journey to this point is the antithesis of harry kane 's , who has spent 11 years in the relative comfort of tottenham 's academy
the now - qpr striker got his first premier league break at swindon town , for whom he scored over 30 goals austin takes on team - mate shaun wright-phillips during a training session at qpr for austin though , that route did n't work out
he was released by reading as a teenager for being too small , and had to rely on opportunities elsewhere to get where he is today
' coming through the academies did n't work for me , ' the qpr striker continues
' i was released at 14
i would n't change it at all
harry kane [ kane ] would probably tell you the same about his upbringing
we just got taught differently
' my way you pick up things as you go through the game
for players in academies ... everything is in place for them at the clubs
' regardless of their differences , austin and harry kane will face each other for the first time on saturday afternoon
in fact , they 've never even met before
29 league goals between them this season has warranted calls for international call - ups , but all eyes will be on west london to see which player comes out on top in this encounter
austin 's career in football has been the opposite of harry kane , who has been at tottenham for 11 years the 25 - year - old will come face - to - face with harry kane for the first time in his career on saturday afternoon
