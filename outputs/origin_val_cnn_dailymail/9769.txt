towle , from portland , ( seen on right with a friend ) lost 500 pounds , but must now wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin towle admits he suffered an addiction to eating and only took stock when his doctor told him he faced an early death if he did not lose weight ' i did an amazing job , i think , of putting a great face on , letting no one know how much being that heavy bothered me , ' he said
at one point he weighed almost 800lbs
' i made jokes at myself to survive
if someone was making fun of me , i made fun of myself harder
that way your jokes did n't hurt me , or at least you thought they did n't hurt me
inside , it was a totally different story
' towle tried several diets which all worked but as soon as he pulled back , he put the weight on again
he eventually began to lose weight when he got a job at mcdonald 's and he left the house and moved around more
he said that although he suffered pain in his joints from the excess weight they supported , he was able to sit down on a stool and serve customers
towle and a friend fit now fit into the shirt he used to wear before he lost weight he now weighs about 270 pounds , and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds ' i learned to work at mcdonald 's , and i lost weight , ' he said
' i was actually getting out of the house
even though i might not have been standing up and doing exercise , i think the motion , the actual getting out , was a big first step in losing some of that weight
' he lost about 200 pounds through an improved diet and additional exercise , bringing him down to 600 pounds
eventually towle decided to have weight - loss surgery , although he had to lose another 50 pounds to be a safe weight to have the operation
in june 2011 , towle underwent gastric bypass surgery and a portion of his stomach was used to create a second smaller stomach
towle can no longer eat some of his favorite foods as a result because they can make him vomit
he now weighs about 270 pounds , and is nearing his goal of getting below 250 pounds
but he has has to wear compression garments to stabilize all his excess skin
he says his faces a daily regime of three compression garments everyday as well as creams and powders to treat his extensive rashes and dry tearing skin
towle needs reconstructive surgeries to remove the excess skin from his chest , abdomen and legs
the procedures are predicted to cost close to $ 30,000 and towle thinks his insurance company will pay for at least a portion of the bill , but he is now appealing for help in paying the rest of it on his go fund me page
he wrote : ' i am still trapped inside my own fat suit of skin that just hangs there and affects my everyday life , making it depressing to think i have come so far yet i am still trapped
' i am asking you to please help me shed this one last obstacle in the way between me and a true new beginning a life that can be lived to the fullest
' i wish insurance understood i do n't want to be the next sex symbol i just want to be free of this burden
