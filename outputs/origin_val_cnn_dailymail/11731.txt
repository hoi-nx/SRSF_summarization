' as part of his sentebale charity , harry built the mamohato children 's centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education and the initiative is being awarded speaking about the award , life ball founder life ball , who selected harry 's work , told femail : ' we always select programmes to receive this award that are relatively unsung heroes , doing interesting , innovative and important work but not yet well known ' the life ball , which takes place in may , is the biggest charity event in europe supporting people with aids and is being dubbed europe 's answer to the met ball thanks to it 's dazzling guestlist
speaking about the origins of the glittering event , life ball said : ' life ball was born out of the energy and environment prevalent across the world in the late 80 âs and early 90 âs - particularly in the fashion industry - that saw aids as a daily issue profoundly effecting our friends and colleagues who were dying , but that no one understood or was willing to talk about
' there was this undercurrent of urgency to do something : to help , to get involved and make some noise
' my main goal with the first life ball was to bring a spotlight to the disease , the fundraising aspect was a secondary consideration
' prince harry 's award will be announced at the life ball , pictured , which is the biggest charity event in europe supporting people with aids or aids and is being dubbed europe 's answer to the met ball life ball set up the event in 1992 with the goal of the show being to be provocative and have aids and the taboo that it represented acknowledged life ball , left , pictured with sir elton john , centre , set up the life ball in 1992 to raise vital funds the event , which has attracted the likes of bill clinton , left , and dame vivienne westwood , aims to get people talking about aids , which life ball says was a daily issue profoundly effecting his friends and colleagues who were dying but that no one understood or was willing to talk about life ball aimed to marry the unique and prolific ball tradition that they have in vienna , and combine the splendour of the viennese waltz with modern , liberal ideals to celebrate life
' at that time , the goal of the show was to be provocative as we were aiming to cause a stir and have aids and the taboo that it represented acknowledged , ' he explained
' when in 1993 one of my clients , thierry mugler âs main stylist , died of the disease , he agreed to do the fashion show and so life ball as a standalone event was born
' i had no conceivable idea what i was taking on , it was me and a fax machine in six square meters of office space in my client 's kitchen
i funded it entirely from my own pocket and did nât really know if anyone was going to attend but knew that we had to do something
' life ball aimed to marry the unique and prolific ball tradition that they have in vienna with more liberal ideas ( conchita wurst pictured at the event ) life ball says this year 's life ball , which takes place in vienna , will ' undoubtedly be better than ever ' life ball ' strongly believes ' that a cure for aids is on the horizon and hopes to make as much noise about it as possible via his glittering event from there , a huge event was born and the likes of debbie harry , kate moss , naomi campbell and helena christensen were among the first guests
the event is now listed as one of the top 50 hiv / aids fundraisers in the world and has partnered with elton john âs aids foundation , bill clinton âs aids initiative and amfar
life ball says this year âs life ball will ' undoubtedly be better than ever '
the event will be continuing its work with elton john âs foundation , supporting the crucial work that they do , and graham norton will be attending as part of the foundation
adding some high fashion glamour to the event , jean paul is set to unveil an exclusive retrospective of work twenty years after he first showed there
with gold as this year âs life ball theme , taking inspiration from the exquisite baroque vienna secessionists , the couture show will follow the vibrant and ostentatious theme with a bevy of internationally acclaimed supermodels set to walk for well - connected jean paul
' it is really perfect timing to have jpg back this year , ' said life ball
' it has been twenty years since he was part of the life ball and we are at such an exciting time in our medical fight against aids that his presence is a wonderful reminder of how far we have come
' the event is now listed as one of the top 50 hiv aids fundraisers in the world and has attracted guests such as maria cross , left , and antonio banderas and naomi campbell , right ricky martin has performed at the event in previous years and 2015 will welcome jean paul and charlize theron jean paul 's show will be watched from the front row by actress charlize theron , who will attend on behalf of her foundation charlize theron africa outreach project
theron will join a bevy of a-list celebrities and performers , who pour into vienna annually to help fight against aids at the world âs largest aids event
the charlize theron africa outreach project , based in her home country of south africa , is dedicated to addressing aids in adolescents across sub-saharan africa through education , grant giving , networking and community outreach
theron will give a keynote speech at the first ladies luncheon at the belvedere castle in vienna ahead of attending the life ball , where she will present the work of her organisation and her vision for and aids - free generation
so who would life ball love to host ? ' we have long been aware of prince william âs continued support of aids organisations , much like his brother , following in the footsteps of their mother and would naturally consider supporting any relevant programme
' he and the duchess of cambridge are both welcome guests at life ball , ' he said
life ball wo n't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change life ball ' strongly believes ' that a cure for aids is on the horizon and that the leap forward that was affordable generic medication was crucial to the fight for survival for the 34 million people in the world living with aids
' ironically we have further to go in the fight against social aids than we do the medical disease now and thus it is this fight that we must be equally concerned with , ' he said
but that 's where the life ball comes in - and he wo n't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change
he concludes : ' life ball is symbolic , it is a unique weekend in the year in which the world âs most significant aids organisations come together , stand together , fight together and continue to fight for those who are not able to fight for themselves
' it is my constant desire for life ball weekend to expand , to obtain more friends , have better connections , help more programmes and become internationally known for fighting social aids as well as the disease itself
