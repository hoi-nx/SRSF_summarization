just when you thought echidna puggles could n't get any cuter one shown being cared for at taronga zoo in sydney has upped the charm factor
a wildlife hospital supervisor said it was only around 30 days old when it was brought in
tiny , bald and has no spines , the puggle was found on a walking track at anna bay in the hunter region of new south wales and taken to taronga zoo
â it âs quite possible it fell out of it âs mum âs pouch
it still would have been in mum âs pouch at that time
when they get a bit older â 10 to 15 days older â they are left in a burrow , ' the wildlife hospital supervisor explained in a zoo video
at the moment i only have to feed this one every two days
â the puggle just sucked milk out of the palm of the wildlife hospital supervisor âs hand as the mother echida does not have any teats only milk patches which the baby puggle drinks from
â at the moment i âm keeping it in a small esky just to keep it at the right temperature
they actually have a very low temperature of 25 - 27 degrees
the esky is really good at keeping that constant temperature , â the wildlife hospital supervisor said
the puggle is bathed and cleaned daily
at this age it is tiny , bald and has no spines at the moment the small puggle only has to be fed every two days at the most it âll take a few months before it will look like an echidna
they normally do nât come out of the burrow for six to sevens months
â it still needs a lot of tender loving care for the next few months yet , â she said
being monotremes , echidnas produce young from eggs which are hatched outside their body , in the same way as birds and most reptiles
young echidnas are often not fully weaned until they are at least several months old although they begin to eat termites and ants soon after leaving the pouch , young echidnas are often not fully weaned until they are several months old
echidnas evolved between 20 and 50 million years ago , descending from a platypus - like creatures
this ancestor was aquatic , but echidnas adapted to life on land
it will take a few months yet before the puggle will start looking like an echidna
