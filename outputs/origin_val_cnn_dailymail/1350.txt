former american presidents cost taxpayers more than $ 879,000 per year in pensions , personnel , benefits , travel and office expenses , and bill clinton 's cumulative near - $ 16 million total is bringing him new scrutiny as his wife makes the case for a white house run of her own
daily mail online reported bill clinton 's take in 2014 , amounting to slightly less than $ 1.14 million per year , based on a paper from the nonpartisan congressional research service ( congressional research service )
that amount is still less than george w. bush 's $ 1.18 million annual haul
but since bill clinton has had an eight - year head start , his overall benefits are the highest by far , totalling $ 15,938,000 since he left the white house in january 2001
his disbursement each year from the gsa includes $ 96,000 for salaries ; insiders told politico that some of that money has been passed through to staffers at the bill , hillary and clinton foundation
the foundation also insisted the bill clinton 's personal funds , not taxpayer dollars , paid for the now - infamous private email server that his wife hillary used exclusively while secretary of state
mrs. hillary said tuesday during a contentious press conference in new york city that the former president set up the server for his own staff 's use , and she began using it later
as she ramps up for a presidential campaign , critics have piled on with accusations that she intentionally avoided using a government - issued email address while she was the nation 's top diplomat in order to hide electronic communications from state department archivists
but she insisted on tuesday that decision was made purely for ' convenience
' the larger question raised by politico is whether it 's appropriate for tax dollars to subsidize the salaries of nonprofit employees while their work is leveraged to support a potential presidential candidate
while bill clinton has received more post-white white house cash overall than any other living former president , george w. bush âs annual numbers are the highest the clinton foundation is now hillary 's principal political messenger in the public sphere
although its work does n't include overt politicking or political campaigning , there 's no mistaking that the public sees what washington wags call ' clinton , inc. ' â the amalgamation of the family 's political , commercial and philanthropic arms â as a single entity
sources also told politico that staffers whose compensation straddles bill clinton 's foundation purse and his government benefits include former white house aide doug band and senior clinton foundation staffer laura graham
the paper also speculated that flournoy , a former union official who is now bill clinton 's chief of staff and advised hillary 's 2008 campaign , has followed suit
new york magazine observed flournoy 's arrival at the foundation in 2012 ' as hillary 's planting a sentinel ' there
annual payments to former american chief executives are guaranteed by the former presdients act of 1958 , a law passed in response to the predicament of former president truman , who fell on hard times after he moved from washington back to missouri
at the time , truman had to take out a personal loan from a missouri bank to pay his bills
today the law provides payments to bill clinton , george w. bush , his father george w. bush , and jimmy carter
which way to the gravy train ? barack obama is set to reap an annual windfall beginning in 2017 that will dwarf his current $ 400,000 salary former american presidents receive millions of dollars over the course of their post-office years , including living examples bill clinton , jimmy carter , george w. bush and his father george h.w. bush the clintons ' burgeoning personal wealth , including a mammoth $ 15 million advance for hillary 's memoir ' hard choices ' and a string of six - figure speaking fees for her and bill , have raised questions about whether 21st - century former presidents still need to be on the government dole
utah chaffetz rep. chaffetz , now chairman of the powerful house oversight and government reform committee , introduced a bill in 2012 called the presidential allowance modernization act to reform the practice
the legislation , which never received a positive committee vote , would have capped the government 's total annual spending on former presidents to $ 400,000 each
and that amount would have been reduced dollar - for - dollar by any money they earned
under those guidelines , bill clinton would have received nothing during most of his post-presidency
his earnings for individual speeches have reportedly topped $ 500,000
tax returns the clintons released in 2010 showed a total of $ 111 million in earnings from 2000 through 2007
' nobody wants our former presidents living the remainder of their lives destitute , " chaffetz said when he floated his bill three years ago , ' but the fact is none of our former presidents are poor
' ' reports actually indicate that between book tours and speaking fees , these men are making millions of dollars a year
there 's little reason why american taxpayers should be subsidizing these former presidents when they 're doing fine on their own
' his spokespersons did not respond to a request for comment about whether he has plans to use his influential platform to reintroduce the bill in the current congress
jimmy carter , who left office in 1981 , spends the least among the four living former presidents
the gsa budgeted $ 466,000 for his total upkeep in 2014
