if the wheel was man 's greatest invention , putting two wheels together comes as a close second for dani foffa , ceo of foffa bikes
his eponymous company builds bespoke urban bicycles with a stylish design that has been lauded by magazines like vogue and gq
london - based foffa tracks his passion for cycling back to his childhood in venice , italy , where biking in the city 's winding narrow streets was a rare treat
he spent his early professional career as a business analyst , before a nagging feeling that there was more to life encouraged him to start designing and building bikes , initially from his office garage
" i started refurbishing vintage bikes up and reselling them online
and the demand just grew very gradually , steadily , to the point that it was time for us to get our own brand in the bikes , and open up our first shop
i took my chances , i quit my job , and clearly i have no regrets , " says dani foffa
his company has built over 5,000 bespoke bikes since 2007 , and they were named as one of the ten best commuter bikes by the independent , a uk newspaper
dani foffa says that he was encouraged to start the company when he saw a gap in the market for comfortable bicycles designed for cycling in the city , which also looked good
" in the same way that we decide what to wear , we think that the bicycle should be an extension of your personality , " says dani foffa
he adds that he always relished the sense of liberty that biking afforded him , and wants to introduce the simple pleasure of a bike ride to as many people as possible
" bikes are great for the environment , great for the health , they are the quickest and probably the cheapest way of commuting around town
and they link with that sense of adventure , that freedom that comes with it , which no other invention , as far as i 'm concerned , was able to offer me
