manager beale ( left ) of darwin âs barra base has been running his business for more than 12 years â once we hit the water with beale i think we were all looking around for the hidden cameras ! â the post read
â abused at the boat ramp whilst attempting to help him launch the boat , abused when we hooked a fish , abused when we lost a fish , witnesses to the man himself defecating off the front of the boat â¦ â in response to these allegations , beale told daily mail australia the review was not true and are based on â one side of exaggeration â
â the reviews were pretty rude and distorted to the facts , â beale said
â customer service is our business
we 've been in the tourism business for more than 12 years and i 'm saddened to read these false allegations after all these years
' beale said the allegation was not true and are based on â one side of exaggeration â - he also added that ' catfish are a pest ' so he ' assists to minimise the population ' beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client 's best interests beale said one person had suffered a sore back during this trip so he suggested an alternative because the man could n't handle the rough waves and everyone was happy to choose the other location for fish species another client , under the name â les n â from perth also took to the travel website to post their â overrated and disappointing â experience
â i wrote a review on alan 's facebook account after he used pictures of my group holding fish up that quite frankly i could n't believe we kept ? â the post read
â we came here to catch sailfish & barra ? what a joke , not one sailfish and 3 barra , not one was a keeper , we paid nearly $ 4000 and did n't take a fish home , great
' beale , who runs the fishing safari , said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business a 152cm black jewfish landed finniss river 17th june 2013 by gary bez from karratha at head but beale told daily mail australia they had set off for sail city to go hunting for sailfish but one person among the group had suffered a sore back during the trip
â one of the chaps had a sore back and he could nât handle the wave action so i told them that we could nât go out there because we needed to look after the client âs best interest , â beale said
' i like to make 100 percent of my customers happy but when it comes to bad weather and body conditions , the reality is - it âs hard to give them that because we ca nât control the weather
â i knew the wave action from the wind would double in the next two hours and the sailfish would have been around 60 kilometres away so it was definitely out of the question
â i explained it to them and they accepted that they could nât handle the distance so i gave them two safer alternatives â go black jewfish fishing at peron island or travel out to jenny and blaze wide for spanish mackerel â everyone picked the spanish mackerel
â i do nât think it âs fair to make these sorts of allegations towards our business because all we can do is offer the best service as possible
' beale said fishing safari offers a great experience to all customers as well as meet client 's best interests beale , who runs the fishing safari , said customer service plays an important role in his tourism business darwins barra base will offer their clients the choice of two levels of extended fishing safaris les n added : â alan was the skipper the 1st day , what a miserable moany [ sic ] guy , all he did all day was tell us how much he was struggling to keep skippers & that his secretary was on stress leave
â sorry mate we needed counciling [ sic ] after listening to your moaning all day , â the post continued
but beale responded : â during the day clients ask questions whilst fishing about work , fishing , staff and family and their business
this comment about me moaning about staff issues just shows how little he had to go to , to complain
â there are issues in these allegations â they are made up and completely false
â and as for the defecation claims â i never defecated and they are pure lies
â we do nât have commercial toilets
the truth of matter is , if someone has to go , then we have to go but you 've got to do it in a safe matter
â beale added : â send us an email and i 'll look after you and ensure all the little issues presented in these reviews are better handled for you by me and my staff
