it was popularised by artists like johnny cash and dolly parton in the fifties and sixties
but now it would appear country music is more popular than ever
chart history was made on sunday as the first ever home - grown british country act shot into the top ten with a debut album
relatively unknown until now , the shires , comprised of crissie rhodes from bedfordshire and ben earle from hertfordshire , made it to tenth place in the official uk album chart with their debut album brave
the pair , both aged 26 , overtook established band hozier and came just behind paloma faith when the results were announced on sunday
their position sees them sit alongside big names such as kelly clarkson , ed sheeran and sam smith in the charts
their feat has been described as â truly remarkable â for a country band and is evidence the genre is shifting eastwards from its heartland in nashville , tennessee
country band the shires now sit alongside the likes of paloma faith and ed sheeran ( pictured ) in the charts official charts company chief executive martin talbot said : â this is a fantastic feat by this young british country duo
no uk country act has ever made this kind of impact on the chart before â it is truly remarkable
â bbc radio 2 âs bob harris added : â i âve been doing the country show for 15 years now , and in the whole of that time i âve never known things to be quite as exciting as they are today
country is now appealing to a completely new , young generation
â the genre has experienced a renaissance in recent years
last year dolly parton returned to perform at glastonbury to huge critical acclaim .
