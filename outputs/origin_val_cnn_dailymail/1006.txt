alan pardew wants wingers wilfried zaha and yannick bolasie to become the 21st century version of ian wright and mark bright at crystal palace
the pair terrorised qpr last week in the 3 - 1 win with zaha scoring from a yannick bolasie cross and alan pardew is excited by the potential his two wingers have attacking both flanks
but the crystal palace boss has warned the pair are not the finished article and still have plenty of room for improvement
wilfried zaha celebrates with crystal palace team - mates after his opener at selhurst park last weekend yannick bolasie was in magnificent form last saturday as crystal palace beat qpr 3 - 1 at selhurst park he said : â i think any team knows that any full backs coming up against these two know they are in for a test because these two can move the ball
â they have to do the other parts of the game that do nât come as easy to them such as , discipline , work rate , commitment , aggression , but they are adding those aspects to their games and at the moment they have got the flare in them to create something
â it is exciting to watch them and it is exciting to have them in the team - but frightening for the opposing manager
â ian wright congratulates mark bright ( centre ) during their spell together playing for the crystal palace the crystal palace squad of 1990 - 91 , including ian wright and mark bright , celebrate winning the full members cup alan pardew was a player at crystal palace in the late 1980s and early 90s when ian wright and mark bright formed one of the most lethal strike partnerships in english football
they scored a total of 209 goals between them and guided crystal palace to promotion to the top flight in 1989 and then to a third place finish in the old division one under steve coppell in 1991
and alan pardew says the game has changed so much with more focus being put on the midfield that the sort of partnership that ian wright and mark bright had is unlikely ever to be seen again â but zaha and yannick bolasie can provide a new type of threat
he added : â mark bright and ian wright had a very tight bond and that helped them with each others games
zaha slides in to open the scoring during the 3 - 1 win over relegation threatened qpr â they were very unselfish , although brighty will probably argue that ian wright was more selfish than him
â what they had was the chemistry of the old front pair
those days are sadly diminishing because of the power of the midfield of the top teams and if you do n't match that up it is very difficult to win games so that kind of combination is not a popular in the premier league as it used to be
â the style you have with zaha and yannick bolasie out wide it can provide a nice force for us and we have a very experienced striker in glenn murray who is looking to profit and that is their job , to put balls in the box
â crystal palace travel to stoke on saturday and have put on free coach travel for fans making the trip
the crystal palace have sold out their allocation of 2,900 tickets and alan pardew hopes the traveling fans will be able to make themselves heard at a traditionally noisy britannia stadium
crystal palace manager alan pardew salutes the selhurst park home fans after the win over qpr despite being eight points clear of the bottom three , alan pardew does not want anyone at the club to become complacent
he added : â we just hope they make a lot of noise , we 'll need them , we can not afford to relax , the second year in the top flight is always more difficult after you have survived a promotion year
â we know it is going to be tight to stay up again , but there is an extra air of confidence in the club after our recent wins , but seven days is a long time in football and we still have work to do
â alan pardew will check on the fitness of zaha and jason puncheon ahead of saturday 's trip to stoke after both picked up knocks against qpr last weekend .
