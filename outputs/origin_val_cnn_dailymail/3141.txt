newcastle united will be forced to use janmaat as an emergency centre - back in their next three matches despite the holland international admitting â â i âve never played there in my life â
the magpies have left themselves desperately short of defensive cover and , with steven taylor and paul dummett sidelined because of injury until the summer and skipper coloccini suspended , only williamson remains as a recognised central defender
newcastle united - who sold defenders mapou yanga-mbiwa and davide santon in the january window - failed in their bid to overturn coloccini âs red card from sunday âs 3 - 0 defeat at everton
janmaat is set for a spell at centre back following the fa 's decision to reject coloccini 's appeal the argentine was dismissed following a lunge on aaron lennon and will now serve a three - game ban
that rules him out of the tyne-wear derby at sunderland on easter sunday , as well as testing fixtures with arsenal and liverpool
it means right - back janmaat is set to partner williamson , but the 25 - year - old said : â if the team needs me there , i am confident i can do well there , even though i have not played as a central defender in the whole of my career
the newcastle united captain ( left ) was sent off for a dangerous tackle on aaron lennon on sunday â i will play in the middle of the defence if i am asked to do so , although it is not really my position
â it is not really as though i have ambitions to stay there , but we all know what the situation is at the moment and if i have to play there , i will
â the second half at everton was the first time i have played there so it is not something i know all that well
â the dutch international has been one of newcastle united 's most consistent performers so far this season
