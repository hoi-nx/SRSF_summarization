villa has graced the grandest stages of them all
world cup and champions league triumphs sit proudly on a superb cv
his spell at new york city fc may not be on the same level , yet the unbridled joy displayed at creating history with the new mls side âs first ever goal on the hallowed turf of yankee stadium was there for all to see
it was his presence which attracted a healthy and encouraging 43,507 here
and it was his typically busy display which ultimately was the difference
villa fires past bobby shuttleworth to score the first goal for new york city fc at yankee stadium the spaniard finished off a neatly - worked move with ned grabavoy to put the hosts on the way to a well - deserved victory yankee stadium played host to a whole new ball game as the mls expansion franchise won its first game in the big apple a packed yankee stadium watches as the two teams battle it out in the second game of the mls season new york : saunders ; williams ( facey 79 ) , hernandez , chris wingert , brovsky ; velasquez ( khiry shelton 66 ) , diskerud , jacobsen , ned grabavoy ; villa , nemec ( mullins 84 )
booked : chris wingert , williams goals : villa 19 , mullins 84 new england : shuttleworth ; alston ( barnes 59 ) , farrell , jose goncalves , tierney ; kobayashi , dorman ; rowe , nguyen ( caldwell 71 ) , fagundez ; agueldo ( davies 65 )
booked : agueldo , dorman sent off : goncalves attendance : 43,507 his first goal since moving to the us this summer was a clinically taken strike on 20 minutes and , on another day and without the seemingly impenetrable bobby shuttleworth standing in his way , the 33 year - old would have bagged a hatful
yet he still managed to retain his composure and cross for mullins on 84 minutes to nab the killer second and prove the former barcelona and atletico madrid striker brings much more to the table than just lightning quick reactions in front of goal
of course , it 's not all about one man and , in truth , city âs newest fledgling entity were decent value after securing their first win against a new england side who were harshly forced to play with 10 for the last 23 minutes following jose goncalves â straight red card
city have aggressively marketed their brand new adventure in manhattan , hammering home the fact that they â and not the new jersey based red bulls â are the true team of new york
the numbers swilling around outside before kick - off suggested it had done the trick
yankee stadium , no matter how resplendent an arena it is , will never be a perfect fit for the beautiful game
yet new york city fc and their freshly conceived , enthusiastic fanbase did their best to make it feel like home
the makeshift pitch which has already got the baseball players fretting ahead of their season opener in three weeks time , was certainly passable
there was a decent atmosphere though here in the bronx
the rarest of sightings in this vast country - away fans - played their part too
it was hard to gauge exactly at what stage jason kreis â side were at in the opening day draw with fellow newcomers orlando city
they are still in an embryonic stage after just a handful of games together
new york city fc celebrate after mullins wrapped up the first victory of the mls season for the team villa leaps into the air after scoring the first goal of his mls career in front of an adoring crowd villa shakes hands with new york mayor bill deblasio as chris wingert looks on before the victory at yankee stadium new york city fc fans wait for the start of the game during the inaugural game of the mls franchise new england , who were denied the title last season by robbie keane âs la galaxy , would certainly provide a much clearer yardstick
villa buzzed around early on , teeing up frontman adam nemec who shot straight at revolution keeper bobby shuttleworth before the spanish was ace was denied on 15 minutes following a typical jinking run into the box
the former barcelona man was , by far and away , the most potent player on the pitch
and on 19 minutes came his first mls strike
it was a classic villa moment
a sweet exchange with ned grabavoy opened up the visitor âs backline and as villa bore down on goal , there was only going to be one outcome
his finish was assured , calm and clinical
when frank lampard arrives in the summer , the added quality will ensure city will be hugely competitive
yet in the land of single entity leagues and the desperation of ensuring level playing fields , weaknesses in other parts of the pitch are harder to plug
the home side âs defence looked particularly creaky with new england knocking on the door with increasing regularity following villa âs opener
the best chances fell to juan agudelo , the first on 36 minutes when a weak flick dribbled the wrong side of the post before he somehow headed straight at josh saunders from four yards out
an new york fan sports a frank lampard shirt ahead of the englishman 's arrival in new york at the end of the premier league season fans flock to the stadium in the bronx to watch new york 's latest sporting team compete against the new england fans wait to enter yankee stadium for the mls match between the two teams in the first home game for new york city fc three minutes after the re-start , the game should have been dead and buried
villa was set free , twice he failed to apply the finishing touch
it was fast becoming the shuttleworth and villa show - the new england keeper brilliantly tipping over a fierce 12 yard volley from the spanish superstar
the visitors were soon reduced to ten men on 67 minutes after centre - half jose goncalves was handed a straight red for hauling down substitute khiry shelton
yes , he was the last man
yet contact was minimal if that
it was left to that man villa though to have the final say when he crossed for mullins to make it two
villa has wasted no time in making an impact
he is already the big man in the big apple .
