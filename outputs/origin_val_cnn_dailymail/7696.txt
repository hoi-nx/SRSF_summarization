as pr blunders go it was hardly on the scale of gerald ratner 's infamous quip that one of his jewellery company 's products was ' c * * * '
but manchester city 's decision to extend lampard 's contract to the end of the season , rather than allowing him to move as planned to sister club new york city , left many questioning whether the powers - that - be in abu dhabi believed their new american operation was an inferior product
some in the big apple , who had already shelled out for season tickets , demanded refunds
in the home of broadway , others rather dramatically branded it a betrayal
lampard ( left ) closes down james morrison during manchester city 's 3 - 0 win over west brom lampard reacts after he hit the post during his side 's victory over the west brom at the etihad on saturday it was not , and the reality is that spain legend david villa was always a bigger draw in a city with a huge hispanic population
regardless , some may now be questioning the logic of keeping lampard in manchester , rather than manhattan , after the media storm the decision triggered
since january 1 , when the former chelsea man was expected to cross the atlantic , manchester city have encountered choppy waters
knocked out the fa cup they are now six points behind lampard 's former club , out of the fa cup and out of the champions league
not that he can be blamed for that
lampard has made 30 appearances for manchester city this season , but many of those have been cameos from the bench at 36 , lampard was never intended to be a regular starter , but given the ferocity of the response to his extended stay , manchester city fans may have expected more
pellegrini has given the former england man just 190 out of 990 premier league minutes following the turn of the year
in that period he has scored once , in a 3 - 2 victory over sunderland on new year 's day
should manchester city stage a miraculous defence of their title , that may prove key but it is unlikely
even with yaya toure absent in africa and his remaining midfielders looking like they were operating on separate continents the chilean was reluctant to turn to a man who has won more premier league trophies than the club he plays for
former spain and barcelona star david villa ( centre ) in action for new york city lampard , belatedly , did start saturday 's 3 - 0 stroll over west brom
he was steady and kept things ticking over before being substituted with the game long won
as pellegrini pointed out after that canter , the season is not over and there are still 24 points to play for as they head into the final furlong
however , if the decision to keep lampard here is to be justified he must turn more often to his thoroughbred .
