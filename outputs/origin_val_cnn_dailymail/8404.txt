halsey , the controversial former elite referee who lost his role as a regular bt sport pundit following premier league upset , has had an invitation to speak to a regional referees association withdrawn following intervention from the highest level
halsey was due to address the sheffield referee association on how he beat cancer to continue as a top referee
but an objection from an unnamed football figure led to the ra persuading their sheffield branch to embarrassingly cancel the appearance of halsey , who was giving his services free
the email from laura ritchie , chairwoman of the ra , read : â a senior member of the footballing world has brought it to our attention that you have invited halsey to be a guest speaker
it is a worry that a figure who is being very negative about top - flight referees wo nât send the right message to members
it may be perceived ra agree with his viewpoint
â halsey was invited to speak to the sheffield referee association regarding his battle against cancer however his planned appearance was cancelled after an unnamed football figure objected against the talk sheffield management then informed members : â there was an agreement that we cancel halsey after pressure from the national ra and the wider football world
â and the sheffield response to the ra said : â our irritation at having been placed in this position can not be underestimated
are we saying that as referees , we are above criticism ? â fa refs chief david elleray is president of the ra but on monday night he denied any involvement
however , halsey âs strong views on a decline in refereeing standards is certainly born out by the widespread furore around their performances this season
bbc rugby co-commentator brian moore reacted to his perceived â snub â at being one of the few tv pundits not included in itv âs giant world cup team by tweeting â i âve been told i âm too controversial for tv world cup coverage
too c * * * , i could take but controversial , b * * * * * * *
â however , it was nât itv who told brian moore he is controversial
the network , happy to employ the more volatile roy keane as a football pundit , have had no contact with brian moore
bbc rugby co-commentator brian moore vented his frustration at being snubbed by itv on twitter van praag bid blunder fifa presidential candidate michael van praag says , if elected , he intends to cut costs â something he âs never heard mentioned during six years of dealings with zurich , where figures are just plucked out of the air , he claimed
van praag will also declare what his fifa salary would be and wants to know what blatter has been paid
the dutch football leader , who has a budget of â¬ 400,000 from his national association for his campaign , is also concerned at the way fox tv were given the rights to the world cup in 2026 without a tender to end their resistance to a world cup in qatar
yet all van praag âs good intentions are undone by his open offer to blatter , who he says could carry on as a working honorary president concentrating on the goal project funding
meanwhile , portuguese contender luis figo is rich enough to fund his own campaign but this most charismatic of footballers could nât be more dull when he talks fifa politics
michael van praag , pictured with louis van gaal in 2014 , has said he will cut costs if he replaces blatter blatter is said to be so confident of winning a fifth term that he feels no need to mount any form of campaign and is addressing the uefa on tuesday in his fifa president âs slot rather than as a candidate
however , the 79 - year - old is understood to have engaged well - known swiss pr figure stohlker to advise him on his election strategy
stohlker , former tv journalist and political author , founded his own pr and consulting business in 1982 and is a long - time friend of blatter âs
fifa president blatter is confident of beating off competition from the likes of van praag to win a fifth term for all the shenanigans , scandals and infighting at the fa over the years , at least there âs never been such an unseemly episode as germany âs fifa executive member theo zwanziger reporting his successor as german federation president wolfgang niersbach to fifa âs ethics committee over alleged pay and pension irregularities
it is a blatant attempt by theo zwanziger to stop wolfgang niersbach taking his executive seat
fifa have cleared wolfgang niersbach and uefa general secretary gianni infantino said theo zwanziger âs claims had been fully rejected , adding : â it âs all a bit embarrassing for him and sad for german football
â wolfgang niersbach said : â i have not heard of a similar story anywhere in football
