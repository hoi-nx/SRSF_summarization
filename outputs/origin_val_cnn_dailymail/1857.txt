hart , who saved messi 's penalty in the first leg , said : ' we 've gone out to a magnificent side , but that 's the second time in two years which is disappointing for us
' they 're going to get a lot of plaudits for how they play , they 've got fantastic players , but we had a big chance , we hung on in there and we had a big chance but unfortunately we could n't take it
' i suppose you could say they had a chance to finish us off in the first game and they did n't take it but that 's how football goes
' hart made a string of impressive saves , especially in the second half , and midfielder milner was full of praise for his team - mate 's performance

he gave us that chance with the penalty ( in the first leg )
they could have been out of sight by then and he gave us a chance to still be in it
' he was amazing tonight and deserves everything that gets said about him
' hart added : ' it was busy
i just tried to smother them as best i could because i know full well they 're thinking they 've got to pass at all times
' i tried to rush him for the goal , i thought he took it well
from there my job is to rush them , with quality players it 's difficult to do sometimes , and i got a bit of luck on my side
' i do n't know how neymar 's stayed out in the first minute but that 's football
we did our best to stay in it and were just unfortunate tonight
