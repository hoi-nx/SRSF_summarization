williams , 34 , had pip implants fitted in 2008 , and plans to claim compensation thousands of uk women who had pip breast implants could be in line for payouts totalling up to half a billion pounds
there are believed to be more than 50,000 women in the uk who were fitted with the implants before the product was discovered to contain a high level of industrial silicone
but the deadline for compensation expires today - and there are still many uk women who do nât realise they can claim compensation for their implants
the scandal came to light after doctors found unexpectedly high numbers of women were suffering from ruptured implants
the stanton fisher group , a firm of uk financial claims specialists representing pip patients from all over the world , has said the total payouts for uk women could total as much as half a billion pounds
it is welcome news for the thousands of women in the uk who faced trauma , financial costs and further operations to have their pip implants removed
and they are urging women to come forward to start their claims as soon as possible , before the deadline at the end of today
it comes after many women have been unsuccessfully trying to gain compensation from their individual private clinics and banks
solicitor hulme from stanton fisher , said : â anyone living in the uk should consider making a claim now
â women who have had pip implants simply need to prove they had the surgery undertaken
there is no requirement for the implants to have ruptured or still be in place to pursue a claim
â the victims of the pip breast implant scandal have been cruelly and criminally treated and we are determined to get justice and financial compensation for them
â pip implants were sold widely across the world from the mid 1990 âs
there was uproar when it emerged in 2010 that the french firm poly implant prothese ( pip ) had been manufacturing the implants using industrial grade silicone intended for use in mattresses
jean claud mas , the founder of poly implant prothese was jailed for four years last year for fraud at a court in french
but in november 2013 , a court in toulon , french , ruled that the german safety company tuv rheinland , which had certified the silicone implants , is liable for having failed to perform its control properly and has to compensate the victims whilst pip is in bankruptcy
a law firm is urging women to come forward to start their claims as soon as possible , as the deadline for claiming payments is at the end of today french lawyer olivier aumaitre , who is working closely with stanton fisher , discovered that the german company had repeatedly certified the pip implants and he took them to the court where the ruling was made
the ruling , which is now pending before a court of appeal , could make tuv rheinland liable to pay compensation to up to 300,000 women around the world - including women in the uk
mr hulme added : ' this has opened the door for the thousands of women in the uk and ireland who had pip implants to take action in the french courts
â we are pursuing an advance payment of unto Â£ 2500 for each of our clients , prior to their final compensation award being decided by the court , which could be up to Â£ 10,000
it is welcome news for thousands of women in the uk who suffered anxiety , depression and worry after the scandal came to light
