â it is hard to understand why the us finds the transfer to the britain almost impossible , â he said
â the question we are all asking is why is shaker aamer still being detained
is it that shaker aamer knows too much about what happened in guantanamo bay and would ensure the truth comes out if he was released
â or is it because he can bear witness not just to the us involvement in illegal criminal torture but also to britain involvement ? â he called for a â full and thorough independent inquiry â into the detainee âs evidence about alleged collusion in torture by britain intelligence officers
in a statement , mr mcdonnell said : â it is absolutely unacceptable that an innocent man continues to be to be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in absolute denial of his human rights remains in guantanamo bay

us intelligence agents insisted he financed al qaeda and was
he was sent to guantanamo bay in february 2002
