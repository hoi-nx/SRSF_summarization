as thousands queued up outside leicester cathedral yesterday to catch a glimpse of richard iii 's coffin , businesses in the city also appeared to be doing their utmost to get into the commemorative spirit
with the city centre swamped by visitors from as far and wide as the u.s and russia , shopkeepers in leicester have been selling off a raft of merchandise - including t - shirts , ice creams and even haircuts - in an apparent bid to cash in on the historic five - day event
from fridge magnets emblazoned with the king 's signature , to a Â£ 14.95 richard iii - embossed silk ties , the souvenir frenzy has been led by the official visitor centre , a former school located next to the spot where the former monarch 's remains were found in 2012
gelato village , an italian ice - cream shop which has extended opening hours until 11pm for the reinterment , has also made a special richard iii rose blossom and fruits of the forest - flavoured ice cream , a move which yesterday prompted the business 's ' busiest day ever '
the apparent commercialism of the event is sure to prompt outcry from those who have already criticised the king 's reburial
louise hollingsworth , who was part of a campaign group which had argued that he should have been buried in york , has already called the event an ' undignified , money - grabbing pantomime ' , while one twitter user wrote : ' # richardiii no dignity in death , no dignity in burial , and after being hawked around like the fa cup on a bus , no dignity in reburial either
' another person used twitter to mock the hullabaloo , tweeting : ' is there a # richardiii christmas decoration on sale ? i ca n't find it

but the pivot for the change in public opinion - which sparked a huge debate over the whereabouts of his reinterment - was in 2012 , when the monarch 's bones were discovered beneath a social services parking bay in central leicester
when dna tests , bone analysis and other scientific scrutiny established that the skeleton belonged to the king , archaeologists revealed that he had been given a hasty burial , with a grave so short the king 's head was propped up against its side
visitors will be able to visit the coffin between 9am and 12.30pm today , and then between 2pm and 5pm and 7.15pm and 9pm
tomorrow , viewing will take place between 9am and 12.30pm .
