dhaka , bangladesh bangladesh authorities say they have arrested the prime suspect in the murder of united states blogger roy who was hacked to death on a dhaka street last week
the person , rahman , had called for roy 's death in numerous facebook posts , according to roy 's parents
and within minutes after the thursday attack , rahman posted photos of the crime scene , said col. ziaul ahsan of bangladesh 's elite anti-crime unit , the rapid action battalion
in a facebook comment last year , rahman allegedly wrote , " roy lives in united states
so it 's not possible to kill him now
but when he returns home , he will be killed then
" in an earlier post , the same person wrote , " it 's a bengali muslims holy duty to kill roy
" extremists resented roy for openly and regularly criticizing religion in his blog
they threatened to kill him if he came home from the united states to visit
as usual , roy defied the threats and departed his home in suburban atlanta for dhaka , where he appeared at a speaking engagement about his latest books -- one of them titled " the virus of faith
" he has written seven books in all
roy was killed thursday as he walked back from a book fair with his wife
assailants plunged machetes and knives into roy and his wife , killing him and leaving her bloodied and missing a finger
witnesses said no one came to the couple 's aid as they were hacked down
rahman , the man in custody , also allegedly posted threats against the owner of the online bookstore , rokomari.com , forcing it to stop selling roy 's books
and last year , he was detained -- then released -- for comments he allegedly made in support of the death of another blogger , haider
like roy , haider too was hacked to death
he too had written critically about religion on his blog
