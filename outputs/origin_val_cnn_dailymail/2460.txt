a british solicitor has claimed that â jihadi john â gatecrashed her daughter âs wedding
according to court documents , mohammed emwazi used 22 - year - old morgan âs wedding in 2011 as cover for a secret meeting with members of his terror network
but ms morgan âs mother , nuth , 53 , suggested mohammed emwazi was nât invited
she said : â i âve no connection to him and my daughter has no connection to him
the veiled woman at ms nuth 's home ( left ) declined to speak to reporters over claims mohammed emwazi ( right ) attended the solicitor 's daughter 's wedding as a cover for a terror meeting in 2011 ' it âs absolute rubbish
none of my family have anything to do with him
â according to the court papers , her daughter âs wedding to an egypt muslim was held at the home of the wife of a terror suspect referred to as â ce â , who once spent time at an al qaeda training camp
mohammed emwazi turned up with another man , mekki , and is then thought to have discussed â extremist activity â with ce. the papers state that ms nuth â describes as â absurd â the suggestion that extremist activity was discussed â
however they note that â ms nuth left shortly after the arrival of mekki and mohammed emwazi at about 10pm and so can not speak of what occurred after her departure â
later that year all three men were described in court as supplying funds and equipment to somalian terrorists
ms nuth told the mail on sunday : â i do nât want to get drawn into all this
what was said in court was confidential
as a solicitor i do not want to compromise my position
â it is believed her daughter , now 26 , is living at ms nuth âs london home , having spent time in egypt
yesterday a woman in a niqab arrived at the flat but declined to speak to a reporter
it also emerged last night that mohammed emwazi may have collected money for jihad from friends and neighbours in london , under the pretence of fundraising for syria
the 26 - year - old entered syria some time after the wedding where he has taken on the role as the masked executioner of its propaganda videos the jihadi was raised in north west london ( above ) with by his kuwaiti father and alongside siblings
