rounding up sheep successfully is a difficult task usually reserved for experienced shepherds and their sheepdog
but it looks like there might be something else working the fields in the future
new footage shows how a drone can herd around 120 sheep across a field and through a narrow gateway within minutes
the drone remains behind them at all times and makes them walk forward as a group until they get to a gate
it even shows off its manoeuvrability by flying close to the ground before zooming into the sky to get the last three animals into the next field
the footage - titled ' shep the drone , worlds first drone sheepdog ' ( sic ) - has already been viewed more than 82,000 times on youtube
as the farmer and photographer stand in one corner of the field the drone does all of the hard work , forcing the sheep towards the gate the sheep stay in a group while the drone flies behind them
the animals appear to react to the slight movement of the nifty aircraft the footage of the sheep was captured by paul brennan , who specialises in aerial photography for farmers the final sheep make their way through the gate ( left ) and into the next field minutes after the drone ( stock image right ) started its work it was captured by paul brennan , who specialises in aerial photography for farmers
his company skyfly photography wrote on facebook yesterday : ' delighted to say that " shep the drone " has just broken the 50,000 views barrier on youtube in less than 48 hours
' it added : ' a picture tells a thousand words and there is nothing quite so beautiful as an birds - eye view
' the number of drones operating in british airspace is increasing and they are used for a range of tasks including surveillance , photography and defence
they can be controlled by a pilot on the ground or used to undertake ' pre-planned ' trips .
