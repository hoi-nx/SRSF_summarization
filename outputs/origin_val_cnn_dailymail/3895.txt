hundreds of hens who lay unique pastel - colored eggs have been stolen from a family 's farm just weeks before easter
leuschen , who hand - raised the chickens on buddy 's farm in sonoma county , california , said he has been left emotionally and financially devastated by the loss - which he predicts will cost him around $ 22,000
' i miss my birds , ' he told the press democrat
' they 're so beautiful ! ' leuschen , who runs the farm with his wife and their two young sons , said he first noticed about half of his 600 to 700 ' easter egger ' hens were missing after returning to work following a brief illness
the targeted hens are known for laying colorful eggs which are particularly in demand around easter special : the ' easter egger ' chickens lay pink , blue , green and cream eggs ( pictured ) but owner leuschen said his family is now collecting just half of the eggs they would expect to have right now he told ktvu that the birds apparently vanished overnight from their coop , which he had always left closed but unlocked until the theft
it came just days after he noticed the coop was wide open and that some of the birds were outside , so he told his sons , aged 11 and 13 , to make sure they secured the door behind them
' for someone to come in and do that is a violation
it 's a huge violation , ' he told ktvu
' i 'm angry they 're taking the food right out of my family 's mouth , but i ca n't carry that anger
' he believes someone who knows the farm and knows chickens could be responsible , and that too many chickens have disappeared for an animal to be responsible , the press democrat reported
heartbroken : leuschen , pictured , runs the sonoma county farm with his wife , sons and brother - in - law and said he is emotionally and financially devastated by the disappearance of the chickens loved : he said he misses his beautiful easter egger chickens , all of whom he hand - reared from birth leuschen , who started the business a few years ago , said he is down around $ 75 a day in earnings from eggs and about $ 100 invested in each chicken , for a total of more than $ 22,000
easter egger are a mix of different breeds
their eggs may be blue , green , pink , brown , olive or cream
each hen will give lay just one egg color - they do not each lay a variety
egg colors occur when pigments are deposited as an egg moves through the hen 's oviduct
the exact color then hen will lay is determined by their genetics
for example , some breeds lay only white eggs ( leghorns ) or brown eggs ( orpingtons ) , while others lay more colorful eggs
an olive egger lays green eggs because it is the result of cross breeding between brown - and blue - laying chickens
likewise , because easter egger are a hybrid breed , a coop will lay a mixture of colors
quite often the color of the chicken 's earlobe ( the flappy piece of skin at the side of their heads ) will indicate the colors of their eggs
if a chicken has white earlobes , it will likely lay white eggs , while if the earlobe is pink , the eggs will likely be non-white
despite the different colors on the shell , the eggs inside are the same and there are no major differences in flavor
instead , flavor is determined by the chicken 's diet
easter egger are kept for their eggs but are not large enough to be used for meat
the birds , which he and his family incubated inside their home before hand - rearing , are a mixture of heritage and standard breeds , which allows for their colorful eggs
the demand for the eggs , which are blue , pink , grey , green and olive , is particularly high ahead of easter , now less that two weeks away , the family said
leuschen explained they should be collecting around 30 dozen eggs a day , and would expect to be getting as many as 50 dozen a day in a month - but right now they 're only collected 21 dozen
' alas , someone else will reap the benefit of our time , money and efforts , ' he wrote on facebook as he appealed for friends and customers to share his story
but he added that they are committed to rebuilding their business and is offering a $ 250 reward for information leading to their return
in the meantime , he is padlocking the birds ' enclosure and asking friends and neighbors to be on the lookout for anyone with new colorful eggs in the area
' maybe you have seen someone selling laying hens on craigslist or facebook , ' he wrote in his facebook plea
' maybe the guy down the street just put up a sign
' perhaps your local feed store has some really beautiful chickens that do n't fit any variety specifically
they could be our birds
' he asked for anyone with information about the whereabouts of his stolen hens to contact the sonoma county sheriff 's office , which said it is unclear if it will investigate
