several business owners in austin were horrified this week to find large stickers bearing the message ' exclusively for white people ' affixed to their storefronts
as thousands partied and pitched new technologies at the sxsw , staff at an austin bakery were wondering who would want to announce to their customers ' maximum of 5 colored customers / colored boh staff accepted
' ' as a multiracial family with a multiracial staff , there 's nothing funny about this â¦ it 's sick , ' olivia guerra o'neal , owner of sugar mama 's bakeshop , told kxan
' we are disgusted by this act of vandalism and cowardice
' shocking : these stickers appeared overnight between tuesday and wednesday on the storefronts of at least six austin , texas businesses the stickers also appeared during the night between tuesday and wednesday on a mexican restaurant , clothing store , bicycle shop and others
the glossy stickers also feature what looks like an official city of austin seal and the message ' sponsored by the city of austin contemporary partition and restoration program
' but austin mayor steve adler wants the world to know his city had absolutely nothing to do with the stickers
' this is an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city
austin condemns this type of hurtful behavior
our city is a place where respect for all people is a part of our spirit and soul
we will keep it that way , ' steve adler said in a statement
while austin appears to agree the stickers are wholly inappropriate , no one is sure what their point is
video from keye-tv ' some jokes are not funny ' : business owners ca n't agree on what the stickers mean -- is it racist or a message about gentrification ? -- but all say they 're inappropriate ' appalling and offensive display of ignorance ' : the stickers said they were sponsored by austin 's ' contemporary partition and restoration program ' along with an official - looking city seal , which led the mayor to condemn the confusing prank some say the creator is attempting to make a statement
' people are saying that this may be an attempt at satire , or a statement about gentrification , â said o'neal said
others say it could be an offensive joke
' some jokes are not funny , ' texas house of representatives member dawnna duke wrote in a facebook post along with a photo of a sticker affixed to clothing store rare trends
' if this is a joke at all , it is tasteless ... i will be damned if this will occur in my house district â¦ in this historical black community or any community
' regardless of its intent , sugar mama 's employees have labeled it a hate crime
' today we were the victim of what i consider to be a hate crime against our family and staff at our eastside location , â reads a post on the bakery 's instagram feed
' our business was built on family and love and we will let that shine on
