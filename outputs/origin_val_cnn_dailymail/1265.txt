an adorable video of a concerned baby crying along with his father is bound to warm the cockles of your heart
featured in the clip , the baby named aris initially appears quite content as he sits on his dad âs lap and listens along to him addressing the camera
his dad states : â i just had to get it on video so you could see that aris is a natural sweetheart
â so far so good : aris initially appears quite content sitting on his dad 's lap , listening to him address the camera adding : â anytime he sees me crying it makes him want to cry too
â getting the experiment under way , the dad mimics the sound of a cry and immediately the six - month - old baby reacts with a look of concern while shaking his head
gazing up at his dad , aris then proceeds to cry along with him until the pair stop in unison as if nothing ever happened
mimicking tears , the dad influences the concerned six - month - old to cry along with him and produce actual tears testing his theory twice more , the dad once again turns on the taps and without fail little aris scrunches up his face and begins bawling
looking at his dad for reassurance , aris momentarily settles down before crying with his dad for one last time
shedding visible tears , aris â wailing becomes increasingly louder until his dad puts a halt on the proceedings and gives his son a kiss
the adorable video , which appears to have been staged at the family âs house , was filmed in kaufman county , texas
panic over : the baby settles back down as quickly as he started crying and is consoled with a kiss from his dad
