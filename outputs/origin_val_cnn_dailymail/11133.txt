google unveiled plans earlier this year for a cancer - detecting wristband that it was testing using moulds of human skin
now the firm has been awarded a patent for the technology that will ' automatically modify or destroy targets in the blood that have an adverse health effect '
according to the files , the wearable could target these cells using an ' external energy source ' such as ultrasound or radio frequencies
google 's patent explained its wearable ( illustrated ) could target any substances or objects that , when present in the blood , may affect the health of a wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels
this could include infrared signals , a radio - frequency or acoustic pulse , or a magnetic field ' a number of scientific methods have been developed to examine physiological conditions of a person by detecting and measuring one or more analytes [ chemicals ] in a person 's blood , ' explained the nanoparticle phoresis patent
' analytes could ... be indicative of a medical condition or health of the person ' and could include ' enzymes , hormones , proteins , cells or other substances
' google continued that its wearable would target any substances or objects that , when present in the blood , may affect the health of wearer by transmitting energy into the vessels
in an interview with bloomberg , google ventures ' president maris recently said he thinks it 's possible to live to 500 years old
and this will be helped by medical breakthroughs as well as a rise in biomechanics
he has already ploughed money into genetics firms and cancer diagnostic startups and said : ' we have the tools in the life sciences to achieve anything that you have the audacity to envision
i just hope to live long enough not to die
' mr maris founded google ventures in 2009 and oversees all of the fund âs global activities
elsewhere he has develop google âs september calico project
calico is a research and development company set up in 2013 by google and apple to tackle ' ageing and associated diseases
' google co-founder larry page said the project would focus on ' health , wellbeing and longevity ' and last september calico partnered with abbvie to open a research centre into neurodegeneration and cancer
this could include infrared signals , a radio - frequency or acoustic pulse , or a magnetic field
the energy used would depend on what the band is targeting , but it would be designed to alter the chemical composition of the analyte
' in one relevant example , certain proteins have been implicated as a partial cause of parkinson ; the development of parkinson may be prevented or retarded by providing particles functionalized with a bioreceptor that will selectively bind to this target ' continued the files
' these bound particles may then be used , in combination with a wearable device as described above , to modify or destroy the target protein
' as a further example , the target could be cancer cells ; by selectively targeting and then modifying or destroying the cancer cells , the spread of cancer may be diminished
' in january , conrad , head of life sciences unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells
after travelling around the body , these nanoparticles would then be collected , using a magnet , to reveal what cells they encountered
the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up , for example , allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body
the system relies on light emitted from the cells as a result of the nanoparticles , so scientists must understand how light passes through skin
so google started making skin
it would scan the blood for so - called analytes , or chemicals , in the blood such as the presence of ' enzymes , hormones , proteins , cells or other substances
' google said it could target certain proteins that have been implicated as a partial cause of parkinson , for example , or cancer cells in january , google 's life sciences lab unveiled plans for a wristband which would work with nanoparticles that circulate around the body looking for cells
to assist with their research , the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors ( pictured ) to assist with their research , the scientists made moulds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors
as the wearable is still in the early stages of development , google x is working to determine what defines a ' healthy ' person
they are monitoring 175 healthy volunteers to frequently collect physiological information
mr conrad admitted that people may find it ' weird ' having particles constantly tracking the cells in their body
after travelling around the body , these nanoparticles would then be collected , using a magnet , to reveal what cells they encountered
the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up , for example , allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body ' it 's way weirder to have cancer cells floating through your body that are constantly trying to kill you , ' mr conrad continued
he said that the google x team is trying to change medicine from being episodic and reactive to being proactive and preventive
' we 're making good progress but the journey is long and hard , he said
' so i think we will get there and i hope it 's years , not decades
