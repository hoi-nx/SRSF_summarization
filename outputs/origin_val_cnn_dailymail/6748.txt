a little girl has been cured of a rare a condition that made milk shoot out of her nose
georgie yorke was born with birth defects that meant her oesophagus was not connected to her stomach
this meant that whenever her mother tried to feed her with a bottle , milk would come back out of her nose and mouth
georgie yorke was rushed to surgery to undergo an operation to connect the oesophagus to the trachea just 22 hours after she was born on july 10 2014
georgie yorke , now eight months , was born with birth defects meaning whenever she was fed , milk shot back out of her nose and mouth
she is pictured with parents ross , 25 and vic yorke georgie yorke was born with the birth defects oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - meaning her oesophagus was not connected to her stomach georgie yorke was rushed for an operation to correct the defects when she was just two days old
she has since had five more operations to further correct the problem and rid her of scar tissue georgie yorke , aged eight months , is now out of hospital and finally able to enjoy life at home with parents ross , 25 , and vic yorke , 19 , from consett , county durham
ms ross , a travel agent , said : ' when georgie yorke was born , i was rushed in for an emergency c - section , so i did n't get to hold her in the beginning
' when i finally tried to feed her that night , the milk was coming out of her nose and mouth and going everywhere - almost like when you drink a fizzy drink and it shoots out of your nose
' i thought it might have been me - and because i was trying to feed her on my own
' but when the midwife came around to help me , she realised something was wrong as the milk was going down the wrong tube and georgie yorke 's breathing was n't right
' she was taken away from me a few times in the night and taken into special care
it was n't until they x-rayed her that i was told what was wrong
' oesophageal atresia is a rare birth defect that affects the baby 's oesophagus , the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach
in oesophageal atresia , the upper part of the oesophagus does n't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach
it ends in a pouch , which means food can not reach the stomach
it often happens together with another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula , which is a connection between the upper part of the oesophagus and the windpipe ( trachea )
this causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach , and stomach acid to pass into the lungs
it 's not known why the defect develops , but it 's more likely to happen in babies of mothers who had too much amniotic fluid in pregnancy ( polyhydramnios )
the defect means the baby wo n't be able to swallow and digest food safely , or at all
oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula are thought to affect about one in 2,500 - 3,500 births
if they 're not corrected soon after birth , the pouch at the end of the oesophagus may fill with food and saliva , which can overflow into the baby 's windpipe
source : nhs choices doctors diagnosed georgie yorke with oesophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula - two conditions that tend to occur together
in oesophageal atresia , the upper part of the oesophagus does n't connect with the lower oesophagus and stomach
it ends in a pouch , which means food can not reach the stomach
the condition often occurs alongside another birth defect called a tracheoesophageal fistula
this is where the upper part of the oesophagus and the windpipe ( trachea ) are connected , rater than being separate
this causes air to pass from the windpipe to the oesophagus and stomach , and stomach acid to pass into the lungs
georgie yorke was kept in surgery for five hours and spent six days in intensive care at the great north childrens ' hospital , newcastle
ms ross said : ' i was shocked to see her go straight into surgery , but i did n't really know what to think at first
' all i could think when i saw her lying there was that i wished it could have been me
' i could n't wait for the three of us to get home together , so it was n't a nice feeling to know that we could n't even put the banners up at home to welcome the baby
' since the initial surgery , georgie yorke has had a further five operations to correct her tubes and scar tissue
she will have to undergo further operations , but is currently developing well
ms ross said : ' we 've had major setbacks and she 's been so poorly but she 's such a bright and bubbly little thing
georgie yorke is now at home enjoying time with her family
her mother said : ' we 've had major setbacks and she 's been so poorly but she 's such a bright and bubbly little thing.she does everything a normal baby would do ' ' georgie yorke is a lovely baby
she 's so bright and clever
she does everything a normal baby would do
' she loves peekaboo and is full of smiles
' bruce jaffray , consultant paediatric surgeon at the great north childrens ' hospital , said : ' a tracheoesophageal fistula is an abnormality with the oesophagus which develops incorrectly - essentially leading to two blind endings to the oesophagus , the lower ending of which stopping at the windpipe
' patients undergo surgery whereby the two ends are stitched together and usually do well after that
any additional medical conditions diagnosed are unrelated
' when baby 's first attempt at feeding is met with coughing and spluttering , nurses pass a tube down the nose and into the stomach and perform an x-ray
' if the tube gets stuck in the chest as opposed to reaching the stomach , a tracheoesophageal fistula is diagnosed
