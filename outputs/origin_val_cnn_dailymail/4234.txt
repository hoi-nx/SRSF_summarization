obama today took a chance to boast about healthcare reform to a group of six - year - old girls - though admitted that obamacare is not as impressive as a device for turning the pages of a book
the president , put on the spot by a crowd of girl scouts to name something he 'd come up with to match their device , plumped for his much - touted healthcare reforms
obama , who was touring exhibits at the annual white house , made the jokey exchange before pledging $ 240million in federal dollars to boost the study of science and technology
the girls , all aged six , are members of a girl scout troop in tulsa , oklahoma , and developed their contraption to help those who are paralyzed or arthritic read more easily
when the commander - in - chief asked how they had come up with the device , one answered that ' a brain - storming session ' was the answer , then asked whether he had any to his name
obama conceded : ' i have had a couple of brain - storming sessions , but i did n't come up with anything this good
' announcement : obama also used the annual fair , held at the white house , to announce $ 240million of funding for science , technology engineering and math whizzes and bangs : the commander - in - chife marveled at the devices on display , including this robot built by sergio corral ( left ) and isela martinez ( center ) from phoenix , arizona ' see , you guys are already better brain - stormers than i am
' the persistent girl scout followed up her question , asking : ' what did you come up with ? ' he replied : ' i mean , i came up with things like , you know , health care
' it turned out ok , but it started off with some prototypes
' his flagship health legislation is five years old today
the girls were among 35 young science fair winners who came to the white house to show off their inventions , which ranged from spinal implants to computer password technology
favorites : obama lingered at the display by the so - called ' supergirl ' team , who had made their invention partly out of lego learning : corine peifer , from wallenpaupack , pennsylvania , shows obama how to make waves to illustrate her solution to generate electricity from docks bobbing in the water he later announced the hefty new government investment into so - called stem subjects , an acronym for science , technology , engineering and math. the pledges the president announced include a $ 150million philanthropic effort to encourage promising early - career scientists to stay on track and a $ 90million campaign to expand stem opportunities to underrepresented youth , such as minorities and girls
altogether , the new stem commitments have brought total financial and material support for these programs to $ 1billion
' it 's not enough for our country just to be proud of you
we 've got to support you , ' obama said later , addressing students and scientists in the white house east room
talking it up : the president said that his educate to innovate strategy is a way to ' support ' science rather than just be ' proud ' of it more than 100 colleges and universities have committed to training 20,000 engineers , and a coalition of ceos has promised to expand high - quality stem education programs to an additional 1.5million students this year
obama launched ' educate to innovate ' , his effort to encourage the study of science , technology , engineering and math , in 2009
obama said the fair is one of the most fun events held annually at the white house
he said : ' every year i walk out smarter than when i walked in '
another one to try out : obama is pictured here testing a modified wheelchair made by kaitlin reed , 16 , of dover , massachusetts and mohammed sayed , 16 , of cambridge , who is originally from afghanistan obama 's science adviser , john holdren , joined the president during the tour of the displays , introducing himself to the young inventors and researches
he said : ' amazing - these kids are so much more advanced than when i was in school
' at each of the 12 display stations , obama quizzed the participants about their projects
at one , anvita gupta , a 17 - year - old from scottsdale , arizona , described the special algorithm she had devised to identify other medical applications for existing drugs
obama turned to the group of reporters and photographers trailing him
' just saying , i do n't know what you all have been doing - this is what she 's been doing
