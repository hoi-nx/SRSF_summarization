a woman desperate to become a mother has been refused ivf treatment on the nhs because her partner already has a child from a previous relationship
now , a furious mcphillips , 23 , from rainham in kent , is taking her case to the european court of human rights in an attempt to force the government to act
according to ms mcphillips , she never sees her boyfriend 's daughter and insists that having a child is a ' basic human right for a woman '
charlotte mcphillips , 23 , pictured with partner robert was told as a teenager she would be unable to conceive naturally because she has polycystic ovary syndrome ' i hardly have any contact with eleanor , ' she says of partner howard 's four - year - old daughter
' she lives with her mum and she never stays with us so i do n't understand the decision
' when i was 17 i was told i would get two free goes on the nhs and i was n't told then that anything would get in the way of that
' i have already been told that parliament ca n't do anything and i am willing to go to the european court of human rights to get it
' it is a basic human right for a woman to have a child and be a mother
even though i love my stepdaughter , i want a baby of my own
' ms mcphillips ' problems began when she was a teenager and was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome which caused small cysts to grow on her ovaries , preventing her from ovulating
the couple read their letter informing them they can not have ivf on the nhs as robert already has a child promised ivf by medics at the time , ms mcphillips thought nothing more of it until , three years after meeting mr howard , 24 , she decided she wanted to start a family and requested an appointment
but the couple were left devastated when nhs officials told them they were not eligible for ivf because robert has a child , four - year - old eleanor , from a previous relationship
dr peter green , chief officer for the medway clinical commissioning group , sent a letter telling the couple they were n't eligible
' the eligibility criteria states that where either partner in a couple has a living son or daughter from their relationship or any previous relationship , funding is not available through any of the ccgs in the nhs across kent and medway , ' he wrote
' this is irrespective of the age or place of abode of their son or daughter
' the barmaid said she intends to fight the decision denying her the chance to be a mother ' it is heart - breaking that i ca n't have children and it was even more devastating when i was told i could n't have ivf , ' says ms mcphillips
' time is running out because i may not be able to produce eggs in a few years ' time so i am more determined than ever to get this sorted
' ' it could mean a bitter double whammy as it means my mum may never be a grandmother
why am i being penalised for a condition that i have through no fault of my own ? ' mr howard , who recently left his job as a supermarket manager , added : ' i have been with charlotte for three years and we want a baby together
' they have considered going private but say they are unable to afford the Â£ 5,000 fee since mr howard is unemployed and ms mcphillips works as a barmaid
their local conservative mp rehman chishti is supporting them and has said he will back her battle if she takes it to europe
guidelines published by the nice ( nice ) state all women under 40 should have access to free ivf
they should be referred after two years of trying to get pregnant but if they can only have a baby using the treatment they can start immediately
however the guidelines are voluntary and many local nhs trusts impose their own conditions in a bid to cut costs .
