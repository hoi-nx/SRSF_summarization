one in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in , with more than Â£ 12 billion needed to sort out repairs , a new study has revealed
emergency funding by the government after last year 's floods helped drive a 33 % increase in pothole repairs , but there has been no reduction in the amount needed to bring the network in england and wales up to scratch , said a report
the asphalt industry alliance ( aia ) said Â£ 12.16billion was needed to get the local road network back into ' reasonable ' condition , adding that money spent on filling 2.7 million potholes in the past year had been ' wasted '
the estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years , said the report
one in six roads are still in poor condition despite more potholes being filled in , with more than Â£ 12 billion needed to sort out repairs , a new study has revealed the annual survey also found a ' dramatic ' increase in the amount paid in compensation to motorists in england , doubling to more than Â£ 20 million outside london
the staffing costs to local authorities for processing claims increased to almost Â£ 18 million , equivalent to 225 hours per month per authority , it was found
alan mackenzie , chairman of the aia , said : ' the government 's emergency funding for pothole and flood repair following last year 's wet winter has clearly contributed to the trends reported in this year 's survey
' essentially , the money spent on filling the 2.7 million potholes reported is wasted - it is inefficient and short term in its effectiveness
' so , while we understand that the department for transport is promoting permanent repairs , the point remains that money would be better spent preventing potholes forming in the first place
' the Â£ 6 billion of funding pledged between 2015 and 2021 is welcome , and hopefully will be confirmed by an incoming government
but the truth is that although it sounds like a big investment , it will only be enough for local authorities to tread water and it will do nothing to tackle the backlog or prevent continuing deterioration
' peter box , transport spokesman at the local government association , said : ' councils fixed more potholes than ever before last year - one every 15 seconds - despite spiralling multi-million pound compensation costs and funding cuts
the estimated time it would take to clear the backlog of repairs has increased by a year to 13 years , a new report claims ' it is hugely frustrating yet unsurprising that , despite our best efforts , we have not been able to make a dent in the Â£ 12 billion roads repair backlog
patching up our crumbling road network is simply not the answer to tackle the roads crisis we face as a country
' councils need billions , not millions , to bring our roads up to scratch
every mile of motorways and trunk roads will receive Â£ 1.4 million funding over the next six years compared with Â£ 31,000 per mile for local roads
this makes little sense given the government 's own traffic projections predict an increase in local traffic of more than 40 % by 2040
' professor stephen glaister , director of the rac foundation , said : ' back in 2010 the top transport priority amongst voters was filling in the potholes
five years later and an rac foundation poll shows fixing our roads and pavements remains the public 's number one concern
' the extra chunks of cash spent on road maintenance over the last parliament have been welcome but with a record number of cars on the road , rising traffic volume and routine resurfacing work taking place only half as frequently as in the 1980s , this issue is unlikely to slip far down the list of things people want ministers to tackle
