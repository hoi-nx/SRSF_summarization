dozens of mps are claiming taxpayer - funded expenses to rent homes or stay in hotel rooms in london while letting out property they own nearby , it emerged last night
the 46 mps have claimed more than Â£ 1.3million for rent or hotel rooms at the same time as receiving rent from properties that were often purchased and refurbished from taxpayers â money
an investigation by channel 4 news found 25 conservatives , 14 labour and four liberal democrat had benefited from the expenses loophole , which is not against parliamentary rules

former chairman of the committee for standards in public life sir alistair graham said mps should be seen to be upholding the spirit of the rules that state they must not â exploit the system for personal financial advantage â
former chairman of the committee for standards in public life sir alistair graham ( above ) said mps should be seen to be upholding the spirit of the rules that state they must not â exploit the system for personal financial advantage â he told channel 4 news : â it âs not always just about exactly what the rules say
it is about you taking personal responsibility that public funds are used in a proper and appropriate way that your constituents would be comfortable with
â i âm sure we will hear all sorts of sob stories about why it âs justifiable to do what they âve done
â but they must know in their heart of hearts that the public will see this as mps on the make
â last night mps said the rules banning mortgage claims had forced them to let out their second home to be able to afford the mortgage payments
sir nick harvey said : â this situation is not of the mps â choosing
mps have been obliged to let out their own properties since 2010 because the new rules say they can not claim mortgage interest â only rent
â letting income covers the mortgage and other outgoings and is of course taxed
it is not mps â fault that the rules compel them to rent a separate flat to live in
â mr macneil blamed the current rules and said mps should be allowed to claim for flats they own , as they did in the past
mr lansley said he normally commuted to parliament from his home in south cambridgeshire and only stayed overnight in london hotel about once a month
he told channel 4 news : â my expense claims have always sought to minimise the cost to the taxpayer
my relatively few overnight stays in london ( barely once a month in the last year ) meant that my expenses claims would be lower for occasional hotel stays in sitting weeks than for the costs of maintaining a flat in westminster
â mr bryant and mr murphy did not respond to a request for comment .
