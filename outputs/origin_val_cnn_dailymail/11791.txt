emma purnell , 30 , is going to be living in a human - sized rabbit hutch for 48 hours money raised from sponsorship of the event will go to the fat fluffs and the windwhistle warren rabbit rescues
speaking to mailonline about her decision to go through with the task , she said : ' i have been hoping to do something for both these local charities for a while
' while i was brainstorming , i came up with the idea of being that rabbit that we see in practice and in rescues that is treated as we used to believe was ok
' the rabbits that live in a small hutch with no space or stimulation , with a poor diet which often leads to dental problems , no company of fellow rabbits , generally just a bit of a miserable existence
' emma purnell in her ' rabbit hutch ' emma purnell believes that the problem lies in the fact that people do n't understand how to care for rabbits properly
emma with one of her pet rabbits she said : ' i was hoping that doing it this way is just silly enough to grab a bit of attention and make a few people think if there were some little changes they could make to improve life for their pet just a little
' rabbits are such misunderstood pets - they are still often seen as a child first pet , but they are really not suitable for this , they are nervous creatures that can , if handled improperly , even fracture their own spine
' they need space , time , another bonded rabbit for company , vaccinations and , when ill , can go downhill very quickly
' rabbits are the third most popular pet in the uk , yet the most neglected - which is not simply due to cruelty , it is often a misunderstanding of their needs and they are really beloved pets
' if this can make a couple of people think it is worth it to me
