' we are studying what caused the fish deaths , but we have n't figured it out yet
we suspect that it could be due to new factors that were not present before
' the tank 's lighting and other factors that could have caused stress among the fish , or the presence of a poisonous substance in the water are being considered
the 2,200 - tonne tank once housed 69 bluefin tuna , 52 eastern little tuna and 38 oriental bonito
in december , the tank 's population suddenly started plunging with just 30 fish alive by mid-january
researchers are trying to find out the cause of their deaths , and one option being explored is poisoning ' the second last one that just died apparently crashed into the acrylic wall twice , ' the spokesman added
' it suffered a broken backbone , which was unfortunate but not very unusual for tuna kept in a tank
' an earlier examination has found some sort of virus among some of the dead fish , but it was n't the kind that is usually fatal in fish farms
