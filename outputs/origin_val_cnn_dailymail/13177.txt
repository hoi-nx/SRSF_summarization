the bbc 's director - general , hall , has allegedly received death threats days after " top gear " host jeremy clarkson was dropped
" police in westminster are investigating an allegation of threats to kill , " the metropolitan police confirmed to cnn in a statement
the allegation was reported to the police on wednesday
" the threat was made by email , " the police added
" the content of the message suggests ( it was sent ) from outside the british
" the alleged threats come shortly after hall took the decision to dismiss popular presenter jeremy clarkson from " top gear , " one of the most - watched television shows in the world
" top gear " was suspended march 10 after an apparent altercation between the motor show host and producer oisin tymon on march 4
at the time , the bbc issued a statement saying that there had been a " fracas " between the host and a bbc producer
more than 1 million fans of jeremy clarkson and " top gear " signed a petition to reinstate the host
the document was delivered to the bbc 's headquarters by a fan dressed as the " stig " -- the incognito racing car test - driver who appeared regularly on the show -- driving an armored tank
on wednesday , the british broadcaster announced that it would not be renewing jeremy clarkson 's contract as host of " top gear " after he allegedly busted his producer 's lip and hurled verbal abuse at him
hall issued a statement online following the decision
" it is with great regret that i have told jeremy clarkson today that the bbc will not be renewing his contract , " he announced
" it is not a decision i have taken lightly
i have done so only after a very careful consideration of the facts and after personally meeting both jeremy clarkson and oisin tymon
" placing emphasis on jeremy clarkson 's legacy , hall added that the bbc will be looking into a new host for " top gear " in 2016
" this will be a big challenge and there is no point in pretending otherwise , " he said
inquiries are ongoing to establish where the threat came from , the police said
a representative for the bbc told cnn : " we do n't comment on security matters
