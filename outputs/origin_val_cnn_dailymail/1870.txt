former swansea and england under 20 goalkeeping coach , adrian tucker , also joins advocaat 's backroom staff

sportsmail understands that west ham manager sam allardyce and real madrid assistant paul clement are at the top of the club 's shortlist to take charge beyond this season
paul clement , in particular , fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club , where sporting director congerton has control over transfers
paul clement and congerton know each other from their time at chelsea and the real no 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in england
meanwhile , it is congerton 's contacts book which has led to a deal with advocaat
former chelsea sporting director frank arnesen â who worked with advocaat at psv eindhoven and congerton at stamford bridge and then hamburg â recommended him for the role
advocaat could land up to Â£ 500,000 if the sunderland â one point above the drop zone â avoid relegation ' this is something i always wanted to do , the premier league

' as a manager that is where you want to work , that has such a pulling power
' saturday , west ham awaits
and then there 's the international break
and then â the derby with newcastle
that is really something to look forward to because believe me , this just is a very big club
