he was born a healthy little boy , with his whole life ahead of him
but at the age of just one , zach parnaby 's bright future was cruelly cast into doubt when doctors diagnosed the toddler with a crippling genetic disease
just after christmas zach parnaby 's parents lindsey and ben parnaby were given the devastating news that their son has a rare illness , which had been unwittingly passed on in their genes
the condition , known as krabbe , which affects one in 100,000 people across the world , will cause zach parnaby to gradually lose the ability to walk , talk , see or hear
his doctors have warned his parents , he is unlikely to live beyond his fourth birthday
when he was just 17 months old , doctors diagnosed zach parnaby , pictured with his mother lindsey , with the rare genetic krabbes disease , which will gradually cause the toddler to lose the ability to walk and talk doctors have warned zach parnaby 's parents lindsey and ben parnaby that their son is unlikely to see his fourth birthday
determined he will make the most of the time he has left , the couple have compiled a bucket wishlist on the 16 - point list was a wish to sit in a fire engine and meet the cartoon character fireman sam
as well as the cartoon characters and other entries including swimming in the sea and taking a boat trip , the family are aiming to help find a cure for the genetic illness now , the couple have vowed to raise awareness of their son 's disease , while also compiling a bucket list of things the 20 - month - old must see and do in the time he has left
so far , zach parnaby has already met his favourite cartoon character , fireman sam , and taken a ride on thomas the tank engine
he has enjoyed a boat trip , been given his own pet puppy and met some of the newcastle squad
but his parents , both 29 , from spennymoor in county durham , are determined he will fulfil the list
still to come is a swim in the sea , riding a bike , meeting a real bear as well as mickey mouse , and feel a waterfall wash over his head
zach parnaby 's parent 's lindsey and ben parnaby have compiled a 16 - strong wishlist for their son , of things for him to do and see in the time he has left

take a ride on thomas the tank engine - booked for march 22 but , while each entry on the list has its own importance for zach parnaby and his parents , their top wish is to help find a cure for krabbes disease
mr and mrs parnaby argue it is vital that all children are screened for the disease at birth
they have so far raised a staggering Â£ 4,000 to help their son realise the bucket list
mrs parnaby said : ' the things we are generally doing with zach parnaby are n't out of the ordinary
' they are things we would have done with him anyway while he was growing up , but we just have to squeeze it in to such a short space of time while he is aware
' we want him to enjoy it and be aware of what is happening
' sadly his symptoms have been very rapid
we do n't know what the future looks like but we have to take each day as it comes
' every little cold could be it , we just do n't know
' we know zach parnaby is not going to see four , five or six
' the doctors told us he may have between 18 months and four years
' she said the family are hoping to visit london soon to tick off more of zach parnaby 's list , including a ride on a red open top bus and the london eye as well as meeting disney star mickey mouse and characters from frozen
' we want him to ride a bike , it 's something every child should do , but the practicalities of all of the wishes are quite difficult , ' mrs parnaby added
' i do n't know if we can find a bike sit that will work for him
' the 29 - year - old said if her son had been screened for krabbes disease with a pin - prick test at birth , it may have allowed time for a potentially life - saving bone marrow transplant
doctors have told the family the procedure was too expensive
mrs parnaby first noticed her son was struggling to walk last november , and took him to see a gp
they suspected zach parnaby was going through a ' phase ' , but a month later his condition appeared to be deteriorating and reaching a the point where he could only crawl
in their quest to do as much as they can with their son , mr and mrs parnaby organised for him to meet some of the newcastle squad
they are pictured here with attacking midfielder remy cabella zach parnaby , now 20 months , was also given the chance to meet steven taylor , left and jack colback , right mrs parnaby , said : ' sadly his symptoms have been very rapid
we do n't know what the future looks like but we have to take each day as it come ' his mother took him to darlington memorial hospital four times , before doctors ordered an mri scan
the toddler was referred to the royal victoria infirmary in newcastle , where on christmas eve a specialist revealed zach parnaby was seriously ill. krabbes disease is typically diagnosed in the first year of life
it is a genetic condition that causes patients to rapidly regress to a point where they have little to no brain function
those diagnosed with the condition rarely live beyond the age of two , many dying as a result of respiratory infection or brain fever
symptoms of krabbes disease include : in general , the earlier a child is diagnosed with the disease , the more rapid its progression
those who are first diagnosed at ages two to 14 will become severely incapacitated , and generally die by the age of two to seven

' i do n't know what was going through my head when the doctor told us on christmas eve , ' mrs parnaby said
' you just do n't eve expect to be told this when your son has been happy and healthy for 17 months
' if we had learned of this disease from an earlier point it would n't have been easier but it would not have been such a shock thinking everything was fine and normal for all that time
' she said up to the point where doctors diagnosed the disease , zach parnaby was a ' normal ' baby , going to play group three times a week
' he was such a clever and active baby , going to water babies till he was 14 months old , ' she added
' if we were given the option at birth to be screened and found out he had it then we would have had the option of a bone marrow transplant , which could have given him a normal life
' it 's too late now
' ' we had 17 months of thinking he was fine
it only takes a heel pin - prick test
' i asked why they do n't do it and they told me it was due to cost
cost does not come into it with the lives of children
' a fundraising page for zach parnaby reads : ' myself , ben parnaby and our family have made an agreement that zach parnaby 's life will continue as normal but in the short time that we may have we plan to achieve a lot , we have therefore created a bucket list for him that we hope people can support and assist us in achieving where possible
' there is no treatment for this disease however if diagnosed early then there are potentially life - saving options available to those children
we are told that zach parnaby 's symptoms are too progressed for this to be an options , however if detected early enough he may have been
