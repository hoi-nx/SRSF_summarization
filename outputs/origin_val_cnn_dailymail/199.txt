â she goes , â does this mean i 'm fat ? â and i said , â no , this does not mean you are fat , " â moss recounted

students at hillcrest elementary school in missouri recieved the notes last friday after being weighed in and measured by pe teachers body mass index is calculated by multiplying a person 's weight by 703 and dividing the result by the height
age and gender are factored in when determining bmi parameters
according to a chart included in the note from the school , a 7 - year - old girl 's healthy bmi should fall between 13.5 - 17.5
kylee 's index was 17.9
' they send home a piece of paper that says , " here is a box
your child does n't fit into it
here is what you should do to fit into the box , " ' her mother fumed
belton superintendent underwood said the letters are sent home to parents every year to promote a healthy lifestyle as part of a county - wide program called healthy hillcrest
underwood insisted that it was not the school 's intention to be malicious towards students
going forward , parents will be notified of the weigh - ins in advance and will get the chance to opt out .
