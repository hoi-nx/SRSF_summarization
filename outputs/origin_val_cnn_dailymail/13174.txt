the beauty of afghan -- a country blemished by wars , upheaval and the inhumane treatment of women by extremists -- has almost been forgotten by the world , and by many afghan themselves
in the last few decades , little attention has been paid to the other afghan : the sweet melodies , the kind people , and the beautiful land full of ancient wisdom and intersecting traditions
it would be irresponsible to solely focus on those positives while families are torn apart and the noise of war rings in people 's ears
generations of afghan have had their homes surrounded by battles and their lives punctuated by fear
afghan has been the largest refugee - producing country for 32 years
one out of every four refugees worldwide is afghan , according to the united nations
recently , i was watching an engrossing reality tv show featuring singers when a friend peered over my shoulder and asked about the program
i explained that it was " afghan star , " afghan 's answer to " american idol
" she was shocked by the set and the sophisticated arena stage where the stars were standing
that stage could easily have been in new york , los angeles , london or rome
this , i realized , is the afghan no one believes exists , or has ever existed
afghan has a rich tradition of music , poetry , and songs that have influenced its neighbors and any region of the world exposed to the silk road
after all , the famous sufi poet mawlana jalalideen rumi was from modern - day afghan
i grew up across the river in tajikistan , hearing afghan songs and tales of the parties in kabul , and learning about afghan singers , who are beloved across the region
i started watching " afghan star " last year after hearing about contestant dawood pazhman from afghan 's remote northeastern province of badakhshan , who traveled 16 hours ( sometime on foot ) to kabul to audition for the show
this year , another contestant , panj shanbe , also traveled from that remote region for a chance to audition
panj shanbe told tolo tv , which produces " afghan star , " that he did not have enough to eat and did n't have money for his commute to kabul
but he knew , he said , that in this day and age , in his new afghan , he can hope , dream , and make things happen
panj shanbe 's story was so compelling , i have tuned in every week for months now to see what he will sing and whether he will be safe from elimination
he is now among the top three contestants
as i watched every show , the beacon of hope of a new afghan became clear to me
young men and women auditioned , speaking of peace and coexistence , supporting one another outside of tribes or ethnic lines
they wanted what my own children want -- the freedom to explore being a young adult and to follow their dreams
this is the new afghan -- the struggles around poverty , religion and resilience are ever - present , but hope shines through in ways that make everyday life brighter
" afghan star " is a source of pride , happiness and escape for many afghan
when you talk to any afghan around the world , they know all about the contestants and the judges
they openly give their opinions and feel that they are a part of the process ; anyone around the world can vote via sms and call - ins
the panel of judges acts as an amplifier for the voices of the vulnerable , bringing attention to orphans , poverty , and the plight of women
this grounded attitude is meaningful because each one of the judges is a living legend in afghan -- superstars who also have their own war stories to tell
the stalwart female judge , shahla zaland , comes from a family of famous composers and singers
last year told the contestants a heart - wrenching story about her father 's life abroad as a refugee and how she believes her father " died of homesickness
" her presence on the panel of judges is a reminder that women are strong , women do not need to be veiled , and that female contestants who audition should be championed
there is a beacon of hope in just looking at how much the show has changed in its 10 seasons
during the first season , after years of the taliban 's ban on music , a female contestant performed without a hijab , resulting in death threats
the young woman had to go into hiding
this season , for international women 's day , the show celebrated afghan women
male contestants dedicated songs and presented flowers to the women , singing of the strength of afghan mothers
a young woman performed , dancing with her hair flowing freely
the show ended with a dedication to afghan poetess anjuman
anjuman studied literature in secret during the taliban occupation , becoming a well - known published poet before her husband killed her at age 25
he found her writings inappropriate and a stain on his honor
the beautiful irony is that anjuman 's words live on in books and songs today
shahla zaland performed a song that put anjuman 's poetry to music
wearing an afghan flag around her shoulders , her hair uncovered , she brought anjuman 's words to life : " i am not that weak willow tree that trembles with the wind
" i am an afghan woman and so i wail
" with three contestants left , the show will end friday night , appropriately on nawruz , the perisan new year celebrated in afghan , tajikistan and iran
though panj shanbe was my initial reason for watching the show , i will be happy no matter which contestant becomes the " afghan star
" the reality is we are all winners because of one tv program
those living as refugees and those living abroad by choice , away from the homeland , get a taste of the music and culture of their birth country , sparking renewed belief in the new afghan
and people in afghan are given glimpses of what the new afghan can look like -- a vision of young men and women free from war , who can pursue their dreams .
