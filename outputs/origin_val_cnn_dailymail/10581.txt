i 'll make my own , not yours
' he picked an egg up and threw it at me
i dodged that one and he threw another one at me and i dodged that one
he was quite angry and intense and i was disgusted and frightened
' he raised a glass tumbler up in the air and threw that at me
i moved and it hit the floor behind me then he raised up a second one and threw it at me and again i moved
' she added that he then smeared avocado on her coat before wrapping her in the duvet , leaving her unable to breathe as he throttled her neck
the defendant told the court that he had playfully ' lobbed ' two eggs towards miss cade to lighten the mood and she deliberately placed the two glasses on the floor before the police arrived
he added that miss cade had attacked him , leaving scratches on his neck as well as a cut and he wrapped her in the duvet to restrict her ' flailing ' arms

but miss johanna cade insisted she was ' petrified ' as ridge launched the attack
' i was petrified , stunned , frozen and started to cry and he went into my bedroom , got the duvet that was on my bed , and threw it over my head and body , ' she said
' i said : ' get off , i ca n't breathe
' he had hold of me by the arms and then i was dragged into the bedroom with the duvet over me and pinned to the bed , with hands i think it was , around my neck
' i could n't see anything and at first i was very frightened and tried moving , wriggling out and became quite panicked and i managed to get my arm out
' i reached up and i think i grabbed his ear
i hit the side of his face and made a scratch
i was frightened , i knew i had to get out from being suffocated and held by the throat
' miss johanna cade added : ' i remember feeling the blood drain from my body
i could feel myself shutting off and not being able to breathe at all
i felt very , very dizzy
' ridge eventually left when she threatened to call the police , and miss johanna cade added : ' i was sweating , so , so frightened
i 've never felt so vulnerable and fearful for my life

' last august , i was very ill with what turned out to be meningitis and ridge refused to take me to hospital
i begged him to take me to hospital

' he drove off and shouted out the window of his car : ' get the bus to hospital
' he was sentenced to 12 months ' probation and 100 hours of community service at wimbledon magistrates ' court ( pictured ) ridge told the court : ' it was a childish matter that should n't really have happened

i did not use any aggression and i did not raise my hands to her
' his lawyer , mr. david allman told the court yesterday : ' he 's been a professional member of the armed services since the age of eighteen and he 's currently intending to continue that career for at least nine years

' magistrate fiona abbott , making an indefinite restraining order prohibiting ridge from contacting miss cade , said he had subjected her to ' gratuitous degradation ' and ' mental anguish '
ms abbot said : ' it happened in the victim 's home and there was gratuitous degradation in the way you spoke to the victim , ' the compensation is for the bruising and mental anguish caused by this assault
