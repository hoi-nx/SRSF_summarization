one of the two oklahoma students expelled for their role in leading a racist chant has issued an apology , the dallas morning news reported
" i am deeply sorry for what i did saturday night
it was wrong and reckless
i made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same , " parker rice said in a statement printed by the newspaper
earlier tuesday , parker rice and another student were expelled over their alleged " leadership role " in a racist chant by sae fraternity members , a decision that president boren says speaks to his school 's " zero tolerance " policy for such " threatening racist behavior
" the decision comes two days after a video of frat members singing a racist song surfaced and hours after boren told cnn he would suspend or expel the group 's ringleaders if at all possible
" at this point , all i can do is be thoughtful and prayerful about my next steps , but i am also concerned about the fraternity friends still on campus
apparently , they are feeling unsafe and some have been harassed by others
hopefully , the university will protect them , " parker rice reportedly said in his apology
already , the greek letters sigma , alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house 's facade , the house will be closed as of midnight tuesday and the university will board up the windows , following up on separate decisions by the university and the sae national headquarters to shutter the oklahoma chapter , boren said
fraternity 's house mom sings n - word parker rice has not responded to multiple requests from cnn for comment
" for me , this is a devastating lesson and i am seeking guidance on how i can learn from this and make sure it never happens again
my goal for the long - term is to be a man who has the heart and the courage to reject racism wherever i see or experience it in the future , " his apology read
it was only a nine - second clip , but the backlash has been disastrous
party - bound students are seen on a bus clapping , pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , " there will never be a ni * * * * sae
you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me
there will never be a ni * * * * sae
" after the campus organization , unheard , and the school newspaper received the clip via anonymous messages and publicized it , the university and the fraternity 's national chapter acted swiftly to shutter the sae house in norman
boren promised the university 's affiliation with the fraternity was done
" i was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video , " said brad cohen , the fraternity 's national president
" sae is a diverse organization , and we have zero tolerance for racism or any bad behavior
" still , it could get worse
oklahoma may not be the only source of embarrassment for the fraternity
" several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders , and each of those instances will be investigated for further action , " sae said
it 's likely that if the university had n't acted , the justice department 's civil rights division could have stepped in , said arnwine , president and executive director of the lawyers ' committee for civil rights under law
title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 " prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , color , and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance , " according to the justice department
in this case , arnwine said , the university likely found that fraternity members appear not only to have discriminated in their membership -- and backed that discrimination with the threat of lynching -- but they 've also created a hostile environment
the university , she said , " would 've been compelled to do something to sanction and prevent this fraternity from engaging in racial discrimination
" arnwine said she was n't personally familiar with the school 's code of conduct , but she 'd be surprised if the fraternity members ' actions were n't in violation of university rules as well
all of these reasons are grounds to sanction the fraternity and expel specific members who were involved in the singing , she said
" a very important part of the lexicon of civil rights law is that you can not create a hostile environment where you make it so people of different races or religions or women feel they ca n't function at your institution without being subjected to unlawful discrimination , " she said
it 's unclear whether more students will be punished for the video , though boren has promised the saes wo n't return during his tenure if he can help it
" the house will be closed , and as far as i 'm concerned , they wo n't be back , " he said at a monday news conference
he later told cnn , " there seems to be a culture in some of these fraternities , and it just has to be snuffed out
" the decision to shutter the fraternity was an easy one for boren , he said
" if we 're ever going to snuff this out in the whole country , let alone on college campuses , we 're going to have to have zero tolerance , and we have to act right away , " said boren , a former oklahoma governor and u.s. senator
" this is not a place that wants racists or bigots on our campus or will tolerate it , so i think you have to send a very strong signal
" hundreds of students have protested the fraternity 's actions
some of them arrived monday morning on the campus ' north oval with tape over their mouths , while the oklahoma football team and coach bob stoops marched arm in arm across campus instead of practicing
the video infuriated oklahoma linebacker eric striker , who posted a profanity - laced video to social media
" i was angry and i was outraged , " striker said
" i apologize for the profanity , but i 'm not apologizing about how i felt , because that 's how i felt in my heart
" the fallout from the video also cost the football team a top recruit as offensive lineman jean delance said monday he was de-committing from the sooners and considering other teams
just as they protested loudly monday , students on tuesday were emphatic in expressing their relief and satisfaction that those allegedly responsible for leading the racist chant got their due
ross johnson , a senior studying drama and broadcast media , called the video embarrassing and unacceptable as he worried that it may be seen as a reflection on him in the future
" it sucks that i 'm graduating in may
i feel i am probably going to have to explain this when i move , " he said
" for people who do n't know the oklahoma , are n't part of the student body , it 's a black eye that does n't really deserve to be there
it 's a small group of people who were acting foolishly
" another student , junior jake hewitt , applauded the university and the fraternity 's national president for their handling of the incident
" i think it 's really good that the president is showing strong support for the students in the community here and saying , ' this is not ok
it 's not going to be acceptable on our campus
' it 's a good strong move , and i hope if they find out more , they do more , " he said
shortly after the expulsions were announced , senior humphrey , an american modern dance student , told cnn , " i think it 's rightfully so that they were ( kicked out )
... that needed to happen
it was n't fair ; it was n't right
i am , as most of the student body -- not just the american students -- we 're all disheartened by the situation
it 's just really hard to think that this is still going on today , and i 'm still deeply saddened
" he is still a " proud student , " he said , and he understands that the fraternity members in question represent " just some microbial infestation that 's on campus
it 's on every campus , it 's on every campus
it 's unfortunate that we have to be seen in that light
" asked what he could say to the fraternity members if given the chance , humphrey replied , " i pray for their humanity
i hope that they find maturity
... i wish them well
" unheard co-director chelsea davis said a racist mentality is not new to campus and is not confined to one fraternity
" unfortunately , it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen , but this is definitely not something that is brand - new
it 's not something that 's only seen within this one organization , " she said
sae is no stranger to scandal and sanctions davis said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend , as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved
" i was hurt that my fellow peers that i walk to class with every day , people that i see every day , could say such hateful things about me and my culture , about my friends , about my brothers and my sisters , " she said
james , who was a member of the frat between 2001 and 2005 , called the episode " devastating " -- not just because he 's an oklahoma alumnus but also because he 's american
james told cnn that there was " never an inkling of this song or a whisper of anything like this " when he lived in the house
he said members of his pledge class " would n't let that happen , " and if someone did dare to start such a chant they 'd swiftly speak out and shut it down " whether i was there or not
" since the video surfaced , james said he 's heard from many of his former fraternity brothers
like him , they 're offended and supportive of the decision to shutter the norman chapter
" i do n't know what happened to the culture of my home , " he said
" that is not my home
they are not my brothers
