stressed - out adults are shelling out thousands of dollars to unwind at the world 's first preschool for grown ups
the unique new yorkers - based program , known as preschool mastermind , was created by brooklyn resident joni , who holds weekly sessions in her apartment , where her adult attendees are able to finger paint , sing , snack and nap
and , despite the hefty price tag , the new concept has already attracted a variety of new yorkers 's professional elite , from photographers and authors to corporate lawyers , all of whom are eager to forget the stresses of their everyday life and spend some time connecting with their inner child
young at heart : joni 's preschool mastermind offers adults the chance to act like children arts and crafts : the preschool 's grown - up pupils are offered a variety of traditional activities , such as nap time , art class and slumber parties ' it is totally surreal , ' joni , who goes by the name of miss joni when with her ' pupils ' , said of the success of her preschool
' at the first class we had a nap time and all the grown ups laid down with their blankets and cuddled up in a ball
' i just looked around and thought this is absolutely crazy - i can not believe this is happening right now
' we do all sorts of activities from show - and - tell to dress - up ; we also play with play-doh have snack and nap time
' it really is a preschool for adults and everybody loves it
' the classes , which are priced between $ 333 and $ 999 for a month - long course , depending on what each adult is able to pay , have been taking place once a week throughout the month of march , and are scheduled during the evenings , so that any working adult participants are still able to attend , after completing a full day at the office
and , just like a traditional preschool , pupils get the chance to enjoy a class picture day , a slumber party and even a parents ' evening where they can show off their work
' it 's amazing , we say " it 's snack time " and everyone is like " yay , snack time " - then its nap time and everybody cuddles up together in a ball , ' joni added
' they totally get into it â it 's really great getting in there and making things with play-doh and loving it
' interestingly , the adults who attend joni 's classes confess that they feel no embarrassment about taking the opportunity to revert back to their childhood selves - and some even insist that the classes serve as a perfect way of inject more fun into their lives
put it all together : the classes are run by joni ( pictured ) , who goes by the name of miss joni during school hours daring duo : joni ( r ) and her assistant miss cancan ( l ) both have a background in early child development tuneful melody : the preschool program also includes music lessons for participants lawyer amanda devereux , 33 is one such participant , and admitted that she attends the classes because they provide her with a forum in which she can try new things and experience some of the fun she used to enjoy as a child
' i 'm a litigator , i deal with securities litigation and complex commercial cases , ' she explained
' this is definitely a contrast from my job but i would like to think i 'm a lot like i was when i was a child
' i still like to have fun and try new things
' my family are really into the idea and my work colleagues are not surprised i 've taken the class
' my mother just sent me a sweater for [ my ] class picture day with a note saying she used to pick out my clothes when i was four , so why not now ? ' along with lawyers from the corporate sector , the class also attracts mothers who want a break from their everyday obligations at home
sarah fader , 35 , an author and mother - of - two , explained that attending the quirky preschool allows her to embrace her own inner child , after spending a day looking after the needs of her own children at home
' being a mom and taking care of children is very taxing , ' she said
' i wanted to get back to that feeling of freedom and childlike fun and wonder that i used to have
' my children are seven and four and doing this grown up preschool reminds me of what it must be like as a child and helps me become a better parent
' free and fun : joni believes that the classes serve as a form of therapy for the adults artistic expression : the adult attendees are even allowed to finger paint on the walls secret success : joni believes that each pupil at her preschool needs the chance to escape from their adult obligations preschool mastermind creator joni believes that , for many of her participants , the classes serve as a form of therapy , allowing adults to deal with their real world problems from the point of view of their inner child
' my hope is that everyone who participates in preschool mastermind really comes out with a new sense of looking at the world with curiosity , with imagination and they are able to see things differently , ' she said
' part of this is finding the secret to getting adults to get out of their normal routine and start playing more
' with parents day currently on the horizon , joni added that all of her pupils are being encouraged to bring along their own parents , or their friends and family members , to share with them everything that they have achieved during their classes
' on parents day they will either have their parents or their friends here and they 'll get to show off in a big show - and - tell showcase , ' joni added
but while joni 's classes have gone down a storm with her pupils , they have also , perhaps unsurprisingly , garnered some unwanted attention from prospective pupils who have misunderstood exactly what the classes are about
' we have had some adults inquiring about changing diapers and if this is all about adult baby play - but that is not what this is , ' joni explained
' there is nothing sexual about this class it 's just fun
' there are some people that think this is a waste of time and a waste of money - they say they can finger paint on their own
' to them i would say go and finger paint on your own â i hope you do
freedom of expression : according to joni , the participants at her preschool are looking to find ' more magic in life ' select group : joni admitted that the classes have received some criticism , but added that she is aware her preschool program ' is not for everybody ' ' it 's fine that people criticise this â it 's not for everybody
' people come because they want to stop being so serious all the time and want to learn and have that fun come to them and they want to find more magic in life
' while the classes might seem like a bit of a folly for pupils , both joni , and her assistant miss cancan , boast an impressive background in early child development - and both have experience in preschool education
' something you may not know about me is that i have nearly half a degree in early childhood education , ' joni explains on her website
' i wanted to be a preschool teacher for many years , so that is what i originally went to college for ! i love preschoolers , and we connect on a serious level
' but then i realized that career path meant being chained to a classroom and told that my butt ca nât show â¦ so i switched to fashion merchandising
' she adds : ' [ miss cancan ] used to be a preschool teacher abroad and has fantastic insights , puns , a master âs in teaching , and imagination
' but despite her enthusiasm for the class and her pupils , joni remains realistic about how some people will view her grown up preschool
she added : ' for those of you who say this is a weird thing to do , i would say you are probably right
