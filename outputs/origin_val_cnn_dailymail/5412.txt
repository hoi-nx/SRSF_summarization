a man has been reunited with his wallet after it was found in a wall cavity more than 100 miles from his home - 35 years after it was stolen
steel , 45 , lost the brown leather purse aged 10 when a thief climbed into his caravan while he was on holiday in devon
but the square wallet - containing a photo of himself and a Â£ 1 note - turned up again during renovation work at a house in shaldon , devon , now owned by shelley davies
the wallet and photograph of 10 - year - old steel found in a wall cavity 35 years after it went missing builders found it in a wall space in this alleyway during renovations at a house in shaldon , devon builders found the wallet in a wall cavity and she set about finding the boy in the photograph
the picture of the schoolboy had ' steel ' written underneath and the address ' the lye , seend ' in wiltshire on the back
she posted the photo on the melksham town council 's facebook page and within hours mr steel 's friends recognised him and tracked him down
mr steel - who has now been reunited with his wallet - said : ' i was about 10 at the time on holiday in either dorset or devon staying with a friend and his family in a caravan
' my friend 's dad woke up at night just in time to see someone climbing out of the window
luckily mine was the only wallet taken
' shelley davies ( pictured ) said the return of the wallet illustrated the ' power of facebook ' mr steel , from neston , wiltshire , added : ' as for why i had a picture of myself in the wallet i 've no idea
not sure what to spend the Â£ 1 note on though ! ' the wallet was found by mrs shelley davies when builders pulled up wall boards to install a kitchen extension at her property earlier this month
her property backs onto the former caravan site and was once part of a pub. the deli owner posted a photo of the wallet and its contents on the melksham town facebook page and it was ' shared ' 50 times before mr steel was tracked down
her post said : ' we would love to return it - and maybe she 'd some light on how it managed to get wedged up behind the fascia boards of our ground floor extension which runs along an alleyway in a small south devon village
' guessing it was put there in 70 's looking at the photograph
' maybe the wallet was stolen and hidden there ( it contains a small amount of money ) or was it hidden there as a prank ? who knows ? ' speaking after it was handed back to mr steel , mrs shelley davies added : ' it goes to show the power of facebook
i think steel is quite amazed and really , really , pleased
' the sentimental value is huge , but the Â£ 1 note is n't going to get him very far these days
' he added : ' it 's nice to know that there are still good people around
