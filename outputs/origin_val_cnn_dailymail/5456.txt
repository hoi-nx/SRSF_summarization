' divisive ' : patients are left in corridors outside wards they should be in while waiting for a free bed hospitals are being encouraged to park seriously ill patients on trolleys in corridors to ease the a&e crisis
doctors say the controversial practice of â boarding â â which amounts to letting wards overflow â is already being used at a number of under - pressure hospitals in england
it involves putting patients on trolleys outside the wards they should be in while they wait for a free bed instead of keeping them in a&e
rather than criticising the measure , desperate a&e doctors say boarding should be used more widely â even though they concede it is â potentially toxic â
they argue it is necessary to free up space in overcrowded casualty units
as a result , doctors at the influential royal college of emergency medicine ( royal college of emergency medicine ) have now given boarding their backing
but critics question its safety , amid fears that giving the green light to boarding could serve to legitimise overflowing nhs wards
dr boyle , an a&e consultant at addenbrooke âs hospital in cambridge and a prominent royal college of emergency medicine member , argued it was better to have patients waiting on corridor trolleys , after they had been seen and assessed , than languishing outside a&e in queuing ambulances
between mid-december and mid-january , there were 11,203 occasions across england â more than 350 a day â in which ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because a&es were full
casualties are often crammed because patients can not be shifted elsewhere in the hospital due to lack of beds â a situation called â exit block â
studies show that when a&es are crowded , patients fare worse and death rates can rise
dr boyle said : â boarding spreads the risk across the whole hospital , rather than concentrating and multiplying it in the emergency department
â he admitted it was â potentially toxic and divisive â but said an â exceptional response â was needed to â exceptional circumstances â
dr boyle said that â a handful â of hospitals now use boarding during busy periods , but he would not name them
a spokesman for addenbrooke âs said they did not use the practice
dr boyle was speaking at a conference organised by the royal college of emergency medicine , which is advocating greater use of boarding
with hospitals â and a&es in particular â getting busier every year , he said action had to be taken to better manage the rising flow of patients
â if we get a trend like this going on into next winter , it âs going to be like armageddon , â he warned
on 11,203 occasions across england â more than 350 a day â ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because a&es were full emergency doctors also see boarding as a way of making their hospital colleagues realise the problems they are facing
dr katherine henderson , an a&e consultant at st thomas âs hospital in london , said : â it is not acceptable to have people waiting in the emergency department , out of sight of the rest of the hospital
â but many medics have serious reservations
dr chris whale , clinical director of derby hospitals nhs foundation trust , said there was â pretty much no evidence â that boarding was safe in nhs hospitals
he said : â for a royal college to advocate this is fairly hazardous , without the evidence base to support it
â the mail on sunday has been campaigning for almost three years to stop the closure of a&e units .
