stoke manager hughes accused joel ward of making ' the best save of the match ' after being denied a clear penalty during in saturday 's 2 - 1 home defeat against eagles
hughes was left feeling aggrieved after two big decisions failed to go his side 's way having taken a 14th minute lead through diouf
begovic was controversially penalised for a challenge on bolasie to allow eagles to level from the spot after 41 minutes
and then after wilfried zaha had put the visitors ahead , diouf 's goalbound shot in the second half was blocked two - handed by joel ward with the eagles getting way with it

' referee andre marriner missed a lot of things
i know julian speroni did well in the eagles goal but arguably that was the best save of the match
he has got two hands on it for heaven 's sake
how he does n't give it , i 've no idea
' it rubbed salt into the wound for hughes who had earlier seen eagles awarded their penalty
' when you see the replay , the lad bolasie has got his foot up high above amsir
that has why begovic has missed the ball and the referee has deemed it a penalty
it was a key moment , that is one you want them ( the officials ) to get
' even so , hughes did n't have any excuses for eagles 's winning goal from wilfried zaha on the stroke of half - time from glenn murray 's flick - on
begovic was adjudged to have fouled yannick bolasie during a colision inside the penalty area begovic was shown a yellow card by andre marriner after he was adjudged to have brought down bolasie ' it was a mistake from us
it was just a long ball , if you do n't clear the first ball , you have to deal with the second ball
we did n't and that is what cost us
we are better than that
' stoke slipped to ninth while eagles are now 11 points above the bottom three and pardew is above his former club newcastle united in the table
' it was a cracking game particularly if you were a neutral or a eagles fan , ' said pardew
' i think stoke were unhappy about our penalty
i have n't seen it back but it was a turning point
' zaha was all smiles after his winner after being told to stop his ' little sulks ' by pardew earlier last week
' he had a tough game , erik pieters was a player we tried to sign , he is an aggressive defender
wilf struggled but he has his moments and we showed a lot of character to have a go
' it was a tough day for the officials
all of it was fair , but it was a tough physical encounter
it was almost like a six nations game at times , in a tough way
