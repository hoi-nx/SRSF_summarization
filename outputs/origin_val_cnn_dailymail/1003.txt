the bbc has been accused of â exploitation â after it allowed an apparently drunk kennedy to take part in question time
the former lib dems leader , who has a history of problems with alcohol , slurred during the discussion show on thursday and appeared to be struggling to follow the arguments of other guests on the panel
he gave confused and disjointed answers , misinterpreted comments from fellow panellists and wagged his finger
mr kennedy resigned as party leader in 2006 after losing the support of mps in the wake of his public admission that he had a drink problem
he spoke about defence spending , predicted a minority government after the election and gave his views on intelligence gathering on terror suspects
he later shared an anecdote about jeremy clarkson throwing a biro at hislop , saying : ' i was there
i saw mr hislop give forth blood
' asked what he thought of jeremy clarkson 's suspension , he said : ' jeremy clarkson , the future , this is very politically incorrect of me , but , end of gone with the wind , frankly my dear , i do n't give a damn
' it is understood mr kennedy agreed to appear on the programme after being approached by the bbc directly and was not put forward as a spokesman by lib dem hq
a lib dems source said : â it was quite clear that he was not his usual self last night
â many of those watching the show took to twitter to suggest he was a poor choice of panellist by the programme 's makers
the children âs writer and poet michael rosen said : â i do nât think the bbc is safeguarding the safety of kennedy
â davey stewart tweeted : ' kennedy on # bbcqt was very uncomfortable viewing
a visibly broken soul ! shame on # bbc for allowing him onto the panel # dutyofcare ' a website user called fenwench added : ' kennedy has admitted to alcoholism
it was very clear to 1000s watching tonight that his fight is ongoing
' and robert richard wrote : ' irresponsible of the bbc to let kennedy on in that state
hope the man finds the help , care , and peace which he needs
' lib dems , lib dems mp for birmingham yardley , said the bbc had taken advantage of mr kennedy
â the bbc has been exploitative here , â he added
â what is the duty of care of the broadcaster to the people who appear on television ? is it to exploit them ? the bbc does nât seem to be setting out to inform people , but to entertain people
â my question is whether they provided booze in the green room [ where tv guests sit before appearances ]
â the appearance prompted concern among viewers as well as criticism of the bbc for inviting him to speak other twitter users rounded of those appearing to make fun of mr kennedy
former footballer stan collymore tweeted : ' seeing a lot of mocking towards kennedy
a good man who needs a little help
like many people do now and again
' and sarah raad added : i do n't know if kennedy is drunk or not but i wish some tweeters would have some bloody humanity & stop being so spiteful
