palace 's james mcarthur has been criticised by his manager pardew , who feels the midfielder should be ' embarrassed ' about diving in saturday 's 2 - 1 win at stoke
james mcarthur was booked early in the second half of the premier league clash at the britannia stadium for simulation having taken a tumble in the box
and pardew told sky sports ' goals on sunday programme : ' he dived
' he should be embarrassed
he 's a great professional and that 's unlike him
i was surprised but it shows what pressure does to players
palace midfielder james mcarthur ( left ) was booked for diving in the second - half against stoke pardew told sky sports ' goals on sunday programme that macarthur should feel ' embarrassed ' ' i have n't spoken to him about it but i do n't need to
he will see the replay and he will be embarrassed
' the win continued palace 's resurgence under pardew , who took over in january after leaving newcastle
having been in the relegation zone at that point , the palace are now 11 points clear of it and up to 11th place - one spot above newcastle
pardew had a rocky relationship with the tyneside club 's fans and when his newcastle side were beaten 1 - 0 at stoke in september , several of the away supporters held up signs calling for him to be sacked
however , following a much happier return to the potteries for the 53 - year - old on saturday , he insisted it was of no real significance to him that palace had leapfrogged newcastle in the table
and pardew also indicated he is not about to take anything for granted in terms of survival
palace - with 19 points from 10 league games under pardew so far - have a total of 36 , and he said : ' i 'm still thinking about another couple of points

' asked if there was any significance for him to going above newcastle , pardew said : ' no , not really
' the most important thing for me is that this club is within touching distance of premier league status for next year
' that is the only agenda i had when i arrived
we have done absolutely brilliantly
' it ( his previous visit to stoke ) was a difficult night , and i 've had them as a manager
you have to show your mettle
' but it was a different feeling on saturday because we are in great form
you want to have more of those in your career , and hopefully i can as i continue with palace

saturday 's result made it back - to - back defeats and manager hughes is keen for an impressive campaign not to fizzle out
he did , though , stress he thought the potters ' performance against palace had been an improvement on the previous weekend 's loss to west brom
' i thought performance-wise it was a marked difference from last week , which was pleasing , but we have n't got a positive result , ' hughes said
' we are disappointed - we made mistakes , so maybe we did n't do enough to win
' but we certainly deserved to take something out of it
' palace have climbed to 11th in the premier league table since pardew took over at the club in january
