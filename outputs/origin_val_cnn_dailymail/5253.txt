the u.s. government on thursday asked an appeals court to lift a temporary hold on president obama 's executive action to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation , arguing it ca n't wait for the judge who blocked the action to make a ruling on a similar request
justice department attorneys filed an emergency motion with the 5th circuit court of appeals in new orleans , louisiana , to lift a preliminary injunction issued last month by u.s. district judge hanen in brownsville , texas
the injunction had been issued on the request of a coalition of 26 states that filed a lawsuit to overturn obama 's immigration plan
off to court : president obama has responded to a texas judge 's injunction halting his immigration executive actions by demanding an appeals court overrule him here comes the judge : federal jurist hanen called the obama administration on the carpet and put the brakes on the president 's immigration plan the states , led by texas , argue that obama 's action was unconstitutional and would force them to invest more in law enforcement , health care and education
decision time : federal judge priscilla owen will likely make the call on whether to overturn hanen , her former law school classmate the injunction was intended to stall obama 's actions â which would spare from deportation as many as 5 million people who are in the u.s. illegally â while the lawsuit progresses through the courts
many republicans in congress and states led by republicans oppose the action , saying obama overstepped his authority as president
obama said he had to act because congress has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform
the justice department had asked hanen to lift the injunction while the case was appealed to the 5th circuit
but hanen put that request on hold pending a hearing on march 19 to review allegations the government misled him about the implementation of part of the immigration plan
in their 21 - page motion , justice department attorneys called the injunction ' unprecedented and wrong ' and argued lifting it was crucial as the order ' irreparably interferes with ( the homeland 's ) ability to protect the homeland and secure our borders
' justice department attorneys said that if the injunction is not lifted , it should at least apply either only to texas or to the 26 states that sued
' president obama 's unconstitutional use of executive power to accomplish what he could n't do in congress sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the fabric of our republic , ' texas attorney general paxton said in a statement responding to the justice department 's emergency motion
' the state of texas and a bipartisan coalition of 25 other states will continue to oppose the president 's unilateral and lawless actions , ' paxton added
a coalition of 14 states , including california and iowa , and the district of columbia filed a motion on thursday with the 5th circuit in support of lifting the injunction
they argued the immigration actions will benefit states through increased tax revenues and improved public safety
but texas has on its side a longer list : alabama , arizona , arkansas , florida , georgia , idaho , indiana , kansas , louisiana , maine , michigan , mississippi , montana , nebraska , nevada , north carolina , north dakota , ohio , oklahoma , south carolina , south dakota , tennessee , utah , west virginia and wisconsin
legal experts say the 5th circuit is known to be fairly conservative , and is likely to deny the justice department 's request
ultimately , it could end up before the u.s. supreme court
plaintiff : texas gov. greg abbott is spearheading the lawsuit along with 25 other governors anger : conservatives have bristled at the idea of the white house tossing border security overboard in favor of letting 5 million or more illegal immigrants stay at next week 's hearing , hanen was set to have justice department attorneys explain why the federal government granted three - year deportation reprieves as well as work permits to 100,000 individuals before hanen 's feb. 16 injunction
attorneys had previously said federal officials would n't accept such requests until feb. 18
the justice department has said the reprieves and work permits were granted under the 2012 daca program , known as daca , which was not halted by hanen 's injunction
daca protects young immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the u.s. illegally as children
in a separate court document filed with hanen 's court on thursday , the justice department said the acknowledgement that some individuals were granted reprieves under 2012 daca guidelines does ' not bear on the resolution ' of the pending request before the judge to lift the injunction
hanen 's injunction put on the hold an expansion of daca as well as a program that would extend deportation protections to parents of u.s. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years .
