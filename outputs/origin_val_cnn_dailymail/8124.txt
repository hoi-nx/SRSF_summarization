the most surprising thing about new york fashion week this year was n't what the models were wearing , but what they were drinking
the elixir on every fashionista 's lips was bone broth , which is being sold by the cup from a hip new manhattan shop
aficionados claim that it is rich in amino acids - the building blocks of protein - calcium and collagen , and that drinking it will do everything from warding off illnesses to curing joint pain , and giving you healthy skin , nails and hair
and at just 86 calories per cup , it 's a very slimming lunch option
it 's catching on here , too - celebrity chefs jasmine and melissa hemsley , whose healthy cookbook the art of eating well knocked jamie oliver and mary berry off the top of the amazon charts , advocate ladlefuls of bone broth in everything from stews to scrambled eggs
making it could n't be easier : simply add 2 - 3kg of bones from any beef , lamb or chicken carcass to a pan of water with a couple of onions , leeks , carrots and celery sticks
add a tablespoon of peppercorns , a bay leaf and a dash of cider vinegar and simmer for up to 24 hours
it may sound like old - fashioned stock , but fans claim bone broth is different because it simmers for eight hours longer , which helps break down the protein you get from the bones
but sian porter , spokesman for the british dietetic association , is n't convinced
' bone broth does contain nutrients , minerals and vitamins , but in pretty low quantities
you 'd get far more goodness from just eating meat
' however , she says , making your own stock is ' certainly better than buying it in a cube , as you can control what goes in it '
bone broths have traditionally been prescribed for colds , flu and digestive health , says laura tilt , a registered dietitian
' the main protein in bone broth is gelatine
gelatine supplements have been shown to improve pain and stiffness in osteoarthritis sufferers , but whether you get the same benefits from broth is unclear
' so is bone broth a magic bullet for superhuman health and supermodel looks ? probably not
but is it much better for you than a supermarket - bought stock cube ? almost certainly .
