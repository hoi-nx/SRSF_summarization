it will be months , or longer , before the causes behind tuesday 's crash of germanwings are known , but there are initial clues that aviation experts say will be the most important to investigators
speculation comes in the wake of any tragedy such as this , but experts say certain facts can be significant for those who want to know what happened
the most useful clues so far : one of the plane 's " black boxes " has been recovered , the france interior minister said
the data recorder will be the most useful in determining the cause of the crash
its contents are still unknown , but it is a good sign that it was found just hours after the crash
france 's aviation accident investigation bureau will examine the device immediately , the interior minister said
real - time flight data available to the public tells a key part of the story
according to online flight trackers , the germanwings plane had been flying at 38,000 feet when , about 30 minutes into the trip , it started descending
six minutes later , it was recorded at 24,000 feet -- a drop of 14,000 feet
it continued to descend after that -- it 's last recorded altitude was 11,400 feet
the rate of descent indicates that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , cnn aviation analyst schiavo said
if the engines had stalled , the plane would have crashed in less time , she said
departure : barcelona , spain , at 10:01 a.m. ( 26 minutes late ) destination : scheduled to land in dusseldorf , germany , at 11:39 a.m. passengers : 150 ( 144 passengers , six crew members ) airplane : airbus a320 ( twin - jet ) airline : germanwings ( budget airline owned by lufthansa ) flight distance : 726 miles last known tracking data : 10:38 a.m. last known speed : 480 mph last known altitude : 11,400 feet last known location : near digne-les-bains , france , in the alps sources : cnn and flightaware.com the initial data about the plane 's descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , schiavo said
a scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains , she said
another aviation analyst , soucie , said the quickness of the descent shows something went wrong , but also that the plane was not out of control
the plane was descending " faster than an elevator at that point
you 're feeling it down
it 's pulling you down , and you can sense that , " soucie said
a telling piece of data is that the plane maintained speed as it descended , he said
it could show that the pilot was aware that something was wrong and was controlling the speed as the plane went down
" it was a controlled descent , and there was something that had gone wrong that he had no control over or he would have controlled it , " soucie said
the data on air traffic accidents are clear : a majority of accidents happen upon takeoff or landing
according to the federal aviation administration , even though 83 % of a plane 's flight time is taken up with the climb , cruise and descent phases , less than 16 % of accidents happen during this period
soucie described the timing of the crash as an " anomalous thing that happened
" it is " incredibly rare to happen in the middle of the flight , " he said , meaning the pilot would have to act fast
contrary to some early reports , the french civil aviation authority told cnn that the crew of the germanwings plane did not issue a distress call
it was air traffic controllers who sent out a distress call after radio contact with the plane was lost
the lack of an emergency call can raise a red flag to a nonpilot
why would a pilot not alert someone that there is an emergency ? does it hint to an incursion in the cockpit or a pilot 's motives ? it might sound counterintuitive , but calling for help is not the first thing on a pilot 's checklist when things go wrong
soucie said the principle that a pilot follows during an emergency is this : aviate , navigate and communicate
in other words , before turning on a distress call or transponder , the pilot 's first concern is to fly the plane , and secondly , to find the safest option for a crash landing , if it comes to that
the germanwings pilot " was definitely aviating and navigating from what we can tell , " soucie said
the pilot was conceivably looking for a place to try to land , he said
a distress call -- had it happened -- could have signaled a different story
schiavo explained that there are codes that pilots have -- certain words that if uttered by the pilot indicate to air traffic controllers that there is a hijacking
the initial reports are that there was no hijack code transmitted from the plane
a big part of determining the cause of the crash will be whether such a code was sent or not
" i do n't think you 'd rule anything out at this point , " cnn aviation analyst o'brien said
" it 's not like it appears as if it was an in - flight breakup
so what was going on in the cockpit is what we 're going to be talking about in the coming days
" o'brien pointed out the known details of the crash -- a rapid descent , no radio call and a flight that continues into the mountains -- are not part of a " typical emergency scenario
" there were no reported weather issues during the plane 's flight , but that does not mean you can rule these out as a possible cause , pilot and cnn aviation analyst abend said
one thing abend was looking at was a cold front progressing in the area where the plane was
it indicated some precipitation at lower altitudes
so there may not have been bad weather at the cruising altitude , but " at lower altitudes , as they were beginning the descent , their visibility may have been obscured , " abend said
reduced visibility in and of itself is not a huge issue , but the weather may have deteriorated as the plane descended and be a possible factor in the crash , he said .
