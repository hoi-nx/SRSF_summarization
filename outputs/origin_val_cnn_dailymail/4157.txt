since returning from a long - term injury , walcott has struggled for regular football , with the likes of olivier giroud , danny welbeck , alexis sanchez , santi cazorla , ozil and alex oxlade-chamberlain all vying for a slot in wenger âs four attacking positions
arsenal top - earners alexis sanchez and ozil earn in the region of Â£ 140,000 - per - week
the emirates stadium are unlikely to offer walcott anything near that amount , particularly given his lack of games
his wage demands could lead to another long drawn out contract saga , similar to the discussions for his existing deal which nearly saw walcott leave before he signed his last contract in january 2013
