their crimes were committed decades ago but these edwardian crooks are as menacing as ever as they gaze out of their police mugshots taken way back at the turn of the 20th century
the motley crew , including many women and children , were arrested on charges ranging from petty theft to murder and photographed before being hauled before the north shields police court between 1902 and 1916
the fascinating images were given to tyne & wear archives back in november 2010 and over the last few weeks historians have been adding to the set which now holds over 1000 mugshots
killer : corsican jerome guerrini was jailed for 15 years in 1904 for murdering labourer patrick gilligan
the judge said of corsican : ' if there was anything that distinguished a corsican from the native of any other country , it was the hotness of his blood and the constant use of the knife ' smutty : both thomas wallace , left and james dawson , right , were arrested on charges of indecent exposure in june 1902 and february 1905 respectively susan joice , left , was arrested for larceny in august 1903 while susannah adamson , right , was arrested for the same crime in 1904
larceny was a form of theft which involved ' taking and carrying away ' property from someone else , but without committing or threatening violence hayward , an archivist at tyne and wear archives said : ' as the photos piled up we thought this would be a good opportunity to find out more about the stories behind them
' the mugshots include quite a few of children
' these can really tug at the heartstrings
' among the crooks on display are youngsters david lloyd , 15 , and george burn , 14 , who were arrested on 10 november 1902 for larceny , a form of theft
historians from the archive have been trying to find out more about the pictures and found a report in the shields daily news which said that the boys were charged with ' stealing on the 8th inst. from a wash - house in prudhoe street brushes and a box worth 3s , the property of peter johnson '
the shields daily news for 17 november 1902 then revealed that the boys pleaded guilty to the offences and their parents were bound over in the sum of Â£ 5 for their good behaviour during the following 6 months
young offenders : david lloyd , 15 , left , and his accomplice george burn , 14 , right , were both convicted in november 1902 for stealing ' brushes and a box worth 3s ' from a wash house , alongside his accomplice george burn , 14
the shields daily news reported that the boys pleaded guilty to the offences and their parents were bound over in the sum of Â£ 5 for their good behaviour during the following 6 months charlotte branney and william wilson were both arrested for larceny in january 1904 and february 1905 respectively
the offence was abolished in 1968 , and replaced with the broader crime of theft rogues : john currey , left , was arrested in july 1905 while simon sheffield , right , was arrested in june 1906 the offences are unknown but by the far the most terrifying edwardian criminal featured is corsican jerome guerrini , who was jailed for 15 years in 1904 for killing labourer patrick gilligan
mr hayward added : ' while the images of child prisoners really caught my attention , there was another case featured in the album , which had the same effect for completely different reasons
' rather than generating sympathy for the prisoner , this mugshot sent a shiver down my spine
' there was something menacing about the prisoner 's appearance and the word ' murder ' on the board he was holding did n't help matters either
' the case would have been featured in countless newspapers around the country but i was able to find a particularly good account by searching the british newspapers collection on the findmypast website
' the account appeared in the morpeth herald for 26 november 1904 and it revealed that the prisoner jerome guerrini ( who also went under the alias of joseph brunetti ) was a 27 - year old corsican who had spent the previous four years at sea as a fireman
' the morpeth herald reported that the man was accused of murdering labourer patrick gilligan who lived on clive street , north shields ( with two brothers named davis ) , almost directly opposite the lodgings occupied by the accused
annie anderson was arrested for larceny in august 1903 , left , while mary a butts , right , was arrested for the same crime in december 1904 ellen healey , left and maud m garmey , right , were both arrested for unknown offences in 1905 and 1908 respectively
little more is known about the two women alfred thompson , left , was arrested for larceny in august 1902 while mary brewis , right , was arrested for an unknown offence in february 1908 mr hayward added : ' the judge 's summing up is interesting in the rather casual way that it stereotypes corsican
' did gillighan single out jerome guerrini because he was a foreigner ? ' the report states that judge darling , in his summing up , said that ' if there was anything that distinguished a corsican from the native of any other country , it was the hotness of his blood and the constant use of the knife
' the jury found jerome guerrini guilty of manslaughter and he was sentenced to fifteen years penal servitude
mr hayward said : ' by bringing together information from different sources , in this case a photograph album and local newspapers , it 's possible to bring some fascinating , if tragic , stories to life
' to my mind the mugshot album is particularly interesting because it relates to a port town
' it gives us an insight into the lives of both locals and transient visitors such as jerome guerrini
' at the turn of the century north shields , which is eight miles east of newcastle , was an important fishing town and shipyard
it was also crucial to the industry of the north-east , leading to widespread urban poverty which might explain some of the crime documented in these photographs .
