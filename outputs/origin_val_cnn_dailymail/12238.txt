full story : investigators trying to determine what caused the crash of germanwings flight 9525 have made a startling discovery in an audio recording , according to a new york times report : one of the plane 's pilots was locked out of the cockpit before the crash
" you can hear he is trying to smash the door down , " a senior military official involved in the investigation told the newspaper , describing audio from the cockpit voice recorder , one of the plane 's black boxes
" we do n't know yet the reason why one of the guys went out , " the official said , according to the new york times ' report
" but what is sure is that at the very end of the flight , the other pilot is alone and does not open the door
" lufthansa , the parent company of germanwings , said it was looking into the report
" we have no information from the bodies investigating the incident that would corroborate the report in the new york times , " spokesman boris ogursky said
" we will not participate in speculation , but we will follow up on the matter
" the new york times ' report is a " terribly shocking revelation , " cnn aviation analyst peter goelz said
but he and other experts cautioned that it 's still unclear what could have been going on inside the cockpit
possibilities range from a medical emergency to something more nefarious , like a suicide mission , cnn aviation analysts said
officials previously said that had n't ruled out terrorism , but it seems unlikely
alps authorities revealed earlier wednesday that they 'd been able to access audio from the recorder , even though its external casing was damaged
but they disclosed few details about what the recording actually contained , saying only that there was one audio channel with voices on it that went all the way up to the time of the crash
" it is too early to draw conclusions to what happened , " said jouty , head of the bea , the alps aviation investigative arm leading the probe
" there is going to be detailed work performed on that audio file to understand and interpret the sounds and the voices that can be heard
" finding the plane 's second black box will also be critical to understanding the mystery of what went on inside the jet
that box , the flight data recorder , has n't been found yet , but lufthansa ceo spohr said wednesday that there 's a high probability it will be
investigators scoured dangerous terrain in the alps as they searched for clues in the wreckage
workers dropped to the crash site from helicopters , jouty said , and had to be tied together because the steep area in the mountains is so treacherous
spohr said tuesday 's plane crash " represents the darkest hours " in the history of his company , which owns germanwings
officials are struggling to understand how an airplane that " was in perfect technical condition " with two experienced pilots " was involved in such a terrible accident , " he said
but even worse , he said , is seeing the heartbreak of the relatives and friends of the victims who perished in the crash
" what they have gone through is , of course , incomprehensible , " he said , describing what he said was an emotional meeting between the relatives and airline executives wednesday
and now , he said , the company 's focus will be taking care of them
special lufthansa flights will take relatives and friends of victims to southern france on thursday , so they can be near the search scene , he said
" we need to understand what happened , " alps president francois hollande said
" we owe that to the families
" the doomed flight was traveling from barcelona , spain , to dusseldorf , germany , when it crashed tuesday in the alps
germanwings said the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , and then dropped for about eight minutes
the plane lost contact with alps radar at a height of about 6,000 feet
there were 150 people from 18 countries on board
mother , daughter from virginia among the victims teams have begun the daunting task of identifying the victims ' bodies , but caution that it could take time to complete
investigators are still trying to piece together what caused the crash
jouty , the head of the investigation team , said the debris suggests the plane hit the ground and then broke apart , instead of exploding in flight
radar followed the plane " virtually to the point of impact " in the alps in southern france , jouty said
the flight 's last altitude recorded by radar was just over 6,000 feet
fbi agents based in france , germany and spain are looking through intelligence sources and cross referencing the passenger manifest of germanwings flight 9525 , two senior law enforcement officials said
so far , their search has n't turned up anything that " stands out " or anything linking the passengers to criminal activity , according to one official
