cancer sufferer tharp , 69 , and his wife found themselves confronted with a sniffer dog and asked whether they had heroin , methamphetamines ir ecstasy stashed in their toyota
the overzealous sheriff 's deputy pulled the pair over on a highway in walton county , georgia , and took issue with their window tint before moving on to illegal narcotics
the deputy can be heard asking which drugs tharp might have in the car
he lists methamphetamines , heroin and ecstasy in turn , to which tharp replies ' no , sir ' each time
the officer had initially said that the windows on tharp 's toyota , which are factory - issue , were tinted too darkly
he took a measurement at the roadside which seemingly confirmed his suspicion - but it was later disproved by a test from the car 's dealership

they were on their way home to north carolina after visiting their granddaughter in texas
in response to the unexpected stop , tharp said : ' i do n't honestly know what the stereotype looks like for a heroin smuggler
