a lot of bale âs friends and fans are letting their hearts rule their heads and are making themselves look spectacularly naive
bale was stunning again for wales in israel
with a little bit of help from his friends â notably joe allen , aaron ramsey and joe ledley â he has spearheaded the charge to the top of group b coleman is arguably the luckiest manager in international football â bale is shining for wales at exactly the same time as the european championship has been expanded , and it would be a huge failure if wales did nât qualify for the finals in france next year
coleman is well on course to make history with his current squad
bale scored two goals for wales in israel but has not been up to scratch for madrid this season bale celebrates one of his two goals in israel as wales won their euro 2016 qualifying match in group b bale has been brilliant for wales but his form for madrid has left a lot to be desired in spain international football should be the best of one country against another ... not a brazilian playing for spain , an argentina in italy colours or an english - born scot england 's exciting squad and flawless form give real reasons for optimism ahead of euro 2016 ... but only if roy hodgson can instil a positive mentality but as brilliant as bale has been for wales , his form this season for madrid is still a subject for debate
he has nât been good enough , and needs to step up to the plate between now and the end of the season to keep his reputation at the bernebeu intact
his supporters have expressed their disgust at anyone who dares to question bale âs madrid credentials
honestly , did these people think that bale or any player for that matter , could go to a club the size of madrid and not be scrutinised ? it seems these people are unaware of the amazing history and traditions of this great club â and the demands that go with it
this is nât the welsh national team , where a couple of goals in israel makes you a national treasure
this is nât tottenham hotspur where reaching the quarter - finals of the european cup is a once - in - a - lifetime achievement
madrid 's cristiano ronaldo vents his frustration next to team - mate bale during a la liga match bale has failed to meet the high standards at madrid this season in front of football 's harshest critics no , this is madrid , where they win their 10th european cup and immediately ask if the players are good enough to win it again the following season
where finishing behind barcelona is almost regarded as a crime
where finishing third last season behind atletico madrid and barcelona was seen as utter humiliation
standards are spectacularly high at madrid and it âs hard to make a case to support the notion that bale has maintained the level he reached last season
as far as his bernebeu future is concerned , saturday âs man - of - the - match display in haifa will have done nothing to appease the madridistas
in a wales shirt bale is everywhere â it âs exhausting watching him
he scored two , he set up the other , he created more chances with some awesome passing
he ran at defenders , committing them , forcing fouls or mistakes from them
in short he was brilliant
compare that with the bale who shrunk , disappeared ( dare i say hid ? ) in the nou camp in the second half of el clasico the week before
now you can see why madrid fans are so frustrated with bale
unless his form and impact changes at club level , bale could be on the way out of madrid this summer
bale scored recently against levante to end a goal drought and covered his ears as if to mute the criticism bale could be on the way out of madrid this summer if his form does not pick up by the end of the season the club demands big - name signings every summer and bale âs second - season slump may be enough to render him dispensable
it might seem harsh to some , but if you know how high the standards are at madrid , then it âs perfectly normal
bale should come back to the premier league
he âd be the perfect signing for arsenal in so many ways , but he âd also fit perfectly into jose mourinho âs way of thinking at chelsea
manchester city âs inertia in evolving their team could be tackled by the signing of bale
but manchester united should blow the others out of the water â they have bargaining chips in david de gea or possibly angel di maria who has struggled to settle after his blistering start
bale has the energy to raise manchester united âs tempo and take them back to the big time
whatever happens to bale he should feel proud of his achievements
he has helped create special history at madrid , and he âs on the brink of doing the same for wales
angel di maria has struggled at manchester united this season so far following his Â£ 59.7million move manchester united goalkeeper david de gea could be used as a bargaining chip for bale to leave madrid this summer
