a goodbye to the giraffes , a lingering look at a pregnancy scan and even a meeting with lionel richie
these touching pictures show the final wishes of terminally - ill patients fulfilled thanks to the work of a dutch hospice
and most are simple , everyday pleasures - a trip to the zoo , a tour of museum or indulging in a good meal
the ambulance wish foundation , with the help of hundreds of volunteers , professional paramedics and comfortable stretchers , aims to give every patient the attention they deserve and bring a little light to their final days
