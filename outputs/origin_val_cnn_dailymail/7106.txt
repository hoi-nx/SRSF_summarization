the bbc must change the way it funds itself to secure its future , the director - general warns today
in a speech to staff , tony hall will say he backs plans to overhaul the licence fee â to reflect changing times â
tony hall reveals he is open to a new universal levy on every household in the country â even those that do not own a television set or only watch programmes online or on catch - up services
bbc director - general tony hall , who says he will back plans to overhaul the licence fee ' to reflect changing times ' this would lead to an estimated 500,000 extra households having to pay for a service they do not use or currently get free
the director - general âs speech at broadcasting house in london comes just a week after a report by the mps on the commons culture , media and sport committee said the Â£ 145.50 - a - year tv licence fee system was outdated and should be replaced
the debate has stepped up a gear as negotiations on renewing the bbc âs royal charter in 2016 get under way
expressing the bbc âs view , tony hall is expected to say : â we âve always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times
â i welcome the committee âs endorsement of our proposal to make people pay the licence fee even if they only watch catch - up television
â the committee has suggested another route to modernising the licence fee â a universal household levy
both proposals have the same goal in mind : adapting the licence fee for the internet age
tony hall made the speech to staff at broadcasting house , pictured , just a week after a report by the mps on the commons culture , media and sport committee said the Â£ 145.50 - a - year tv licence fee system was outdated and should be replaced â i believe we need and we will need what the licence fee â in whatever form â makes happen more than ever
â a universal tax would remove the need for the bbc to pursue those who do not pay the licence fee â a costly system that leads to a loss of between Â£ 196million - Â£ 235million a year
but ministers say the earliest it could be introduced would be 2026
a subscription system advocated by the select committee , is opposed by tony hall as â poor value â
he will warn that it could fatally diminish the bbc âs ability to compete on digital platforms with other providers such as netflix , google and apple .
