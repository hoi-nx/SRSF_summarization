esfahan , iran if you 're looking for the jews community in the iran town of esfahan , you wo n't have to search for long
the main synagogue is on palestine square , right in the heart of iran 's third largest city
there are public prayers several times a day -- sometimes with more than a hundred people in attendance
the jews community in iran does not hide its heritage
at the synagogue , malakon leads the prayer service
he says he is proud of his jews identity
and even in a country that is so hostile towards israel , malakon says he can practice freely and that he has many muslim friends
" i hang around with all kinds of young people and i have a lot of muslim friends , " malakon tells cnn after finishing the noon prayer on a monday
about 20 people were in attendance , usually from local businesses around the synagogue
none of them tried to hide the fact that they were jews -- and inside the synagogue the star of david is proudly displayed in many places , alongside passages from the torah
there have been jews in iran for more than 2,500 years
many left the country after the islamic revolution in 1979 that brought ayatollah khomeini to power
khomeini said iran wanted to destroy israel , but he also issued a fatwa , a religious decree , saying that iran jews were different to those in israel and should be considered an integral part of the islamic republic
sion mahgrefte is the head of the jews community in esfahan
he declined to comment directly on political matters , especially in the current heated environment , but he did say that the members of his community felt very much at home in iran
" israel and iran are countries , " he said
" and we consider ourselves iranian jews , not israel jews
so the hostilities between israel and iran do not affect us
" there is even a jews representative in iran 's parliament
and aside from the vibrant jews community in esfahan -- there are 13 synagogues in the city -- there are also several orthodox cathedrals representing a sizable christian community
most of esfahan 's jews are business people
in the center of town there is a shopping mall , known to people here as the " jewish passage " because so many businesses are jews - owned
when our crew arrived there they found muslim and jews shop owners joking around
one of them is shemyon , who owns a clothing store
his friends call him " mordechai , " and he showed us some hebrew prayer books he always keeps in the store
like most others , shemyon was not keen to talk about israel prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's recent address to u.s. congress , or the problems between israel and iran
he says those politics have no place here
" we just want peace , " he said
" we really hope that all these problems can be solved one day , god willing
we are just hoping for unity and peace
" there are about 1,500 jews in esfahan these days
the community 's leaders conduct religious studies for the younger members of the congregation
while sion mahgrefte is adamant that they have no problems with their shia neighbors , he does acknowledge that friends living abroad often worry about them
" of course sometimes people we know who live in israel or elsewhere are very concerned about us , and they tell us we are crazy to live here , " he says
" but then we tell them how things are and they calm down
