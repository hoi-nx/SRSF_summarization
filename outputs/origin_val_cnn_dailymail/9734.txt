a man who led a kansas commune that collected millions of dollars in life insurance payouts from dead members was sentenced tuesday to life in prison for the drowning death of one of them 12 years ago
perez , 55 , stared straight ahead and showed no emotion as he heard his sentence : a life term for murder in patricia hughes ' 2003 death at the commune 's 20 - acre compound near wichita , another life term on a sexual exploitation of a child conviction , and nearly 34 more years behind bars on 26 other counts , including rape
perez declined to address the court when given the chance
convicted : perez was convicted of first - degree premeditated murder last month in the 2003 drowning death of patricia hughes at the suburban wichita compound where the commune lived sedgwick county district judge bribiesca ordered perez 's sentences to be served consecutively , so he would n't be eligible for parole until he is 120 years old , according to prosecutors
' the evidence conclusively shows that mr. perez used people as mere objects to fulfill his desire for money , sex and a lavish lifestyle , ' bribiesca said
' it is just that he serve the maximum sentence
' prosecutors say perez sexually abused the young daughters of commune members and devised a scheme to receive life insurance payments after members died
' it is clear mr. perez was the puppet master , ' sedgwick county district attorney bennett told the court
during the trial , members of the now - defunct commune talked about how they moved from state to state and to mexico over a 15 - year period before they settled at the elaborate compound near wichita
they testified about being subjected to sexual violence by perez and about the deaths of six people
perez , who went by lou castro , was charged only with the death of patricia hughes , who was 26 when she drowned in the commune 's pool
her death was considered an accident until 2011 , when a woman who was 12 when patricia hughes died told authorities that it had been staged to look accidental
the commune had received $ 1.24 million from patricia hughes ' life insurance policy

she said ' her childhood was over ' at the age of 10 , when she says perez first sexually assaulted her
another woman told the court she was angry because perez preyed on people like her mother
the father of another victim asked the court to impose the maximum allowable sentence , saying that would be just
bennett told reporters after the hearing that the sentence perez received was appropriate
the prosecutor said there were ' so many lives , so many people " affected by perez
" at some point you lose track of how many victims this man actually victimized , ' he said
perez 's attorney , osburn , did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment

she said prosecutors failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , and said she plans to appeal .
