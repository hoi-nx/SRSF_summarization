footage has emerged of the incredible moment an apparently intoxicated man fell between two moving subway carriages in washington d.c only to come out unscathed
security cameras inside metro 's mount vernon station captured the incident around 5pm on sunday march 1
the man can bee seen stumbling around the platform , obviously unsteady on his feet , before tumbling straight through the gap between two subway cars
the fall occurs right as the doors are closing the the train is preparing to leave the station
unsteady : this is the moment the apparently intoxicated man ( left ) loses his balances and goes to fall into the cap between the two carriages fall : the video shows the passenger falling straight into the space between the connected carriages down : the man slips straight into the gap , as fellow passengers ( right ) watch on with shock as the man falls , shocked onlookers try to help , only to realize the train is alighting
one man can be seen in the video panicking and holding his hands in the air
however , one the train passes and people scurry to the platform 's edge , believing a tragedy has just occurred , they suddenly see the man get to his feet and continue stumbling
he somehow fell into the zone outside of the rails known as the ' area of refuge '
the fellow passengers quickly pull the man up to the platform
police arrived to assist the man
he suffered only minor injuries from the fall
safe : people on the platform can be seen pulling the man back up onto the station after the train departs perhaps more startling is the fact that incidents such as these happen every week , according to a metro spokesman
' it 's important for riders to monitor themselves and also look out for their friends , ' metro spokesman stessel told nbc washington
' if you go out for drinks with a group and someone is clearly not able to walk properly , maybe that 's the time to order a cab or an uber , that sort of thing
' encouraging a fallen passenger to roll into the area of refuge is a ' last resort ' , stessel told the washington post
however in this case it seemed to be accidental
miraculous : the man managed to fall into the space between the platform and the tracks known as the ' area of refuge '
