a 16 - year - old boy has been banned from travelling abroad after his two elder brothers were killed fighting jihad in syria
the teenager , who can not be named , was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the high court of the high court in london today
a judge made the ruling after social services at brighton and hove city council raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers ' footsteps and travel to the war - torn region
the teenager , who can not be named , was made a ward of the court at a hearing in the high court of the high court in london ( pictured ) today
social services feared he could follow in his brothers ' footsteps barrister martin downs , representing the council , told the court that three of his brothers had gone to fight for the al-nusra - a group with links to al-qaeda
two had died in their teens and the third had been wounded but was still fighting in syria
a friend of the teenager had also been killed in fighting
mr downs added that his family had an ' extraordinary history ' and he also had an uncle who had been held in united states ' detention camp in guantanamo bay , cuba
the ruling prevents the teenager , who has dual libya and uk citizenship , from leaving england and wales
mr justice hayden , who said the four fighters could not be named , added : ' the local authority 's anxiety here is that ( the teenager ) may wish to follow the path which his brothers have walked
' he also heard that council staff had learned that family members were making plans for the teenager to go on a trip to dubai during the easter holiday
mr justice hayden said he was concerned to ' keep this lad alive ' and said an order which barred from travelling abroad was proportionate
' [ the teenager ] is a vulnerable young person
he has grown up in modern uk in an extraordinary family - a family where the male members are patently committed to waging jihad in war - torn syria , ' he said
he told the court he had balanced the teenager 's human rights and added : ' the balance falls clearly in protecting this young man , ultimately from himself
' mr justice hayden made the ruling after social services at brighton and hove city council ( headquarters pictured ) raised fears that the boy could follow in his brothers ' footsteps and travel to the war - torn region the boy 's mother , who he lives with , is said to be was ' exhausted by grief ' and there were concerns that she was unable to place ' proper boundaries ' around him
mr justice hayden said the council had considered asking for the teenager to be taken into care but given the boy 's age , staff thought making him a ward of court would be a better option
the judge said by becoming a ward of court the youngster would come under the protection of a judge and added : ' a child who is a ward of court may not be removed from england and wales without the court 's permission
' mr downs said the teenager 's father was thought to be in libya and that the teenager was ' disaffected ' and was not ' properly engaging ' at school
he told the court the boy had been involved in fighting and was currently on police bail after being arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm
the judge was told that the mother was aware of her son 's planned trip to dubai
she hoped that the trip would ' get him away ' from his local area where he had been getting into trouble
mr downs said it was thought that the teenager 's brothers had left the uk after telling their mother that they needed passports for a ' school project '
mr justice hayden said he was ' sympathetic ' to the teenager 's mother , adding it was not difficult to see why the teenager might feel aggrieved and have a sense of injustice
lawyers said it was thought this was the first time a family court judge had been asked to take such an approach to prevent a boy going to fight in syria
the group , which is also referred to as al-nusra , formed in january 2012 during the syrian civil war and made its announcement as extremists through an online video
it quickly rose to prominence among rebel organisations in syria for its reliable supply of arms , funding , and fighters from a combination of foreign donors and isis
al-nusra , which means support in arabic , was also the first syria force to claim responsibility for terrorist attacks that killed civilians
in 2013 the militant group , designated as a terrorist organisation by the united nations , made an allegiance to al-qaeda commander zawahiri , claiming it was part of its network and denying any affiliations with isis
despite zawahiri 's public denial of the merger , a number of al-nusra fighters defected to isis , furthering tension between the groups
by march last year , over 3,000 fighters had been killed in battles between isis and al-nusra
the group 's videos and statements are regularly posted to social media such as facebook and video - sharing sites through media group , al-manara al-baid
there were rumours last month that the group was planning to separate from al-qaeda but it is yet to formally declare it .
