washington cruz is back in his favorite place : the spotlight
as the first candidate to quit the charade of " exploring " a presidential run and actually jumping in , the texas republican senator presented an image monday of decisiveness and vision -- all before an auditorium of mostly supportive young evangelicals
now comes the hard part
cruz must make inroads with wide swaths of the republican if he hopes to break through as a top - tier candidate
he does n't have many friends in the party establishment thanks to his hard - line tactics on issues like obamacare
and he 's facing steep competition for the conservative vote from the likes of wisconsin gov. scott walker
even evangelicals , cruz 's target audience during his launch speech at liberty , are n't firmly in his column
the firebrand 's decision to jump - start the 2016 election season now is an implicit admission of the daunting challenges he will face in a crowded republican field where multiple republican will vie for the same social and evangelical support base
" cruz is clearly a player , " said perkins , president of the family research council , a christian public policy ministry
" but the competition this cycle is very steep
" by choosing liberty in virginia , which was founded by fundamentalist preacher jerry falwell , to roll out his long shot campaign , cruz made clear he wo n't cede the christian right to another candidate
" from the dawn of this country , at every stage , american has enjoyed god 's providential blessing , " said cruz , roaming the stage with a microphone like a megachurch preacher on a sunday morning
" over and over again , when we faced impossible odds , the american people rose to the challenge
you know , compared to that , repealing obamacare and abolishing the irs ai n't all that tough
" liberty offered cruz a ready - made crowd : young evangelicals in a vast auditorium who had little choice but to pack the stands , because the announcement came during their compulsory weekly convocation
this is exactly the kind of coalition of youthful christian idealists cruz must win over and get to work in early voting states if his presidential hopes are to catch fire
but cruz wo n't have this political territory all to himself
several students sat in the audience within view of the cameras wearing red t - shirts emblazoned with " rand , " referring to kentucky sen. paul , who is also likely to make a play for young conservatives
meanwhile , scott walker , with his governing record and history of facing down a recall and trade unions , seems to have eclipsed cruz in the minds of many conservatives who are desperate to take back the white house
" when the grass roots look at a guy like scott walker -- he can not only bridge the divide , we believe , in the republican , but he might be the one who can bridge the divide like he did in wisconsin , " said jennifer stefano , a pennsylvania tea party activist
" that 's what i think is dominating cruz -- he has not made as many headlines as in 2013 , as when he tried to stop and defund obamacare
" cruz must also face off against paul , former arkansas gov. huckabee , former pennsylvania sen. santorum and dr. ben carson to win evangelicals -- a tough task
" it 's a crowded field to begin with and it 's almost as if , within the republican contest , there are some early sub-primaries : who is going to be the establishment candidate ? who is going to be the social conservative candidate ? " said david yepsen , who was for years the dean of iowa caucus reporters from his perch at the des moines register
meanwhile , a cnn / orc international poll last week put cruz as the choice of 4 % of likely republican voters
so if he seems unlikely to win , why would cruz get in -- and so early ? paradoxically , the size of the task facing cruz and the tempered expectations for his bid may also mean that the risks that often weigh against a presidential candidacy -- the potential damage to a political career that can be caused by a poorly run campaign -- may not apply
perkins said he had been assured by cruz personally that he believes he can create a path to the nomination -- and ultimately the presidency -- despite the fact that he would be taking aim at the white house with the almost unanimous disapproval of the republican establishment
announcing now could give cruz more time to test messages beyond those tailored for evangelicals
he used his speech monday to also slam common core education standards and immigration reform , areas where establishment republican favorite jeb bush is perceived to be vulnerable
he also joined the hawkish republican barrage on foreign policy , slamming president barack obama over his row with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his record on iran and combating " radical islamic terrorism
" but should he fall short in his 2016 bid , a successful campaign that positions cruz as the leader of the evangelical right would certainly boost his political brand and position him for a future presidential run
and at only age 44 , there 's plenty of time for that
his texas senate seat , meanwhile , seems to be his as long as he wants it
he does n't have to run for re-election until 2018 , so a presidential bid would n't get in the way of the day job
so in a sense , cruz may not have that much to lose
another reason to get in early is iowa
the state is going to be crucial for cruz 's hopes because it is the most fertile early voting territory for his chosen campaign path
a win in the first - in - the - nation caucus could crown cruz as the undisputed champion of the social and evangelical conservative wing of the party
but he is going to be facing proven iowa campaigners
huckabee won the state in 2008 and santorum won a recount over the eventual republican nominee , mitt romney , in 2012
both have substantial networks of support and , crucially , know many caucus voters personally in a state where the personal touch counts for everything
" i think cruz has generated some excitement in iowa , and he is a new face , " said yepsen
" but it is going to be a while before he closes the sale with a lot of activists
" an added bonus for cruz getting in now : the early bird gets the best coverage
in a matter of weeks , republican presidential announcements from the massive republican field will draw little more than a shrug , so getting out ahead of expected announcements from paul and florida sen. marco rubio could be a good idea
when democrat hillary clinton makes her official plunge into the 2016 race , any republican candidate may struggle to dominate media coverage for several weeks
monday also happened to be the fifth anniversary of the day obamacare was signed into law
because cruz has spent endless hours trying to overturn it -- winning the appreciation of conservative activists in the process -- monday was a good moment to highlight the point
cruz , unlike some other potential republican candidates , may have to work extra hard to raise the campaign funds he needs to mount a viable campaign
his early announcement gives him time for a post-announcement spurt before the next quarterly fundraising figures close at the end of the month , and a full three months to put up an impressive number in the next quarter .
