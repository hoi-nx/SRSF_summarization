putin is ' alive ' but ' neutralised ' as shadowy security chiefs stage a stealthy coup in moscow , it was claimed last night
former fsb chief patrushev was behind the plot , claimed chairman of the pro-kremlin national islamic committee , dzhemal
there have been no confirmed sightings of putin for nine days , while in the febrile atmosphere engulfing moscow a convoy of large trucks parked outside the kremlin fueled rumours of a flit by the president
despite this , bloggers likened it to ukrainian leader viktor yanukovych 's treasure - grab as he fled into exile just over a year ago in kiev
' i think that putin is neutralised at the moment , but of course , he is alive , ' said dzhemal , seen as a kremlin loyalist
' he is under the control of the power - wielding agencies , who have , in my opinion , organised a coup d'etat
' recent pictures of putin supposedly working during a nine day absence from public sight was ' playing for time ' by the plotters , he claimed
' my information is that patrushev met chechen leader kadyrov in pyatigorsk on 11 march and tempted him over to his side
' he also pointed to a recent visit by patrushev - head of putin 's security council - the us
the visit came despite sanctions barring visits by most senior russian officials
' i think he was offered something there that he failed to reject , ' said dzhemal on georgian tv channel rustavi-2
several large trucks were parked near kremlin square fueling rumours connected with putin 's absence putin has not been seen in public for nine days which has caused certain consternation in russian putin failed to reappear again on saturday - the ninth day without a confirmed sighting - as his chechen enforcer suggested the russian strongman is in danger of being overthrown
kadyrov - a devout muslim whose security apparatchiks are seen as being behind the brutal murder of nemtsov - said he would remain devoted to the kremlin leader ' whether he is in his position or not '
this came amid a claim that pictures issued by the kremlin on friday of putin meeting supreme court head vyachevslav lebedev may date from 2011
the images were rushed out in a bid to show putin is still at work , and followed the release of other photographs which had been taken on or before 5 march when he was last seen in public
with feverish speculation in moscow over putin 's health and whereabouts , and claims of a bitter power struggle in his entourage which could even trigger an attempted coup , the head of chechen spoke emotionally of people ' trying to harm the president of russian - and russian itself '
and he claimed that forces were scheming ' to break us apart ' , referring to him and his guarantor putin
as startling has been the lack of shows of support in recent days from other senior kremlin cardinals during an absence which has no obvious parallel in his 15 years as president or premier
the voices of prime minister dmitry medvedev , defence minister sergei shoigu , chief of the kremlin staff sergei ivanov - and putin 's intelligence tsars - have remained silent
kadyrov has enjoyed extraordinary power and largesse under putin as a reward for keeping an iron grip on the rebellious oil - rich chechen region , scene of two bloody wars since the collapse of the ussr
as a result he is hated by many senior putin loyalists
but kadyrov 's enemies claimed yesterday that the 38 year old bearded regional potentate is in ' panic ' because he can no longer contact his mentor
' he is phoning anyone he can in an attempt to arrange a talk with putin - but he fails , ' alleged a website linked to islamic hardliners seeking to overthrow kadyrov
one of the two men formally charged with killing opposition leader nemtsov is a personal friend of kadyrov , who spoke out in his support for the second time yesterday
' i 'll repeat now that i knew him as a true warrior and patriot , ' he said of zaur dadayev , who is accused of murder
there are allegations that a security official closer to kadyrov ordered the nemtsov murder , and that the fsb and interior ministry in moscow have full proof
his slaying has triggered bitter factional infighting in the kremlin , which includes talk of defence and security service generals seeking to replace putin
others believe putin will reemerge tomorrow to stamp his authority once more on his government
there were also unverified claims last week that putin 's alleged girlfriend , olympic gymnast alina kabayeva , 31 , had given birth to a child in switzerland
this was denied by the kremlin
the political chaos in moscow comes after western sanctions and a low oil price have caused mayhem to the russian economy , with a serious fall in the rouble
many of the clans in putin 's entourage became hugely rich under his rule , but now face their fortunes evaporating
software experts in russian yesterday suggested the pictures of putin meeting lebedev , supposedly taken friday , were created in 2011 and modified a year later
but putin is shown in front of the presidential flag , though he was not head of state in 2011
