however , the man was safely handed to medical crews
mr craig maclean , who jetted back to scotland yesterday from abu dhabi , then used the plane âs public address system to let passengers know what had happened
he said that after answering the appeal for help he told a steward : â i âm just a student
before i could finish , she said , â come with me â
â there was a man in his 50s with vomit coming from his nose and mouth who was unconscious
â he was completely unresponsive , so i called for help and we got him on to the floor in the aisle â he was a big man
â i assessed him and discovered he was not breathing and had no pulse
a major alarm bell goes off â this is a cardiac arrest
i need to act now , and quickly , or this man will die
i started cpr , called for the defibrillator and asked for an immediate emergency landing
â i continued cpr and they brought me medical equipment , at which time a dutch nurse came to take over cpr
' i was then able to apply the pads and shock the man
i got his heart beating properly again and he started breathing
â mr craig maclean , who is from glasgow and was attending a conference on the health problems caused by tobacco , said that , following the handover of his patient , â the last update i got was on landing , at which i was relieved to hear he was alive â
