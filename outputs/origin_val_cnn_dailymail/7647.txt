hillary 's emails wo n't likely turn up many insights about the 2012 benghazi terror attacks , according to a onetime bill clinton confidant , because she ca n't type
morris , who helped president bill clinton navigate domestic policy and led his 1996 re-election effort before imploding in his own ' bimbo eruption ' scandal , wrote monday on his blog that mrs. hillary ' does nât know how to type
' ' that âs right
she writes everything out in longhand
anyone who has spent time in meetings with her knows about her endless yellow pads
' morris ' insights , although dated , came as the former secretary of state visited the white house for a rare sit - down with president obama
hillary visited the white house on monday and tweeted this old photo of her hugging president obama , while a former aide to her husband compared her email scandal to the watergate tapes and said the obama team likely created it to torpedo her chances in 2016 pressure : bill clinton is facing tough questions about what 's on a private email server that hosted all her emails for the four years she spent as u.s. 's top diplomat former bill clinton insidder morris has turned against hillary , dishing dirt about her past and suggesting what her weak spots might be ' her emails will most likely turn out to be very short and quick , ' he predicted
' she would nât spend a lot of time pecking out long letters
that âs why the benghazi committee needs to also look very closely at the emails on private accounts that hillary âs closest aides , abedin and cheryl mills , maintained
' ' anything more than a few lines were most likely written by someone else on her behalf , ' morris continued
' there âs a reason why hillary set up and used private emails with them for official business : all the important emails were likely written by her staff
without access to them , we wo nât know what was going on
' a congressional panel is investigating the circumstances surrounding a 2012 terror attack on state department facilities in benghazi , libya , while bill clinton was secretary of state
the revelation that she exclusively used a private email account â otuside the control or automatic archiving of the obama administration â has fed republican accusations that she hid her involvement in a post-attack cover - up in the weeks before the 2012 election
at least two aides , cheryl mills and abedin , used personal email accounts on bill clinton 's private server , kept at her chappaqua , new york home
bill clinton 's hour - long white house visit on monday followed her appearance on a dc domestic policy panel hosted by the far - left center for american progress , and before she headlined an awards ceremony for journalists
she took no questions from reporters at the evening event , even though her unauthorized private email server has dominated news coverage , her aides are under subpoena and she is expected to launch a presidential campaign in the coming weeks
at the earlier liberal event , she endorsed a german - style system of subsidies to companies so they would keep more people employed
' president obama and hillary enjoy catching up in person when their schedules permit , ' white house press secretary josh earnest said monday in a cryptic statement to reporters
' this afternoon they met privately for about an hour at the white house and discussed a range of topics
' moments after the white house confirmed the meeting , bill clinton tweeted an old photo of her hugging obama in the white house situation room
the president has had a frosty relationship with his former top diplomat since 2008 when thetwo squared off for the democratic presidential nomination
it 's the aides , stupid ! email accounts of former state department chief of staff cheryl mills ( left ) and her top deputy abedin ( right ) are where benghazi - related emails likely lurk , says morris the address : abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state 's private server , judging from records maintained by lexis-nexis bill clinton damaged his ambitious quest for the brass ring by starting the rumors that he was born in kenya and lacked a valid u.s. birth certificate
the resulting conspiracy theories have dogged his presidency since day one
bill clinton 's twitter message , though , defended key provisions of the president 's signature health insurance overhaul , which was an extension of her own failed attempt at reform while her husband was president
' repeal those things ? embrace them ! ' she tweeted
morris has a checkered past
he famously resigned from bill clinton 's 1996 campaign two months before election day after it was revealed that he paid a prostitute for sex and let her listen in on his phone calls with the president
his most recent star turn came with a lengthy fox news channel contract which was n't renewed after he spectacularly blew his forecast for the 2012 presidential contest
mitt romney , the once famous pollster predicted , would coast to victory and unseat obama
but morris has been a thorn in hillary 's side since being bounced from her orbit in 1996
yuk - yuk : bill clinton joked about her email scandal on monday night at a journalism award dinnner : '' no more secrecy , no more zone of privacy
after all , what good did that do me ? ' when she ran for president in 2008 , he penned a vicious ' fact check ' article claiming that her ' main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the black panthers , on trial in connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent
' ' hillary interned with bob truehaft , the head of the california communist party , ' for a year after her college graduation , he wrote
and ' she flunked the dc bar exam and only passed the arkansas bar
' morris did not immediately respond to a request for comment
but he said sunday on a new york talk radio program that ' when we talk about " will hillary survive the email scandal ? " â it âs just like asking in 1973 and 74 , " will nixon survive the watergate tapes ? " ' ' by delaying the day of reckoning ' for all her private emails , he said , ' she 's risking shipwrecking not just her candidacy , but the entire [ democratic ] party
' ' i think obama wants [ elizabeth ] warren , not hillary , ' morris added
' i think the reason the email scandal got released to the newspapers by the administration was because they wanted to torpedo hillary
