horror : the defenceless child was locked in a wooden cage and had petrol poured over his body before being set alight
thankfully a group of locals spotted the attack and managed to save the boy 's life gruesome : the attack is understood to have been a sickening imitation of the brutal murder of jordanian pilot mu'ath al-kasasbeh , who was burnt alive by isis earlier this year local journalist mouzahem was told about the attack and posted details of it on his facebook page , according to gulf news
the boys are understood to have been inspired by murders committed by isis after using mobile phone apps such as whatsapp to share gruesome videos of the terror group 's atrocities , despite living in a remote village where electricity supplies are unreliable
during the attack , the boys are said to have assumed different terrorist roles , with the ' leader ' sitting in a chair and giving orders to his friends
after being set alight , the boys cries were overheard by local residents who rushed to save him
' the villagers took him to a local hospital where he received treatment for burns to one of his legs , ' mr mouzahem was quoted as saying

the chilling footage , entitled ' healing the believers ' chests ' , shows the caged airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and seemingly doused in fuel as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars is seen being set alight
flames are seen quickly spreading across the dirt to the cage , where they completely engulf the helpless pilot in images that are far too distressing to publish
extremists pour debris , including broken masonry , over the cage , which is then flattened by a bulldozer
the horrific murder led to jordanian immediately executing two isis prisoners and carrying out an unprecedented number of attacks on the terror group in syrian

the grainy mobile phone footage was reportedly filmed somewhere on the gulf coast in yemeni
it shows five young boys , possibly aged around 10 - years - old , wearing only trousers , being led to a beach by five teenage boys
the teenage boys are fully dressed and their faces are covered by scarfs to imitate the masked murderers from the sickening islamic state execution video

each boy appears deep in character , honed from studying the terror group 's depraved videos
an egyptian couple horrified guests at their wedding by hiring fake jihadis to hijack the ceremony and force them in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a jordanian pilot
the marriage ceremony was held in menoufia , north of cairo and saw masked men storm the venue and order the bride and groom to climb in to a cage at knife point
the only members of the wedding party who knew about the pretend ' attack ' in advance were the groom , his best men and wedding photographer ahmed kassem - although the bride is said to have been told to expect something ' different ' from the ceremony
hijacked : the marriage ceremony was held in menoufia , north of cairo , and saw masked men storm the venue and order the bride and groom to climb in to a cage at knife point trapped : the fake jihadis took control of the ceremony and force the bride and groom in to a cage in a shocking imitation of the burning to death of a jordanian pilot it is unclear from the video whether the bride and groom are muslim or christian
video footage of the ceremony shows one of the groom 's knife - wielding best men wearing a black balaclava and religious song - known as a nasheed - that has previously featured prominently in genuine islamic state propaganda videos
having stormed the stage , the men force the couple to climb in to a cage in a chilling imitation of the isis video that showed jordanian pilot mu'ath al kassasbeh being burnt alive earlier this year
the only members of the wedding party who knew about the pretend ' attack ' in advance were the as yet unnamed groom , his best men and wedding photographer ahmed kassem
the bride was not aware once inside the cage the couple stand up and dance while guests clap and cheer them on
not everybody was enamoured by the proceedings , however , with the youm7 newspaper reporting that several of the wedding guests mistakenly thought it was a genuine terrorist attack
it is believed that even the bride was unaware at what the groom had planned , and that the only people aware of the ' attack ' in advance were the best men playing the roles of jihadis , and the photographer , who had been ordered to make sure everything was caught on camera .
