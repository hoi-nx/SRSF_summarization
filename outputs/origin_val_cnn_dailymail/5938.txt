eventually he snapped , trudging off the field after 75 minutes and wondering when his next game in a chelsea shirt will be
this has been brewing for a while , simmering in the background at a time when mourinho needs his first choice striker out on the pitch in the final , decisive nine games of the season
costa , this hot - head in a chelsea shirt , has tweaked his hamstring again and mourinho will expect his prized forward to barter his way out of spain 's two games during the international break
this time the complaint felt legit , particularly as the score was delicately balanced at 2 - 2 at the kc stadium when costa signalled for help
chelsea striker costa was forced off with a hamstring injury during the blues ' 3 - 2 win over hull city costa ( left ) talks to manager mourinho ( right ) before he is substituted at kc stadium on sunday his replacement , remy , answered the sos by scoring chelsea 's winner with his first touch
it was a shame to see costa disappear down the tunnel , particularly after he had joined harry kane at the top of the scoring charts in the barclays premier league with a rasping effort to put chelsea 2 - 0 ahead
instead spain , who have a euro 2016 qualifier against ukraine to play on friday , and a friendly with holland the following tuesday will dictate when the forward plays again
mourinho has an uneasy relationship with spain coach vicente del bosque and with that in mind , his adopted country are likely to demand that he is assessed by their own doctors
' when the team needs a goal with 15 minutes to go and the striker has a lot of experience with hamstring injuries and says it 's over , it 's over
' we know his hamstring is not strong
now he has 15 days without football , but we never cry about our injured players
' he has had this problem since he tried to play in the champions league final against atletico madrid
' there has been talk of an operation at the end of the season , some serious discussions between chelsea 's medical staff about a permanent solution
' dr biosca ( chelsea 's medical director ) is against knives , against surgery , ' admitted mourinho
' he 's all in favour of conservative work and collective work between the medical department and fitness staff
this is the direction , we believe
' costa had scored chelsea 's second goal as they stormed into a 2 - 0 lead within 10 minutes on sunday it has been another eventful game for costa , full of sly digs and elbows again as he responded to the prods in the back from steve bruce 's players
everyone tries to work him over these days
there was a flashpoint , of course there was , because that is the way costa plays the game
he snarls , he snaps , he scores
here at the kc stadium , after hull city had pegged back chelsea amid raucous scenes in the stands , he threw half an elbow in the direction of jake livermore
it was not seen by michael oliver , the referee who also failed to spot costa raking his studs down emre can during the volatile capital one cup semi-final second leg at stamford bridge
on this occasion he is expected to escape
hull city were able to draw level before half - time and when costa was subbed off the scores were locked at 2 - 2 the real punishment was for hull city , beaten by the boot of remy just a couple of minutes after he had replaced costa as a substitute
he is a useful back - up , full of energy and enthusiasm despite his lack of minutes
mourinho had every reason to be grateful to him
' every time he plays here is there and he probably deserves more than i give him , ' admitted a mightily relieved mourinho
' there are not many times when a coach owes something to a player , but with remy that 's the case
every time he plays he gives us a lot
' after scoring the winner here for chelsea , he has earned a break
remy scored the winning goal for chelsea and his contributions could prove vital in costa 's absence
