a new york city man says his smartphone blew up in his pocket and that he wound up in a hospital
erik johnson of lindenhurst says his iphone spontaneously erupted in extreme heat while it was in his pants pocket , giving him second - and third - degree burnson his leg the size of a football
he was headed to a wake for his cousin in new jersey on february 14 , erik johnson said , and he dropped his car keys
" when i went to bend over , i heard a pop , " he told cnn
" i heard a sizzling , and i ended up ripping my pants off to stop it from burning me
" erik johnson said he did n't know what was causing the pain at first and there was no warning -- just an extreme burn and a lot of pain
in a panic , he quickly started ripping at his pants as the phone began to melt the edges of his pocket shut , he said
" i was trying to get it out of my pocket , " he said
" it started burning right through my pants
it was burning my leg , and i had to get my pants off somehow
" erik johnson 's brother , who was with him at the time , decided driving him to the hospital would be faster than dialing 911 , erik johnson said
they drove to the bayonne medical center in new jersey
after being evaluated in the emergency room , erik johnson was taken by ambulance to the burn center at staten island university hospital
the burn center confirmed to cnn that he spent 10 days there receiving treatment
" i still ca n't believe it , " erik johnson said
" i 've never dealt with anything like this before
" he works as an operating engineer in new york city , maintaining escalators , cranes and forklifts
he said now he is at home with family in lindenhurst , and a nurse comes in every day to change his bandage
in the meantime , he said , he has n't even thought about buying a new phone
della , a personal injury lawyer on long island who is representing erik johnson , says despite two phone calls and a letter , apple had not yet responded to his queries about why his client 's phone suddenly exploded in heat
cnn reached out to apple , and the company stated that it is looking into the incident
erik johnson purchased the phone last year and had not been using a battery case or third - party charger , della said
" first and foremost , we have to find out how this happened and prevent it from happening ever again , " della told cnn
" that 's the whole goal here
is the product safe ? " della said because of this case , he now is quick to take extra precautions with his phone
" now , every single time i have my iphone , instead of putting it in my pocket , i put it in the seat next to me because of this case , " he said
" my wife does the same thing , and so does everyone else at the ( law ) firm
it 's a little scary
" " you should n't have to worry about your phone exploding , " he said .
