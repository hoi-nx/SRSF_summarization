a former england beauty queen who was born following ivf treatment has waded into the row against dolce and gabbana
model charlotte holmes , 26 , from plymouth , was crowned with the national title in 2012 but has hit back after the designers labelled babies born as a result of ivf as ' synthetic '
the row was sparked after comments were made in italian magazine panorama about the use of ivf treatments
angry : former england , whose parents underwent ivf to have her , says fertility treatment should be celebrated and calls for dolce and gabbana and gabana to apologise but the devon model has added her voice to stars including john who have been angered by the comments
' according to dolce and gabbana i 'm a synthetic human - ironic for a company who charge Â£ 1,500 for a nylon jacket , ' she said
' i hope it was blown out of proportion and they will apologise
they were a couple for years ; they would have been depriving themselves of a family
' ivf treatment allows people who are unable to conceive in the traditional manner the chance of parenthood
specialist in ivf technology winston helped charlotte 's parents conceive , and she feels strongly passionate about his work
she said : ' i would n't be here if it was n't for professor winston
john and david furnish with their two sons ( left ) and the designers dolce and gabbana ( left ) with dolce and gabbana ' to me and my family ivf is of the utmost importance
it is wrong for high - profile celebrities to make comments like this when it is crucial for families who ca n't have children
' it 's rare to get such negative comments too
traditional family is obviously great if it works , but ivf is great for families who ca n't conceive ' that 's just the bottom line.these treatments are available to us and we should be celebrating it
" we should be developing it to make it more successful and available to other people
' they were never a company i 've shopped with before , so this is more like a continuous boycott , as i will continue to not shop there
' charlotte won the coveted miss england crown in 2012 however , italian fashion designers dolce and gabbana have insisted they ' respect all the world ' after their controversial remarks on fertility treatments infuriated sir john
the pop star called for a boycott of the famous brand after designer dolce and gabbana criticised in - vitro fertilization ( ivf ) , which sparked outrage on social media
but dolce and gabbana has now insisted his views were private , personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional sicilian family
in an interview with cnn , dolce and gabbana insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure , and said : ' i believe in the traditional family
' it is impossible to change my culture for something different
it 's me ... i respect all the world , all the culture
' good looks have helped charlotte make succeed as a model the fashion designer had previously said : ' you are born and you have a father and mother
at least it should be like that
that 's why i 'm not convinced by what i call chemical children , synthetic babies
' that sparked a furious reaction from john , who has two children with husband david furnish through ivf , who fired back : ' how dare you refer to my beautiful children as " synthetic "
' your archaic thinking is out of step with the times , just like your fashions
i shall never wear dolce and gabbana ever again
' his outburst prompted a mass social media campaign , as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand .
