cole has revealed how he was made to feel ' small ' by a perceived snub from sheringham that led to the england pair not talking
the former man united striker played alongside sheringham at old trafford for four years but did not enjoy a relationship with his compatriot following an incident on international duty
cole made his england debut from the bench in a 0 - 0 friendly draw with uruguay in 1995 and , in replacing then - tottenham forward sheringham , felt the lack of acknowledgement from his future man united team - mate was disrespectful
cole ( right ) played alongside sheringham at man united for four years - but the pair never got on following a perceived snub from sheringham during an england international in 1995 sheringham - and david beckham - congratulate cole after scoring in a 6 - 0 win over bradford city in 2000 ' from my england debut against uruguay , he was going to be substituted for me to come on to replace him , and he snubbed me on the line , ' cole said
' i just thought to myself , ' i 'm making my debut here and wembley is a packed house '
and i felt so small
' i do n't think his apology would come , because i honestly do believe that he believes he was not in the wrong
' despite a fantastic goalscoring record at club level , cole only made 15 international appearances and scored just once - famously calling former england boss glenn hoddle a ' coward ' for announcing he was dropping cole through the press
' i do n't think it was damaging to my career , ' cole said of his remarks
' i just think a lot of the media and a lot of joe public picked up on that and ran with it and ran with it , and exhausted it
and i remember when it came out , i mean of course it was going to be massive news
he was the england manager
' cole and sheringham celebrate on the pitch in 2000 but the did n't speak off it the pair come face - to - face when cole played for manchester city and sheringham at west ham in 2005 despite a prolific goalscoring record at club level , cole won just 15 caps for england keegan and cole , pictured here on international duty , fell out briefly in october 1993 cole also had a high - profile falling out with keegan in 1993 while at newcastle , something the striker said was a consequence of tiredness more than anything else
' i felt so tired , and i could n't get myself going , ' cole told itv , ' he [ keegan ] said , ' do n't you fancy it today ? ' so i said to him , ' no i do n't fancy it today
' so he said , ' well if you do n't fancy it you can do one
' so i said , ' okay , not a problem to me , ' and i just walked off
' i got in a taxi and my girlfriend then , she was at home so i just ended up going to hers
and i remember i rang the doorbell and she said to me , ' what are you doing here , you 've got a game tonight have n't you ? ' ' i said i just walked out of there , i could n't be bothered
' keegan added : ' we went to play the game , no cole and we lost , and we go in friday for training , we 've got a game on saturday
cole poked his head round [ the door ] and he just said , " gaffer , what do i do now ? " i said , " i 'll tell you what to do , you go out , you train properly and if i think you are fit enough i will put you in the team tomorrow
