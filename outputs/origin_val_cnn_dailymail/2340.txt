an australian entrepreneur who runs a successful coffee shop is being deported - because she did n't earn enough before launching the venture
australian - born jacky collyer , 27 , moved to british in 2011 and married barista husband carter , of swindon , north wiltshire , two years ago
they had just signed a five - year lease on a premises for their own coffee house when they received a bombshell letter from the home office
australian - born jacky collyer ( right ) and her husband carter ( left ) set up a coffee shop in swindon , north wiltshire - only to be told she must return to melbourne within two weeks officials said she must be deported because the couple did not meet the minimum income threshold for sponsoring a non-eu spouse to stay in the country
at the time they submitted their income , mr carter was still studying philosophy at sussex university so their combined salary fell below the Â£ 18,000 minimum
jacky collyer now has just 14 days to return to melbourne , shattering their dream of running their own business
a number of her customers , and two local mps , have now joined a campaign to stop her being deported
her distraught husband said : ' our whole world has been torn apart
our family and friends are here
' if we have to go we might try setting something up somewhere else , probably in europe , maybe in germany
' jacky collyer moved to british in 2011 and married barista husband carter , of swindon , north wiltshire , two years ago
they are pictured on their wedding day jacky collyer moved to the british in 2011 and met her husband while she was working in a coffee shop in brighton
they married two years later and returned to mr carter 's home in swindon , where they set up an artisan coffee business
but just days after the couple signed a five - year lease on darkroom espresso in july 2014 , jacky collyer received the letter from the home office
they fell victim to a new law which came into affect in 2012 meaning someone in her position must have a household income of least Â£ 18,600 to stay in british
she said : ' we wanted to come to swindon and set up a business like those in brighton , and really contribute to the area
' they seem to think that because we earn a little bit less than Â£ 18,000 , we 'll start claiming benefits
the pair had just signed a five - year lease for their own coffee house when they received a bombshell letter from the home office ' we were told we could n't possibly live on that much money , but we 're perfectly happy with the money we have , we run our own business and still go out for nice meals
' the weird thing is , my visa requirements say i ca n't claim state money anyway , so i could n't even if i wanted to ! ' i spent years supporting carter while he was studying , and then we started our own business
so , of course we do n't earn that much money right now
' they appealed the home office decision but last week received another letter telling her this had been rejected , and are now facing a lengthy separation and the folding of their business
the letter said she would be required to leave the country by next thursday , but she has since started an appeal process
she said she had been ' overwhelmed ' by the support she had received , but was determined to make sure more people knew about the strict immigration rules
she said : ' even if i do have to leave , i want people to know about this law
so many people have no idea , and it 's so unfair
' we would have qualified under the old rules and so many people do n't know they 've changed
' the couple say they have been told that article 8 of the european convention on human rights - the right to a private and family life - does not apply in their case
mr carter said he had been told that this was because his wife 's immigration status was already seen as ' precarious '
among the couple 's supporters are north wiltshire mp , james gray , and swindon parliamentary candidate , anne snelgrove
she said : ' this is a young couple who have set up a very successful business in the railway village which is an area which really needs more businesses like this
more than 2,000 people have signed an online petition in a bid to block jacky collyer 's deportation jacky collyer moved to the british in 2011 and was working in a coffee shop in brighton when she met her husband who was studying philosophy at sussex university ' i am shocked and dismayed to hear about how the have been treated
' i will be talking to some of my friends who are mps and will be trying to find out what can be done
' darkroom espresso 's most loyal customers have started a facebook campaign to help and more than 2,000 people have signed an online petition to keep jacky collyer in the british
a home office spokesman said : ' all applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with immigration rules
in july 2012 the home office reformed the rules that apply for family immigrating to the british from non-european economic area ( eea ) countries
it included the introduction of an Â£ 18,600 minimum income threshold for sponsoring a non-eea spouse or partner to come to british or remain in the country
the home office said that it introduced the guidelines to prevent ' burdens on the taxpayer , promote integration and tackle abuse ' and to ensure family migrants can ' stand on their own two feet financially '
it acted after receiving advice from the independent migration advisory committee and claiming it was a level at which ' we can be reasonably assured that the british sponsor has sufficient means to support themselves and their foreign partner '
' we welcome those who wish to make a life in the british with their family , work hard and make a contribution
but family life must not be established here at the taxpayer 's expense
' that is why we implemented the recommendations of the independent migration advisory committee and established clear rules for british citizens looking to bring their non-eu spouse to this country , including a minimum income threshold
' the pair are now in discussions with an immigration lawyer and plan to appeal the latest decision , but they have also begun to consider other options .
