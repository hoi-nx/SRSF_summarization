the moscow football federation branded the incident ' outrageous '
' i was explaining to the child how to use his foot in a more robust manner , ' claimed the coach , who claimed the camera was at the wrong angle
' i started showing him - and just then the child jumped
so i sort of touched him , and he flipped in the air
' of course , there was not even a slightest intention to hurt him
' he fell down in a theatrical manner so that it looked like he was hurt
the person who filmed it was lucky to catch this angle
' pavlov is the father of two daughters , one of whom plays in his team , and he claimed he filmed his club maximum-brateevo 's training sessions as proof there was no undue physical force or beating of children
while he did not apologise to the eugene efimov after the kick , he claims he has done so since
but after the video went viral , the youngster 's mother alyona efimova , 35 , was tracked down and she refused to criticise the coach

the video does n't show anything really special , my son has been training for football with this coach for three years and we have n't had any problems up until now , and i still do n't see a problem
' the video however has underlined a tough attitude that many parents in russia have to raising children , where violence from parents or teachers is still often regarded as acceptable as a way of making sure they grow up properly
asked if he was angry at the kick , the boy told local tv : ' no. i am not mad at him , i fell down because i jumped , i did n't feel any pain , it just looked bad
' while the footage has caused outrage in russia , without a complaint , the investigative committee may not take further action
after the boy got back to his feet , mr pavlov then appeared to order him back into the game
