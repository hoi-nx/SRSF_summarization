cruel men left gina feeling like an undatable monster , but after under - going Â£ 40,000 worth of surgery and having 22 operations including boob jobs and liposuction she finally feels good about herself gina had hair restoration in 2009 in bangkok , she has traveled around the world to have her different operations but after eight years of surgery she now feels like a movie star - and is being inundated with attention from hunky blokes
now gina says men ca n't leave her alone and she is constantly being stopped in the street by bachelors begging for a date
gina said : ' men who were repulsed by me in the past are now stopping me in the streets and begging to take me out

now they 're wishing they had me
' sick of feeling unattractive , gina - in 2007 , then aged 31 - began ploughing her savings into cosmetic surgery after a lifetime of feeling lonely

' it affected my confidence i had no friends
people did n't want to know me or be my friend
i was n't attractive to people for sexual relationships
' i thought i looked ugly and manly and i had problems dating , men did n't find me attractive
i had a few flings but i just did n't find myself attractive
' gina said she had a few flings before she embarked on her operations but she did not find herself attractive gina says she now feels like a model thanks to her Â£ 40,000 make - over but she would n't put herself at the levels of kate moss and co but she believes spending eight years in an out of hospitals across england , tunisia , pakistan , cyprus , belgium , thailand , has paid off despite having to undergo corrective surgery for botched operations
she said : ' i would n't put myself at the level of kate moss , beyonce or naomi campbell but i feel like a model
' it may have cost me my life savings but it was worth it
i only have one regret , i should have transformed myself sooner
