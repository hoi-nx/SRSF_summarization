the bbc has backed top gear over clarkson âs use of the word â pikey â
the word - used as a derogatory term for gipsies or travellers - was part of a â running gag â between clarkson and fellow presenter james may about their colleague richard hammond âs perceived cheap style
a complaint was lodged by the traveller movement charity after it appeared on a placard in a top gear episode from february last year
top gear hosts : the word ' pikey ' was part of a â running gag â between clarkson ( right ) and fellow presenter james may ( left ) about the perceived cheap style of their colleague richard hammond ( centre ) the bbc trust acknowledged that the word â pikey â derived from â turnpike â and so related to travellers in a ruling due to be published today
but the bbc trust âs editorial standards committee said there had been â no intended racist reference â by the top gear team
the ruling stated : â the committee believed the word â pikey â had evolved into common parlance among a number of people to mean â chavvy â or â cheap â and â¦ viewers would not necessarily associate it with the gipsy and traveller communities
â but a traveller movement spokesman told the newspaper : â we are horrified by the bbc âs green - lighting of the use of the word â pikey â by the top gear presenters
embattled presenter : the future of clarkson ( pictured leaving his house in london yesterday ) at the bbc is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in north ruling : the bbc committee said it â accepted that the word â pikey â did have the potential to be deeply offensive to the gipsy and traveller communities â ( file picture ) â the claim that it has evolved a new meaning and that most people do not realise it has any reference at all with gipsies and travellers is absolute rubbish
â the word ' pikey ' is believed to have been used as early as the 16th century
but it was not seen in print until 1837 , when the times used it to describe strangers who visited the isle of sheppey
the actual origins of the word are unclear
it could be connected to the word ' turnpike '
these were toll roads , which had rotating barriers made of sharp poles called pikes - and vagrants were known to gather in these areas in the 18th century
an alternative version of the word is ' piker ' , which is said to have come from the verb ' to pike ' - which once meant to run away
now , the word is used as an insulting term towards gipsies - who have claimed in recent years that it is the equivalent of calling a black person a ' n * * * * * '
it is also used in the modern day as a term to insult someone of supposedly low class
the bbc committee said it â accepted that the word â pikey â did have the potential to be deeply offensive to the gipsy and traveller communities â , but it cleared the programme of wrongdoing
clarkson âs future at the bbc is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in north
he now faces an interrogation over his row with top gear producer oisin tymon by bbc chiefs , who are said to be â desperate â to get rid of him
ken macquarrie , head of bbc scotland , is leading an inquiry into the fracas and is expected to deliver a verdict within days
last night clarkson was at the centre of another controversy after he said in the march edition of top gear magazine that foreign taxi drivers in london have â vehicles smelling of sick â
he also turned on drivers in the north , saying northern roads are overrun with immigrants â who have never experienced tarmac before â
the inflammatory comments follow a string of racism rows
last year , clarkson apologised after he was filmed allegedly using the n - word in the poem â eeny , meeny , miney , moe â
shortly afterwards , he used the racist term â slope â in a show about burma
the racing driver who was the stig on top gear for eight years has said that the bbc show could thrive without the embattled clarkson
collins fell out with the broadcaster when it launched legal action - which it failed to win - over his decision to reveal his identity and publish his autobiography
he told radio times magazine that the presenter was not supportive of him in his own clash with the corporation
and he said that the bbc2 show could continue to succeed without him
claim : collins ( left ) , the racing driver who was the stig ( right ) on top gear for eight years , has said that the bbc show could thrive without the embattled clarkson the stuntman stated : â top gear has achieved huge status and clarkson has certainly been part of that because he âs got such a big personality ... he âs an unstoppable force
â but fans of the programme love it for lots of different reasons
clarkson is certainly one of them , but not the only one , â collins , who was the stig until 2011 , said
â the bond franchise ...
top gear will always continue ...
it will carry on and continue to be successful because millions of people watch it
â mr collins said that it had become harder for the show â to reinvent itself â , as it was â possibly starting to strain under the weight of its own success â
meanwhile , perry mccarthy , who was the stig from 2002 to 2003 , said that top gear without clarkson would take â the fire out of it â and â wo nât work â
â i think you âre going to have a diluted product
i do nât think it will have the value that it did , here and overseas â , he said
â and god help any soul who takes his place , because that âs like signing up for your own firing squad
the only person who could take it on would be somebody who has nothing to lose
