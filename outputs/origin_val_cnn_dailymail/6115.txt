manchester united and liverpool are set to go head - to - head this summer to sign william carvalho
the sporting lisbon midfielder has a Â£ 35million get - out clause in his contract , though changes to third party ownership could see his price drop by around Â£ 10m
however , the action between the two premier league giants could mean his value surpasses the Â£ 30m mark
liverpool and manchester united will go heafd - to - head to land sporting lisbon midfielder william carvalho the portugal international has a Â£ 35million get - out clause but his value could drop due to third party ownership liverpool see william carvalho as the ideal player to replace the departing steven gerrard
equally , manchester united have eyes for him to shore up a midfield which has lacked an enforcer this season
arsenal are still confident of landing morgan schneiderlin this summer
the france midfielder is rated in the Â£ 25m category
his club southampton have offered him a new Â£ 60,000 - a - week deal to stay at the club
but the gunners will raise the bar on salary and more than likely offer champions league football
sources in france tell the fg that morgan schneiderlin wants to join the gunners
southampton midfielder morgan schneiderlin wants to join arsenal according to fg sources manchester city âs hopes of signing Â£ 60m - rated paul pogba from juventus could be dashed this summer because of the emerging interest of barcelona
president marc bartomeu is lining up an audacious move , despite the catalan giants â transfer ban
barcelona are lining up an audacious move for manchester city target paul pogba , currently with juventus sunderland will move in for sam allardyce should he - as it seems likely - leave west ham in the summer
whatever the outcome of their season it appears the sunderland will part company with gus poyet
the fg understands besiktas boss slave bilic is high on west ham âs â long list â , along with michael laudrup and frank rijkaard
steve bruce is set to leave hull city this summer
fulham and wigan are two possible destinations
sunderland will make a move for sam allardyce should the west ham boss leave upton park this summer i am hearing hodgson will restore wayne rooney to his favoured role of lead striker when england play lithuania in the euro 16 qualifier at the end of the month
wayne rooney has been moved around the manchester united team this season , even playing deep in midfield under louis van gaal
but hodgson still believes wayne rooney âs position is as a front man even though he has used him in differing roles
it remains to be seen though if wayne rooney can justify his place in the national team and not just be picked because he is captain , especially given the emergence of tottenham âs kane as a contender for the central striker role
indeed , suddenly hodsgon has plenty of options up front with qpr âs charlie austin and burnley âs danny ings also candidates with kane and liverpool âs daniel sturridge to challenge wayne rooney for the â no 9 â role
hodgson will restore wayne rooney to his favoured role of lead striker when england play lithuania i am also hearing reports of a deep rift between manchester united boss louis van gaal and assistant ryan giggs may be exaggerated but fg hears there have been differences of opinion with regard to tactics , not least the use of wayne rooney
this time last year fg reported that if david moyes was ousted , ryan giggs would take charge until the end of the season
fg hears it âs not beyond the realms of possibility that ryan giggs will be manchester united âs next boss
how soon ? that depends on how lvg negotiates the remainder of this season
ryan giggs , ( second left ) pictured next to louis van gaal , could be manchester united 's next boss isay the day after the fa appointed glenn as their new chief executive , hodgson announced he wanted his contract extended for at least two years to take in the 2018 world cup finals
it would seem hodgson , or perhaps someone who advises him on pr matters , thought it was good timing to state his case
whatever the reason it could well backfire on hodgson
hodgson has announced he wants to extend his contract with england for at least another two years after all , on what grounds does hodgson think he has earned the right to a new deal ? yes , england are well on the way to qualifying for the finals of euro 2016 , but in a very weak group
and does he think people have forgotten last summer âs lamentable display at the world cup ? england âs dire performances in brazil encouraged scathing comments towards hodgson from bbc 's main man lineker
and here âs the thing
lineker is a pal of glenn
why ? because head of walkers glenn offered former england skipper lineker a lucrative career in advertising crisps
indeed , lineker lauded the appointment of glenn
food industry boss glenn ( left , with lineker in 2000 ) has been named the fa 's new chief the only way hodgson , who is 67 by the way , should continue as boss is if the team reach at least the semi-finals at the euros
of course the obvious question then is who to replace him
given his strong views on football over the last 20 years from the comfort of the pundit sofa after a great international career , it might just be that glenn persuades lineker to put his money where his mouth is
btw liverpool boss brendan rodgers has suggested that steven gerrard âs â dream â of leading out liverpool in this year 's fa cup final as a last hurrah before moving to la galaxy is not guaranteed
after all the reds have got to get there first
sunday âs quarter - final tie against blackburn may seem a shoo - in for liverpool but any manager tempts fate when they look too far ahead
that said , liverpool look well placed to go all the way to wembley this season
steven gerrard is back training but wo n't walk straight into the liverpool team , according to brendan rodgers with steven gerrard in mind , brendan rodgers was spot on when he said : â no player has a god given right to walk into the team
â indeed liverpool have played their best football and have picked up points since steven gerrard was ruled out of action with a hamstring injury
moreover , liverpool âs revival this season has coincided when steven gerrard ended all the speculation about his future and said he would leave the club and join la galaxy in a sense that liberated the rest of the players â¦ not least jordan henderson
jordan henderson , pictured celebrating against burnley , has been liberated since steven gerrard confirmed his move squads ca nât live under the shadow of an ageing star
even that time will come for barcelona and lionel messi
there comes a point when even the best players , club legends , can end up overshadowing the squad and thus undermining the team evolving into a new era
bill shankly was a master at moving on stars and refreshing the team
and of course at manchester united under sir alex ferguson did the same
it would seem brendan rodgers realised that offering steven gerrard two more years at liverpool was more sentimental than pragmatic and thus detrimental to the club moving on up under his watch
that is a sign of good management and may in a few years time see liverpool achieve what they never did in the â steven gerrard era â
brendan rodgers says steven gerrard does not have a god - given right to return to the team straight away ibet the champions league resumes this week
chelsea are 8 - 1 to win the trophy
given the way the beat west ham 1 - 0 last week when overrun in the second half suggest they have the mettle and desire and even the luck to go all the way
the treble lite is on for the blues .
