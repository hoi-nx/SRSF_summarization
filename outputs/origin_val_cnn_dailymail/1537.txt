a friend of jihadi john , unmasked as mohammed emwazi has used the human rights act to avoid being deported a friend of jihadi john accused of organising al-qaeda terror atrocities has used the human rights act to avoid being deported despite being deemed a threat to national security
the terror suspect , originally from ethiopia , is believed to be a leading member of al-shabaab , an al-qaeda affiliate based in somali
he was accused of playing a part in the 2005 plot to blow up the underground and is an associate of isis executioner jihadi john - unmasked this week as mohammed emwazi
but the deportation case against the man , who can only be identified as j1 , collapsed after a five - year court battle when a britain diplomat admitted the system was not working
lawyers argued the man 's human rights would be breached if he was sent back to ethiopia , where he could face detention and possible torture
the terror suspect is now living in underground and has also been linked to two al-qaeda extremists killed in us drone attacks in somali
shadow home secretary yvette cooper said the government has ' serious questions ' to answer about the case and questioned why he was n't placed under special controls
she told the telegraph : ' this man ( j1 ) has been linked to planned terror attacks , associated with known terrorists , and identified as a risk to the britain
so why did n't theresa may at least put him on a tpim in 2013 when he was released from immigration detention ? ' and what is being done now ? are they reconsidering tpim , deportation assurances or prosecution options ? or do they no longer believe he is a significant threat ? ' a tpim is a terrorism prevention and investigation measure which allows authorities to impose a curfew and limit communications on someone they ' reasonably believe ' is involved in terror activities

court papers disclose that ' on the morning of the failed underground bombings of 21 july 2005 , a mobile telephone which the appellant ( j1 ) now accepts was used by him , was in contact with a telephone used by one of the bombers , hussein osman '
the government argued he was a threat to national security and should be deported , court papers show
they claimed he was an associate of londoners mohammed sakr and bilal berjawi , both of whom died in us drone strikes in somali
sakr and mohammed emwazi were friends and sakr attended quintin kynaston academy in st john 's wood along with mohammed emwazi
it was revealed this week that mohammed emwazi was a ' person of interest ' to security service as a member of a cell known as the london boys , which was set up to recruit and raise funds for al-shabaab
security service was also aware of emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in august 2014
it was revealed that jihadi john was a ' person of interest ' to security service as a member of a cell known as the london boys , which was set up to recruit and raise funds for al-shabaab , pictured with britain journalist david haines they had a file on emwazi from at least 2009 , when he was stopped as he arrived in tanzania
britain agents suspected that he was trying to travel to somali to join up with al-shabaab , an accusation that mohammed emwazi denied
he was never charged with a terror offence
shadow home secretary yvette cooper said the government has ' serious questions ' to answer about the case michael adebolajo , convicted of lee rigby 's murder , is also believed to be linked to the somali group
the case has heightened calls for the human rights act to be scrapped
it collapsed when anthony layden , the britain diplomat in charge of negotiating his deportation , admitted the system was not working
he is believed to have blamed the home office for the failure
this comes as the government admitted that hundreds of isis extremists like mohammed emwazi have been free to leave britain because they were not being properly monitored by the security services
a spokesman for the home office said yesterday : ' control orders were not working and were being struck down by the courts
' tpim have been endorsed by the courts , counter-terrorism reviewers , the police , and the security service
following a review of the powers available to manage the terrorist threat , the range of measures available under the tpim act is being extended , including a measure to allow tpim subjects to be relocated to different parts of the country
' michael adebolajo , convicted of lee rigby 's murder , is also believed to be linked to the somali group al-shabaab
