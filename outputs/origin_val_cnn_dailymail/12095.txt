it was n't just the clasico â victor valdes always prepared for every game by imagining the worst things that could happen
he would muscle up his psychological preparedness by spending time mentally filing through the great times in his career , the things he valued highly in his personal life
if he had a stinker , or even if he had a blinder but still could n't stop his opponents getting the better of barcelona , then he would have a store of precious images and memories with which to dilute the pain of defeat or failure
he would rely on them
this will be barcelona 's first clasico at the nou camp without victor valdes at the club since 2002 - 13 years
bravo in training at barcelona 's joan gamper base ahead of clasico against real madrid despite the million - kilowatt glare given off by the stars on the playing surface , i 'll miss his presence â saturnine , deeply competitive , gently eccentric , hugely effective
damn good at his job and one of the plethora of characters who have helped elevate this to the best , most regularly high - quality , most - watched game of football in the world
i am still learning what bravo 's mind usually does to him before a big game , and , vice versa , what the former real sociedad keeper tries to do to either dominate or harness the powerful psychological alert system which should be telling him , right about now : ' oh no ! real madrid again
' from the moment when beckham scored past him with a free - kick at the anoeta stadium in february 2007 , where the ball squirted past bravo like a wet , angry salmon trying to evade capture , the contest with real madrid has appeared to have been bravo 's room 101
following that beckham moment , bravo has faced real madrid 10 times , losing nine , drawing one and conceding 33 goals
like colin montgomerie and a major golf tournament , brazilian ronaldo and the champions league , real madrid are the sharpest thorn , digging into the goalkeeper 's side
bravo joined barcelona in the summer of 2014 and is looking to improve his record against real madrid bravo comes up against messi in 2012 while playing for former club real sociedad back in october , leading 1 - 0 , perhaps he allowed himself to dream
but by the end it was 3 - 1 going on 6 - 1
it 's important to be clear , in not one of real madrid 's goals â cristiano ronaldo 's penalty , pepe 's thunderous header , karim benzema 's blitzkrieg counter-attack third â did the chilean carry any blame
but here he is , guardian of a team expected to win â able to make a decisive statement about taking the title back , at a time when they are in the last eight of the champions league and copa del rey finalists
his mind must have wandered to ... what if ? he 's already admitted : ' it 's true , we do talk about the treble ... it 's an achievement which was in this club 's recent past and it would be fantastic to repeat
the barcelona no 1 ( right ) and jordi masip lopez train in preparation for the game against real madrid ' but thinking about it and assuming it 's going to happen are totally different things
' right now bravo is in line to win the important ricardo zamora trophy for la liga 's stingiest keeper â 16 goals conceded in 27 matches
but , even given that statistic , he 's yet to give , or be asked for , a display where he can definitively say : ' those three points belong to me
' chile 's star of the world cup admits it is still a learning process
' people ask you the difference of playing at barcelona compared to another team and it ' s waiting
waiting with total concentration , mental preparation , staying ready despite the fact that you might not be tested , not even involved for 20 or 30 minutes at a time
' i tell myself that we are under attack , that at any second , including that one right then , something vital might be asked of me
' the match will be barcelona 's first clasico at the nou camp without victor valdes in 13 years just under 105 metres away from him for most of the night will be someone who would have nodded , with a knowing grin , at all of those sentiments
this is n't the first time that some have reckoned that casillas is facing his final clasico ( and who knows whether the two sides might yet meet in the champions league ) â but neither father time nor the club 's transfer market planners are on his side
if real madrid president florentino pã©rez has his way , this will be david de gea 's fixture next season
but , right now , it 's casillas 's
the 4 - 3 loss to schalke at the bernabã©u 12 days ago was the match which made all barcelona fans say : ' three points on march 22 , for sure
' victor valdes ( right ) joined manchester united this season where he is currently no 2 behind david de gea but that 's not so
casillas was correctly blamed for at least two of those goals
but the impression that the game , and it 's embarrassing defending , was definitive was false , i think
casillas ' desire , his cat - like alacrity seem diminished
but he 's a feisty , cold - minded competitor and this matters the world to him
thirty - seven times he ' s played barcelona , far more than any other rival
if this is his last , and he 'd like there to be another six or seven before leaving in 2017 , then he 'll be determined to produce another save like the one which turned last october 's clash
losing 1 - 0 to neymar 's opener , casillas made a point - blank save from messi ( who 's scored 18 times past the madrileã±o )
real madrid were n't 2 - 0 down at home , real madrid pressed the accelerator and crushed luis enrique 's side in ' lucho 's ' first clasico as a coach
it 's an anecdote that casillas ' first clasico at the nou camp , nearly 15 years ago , also saw the first goal he conceded to barcelona â scored by that same lucho
when the world watches this contest it will be in anticipation of another of the three - plus goal games we 've seen over the last 10 years
but spare a thought for the nou camp clasico debutant in one goal , and the legend in the other
different lives , different men
