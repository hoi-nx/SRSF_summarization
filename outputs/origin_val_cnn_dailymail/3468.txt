i think he was writing stuff for his chums to perform at eton and oxford and he did it in a hurry
' they were probably only performed informally around the piano and i suspect he just forgot about them , which is why they have been gathering dust for all these years
' but the seeds of a great composition like jerusalem can be found in this student work
these are beautifully shaped tunes , logical harmony and very exact but imaginative setting of the words
' some are incomplete or jottings , but there are some important compositions which until recently were kept in storage by one of hubert parry 's distant relatives
in later life , hubert parry went on to teach and later run the royal college of music in london , which has an archive of his work
dr peter horton , a librarian at the college , said : ' the new documents are interesting because they are his early works and one can see from them how hubert parry 's work developed
