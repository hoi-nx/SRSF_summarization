social workers have offered the teenage victim of paedophile teacher forrest the chance to meet with him to explain the impact of his grooming the schoolgirl who was groomed and abducted by paedophile teacher forrest has been offered the chance to meet him by social workers
forrest was jailed after he had sex with the girl , then 15 , and fled to france with her - finally being arrested after a week on the run
in the case that followed - during which the child at first pledged to stand by the maths teacher and professed her love for him - it emerged forrest had begun grooming her when she was just 14
the girl 's mother told bbc radio 5 live daily that social workers had approached her daughter , who is almost 18 , and offered her the chance to meet forrest
they said the meeting could take place as part of the restorative justice scheme , where victims are given the chance to meet criminals so they can explain the impact of their actions
it is also thought to help to rehabilitate offenders by allowing them to see the personal impact their crime has had , and take responsibility
all meetings are supervised and in a controlled environment
davina williams , who has changed her name to protect her daughter 's identity , said her daughter had not yet decided whether to take up the offer
but she added that the choice would be her teenage daughter 's only
she said : ' i know she 's in control of whatever happens next and rightly so
as a parent , you protect as much as you can as children and you teach the best you possibly can to give them the best start in life
' when they are adults , you have to allow them to lead their own life
you do n't have any control
i will always be here
i will always be her mum whatever happens
you ca n't force them , you ca n't make them , they have to do it their own time
while they go through that process they have to find a way to cope with it
' forrest previously worked at bishop bell school in east sussex
he began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to los angeles when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane â something she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with bulimia
forrest was arrested after he was seen with the girl in bordeaux after they fled to france under false names she opened up to him about the break - up of her parents ' marriage before he kissed her in a classroom
she said they would have sex in his ford fiesta or hotels , which they would check into as mr and mrs forrest
they first had sex when she was 15 and it later emerged that forrest had been grooming the pupil since she was 13
restorative justice is a government scheme aimed at giving victims a voice
it allows victims to meet perpetrators of crime to explain the personal impact of their actions upon them
meetings are held in a controlled environment and offenders must have admitted the crime
the scheme allows offenders to take responsibility for their actions and try to make amends with their victims
for offenders , meeting their victims can be a challenging experience because they are forced to confront the personal impact of their crimes
restorative justice is used in a bid to rehabilitate people who have committed a number of crimes include violent offences and sexual assaults
according to the restorative justice council it accounts for a 14 per cent reduction in reoffending
in 2012 police were alerted to their relationship and the pair fled to france , using false names
they had planned to set up a new life together and forrest left behind his marriage and career
the pair were found when they were spotted in bordeaux after eight days on the run
forrest , who was married at the time , was convicted for sex offences and abduction and was jailed for five - and - a - half - years
he was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life
after the case the teenager said : ' i love forrest so much
i want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once he 's out , we can marry and have children
' forrest had previously insisted he was not a paedophile but had simply fallen in love with the teenager
last year the girl , then 16 , was said to have started a new relationship with a 20 - year - old part time teacher and security guard
forrest , 32 , is due to be released in the summer .
