if you 're an amazon customer in the britain your future online purchases could arrive at your home or office by drone
frustrated with how long it is taking to get approval for its flying delivery service in the us , amazon is said to have approached the uk government to launch a trial of the technology in britain
transport minister robert goodwill revealed the plans at a press conference for driverless cars and wider technologies earlier today
amazon has approached the uk government about trialling its flying prime air in the britain , transport minister robert goodwill has confirmed
one of its prototype delivery drones is pictured â i had some people from amazon coming to see me the other day ; they want to replace van deliveries with drone deliveries , and they ca nât do any trials in the us because they âre over-regulated , â he said
â so my favourite word is deregulation , and we need to make sure that wherever you are in the world , and if you want to innovate and you want to invest in this sort of technology , come to the britain because we âre here to help you
' the faa ( faa ) in the us last week approved amazon âs plan to begin testing drones for online deliveries , though the e-commerce firm first made the request in july last year
but in the time it took to approve the use of its first - generation drone , amazon has developed a new version , which makes the ruling ' obsolete '
so the firm is setting its sights on foreign markets
the project , called prime air , was first revealed in a youtube video in late 2013
the company is developing drones that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour ( 80 kph ) , operate autonomously and sense and avoid objects
amazon âs paul misener wrote in a letter to the faa in december : â without approval of our testing in the us , we will be forced to continue expanding our prime air r&d footprint abroad
â under us law , operating drones for commercial purposes is illegal , however it is allowed in the britain if permission is granted by the caa ( caa )
the faa is said to be currently reviewing its rules on drones , with new regulations expected to be announced in the near future
amazon is developing aerial vehicles as part of prime air
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds ( 2kg )
about 86 per cent of amazon 's deliveries are five lbs or less , the company said
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making prime air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' amazon has said
in the us , the flying of unmanned aircraft , including recreational drones , is banned above 400ft ( 122m )
any flight that takes place within five miles ( 8km ) of an airport can also only occur once air traffic control has been notified
the britain âs caa has laid out guidelines for drone users that specify that unmanned aircraft must always be flown within the â line of sight â of the pilot , which it generally measures at 1,600ft ( 488m ) horizontally and 400ft ( 122m ) vertically
this remains a stumbling block for amazon and other companies as it means they would only be able to deliver items within 1,600ft ( 488m ) of their warehouses
so far , law enforcement of drone regulation breaches in the britain appear to have been relatively tolerant
chief inspector nick aldworth , of the metropolitan police , told a house of lords select committee on piloted aircraft systems that tourists had been caught flying drones in parts of central london , despite laws restricting use close to buildings and congested areas
â we have decided not to enforce the legislation that exists , even though they were in contravention of it , because it did not seem proportionate , â he said
chinese internet giant alibaba is also currently carrying out its own private trials of drone technology for deliveries
a new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones
' noflyzoneuk.org is the first site in the britain to introduce the vast benefits which the drone industry will inevitably bring , ' says tansley , its managing director
' in fact the service is intended to benefit the public , the drone industry and the uk government
' our hope is that in allowing the public to request that their property become a no fly zone , then this will address the privacy concerns which have been mooted by the relevant authorities
' a new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones
an example of a map marking such zones is shown the company will monitor and record drone traffic so its service can provide a ' rapid drone intercept solution ' to prevent hostile incidents such as a terrorist attack
mr tansley , who has previously served in hm forces and in the metropolitan police , believes the service will allow the uas ( uas ) industry to establish itself in the britain
' as our database grows , it will help services such a amazon âs prime air , dhl âs drone delivery service and google âs project wing among others realistically get a foothold in the britain while simultaneously addressing current security and privacy concerns , ' he added
noflyzoneuk.org will be able to monitor and track all drone , uas , rpas ( rpas ) and uas ( uas ) flights and share this information with the public .
