juventus forward morata is likely to feature up front for spain in friday 's euro 2016 qualifier against ukraine in seville , coach del bosque said on thursday
morata is the obvious choice in the striker 's role for the european champions following the withdrawal due to injury of diego costa as second - placed spain look to maintain pressure on group c leaders slovakia
' we have been training with all the players we have , we have deployed them in the positions they are going to play and we have a lot of expectations of morata , ' del bosque told a news conference ahead of the game at sevilla 's sanchez pizjuan stadium
morata is set to start for spain in their euro 2016 qualifier against ukraine on friday morata has two international caps to his name but looks likely to add to his tally on friday morata is put under pressure by real madrid defender ramos during a training session on thursday spain manager del bosque confirmed that morata was likely to start up front against ukraine ' it has been positive that he has enriched himself by moving abroad and it is good that he has had playing time ( at juventus ) , ' del bosque added
morata joined the italian champions from real madrid in the close season after breaking into real madrid 's first team from the youth ranks but finding his playing time limited
the 22 - year - old , who has scored seven goals in 22 serie a appearances this term for the italian champions , is competing for a place up front with the likes of barcelona 's pedro and malaga 's juanmi
cesc fabregas , who plays in midfield for chelsea but has often been drafted in as an extra striker for his country , is another option
morata was given strong backing by spain team mates ramos and iniesta
