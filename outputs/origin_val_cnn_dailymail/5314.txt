the families of victims of the germanwings plane crash face a wait of up to four months for the remains of their loved ones to be identified , it has emerged
head of the criminal research institute at france 's national gendarmerie said dna identification of the victims would take two to four months
colonel francois daoust , the institute 's director , said : ' subject to the amount of body parts found , the time period could fluctuate between two months at the least , and four months
grieving relatives are pictured at a memorial in le vernet , france friends of students killed in the disaster hugged each other outside an emotional memorial service last week ' it is better to work at the rhythm of the science than to rush ahead and thereby run the risk of making mistakes in the identification
' ' we can not promise that we will be able to identify all of the victims , ' he added , according to german newspaper bild
german prosecutors said lubitz , 27 , who deliberately caused the crash in the french alps , had therapy for suicidal tendencies some time before getting his pilot 's licence
and he was being treated by a psychotherapist , dusseldorf prosecutor 's office spokesman kumpa said
' at that time he was being treated for what is documented as being suicidal , ' mr kumpa said
he added that lubitz paid several visits to doctors right up until the time of the crash but these did not involve suicidal tendencies
lubitz ( pictured ) , who deliberately caused the crash in the french alps , had therapy for suicidal tendencies some time before getting his pilot 's licence , german prosecutors said a top police boss in france has warned that his department ' can not promise ' that it will be able to identify all of the victims no suicide note ' or anything like that ' was found in searches of lubitz 's german residences , mr kumpa said
there was also nothing in his personal , family or professional background to provide any hints ' about his motivation ' , he said
he also said lubitz was not suffering from any ' organic medical illness '
cockpit voice recorder evidence has indicated that lubitz deliberately put the airbus a320 into a descent after locking out the captain
all 150 people on board , including three britons , were killed in the crash last tuesday
work to collect debris and find the second black box continues to take place at the crash site of the germanwings airbus a320 - but it could be months before the remains of victims are identified mr kumpa was speaking as the grim search for remains carried on in southern france
there were reports that lubitz 's girlfriend was pregnant with his child and that the co-pilot , as well as having mental health issues , had been receiving treatment for an unspecified vision problem which could have affected his ability to carry on working as a pilot
authorities have already revealed that he hid from his employers a sick note declaring him unfit to work on the day of the disaster , and german newspaper bild has said he previously told an ex-girlfriend : ' one day i will do something that will change the whole system , and then all will know my name and remember it
' the britons killed were paul bramley , 28 , originally from hull , martyn matthews , 50 , from wolverhampton , and seven - month - old julian pracz-bandres , from manchester , who died alongside his mother , marina bandres lopez belio , 37 , originally from spain .
