preventing your mind from wandering from an important task may be as simple as putting on a pair of glasses
the inventor of smart spectacles called narbis , claim they can train your brain to stay focused
they use sensors to monitor a wearer âs brainwaves and alert them if they start to daydream and let their attention drift elsewhere
when they start paying attention again , the lenses clear
greco , the inventor of narbis , claims that with repeated use , the glasses can train a person âs brain to focus for longer periods of time as well as help them relax and get a good night âs sleep
the 28 - year - old , explained : ' the narbis ' sleep training programme is designed to improve the performance of a brain pattern known as smr ( sensorimotor rhythm ) which is related to relaxation

here , a woman has lost focus on her book , indicated by the lenses on the glasses turning opaque the glasses are designed to use neurofeedback technology , which relays the information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head ( illustrated right ) , to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness
an app will record a user 's progress in improving their concentration narbis is a headset that uses sensors to measure a user âs brain patterns and send these signals to a set of electrochromic lenses
when a wearer âs attention drifts , the lenses darken and when they focus , the specs clear
users will be able to train their brains by practicing keeping the lenses clear
the idea is that with work , they will be able to stay focused for longer and even learn how to shift into a state of focus at will
by doing two 30 - minutes training sessions a week , they will start to see improvements in their brain 's overall performance , mr greco âs kickstarter page claims
â through repeated training sessions , you can learn how to encourage good habits and discourage bad ones , â it says
â the calming program is designed to help manage stress by regulating the level of alpha and theta waves which have been linked to anxiety , panic disorder , and obsessive compulsive disorder
â the glasses are designed to use neurofeedback technology , which relays the information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head , to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness
mr greco , from paoli in pennsylvania , said : â neurofeedback has proven to be a useful tool in helping people improve their concentration , sleep , memory , anxiety and self - esteem
' â narbis brings neurofeedback out of the clinical setting and into your living room , office , air plane seat , park bench or anywhere you are
â mr greco âs kickstarter page says : â by doing just two short training sessions a week , you can improve your brain 's performance â and that just 10 sessions are needed before users start noticing a difference in their ability to concentrate
' narbis will come with five training sessions : one to boost a person 's ability to concentrate and learn and retain information , one to boost creativity and hand - eye coordination and another to help wearers fall asleep more easily
narbis will come with five training sessions , including one to boost a person 's ability to concentrate and learn and retain information , one to encourage creativity and hand - eye coordination and another to help wearers fall asleep more easily
one of the exercises is shown users will have to wear a connected armband - which holds a battery and extra electronics to provide a bluetooth connection â as well as the glasses , which have three sensors attatched the narbis system uses neurofeedback , which is described as exercise for the brain
the neurofeedback technology in the glasses relays information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head , to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness
studies have shown that neurofeedback training increases neuroplasticity , or the brain âs ability to form connections between brain cells , according to mr greco
the training has been proven to significantly improve people 's day to day lives by helping with concentration , sleep , anxiety , memory , self - esteem , fine motor skills , and overall mood
â significant results have been achieved in slowing the cognitive effects of ageing and improving learning challenges with lasting effects , â the kickstarter page says
there will also be a programme to boost self - confidence and self - awareness , as well as managing stress more effectively
users will have to wear a connected armband - which holds a battery and extra electronics to provide a bluetooth connection â and will be able to monitor their progress in exercises using an accompanying app and set goals for themselves
the neurofeedback system was originally developed by mr greco âs parents , domenic and lindsay greco , in partnership with nasa
in 2009 , domenic was diagnosed with the degenerative disease als but continued to work on the neurofeedback system with his son until he died in 2013
â it was the best opportunity of my life to work with my father on developing neurofeedback systems , â greco said
â i could n't have asked for a better partner and mentor
my father was a leader in his field and a true visionary
â he is raising money to put his glasses into production on crowd sourcing website kickstarter , where they can be pre-ordered from $ 295 ( Â£ 199 )
â narbis development is completed and we are ready to begin production , â he said
