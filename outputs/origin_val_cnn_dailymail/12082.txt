britain 's beer is getting weaker , with popular lagers such as stella artois and budweiser reducing alcohol content britain 's beer is getting weaker thanks to the rise in popularity of low - strength tipples and more health - conscious drinkers
despite the britain 's reputation as a country which enjoys a pint , two billion fewer units of alcohol were consumed over the last two years , according to official figures
the decline is largely because the strength of alcoholic drinks has fallen from an average of 4.42 per cent to 4.14 per cent over the two years , a report by the department of health says
increasingly health - conscious drinkers are also playing a part , the sunday telegraph reported , with a sharp rise in choice of lower - strength booze
brewers are also responding to lower tax rates imposed on beers with 2.8 per cent or less alcohol
the change in levy was followed by a number of brewers weakening their products , including carlsberg 's skol lager dropping from three per cent to 2.8 per cent
stronger lagers , such as becks , stella artois and budweiser , also reduced their alcohol levels from 5 per cent to 4.8 per cent , while john smith 's extra smooth bitter falling from 3.8 to 3.6 per cent
low - strength lagers introduced in recent years include beer - citrus fusions such as carling zest ( 2.8 per cent ) , carlsberg citrus ( 2.8 per cent ) and foster 's radler ( two per cent )
brigid simmons , chief executive of the british beer and pub association said : ' britain brewers have responded to consumer demand for a greater range and choice of lower - strength beers , many with new flavours and ingredients
' we âve seen the government âs decision to give 50 per cent tax relief to lower - strength beers combining with a growth in interest among consumers for lower - strength drinks like beer , that are also lower in calories
' while the number of units of alcohol consumed has decreased over the last years , britain still gets through more alcohol per head than most other nations the news comes a month after official figures showed the number of under - 25s who do not drink at all has increased by 40 per cent in eight years
a quarter of young people do not drink at all and binge drinking is falling , but britain still drinks more alcohol per head than most other countries
tom smith , from alcohol concern , said : ' while we welcome the decrease in the number of alcohol units in the market , we ca nât ignore the fact our nhs and communities continue to strain under the burden of alcohol harms
