lily was n't moving when rescuers found her , hanging upside down in her mother 's smashed car
it had flipped over into a frigid utah river half a day before , and the baby was still strapped in her seat
as officer jared warner dashed with the 18 - month - old in his arms to an ambulance , she was barely alive
but she 's doing better , her family said monday
" her improvement is astounding
right now she 's watching ' dora ( the explorer ) ' and singing ' ( the ) wheels on the bus ' with grandpa
she is smiling and laughing for family members
we 're blown away by lily 's progress and so grateful to her rescuers , " they said
lily 's mother , groesbeck , died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the spanish fork river
she was 25 years old
lily might have died unseen with her mother , had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot saturday
the angler waded into the river around noon , then noticed the car wheels - up in the water
" where the car was , you could n't see it from the roadway , " police lt. slaymaker said
the fisherman called emergency dispatch
police and fire rescuers arrived and sprang into the water
the rest of what happened is now a frenetic blur for officer dewitt
" i do n't remember doing anything but just doing it , " he said
the water was so cold that , when the rescue was over , seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia
they heaved the car onto its side and saw groesbeck in the driver 's seat
it was clear to them that she was dead
then they noticed the baby
" she was definitely unconscious and not responsive , " jared warner said
but she was still alive , and rescuers were delighted to see it
she was still strapped into her seat , where she may have been for 14 hours , if the wreck occurred when police believe it did
the night before , a man living nearby heard a loud crash and stepped outside to check , but he saw nothing unusual , police said , and dismissed it
that was at about 10:30 p.m. on friday
groesbeck 's car had probably just struck a bridge embankment
" the driver 's side tire went up the cement barrier on the south end of the bridge , launching this woman and her baby into the freezing water , " slaymaker told cnn affiliate kutv
the angler came along around 12:30 p.m. on saturday , 14 hours later
groesbeck 's death is tragic , but the survival of baby lily is a story filled with hope
but just how did the baby survive the ordeal ? above all , said cnn senior medical correspondent elizabeth cohen , the biggest factor was the car seat
lily was in the proper car seat and the seat appears to have been properly attached , elizabeth cohen said
even though the child was trapped and upside down , her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water
doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous , but would be even more so if the baby were wet
dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures , elizabeth cohen said
another factor may have been that the girl , as a toddler , has baby fat
if she had been an infant , it might have been a different story , elizabeth cohen said
it 's a reminder that the human body is tough
lily apparently survived for 14 hours in extreme cold , without food or drink
a mystery arose from the rescue : the police officers who entered the water say they heard a voice calling for help
the mother was dead , but the officers said that they heard an adult 's voice calling to them
" the four of us heard a distinct voice coming from the car , " jared warner told cnn
" to me , it did n't sound like a child 's voice
" the voice gave the rescuers a surge of adrenaline needed to push the vehicle upright , he said
the child was unconscious , but her eyelids were fluttering , and the rescuers knew she was alive , jared warner said
it 's one of those things that does n't have an explanation , he said about the voice
" it felt like i could hear someone telling me , ' i need help , ' " dewitt told cnn affiliate ksl
" it was very surreal , something that i felt like i could hear
" tyler beddoes , a third officer at the scene , said the same
" all i know is that it was there , we all heard it , and that just helped us to push us harder , like i say , and do what we could to rescue anyone inside the car , " he told cnn 's " anderson cooper 360
" the river is 10 feet deep in some places , police said , but the car hit a shallower spot
images showed it only partly covered by water
lily was not submerged , said police lt. matt johnson
firefighter paul tomadakis freed her from the wreck
he " grabbed the baby in my arm , raised its head up out of water , as i tried to release the seat belt , " he said
then jared warner took lily into his arms
" the child was passed to me and i ran up and climbed into the ambulance with the child , " he said
police have no explanation for the wreck
no alcohol or drugs were in play , they told kutv
there were no skid marks leading up to the impact
a tow truck hauled groesbeck 's car out of the river , and it will be inspected for possible mechanical failures
groesbeck 's family has set up a gofundme page for donations to help with medical expenses for lily , and funeral costs for her mother
late monday , it had reached more than $ 35,500 , surpassing its goal of $ 8,000
