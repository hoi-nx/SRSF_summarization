home : flames swept through the semi-detached house in penistone last year where the boys were staying with their carpet salesman father
neighbours said they heard no screams or cries for help from inside lost both sons : miss claire throssell said she believed jack attempted to save his brother paul during the fire but she added that he became â controlling â over the family after their birth of their sons , and would regularly lose his temper and criticise her for being â fat â
now miss claire throssell â who had her first mother âs day without the boys yesterday â said she has been helped through her grief by sleeping in the boys â bedroom , and has their ashes in a ring
two weeks ago , a coroner recorded that mr darren sykes committed suicide , while the verdict on the two boys was unlawful killing
the inquest in sheffield heard that before he died from burns in hospital , jack managed to tell police it was his father who started the fire - saying : ' my dad did it on purpose
' mr darren sykes , worried over access rights to his children , had ' coldly planned ' the fire at his home ' with the specific purpose of ending two young lives ' , the hearing was told
the inquest heard that mr darren sykes felt ' the world was against him ' after a meeting with cafcass - which represents children in family courts - two days before the tragedy
emotions : miss claire throssell ( pictured left at the funeral for her sons , right ) said she has been helped through her grief by sleeping in the boys â bedroom , and has their ashes in a ring ' to infinity and beyond ' : the boys quoted a catchphrase from buzz lightyear ( above ) in the toy story films he formed the impression that paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights
mr darren sykes lived in penistone after the split with his wife - and his sons lived with her at their grandmother 's home in nearby thurlstone
on the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets , transferring them into a female third party 's account
he spent Â£ 600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be ' engine drivers '
mr darren sykes then bought petrol cans , fuel and posted letters to family and friends - and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home
he picked up his sons on the evening of october 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft , he set the fire
funeral : mr darren sykes lived in penistone after the split with his wife - and his sons lived with her in thurlstone family : in a statement to an inquest earlier this month , miss claire throssell said her ' boys meant the world to me ' the inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house , he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door , letting himself in and locking it behind him
he took the keys upstairs before lighting more fires on the first floor , including in the children 's bedrooms
once this was done he then entered the loft , closing the hatch behind him
mr darren sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was ' going to be at peace '
a minute later , neighbours spotted the blaze and the fire service were called with the downstairs well ablaze
cord had been tied to the front and back garden gates as a barricade and a dining chair placed between the kitchen door and the door to the stairs so nobody could escape downstairs
petrol was used as an accelerant to start the fire with 16 pools of fuel on the ground floor and first floor
a patio door had been left partly open downstairs to fan the flames
in a statement to the inquest earlier this month , miss claire throssell said : ' my boys meant the world to me
they were both polite , well - mannered and caring , and you ca n't imagine life without them
' buzz lightyear is a space ranger hero and action figure owned by a boy in the toy story films
last november his catchphrase ' to infinity and beyond ' was voted the greatest line in movie history .
