she said the most testing part of her incredible trip has been camping in plunging temperatures and tackling wild bears along her route
she said : ' it was difficult because overnight the temperature dropped below -40c several times which made breathing in the tent very difficult
' there were ice particles in the air when i was up in alaska and northern canada between august and october
' some kind people invited me in to their homes but i mostly camped and i knew bears were around so at night my mind would play tricks on me
' there was no - one around and the sound of bears in the forest would keep me awake at night
' i only saw one bear on the bike when a brown grizzly ran across the path i was cycling on and disappeared
' but during the kayaking along the aleutian islands we saw lots of grizzly bears on the banks of the shore
' one evening i was in a stream having a wash and i suddenly saw this big grizzly bear walking towards me downstream
' all i could do was get out as quick as i could and luckily my clothes were on the shore so he had a good sniff of them and that slowed him down
' we were able to make a fuss and throw some stones in the water and luckily that scared him off but he was only a few feet away from us
