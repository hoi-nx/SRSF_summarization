the bomber command memorial in green park the bomber command memorial that honours 55,573 airmen killed in the war is maintained by the raf benevolant fund
a permanent monument was not built for 67 years due to the controversy of thousands of german civilians who died during the bombings of its cities
the memorial - which features a sculpture of seven bomber aircrew - was eventually unveiled in june 2012 at a dedication attended by the queen
a flypast of five tornados in a â v â formation was provided , and a lancaster dropped thousands of poppies over green park
but one year later in may 2013 a thug scrawled the word â islam â on the memorial using red paint - an act that veterans described as ' shocking ' and ' appalling '
les munro piloted one of 19 lancaster bombers on the second world war raid to bomb a series of dams in the industrial heartland of german
the mission resulted in eight of the planes being shot down and 53 crew out of 133 killed
despite the losses , the raid was a success with two dams breached by the ingenious bouncing bombs , wiping out scores of armament factories in the ruhr valley
mr les munro âs lancaster was struck by an anti-aircraft flak shell on the raid over holland , knocking a gaping hole in the fuselage and putting all communications out of use , forcing the crew to turn back still carrying its mine
he was awarded the distinguished service order for the raid and other sorties
guy gibson , who led the mission , received the victoria crosses
in 2013 sqn ldr munro visited the monument - which had been unveilved a year earlier - and afterwards said he was inspired to sell his medals in order to pay for a year âs maintenance of the memorial to keep it in pristine condition but the medals , log books and other associated memorabilia will now be donated to the museum of transport and technology in auckland
lord ashcroft , who owns the world âs largest collection of victoria crosses , said on twitter : â delighted that last dambuster pilot les munro has accepted my medals offer
â in addition to the peer âs donation , auction house dix noonan webb has waived its fees and expenses on the understanding that the auckland museum makes a further donation of Â£ 10,000 to the raf
christopher hill , director of client liaison at dix noonan webb , said : â we are delighted to have helped mr les munro realise his aim of raising a substantial amount of money towards the upkeep of the bomber command memorial
â we share his belief that the memory of more than 55,000 aircrew who gave their lives should be preserved and we have been in close consultation with him throughout this process
â mr les munro 's medals include the distinguished service order and distinguished flying cross as well as his efforts in the dambusters raid , he also led successful raids to wipe out e-boat and u-boat pens in le havre and boulogne - missions that helped the allied take control of normandy and france
he bombed german aircraft and armament factories , v1 , v2 and v3 rocket sites and dropped aluminium strips in the english channel to trick german radar operators into thinking the d - day landings were taking place at calais rather than normandy
mike neville , director of fundraising at the raf , added : â lord ashcroft âs most generous donation , in support of les munro âs desire to see his efforts of the second world war continue to bear fruit today and into the future , is simply terrific
â we are very pleased for les munro and delighted that he has realised his aim of supporting the raf in their duty of maintaining the bomber command memorial in perpetuity
' les munro âs sacrifice and lord ashcroft âs donation will help ensure the long - term future of the memorial
â bomber command suffered huge losses in the war , with 45 out of every 100 airmen killed .
