i âve been in plenty , â said nigel pearson
nigel pearson barks orders from the bench at king power stadium as leicester manage only a draw to hull nigel pearson knows he 's in a scrap for survival in the premier league but fighting to the end is n't new to him leicester , rooted to the bottom of the premier league and seven points from safety , look to have bleak prospects of reaching that stage still in contention to avoid the drop

the point is we âve got to perform
the players know we have nât done enough to win the game
i would like to have seen us show a bit more intent
