thomas has come out swinging in the wake of a report detailing that doping is still rife in the professional world of cycling , branding the findings as â insulting â
the team sky rider was reacting to claims made in the cycling independent reform commission report , which was published on monday
in it one â respected cycling professional â is said to believe that 90 per cent of the peloton are still benefiting from performance - enhancing drugs
thomas has taken aim at cycling independent reform commission 's report into doping in elite cycling , branding the findings as insulting the report alleges that the uci acted favourably to armstrong to protect the sport and that doping still takes place in the sport
however , unlike in armstrong 's days , its says riders now have a choice to dope or not that , according to thomas , is rubbish
â i think it âs a hell of a lot cleaner , â he told the bbc
â i did nât race back then , but some of the stories you hear â¦ it âs certainly not like that now
â whole teams were doing it back then
â it âs insulting when people say it [ cycling ] is really filthy and saying i âm doing something wrong
i dedicate everything to this
â you look at older riders â they are the most cynical about it all because they do nât know any other way
â look at brad [ wiggins ] and [ chris ] chris froome
i âd put all the money i have on them being clean
â thomas said he 'd bet that former tour de france champion chris froome is a clean rider
