hell and high water by sean as usual with books about crazed adventures and daft derring - do , this one , about the author âs attempt to swim the length of the british coastline , begins with an account of the preparation involved
however , very unusually for such books and adventures , sean âs account is mainly about what he has nât thought of doing
charity swimmer sean , 32 ( pictured ) , arriving at john oâgroats , in the north of scotland , after being the first person to swim from land âs end to john oâgroats just weeks before he âs due to dive into the sea off land âs end , he has nât done any training or sought any funding and has no â plan â to speak of
nor is this some long - held ambition of his
indeed , it seems that he only thought of this ultra-long - distance swim up the british coast because his attempt to cycle around the world did nât happen as he âd have wished â all was going well until he had a crash and , although he completed the pan-global bike ride , it could nât get him into the guinness world records
so , the swim is meant to fill that crucial gap in his cv
somehow , he manages to acquire three people to act as his support crew and a cut - price yacht , leaving Â£ 110 in his budget for everything else â supplies , equipment , the lot
not surprisingly , there are those who tell him he âs crazy and that he âd be best off spending his last Â£ 110 on the medication his gp would surely be only too happy to prescribe
but on our hero ploughs , somehow gaining a bit of sponsorship ( partly from speedo , the trunks people ) and eventually managing to get his support crew to land âs end to start his big swim
only to discover two problems
first , there âs the temperature : â i slowly walked into the water , â sean recalls , â and was surprised at how cold it was
turns out the sea is not only cold , it apparently also has these things called tides
as he âs settling down to his first crawl , it begins to dawn on conway that he âll have to time his swims so that he âs going with the tide rather than against it â because even michael phelps at full tilt would nât be a match for the current and would start to go backwards
which is exactly what happens to sean
soon after , there âs another problem â seasickness , for sean , as well as two of his support crew
there are lots and lots of other dangers ahead , almost all of them coming as a shock to our intrepid swimmer
between cornwall and the north coast of scotland , there will be whirlpools , riptides , the mountainous seas off cape wrath , busy shipping lanes , a tornado warning and toxic jellyfish
plus his scabby toe gets worse daily , his wetsuit does nât fit properly , he has to eat about 8,000 calories a day , often in mid-swim , and the protein shakes are giving him wind something dreadful
sean âs original â plan â was that he âd be swimming for two months
a thousand miles of coastline , call it 900 miles for luck , 15 miles a day , 60 days â swimming
simples ! well , not quite
his daily distance is initially so low that , by his new calculations , it will take him two years to reach john oâgroats
then , amazingly , he starts to grind out the miles
more calamities lie in store â running out of money , losing members of his support crew â but sean copes with them all
and , astonishingly , remarkably and record - breakingly , 135 days after he walked into the surprisingly cold sea off land âs end , he swims into john oâgroat âs harbour
