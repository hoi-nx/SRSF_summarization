defender ben gibson is hoping england ' 3 - 2 friendly victory over germany was a dress rehearsal for a european championship finals showdown
both sides will head for the czech republic during the summer as manager southgate attempts to guide the young lions to glory , and england will do so having got the better of their german counterparts with a 3 - 2 win at the riverside on monday evening
southgate 's men had to come from behind twice to set the stage for a late decisive push , and middlesbrough 's ben gibson is hoping that will stand them in good stead for the finals tournament

you know they are going to be technical and strong , and that 's what they were
but we thought we could match them - we did that and ended up getting the result
' we are hoping we will play against them at some point either in the semi-final or final in the euros - that would be nice
it would be another tough game
' they are a good side , so for us to get the win , that was the important thing
' the win against germany was england 's third against fellow finalists with portugal and the hosts having already succumbed at their hands , and while southgate is confident progress is being made , he is taking nothing for granted
england were heading towards defeat before nathan redmond 's strike on 79 minutes he said : ' we have got depth , which really excites me because i do n't think you can go to a tournament relying on a couple of players
' we have shown across the campaign - we started with the likes of raheem [ sterling ] in , we have had luke shaw in , we have had to win matches without all of these players at different times , without harry [ kane ] , without saido [ berahino ] , and they have kept doing it
' and then new players have emerged , people like jesse [ jess lingard ] , who has come back from injury and who has got great potential ; alex pritchard has just come into the squad
' the 23 , i am probably reasonably clear on 21
there are a couple of places that still , in my mind , people are playing for , but i know whoever goes is totally committed
there wo n't be any loafing around , there wo n't be any lads who feel it 's a chore to go

' england 's players had to back each other throughout a testing 90 minutes on teesside during which impressive kaiserslautern striker philipp hofmann fired the visitors into a 15th - minute lead and after manchester united winger jess lingard , currently on loan at derby , had levelled , restored their lead five minutes after the restart
but there was to be a twist and after norwich 's nathan redmond had made it 2 - 2 10 minutes from time , skipper james ward-prowse capped a fine individual display with an 82nd - minute winner , to the delight of a crowd of 30,178

he said : ' it was a fantastic occasion
not just to represent your country , but to do it on your home ground is a bit of a dream come true
' it was a fantastic moment and the fans were brilliant
i got a great reception and i ca n't thank them enough for that
