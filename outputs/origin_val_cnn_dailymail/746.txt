this weekend 's fa cup action unsurprisingly brought up a number of talking points
here , sportsmail 's graham poll talks us through the key events from liverpool 's fa cup quarter - final draw with blackburn on sunday
marriner was well served by not giving decisions at anfield , where there were four decent penalty appeals
while one could make a case â certainly technically â for three of the four to be given , i felt marriner got every one of those decisions right
liverpool âs best chance of a penalty was their first appeal when adam lallana went down under pressure from kilgallon
liverpool attacker adam lallana ( right ) was denied a penalty after tumbling from a challenge by kilgallon adam lallana ca n't believe it after referee marriner waves away his protests while slow - motion replays perhaps indicated that kilgallon may not have played the ball , he certainly appeared to from all angles at full speed
the other two appeals in the first half were for handball and both were accidental
blackburn defender kilgallon ( left ) also made contract with sturridge in the box during the second half early in the second half , sturridge felt kilgallon âs arm make contact so he went to ground , knowing he was nât going to reach the pass played for him
once again , marriner was right to allow play to continue , understanding that not every contact is a foul .
