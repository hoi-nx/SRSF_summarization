a study of 2,000 people revealed the average britons person had nât written any type of letter for at least 18 months and had not sent a postcard in two years britons people are losing their sentimental side with many admitting they have not sent a handwritten thank you note or post card or put together a physical photo album in years
the study of 2,000 people revealed the average person had n't written any type of letter for at least 18 months or sent a post card within the last two years
experts found one in five had recently sold a family heirloom because they did n't have the space for it or because it was ' too old fashioned ' to place on display
modern living appears to make us cherish items less , with a third admitting they are ruthless at throwing things out , while nearly half of those polled described their home as minimalist
the study found four in ten admit not being as sentimental as their parents and getting less so the older they get
results showed the average person had n't hand - written a letter for 19 months , had n't sent a postcard in nearly two years or even hand - written a thank you for 20 months
other sentimental acts are also fading - one in four has never made a cd for someone or made a home - made card , while a fifth never keeps things from their relationship as mementoes
just a third actually bothers to keep physical photos now and a fifth instantly chucks out all the birthday and christmas cards they receive
hanging on to stuff proved a declining trend with people ridding themselves of any heirlooms or old possessions quickly - jewellery , furniture and clothing are the most common things passed down that people get rid of
the study of 2,000 people found four in ten britons admit to not being as sentimental as their parents the survey found 77 per cent feel people are obsessed with being online - and it 's making us less sentimental old crockery , clocks and bone china are also rarely cherished or able to be kept due to a lack of room or not fitting the look of the home
but minimal living can have its drawbacks - 47 per cent of those who had discarded an heirloom later regretted it , because they would not be able to pass it on to their children
accessories ( eg : glasses , broach , watch ) 12
recipe books and folders 15
wedding photographs the biggest reason for losing our sentimental sides was because ' it 's all online now ' followed by the feeling we live in a ' throwaway culture ' but 68 per cent said they like receiving hand written letters in the post and a further six in ten admitted they get excited when they receive a gift in the mail
mark walters , managing director of interparcel , said : ' in a fast - moving modern world it 's easy to forget to stop and appreciate certain things as fully as the generations before us did
' our homes are sleeker , our technology is increasingly compact and as a result the heirlooms or things that may have emotional value can seem out of place or ill - fitting
' results showed people are quicker to throw things out than perhaps they used to be and many do n't feel as sentimental about things as they did
' whether it 's sending a thoughtful gift , a handwritten note or a postcard , keeping that personal touch in day to day life is important
