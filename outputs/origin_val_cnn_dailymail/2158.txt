loblaws , canada 's largest food retailer , is selling â ugly â groceries that are up to 30 per cent cheaper than more aesthetically pleasing products the wonky food is being sold for a campaign called no name naturally imperfect and will begin with apples and potatoes the supermarket said that produce in the naturally imperfect program was previously used in juices , sauces or soups , or may not have been harvested due to their small size loblaw senior vice president ian gordon pointed out that customers often put too much stock in the look of food
he said in a statement : â we often focus too much on the look of produce rather than the taste
once you peel or cut an apple you ca n't tell it once had a blemish or was misshapen
â no name naturally imperfect is a great example of loblaw and our vendors coming together to find an innovative way to bring nutritious food options to consumers at a great price
â the supermarket said that produce in the naturally imperfect program was previously used in juices , sauces or soups , or may not have been harvested due to their small size
it said : â with this program , loblaw is working to ensure farmers have a market for smaller , misshapen fruit ensuring it does not go to waste
â loblaw senior vice president ian gordon said customers often put too much stock in the look of food it âs estimated that around $ 31billion worth of food is wasted in canada every year
loblaws recently said it plans to spend $ 1.2billion on infrastructure in 2015 , which includes building 50 new stores
earlier this year , loblaw âs former chief operating officer , philips , was ousted from uk supermarket giant morrisons
the chain âs board said that it wanted a â fresh pair of eyes â to oversee its revival push
morrisons , the uk 's fourth largest grocer , has grappled with a long period of declining sales and profitability but mr philips said recent trading offered signs that the turnaround plan announced last year was starting to pay off .
