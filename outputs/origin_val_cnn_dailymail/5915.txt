gop sen. cruz , appearing this morning in his first nationally - broadcast interview since announcing yesterday that he would run for president , attempted to shed his conservative hardliner image
cruz said social liberals were ' absolutely ' welcome in his version of the gop and that he 's willing to compromise - as long as those concessions move the country forward
' i have never said i wo n't compromise , ' cruz told today 's matt lauer after the abc news host asked if he 'd bring the same brand of ' no compromise ' politics to the white house that he 's brought to the senate
' i have never said i wo n't compromise , ' he told today 's matt lauer after the abc news host asked if he 'd bring the same brand of ' no compromise ' politics to the white house that he 's brought to the senate the 44 - year - old texas senator contended that from day one he has said he 'd compromise the way that revered gop president reagan did
' what do you do if they offer you half a loaf ? answer : you take it , ' he said , ' and then come back
' confronted with a past statement in which he said , ' i do n't think washington needs is more compromise , ' cruz suggested to matt lauer that his words had been misinterpreted
' what washington does often is it compromises going backwards , ' he said
' i 'm perfectly happy to work with anyone , democrat , independent , libertarian , gop , if they are shrinking the size and power of the federal government , if they are turning around the debt , if they 're expanding liberty
' cruz said that lawmakers in the nation 's capitol often makes deals that are ' not a good compromise ' thought because they do n't fix the problem at hand
a freshman senator , cruz said he 's sought ' more than anything else ' during his time in the federal government is to ' tell the truth ' and ' do what i said i would do
' though voters may not always agree with his principles , the conservative lawmaker said he believes they can respect that he stays true to his word
with his run for the white house cruz said he hopes to rebuild the coalition that elected reagan and attract more women , hispanics and young people to the gop
presidential candidate - in - waiting rand paul suggested in an interview monday night on fox news that his senate colleague panders too much to conservatives to grow the gop , however
acknowledging that he and cruz have ' very , very similar voting records , ' rand paul said ' what makes us different is probably our approach as to how we would make the party bigger
' ' and i âm a big believer that you should stand on principle , and be true to your principles
but i also think that we should take those principles and try to bring in new people with them , ' he asserted
rand paul pointed out that as part of his preparations for a national run , he 's traveled to areas that gop do n't traditionally campaign in and spoken to groups such as the naacp that gop have n't historically engaged with
' and maybe not just throwing out red meat , but actually throwing out something intellectually enticing to people who have nât been listening to our message before
' continuing he said , ' so , it is nât just about rousing the base , it âs about exciting the base by being for the principles of liberty , but it âs then taking those principles of liberty , not diluting them , and taking them to new people and bringing them into the party
' that âs the way you win general elections
' the 52 - year - old freshman lawmaker argued that his approach makes him more viable in a general election that other conservatives vying for the nomination - including cruz
' there will be a lot of conservatives
cruz is a conservative , but it also goes to winnability , and people will have to make a decision which is the gop that can not only excite the base , but can also bring new people into the party without giving up principles , ' he said , noting that he fares better in polls against presumed democratic presidential candidate , and nominee , hillary clinton

' and cruz said , " wow , " he said , " the same is true for me
i spend my day talking about you !
