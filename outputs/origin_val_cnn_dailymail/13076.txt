europe is in the midst of a political and economic crisis that threatens to unravel decades of europe integration and derail the world 's recovery from the great recession
to understand this crisis , let 's compare two countries
country a is a small nation with a long history of tax evasion , government debt defaults and a dysfunctional business and regulatory climate
it allows workers to retire in their 50s , and pays double pensions when they do
it lied about its budget to get into the eurozone
country b is a large , historically powerful nation with a record of low government debt
country b even ran budget surpluses , including a 2 % surplus just before the financial crisis hit in 2008
it entered the eurozone with an honest accounting of its finances
if you guessed that country a is greece , you are correct
if you believe greece has caused the crisis in europe because of its fiscal irresponsibility , then you are safely in the mainstream opinion about the matter
but what do we make of fiscally responsible country b ? its virtuousness must mean it is weathering the crisis
and it must be germany , right ? wrong
far from prospering , spain is doing terribly
spain 's unemployment rate is 23.7 % , down from a high of almost 27 % in 2013
more than a fifth of its workers have been jobless for the last four years
more than half of its young people are out of work and have been for years
there is regularly talk of a lost generation in spain and greece
like greece , spain 's investment bubble burst when the financial crisis hit and it had to seek a bailout ( although a much smaller one ) to prevent its domestic banks from collapsing
spain 's economy also shrank during the crisis and its debt to gdp ratio has shot up dramatically
if greece and spain have such wildly different approaches to fiscal prudence , what can explain the crisis they both find themselves in ? the answer is not fiscal virtue
something else is going on
that something else , in large part , is the euro
joining the eurozone meant spain and greece gave up the power to create money , the power to devalue their currency to restore competitiveness , and the power to set interest rates
these are not trivial concessions , especially in a currency union like the euro where transfers between rich and poor sectors of the economy are limited , strict budget rules deny individual countries the flexibility to react to a crisis , and trade between euro - area nations is severely imbalanced
the inability to set interest rates in line with the economic conditions meant that in the early 2000s , spain and greece could n't raise interest rates to cool their over-heating economies
the over-heating was largely caused , by the way , by the frenzied ( and ultimately reckless ) lending in both countries by germany and other core europe banks
the european central bank set interest rates in line with economic conditions in germany and france that proved too low for spain and greece ( and ireland )
read : 25 people to blame for the financial crisis the over-heating of the greece and spain economies led to inflation and investment bubbles
as those bubbles burst , the banks neared collapse , and their rescue led ultimately to a sovereign debt crisis
the inability of spain and greece to print money meant they had to borrow from their partners in europe or default and be ignominiously tossed out of the eu
strict budget rules of eurozone membership also required spain and greece to impose austerity measures in the middle of the worst financial crisis since the great depression
they were required to raise taxes and cut spending even as unemployment reached astronomical levels
austerity helped create a depression of historic magnitude in greece and a severe recession in spain
the policies also created runaway public debt
greece 's debt is now 175 % of gdp
spain 's debt to gdp ratio is 100 % -- a level not seen in spain in more than 100 years
because spain and greece can not devalue the euro , the only way they can become competitive is through internal devaluation
this means greece and spain are in for years of high unemployment , reduced living standards , falling wages and deflation
in other words , massive impoverization
mario draghi , head of the european central bank , famously said : " the euro is forever
" that may or may not be so , but it does n't mean that countries like greece and spain should stay in the euro forever
contrary to popular opinion , this crisis can not be explained away with a moral tale of greece fiscal irresponsibility
the facts suggest otherwise .
