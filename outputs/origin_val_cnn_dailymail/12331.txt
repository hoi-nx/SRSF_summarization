nigeria go to the polls on march 28 in a tight contest , which is getting extra attention after the original date was rescheduled at the last minute
many voters will be holding their registration card in one hand , and their mobile in the other -- making democratic history with the help of tech. in south africa 's largest mobile phone market , programs to encourage citizens to get involved in the election have been gaining traction
" nigeria are looking for information , " says longe , co-founder of co-creation hub which meshes tech and social issues
" technology is helping people get involved in the conversation around democracy and elections , which is very important , as the general interest in the air has waned since the voting date was changed
" as incumbent goodluck jonathan prepares to face - off against former military ruler muhammadu buhari , longe and his team have developed techsquad -- a gang of geeks who work on web - projects that help citizens vote
pre-vote prep one such project is govote.ng , a popular website that is focused on the registration process -- that 's crucial as in south africa 's most populous country , with over 170 million citizens , the logistics can be staggering
" most nigeria have no idea where they are registered , " explains longe
" we want to simplify the entire election process , [ and ] make it responsive to users
" people log on to the site to see whether they are registered with the nigeria inec ( inec ) and , if not , they can find out how and where to register
techsquad says approximately 10,000 people visit the site each day
finger 's influence other squads concentrate on the next step

" the rescheduling of the election ... did affect the level of voter enthusiasm , " explains yiaga program manager , cynthia mbamalu
" while there are certain concerns about security and the guarantee of free , fair and credible elections , the interest in this election is founded on the belief that this time votes will count
" personality problem this election will be the first since nigeria re-calculated it 's gdp and pulled ahead of south africa to become the continent 's biggest economy
with a nominal gdp of $ 510 billion , and an oil sector that makes up 96 % of total export earnings , the outcome of the vote will be closely watched by policy makers and businesses all over the world
politicians , however , stand accused of relying on personalities rather than policies when it comes to winning votes
" the strength of a leader 's personality and his key personal networks are playing a very strong role , " says jasper veen , nigeria director at national democratic institute
" both flag - bearers occasionally attempt to articulate policy positions -- it is still a far cry from policy - based politics
" and this is set to be a particular issue in this poll , as some seek a strongman who can defeat boko haram militants in the north-east -- the main justification authorities used when explaining the decision to delay the vote by six weeks
to fight this popularity contest , techsquad collaborated with the centre for democracy and development ( cdd ) to produce ngmanifesto.org , which explains what the parties plan to do to improve education , the economy and infrastructure
and once a government is elected , the site will track whether election pledges become reality
' quick count ' technology will also play a big role on voting day

the process aims to bring transparency to the elections , and will be assisted by niger 's former prime minister , mahamadou danda , who is part of a smaller team of international observers organized by the national democratic institute
such independent observation is likely to speak to the thousands of citizens concerned with governance in the country
a recent afrobarometer poll found that 68 % of respondents are " not very " or " not at all " satisfied with the way democracy is working in nigeria
another approach to inspire citizens to get involved in the election is the nigeria constitution app which has been downloaded almost 1 million times according to the indigo trust
by making the constitution available on mobile phones , the app aims to teach citizens about national laws and inspire them to vote
and there 's also budgit -- a site that publishes state and federal budgets for all to see
the list of election - based websites and apps goes on -- too many to mention here
but , while the election outcome is yet to be seen , it seems that the tech involved could bring a formidable force to the ballot box
