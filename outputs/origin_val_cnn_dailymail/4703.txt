dortmund boss klopp is confident his side can overturn a 2 - 1 champions league first leg deficit against juve on wednesday due to their watertight defence
the improving germans , who have recovered after a dismal first half to the domestic season that saw them anchored in last place as recently as last month in the bundesliga , have kept a clean sheet in their last three league games , including a 0 - 0 draw against cologne on the weekend
with neven subotic and mats hummels back fit in central defence , along with full backs marcel schmelzer and lukasz piszczek , dortmund 's defence has been as solid as it has been all season

' we want to advance to the quarter - finals and we can do this
' dortmund boast a fine record at home in europe having won 11 of their last 14 champions league games at the westfalenstadion
but in order to book a spot in the last eight they have to snap a losing run at home against juve , having lost all three previous encounters against the italian in dortmund
klopp will be counting on goals from pierre-emerick aubameyang , who has scored five in his last seven outings and in - form marco reus , who has struck five times in eight games
marco reus cancelled out carlos tevez 's opener before alvaro morata scored a 42nd - minute winner juve are flying high in serie a , edging closer to the italian title with their first triumph away from home in over two months at palermo , opening up a 14 - point lead
' one less win needed to win the league , ' juve manager massimiliano allegri said , knowing he will now need to shift his focus to dortmund and their attacking game
' we will need to take the lead there , maybe score more than one goal , ' said the coach
they will , however , be without influential playmaker andrea pirlo who has yet to fully recover from a thigh injury suffered in the first leg
' he has made good progress but not enough to be in dortmund , ' the club said in a statement
klopp knows that his side will have to be at their absolute best to overcome high - flying serie a giants juve dortmund have won 11 of their last 14 home ties in the champions league at the westfalenstadion
