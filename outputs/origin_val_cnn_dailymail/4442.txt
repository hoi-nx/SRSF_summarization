gomis was given a clean bill of health on thursday after revealing his shocking mid-game collapse was caused by the stress of his father âs ill health
the france was discharged from hospital in london in the morning having fainted eight minutes into swansea âs 3 - 2 defeat against spurs at white hart lane
there were distressing echoes of fabrice muamba âs collapse at the same ground three years ago , with spurs â substitute goalkeeper friedel admitting he â feared the worst â as he watched the striker slump to the ground
gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during swansea 's game with spurs medical staff attended to the france international for four minutes before he regained consciousness concerned spurs players look on as the swansea forward is attended to my medical staff but hospital tests through the night have found no deeper cause for concern beyond the 29 - year - old âs vasovagal condition , which the wales club insist they have been aware of since before they signed the player from lyon last summer
a senior club source told sportsmail that knowledge of at least three previous episodes involving gomis in france meant they were â extra rigorous â in testing him during his medical and cardiology exams
a source close to the player confirmed those tests took place in a specialist facility in cardiff ahead of gomis âs bosman move to south wales
the france tweeted to insist he was feeling better , claiming he fainted because of the anxiety caused by his father âs illness
he said : â i wanted to reassure you concerning my health
it actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous , and i am feeling well now
gomis , who has a history of blacking out , is taken off the field on a stretcher at white hart lane spurs midfielder nabil bentaleb ( right ) holds his head in his hands as gomis is taken off on a stretcher players from both sides appear shocked as referee michael oliver prepares to restart the game â i have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father âs health , which requires me to go back and forth from france
â i was disappointed that i could nât help my team tonight ( wednesday ) , but now everything is back in order
i also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages
â the striker will not return to training until tuesday , though the time off was agreed for the whole squad ahead of wednesday âs incident , with swansea not playing again until monday week âs clash against liverpool
he is expected to return to france imminently
club officials were adamant on wednesday night that gomis has suffered no previous issues with fainting since his arrival at the liberty stadium , though the dressing room had been made aware of a condition that is understood to have first affected the striker when he was 14
a vasovagal syncope , which is what gomis suffered on wednesday night , is caused by a sudden decrease in blood pressure or heart - rate , triggered by emotional or physical factors
reduced blood flow to the brain makes a person faint
it can be prompted by extreme exertion or anxiety
on the physical side , there are numerous tests that can be done when a player has a medical and it appears swansea knew all about gomis âs history
they will have checked the flow through his blood vessels under exercise stress , though emotional triggers are harder to quantify
it is a rare condition for a professional sportsman and is more common in older people
it is not something i have encountered in any other footballer
thankfully , it is not an especially dangerous condition in isolation
the risks are low beyond what happens when you fall
you could hit your head or suffer trauma damage to another part of the body on landing
often there is a stimulus that the person will recognise and they can act , by sitting down
most sufferers feel fine in a matter of moments

gomis is believed to have collapsed a third time in a ligue 1 match for lyon against monaco in august 2010

' it was something that had to be dealt with , of course , but it was nothing in the stratosphere of what went on with fabrice muamba
