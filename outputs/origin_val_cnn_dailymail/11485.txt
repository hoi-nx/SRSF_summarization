two michigan police officers have been applauded for their kindness after buying a child car seat for a hard - up couple rather than issuing them a ticket
officers jason pavlige , 32 , and james hodges , 26 , of fruitport township , michigan responded to a call made by a mcdonald 's worker who was concerned that a baby was not properly secured in a car seat when her parents picked up some food from the restaurant
when the officers stopped the couple 's car , they found the 10 - month - old girl sitting in her mother 's lap while her father drove the vehicle
the couple , who have not been identified , explained that they did not have the means to buy a seat
' we tried to have them contact family but they do n't have anyone close
there were no co-workers , no one who could help them out
' rather than giving the couple a ticket , the officers decided on a different tact
' we spoke with each other and made the decision to go get them a car seat so we 'd know the kid was safe and that this issue would n't come up again , ' james hodges said
the two men pooled their money and , while jason pavlige stayed with the family , james hodges went to a local walmart to buy a new car seat for the baby
they installed the seat and showed the shocked couple how to use it
quick - thinking : after learning the family could not afford a car seat for their child , the two officers pooled their money and went to this walmart to buy a new seat before installing it for the shocked couple ' they did n't say much but were just very appreciative , ' james hodges said
the two officers did n't tell anyone about their good deed , which they carried out in february , but it came to light after a walmart employee called the police station to let their superiors know
but the men said they were simply doing their jobs
' we made the decision that was what we needed to do to solve the issue , ' james hodges said
' it 's just part of what police officers do on a daily basis
' in a letter to the officers , public safety director ken doctor thanked the men for their actions , mlive reported
' this certainly goes above and beyond what is expected of you in serving our community , ' his letter read
' it reflects the care and compassion of the officers serving fruitport township
not the first time : in 2009 , jason pavlige ( left ) was given a ' life saving award ' for saving a golfer who had a heart attack
he is pictured with resident david wingate sr. , who helped him , and police chief paul smutz ' sincere thanks for representing our department so well and providing , great service to the community
