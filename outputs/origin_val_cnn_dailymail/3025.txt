gathered in their hundreds , spectators crowd round to watch as two dogs are forced to fight to the death in barbaric cages
these shocking scenes from northern china drew outrage from animal rights activists in the country , who have called for a change in the law to protect the canines
but the local villagers who organised the event have defended the dogfights as necessary ' entertainment ' in an isolated part of the country
the competition was open to anyone who brought a dog along , and the winner of each bout was rewarded with a pack of cigarettes and a china mug
one of the organisers , shi pan , 45 , protested that because the village was in a poor rural area , the locals had to resort to creating their own entertainment
he said : ' people in the city criticise our dogfights but they have all sorts of money to pay for entertainments which we do n't have access to
we have to organise things to entertain ourselves
' while banned in some countries , dogfights are a common attraction in northern china which hosts more than 100 festivals each year attracting visitors from neighboring provinces and tourists alike
police have said the event did not breach any laws and that there have been no official complaints
they added that some of the people who who turned up had allegedly grabbed stray dogs off the street , and claimed they were their pets
attraction : while banned in some countries , dog fights are a common attraction in northern china violent : despite the vicious scenes sparking outrage , organisers have insisted that the dogfights are part of the traditional ' entertainment ' in the area brutal : the dogs are forced to fight to the death in cages , leading to calls from animal rights activists for new cruelty laws rural : organiser shi pan declared the dogfights as a ' great success ' and added : ' we plan to do the same thing next year ' china has no animal cruelty laws , and a person who damages a dog or another animal can only be prosecuted for damaging property if the animal belongs to somebody
dogfighting is illegal , but only if it involves bets
simply allowing the animals to fight purely for entertainment comes into a grey area where it is difficult to prosecute anyone involved
chung lu , an animal rights activist in the country said , said : ' events like these are exactly why we need a functioning animal cruelty law in china , because people do that they want and get away with it unless they know the law can stop them
' but a defiant shi pan said : ' it was a great success , we plan to do the same thing again next year
and we do n't care what the people in the city say
