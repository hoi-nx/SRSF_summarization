wyatt has won the right to fight for a payout from her ex-husband energy businessman vince , 20 years after they divorced she has taken jobs picking fruit , and since the mid- 1990s has lived largely on benefits
her current home is a former council house in monmouth , south wales , bought on a mortgage for Â£ 60,000 under right - to - buy laws
it was described in court as being damp and badly heated
by contrast , her former husband has founded ecotricity , now one of the uk 's biggest green energy companies , worth at least Â£ 57million
the strict vegan lives in a Â£ 3million 18th century castle near stroud , gloucestershire , with his second wife and their five - year - old son
mr vince also owns forest green rovers football club where he has banned red meat for players and supporters
mr vince 's son dane moved in with his father in 2001 after the business began to take off
in december 2012 a judge ordered the ex-husband to pay ms wyatt Â£ 125,000
but he challenged the ruling and appeal court judges struck it out
yesterday , supreme court justices ruled in favour of ms wyatt and said her claim should be heard by a judge in the court of the court
she is demanding almost Â£ 2million
lord wilson , speaking for all five justices , said that under 1973 divorce legislation the courts should have taken into account the years ms wyatt looked after the couple 's son
' he was brought up by ms wyatt , ' the judge said
' she struggled to do so
they were 16 years of real hardship for her and her family
at times they lived in caravans
they lived from hand to mouth
' lord wilson said the burden had fallen on ms wyatt and her contribution had been unmatched by mr vince
mr vince turned from new age traveller to the founder of a multi-million green energy firm , ecotricity wyatt ( left ) pictured with lawyer reeves ( right ) after justices said the case could be heard ms wyatt is pictured leaving the supreme court today ( left ) after judges ruled her application can be heard by the court and in 2003 ( right ) after the two new age travellers had divorced as a result , the case should now be reconsidered by a family court , he said
lord wilson added : ' unwisely , miss wyatt has pitched her claim at Â£ 1.9million and it is obvious â¦ that an award approaching that size is out of the question
her claim may even be dismissed
wyatt 's legal victory opens the way for divorcees to claim a pay - off from their ex-spouse decades later
supreme court judges â lady hale , lord clarke , lord wilson , lord hughes and lord hodge â said appeal judges had been wrong to throw ms wyatt 's original case out on the basis she had no reasonable grounds , in 2013
the justices said under the 1973 matrimonial causes act , a family judge in a divorce case must consider who has cared for the home and any children
lawyers said the case would encourage copycat claims
james brown , of firm jmw , said : ' it amounts to nothing short of a call to action â¦ [ it ] underlines how there is no limit on when someone can make a claim
it does n't matter whether you divorce in your 20s and return with a claim when you 're 80
' there was no recorded financial settlement from ms wyatt 's divorce
' but there is â¦ a real prospect that she will secure a comparatively modest award , perhaps of a size which would enable her to purchase a somewhat more comfortable mortgage - free home
' ms wyatt 's solicitor , reeves of law firm mishcon de reya , said : ' she looks forward to concluding the litigation as quickly as possible
' ms reeves added that mishcon would try to win a costs order against mr vince to cover its fees , which have so far swallowed up all but Â£ 2,539 of the Â£ 125,000 awarded to ms wyatt in the earlier court hearing
after the ruling , mr vince said : ' i am disappointed that the supreme court has decided not to bring this case to an end now , over 30 years since the relationship ended
' we both moved on and started families of our own
' for my part the passing of time is extremely prejudicial , it 's been so long that there are no records â¦ it 's hard to defend yourself in such circumstances
indeed , the delay itself has enabled the claim , because there is no paperwork in existence
' he added : ' i feel that we all have a right to move on and not be looking over our shoulders
this could signal open season for people who had brief relationships a quarter of a century ago
it 's mad in my opinion
' ecotricity has earned mr vince considerable wealth and he spent almost Â£ 1million building his electric supercar , nemesis , from a second hand second - hand lotus exige
