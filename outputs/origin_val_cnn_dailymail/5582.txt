unmasked : jihadi john has been identified as mohammed emwazi a charity that funded the human rights group which described jihadi john as a â beautiful young man â has been forced to halt further donations
the joseph rowntree charitable trust had made six - figure donations to cage , but links with the â warped â campaign group prompted outrage from westminster and the threat of a charity commission inquiry
the mail has also highlighted criticism of cage and its pronouncements about jihadi john , identified as mohammed emwazi , for the past week
last night the rowntree trust reluctantly agreed to stop bankrolling cage after officials at the charity commission â furious over cage âs support for the is killer â threatened a statutory inquiry into its leadership if it refused to give â unequivocal assurances â it would withdraw funding
cage caused outrage last week over its attempts to justify the killings meted out by kuwaiti - born briton emwazi , because he had claimed to have been harassed by mi5
the campaign group gave an extraordinary press briefing about emwazi â carried live at length on the bbc and sky â after he was identified as the man behind the mask of jihadi john
asim qureshi , its research director , described one of the world âs most wanted terrorists as a â beautiful young man â , â extremely gentle â and â the most humble young person that i ever knew â
the 32 - year - old blamed uk security services for mohammed emwazi âs radicalisation , saying he had tried to fit in but had been made to feel like an â outsider â
and on thursday night , asim qureshi was a guest on bbc1 âs this week , which appeared to expose him as a cheerleader for jihad
â cage has been propped up largely by grants from the joseph rowntree charitable trust since 2007 , making a combined total of Â£ 305,000
the trust said its last grant payment to cage was in january 2014
a separate charity , the roddick foundation , has also handed over Â£ 120,000 to cage
the charity commission wrote to the rowntree and roddick charities on monday , giving them 24 hours to give unambiguous assurances they would stop funding cage
' warped ' cage 's research director asim qureshi ( left ) at a press conference about jihadi john last week while officials at roddick gave â immediate â guarantees they would pull the plug , the rowntree charity dragged its heels and agreed to stop funding cage only after the charity commission threatened to launch an inquiry into how it is run
a source said rowntree complained of â unprecedented regulatory pressure â when they eventually backed down
the source added : â very reluctantly , and with very little grace , rowntree caved in at the 11th hour
it is extraordinary how they dithered over whether cage was a suitable organisation to fund
â the charity commission started investigating both the rowntree and roddick charities over their funding of cage in 2013
much of the rest of its income comes from cash donations from muslim
last week lord carlile , a former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation , said : â cage is an organisation with a warped view
no sensible person should be funding it
â sources at the charity commission believe officials at rowntree may have been â duped â when they agreed to support cage
the mail has highlighted criticism of cage and its pronouncements about jihadi john , identified as mohammed emwazi , for the past week in a statement rowntree said : â in the last week we have been put under intense regulatory pressure to rule out any future funding of cage
â in the light of regulatory pressure , and to protect the interests of all our grantees and the other work of the joseph rowntree charitable trust , we have decided to confirm we will not fund cage either now or in the future
â a charity commission spokesman said : â statements by cage officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities
in these circumstances , [ we ] required unequivocal assurances from the two charities that they have ceased funding cage and had no intention of doing so in the future
we are glad both the roddick foundation and the joseph rowntree charitable trust have ceased funding cage
â a cage spokesman said last night : â we respect their decision
we thank them for their past support
â both of these charities have played a significant role in contributing to the development of muslim civil society here in the uk
