at first glance , it looks like any other f - 16 fighter jet - except for one difference
boeing 's new qf-16 is a actually a retired us air force jet converted into a drone
the pilotless plane can be controlled from the ground , and will used for target practice by ' top gun ' pilots
126 of the converted planes will be used by the air force as flying targets to train top gun pilots
length : 49 ft , 5 in
span : 32 ft , 8 in
takeoff weight : 37,500 lbs max : 1,500 mph max altitude : 50,000 ft plus range : 2,425 mi engine : one 27,000 - lb - thrust pratt & whitney f100 the first production qf - 16 optionally manned target drone has been delivered to the air force ( air force ) , air bosses have revealed
aircraft qf-007 arrived at tyndall air force base ( afb ) in florida on 11 march , ahead of being pressed into service by the 82nd aerial targets squadron ( 82nd aerial targets squadron )
boeing has delivered six pre-production qf-16s , and in all , the air force expects to receive 126 qf - 16s
the unmanned mcdonnell douglas f-4 phantom ii currently used is no longer truly representative of the air - to - air threats air force pilots are likely to encounter on future operations
the qf-16 will be able to represent threats in the class of the mig-29 ' mig-29 ' and sukhoi su-27 ' flanker ' , bosses say
in tests , two us air force test pilots in a ground control station at tydall remotely flew the qf - 16 , which is a retired f - 16 jet modified to be an aerial target
while in the air , the qf - 16 mission included a series of simulated maneuvers , reaching supersonic speeds , returning to base and landing , all without a pilot in the cockpit
' it was a little different to see it without anyone in it , but it was a great flight all the way around , ' said us air force lt. col. ryan inman , commander , 82nd aerial targets squadron
' it 's a replication of current , real world situations and aircraft platforms they can shoot as a target
now we have a 9g capable , highly sustainable aerial target
' for more than 40 years , the f-16 has proven itself as the world 's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter , serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world
the drones have been adapted from f-16 jets that have been retired by the air force
the qf-16 is a retired f-16 ( pictured ) turned in a remote controlled drone
the air force has ordered 126 craft to be used as ' target drones '
for more than 40 years , the f-16 has proven itself as the world 's most capable 4 generation multi-role fighter , serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 customers around the world
the f-16 's most innovative design feature is its ' fly - by - wire ' control system , the first on any aircraft
the f-16 is designed to maneuver at up to nine g 's
this allows it to turn tighter than other fighters , a big advantage in a dogfight
but at such high g - loadings , the pilot is crushed down into his seat by almost a ton of force , and can barely lift a finger
so the f-16 has a small side - mounted control stick on an armrest
instead of moving back and forth , the f-16 's fixed joystick responds to hand pressure
in a tight , high - g turn , an otherwise immobilized f - 16 pilot can literally fly with the twitch of a finger .
