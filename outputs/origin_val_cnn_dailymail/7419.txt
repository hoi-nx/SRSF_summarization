last night 's highly publicised television debate between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition was intended to focus the watching audience 's attention acutely on them ahead of the general election in may
however , the morning after the night before , another name is grabbing the headlines
as jeremy paxman 's co-host on cameron & miliband live : the battle for number 10 , sky news anchor kay burley , 54 , was charged with managing the audience 's questions
kay burley , pictured with cameron and jeremy paxman , was accused of giving the pm an easy ride narrowing her gaze at mr miliband : the sky news anchor was trending on twitter after the programme aired with one user , imperial aerosol kid accusing her of being ' biased ' towards cameron perched to left of the stage , wearing a bright pink dress , the presenter caused such a storm while interviewing cameron and miliband , that her name promptly trended on twitter
imperial aerosol kid wrote : ' i 'm not sure how any sensible person can say kay burley was neutral last night
i laughed a few times at how biased she was
' while tommy ball wrote sarcastically : ' just watched kay burley
really hard to see where her political loyalties lie
' the audience at home also derided the co-host , accusing her of giving the prime minister an easy ride , as she asked him questions about shredded wheat ( in reference to leading for three terms ) and even his favourite colour
a spokesman for communications watchdog ofcom said it had received 131 complaints by late morning today , all of which were about perceived bias against the labour leader
an ofcom spokesman said : ' we are assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate
' channel 4 also confirmed today that they had received around 300 complaints following the show last night although a spokeswoman could n't confirm specifically what they were about
burley was charged with managing the audience participation section of cameron & miliband live viewers at home took to twitter to say they felt burley , 54 , was noticeably softer on the pm kay burley has responded to many of the twitter responses ... surmising that both herself and jeremy paxman were ' alternately accused of being pro and anti both cameron and miliband ' the news anchor took to twitter herself to refute accusations of bias
she posted after the debate : ' i see jeremy paxman [ jeremy paxman ] and i are being alternately accused of being pro and anti both cameron and miliband
our work here is done # battlefornumber10
' later , when another user accused her of ' telling porkies ' about the reaction of viewers on twitter , burley responded that ' @ ed_miliband team disagreed ' , suggesting the labour team were happy with burley 's questioning of mr miliband
a channel 4 spokeswoman said both parties had been happy with the format : ' both politicians , one of whom is likely to be the next prime minister , agreed to the format and were prepared for and actively participated in robust questioning about their policies and abilities
neither party has expressed any dissatisfaction to channel 4
' burley , 54 , responded on twitter that the miliband team were ' happy ' with her performance making peter cry : pop star and television presenter was reduced to tears in 2010 after burley asked him about whether he worried about losing custody of his children
the star promptly asked for the interview to end there was an awkward moment during miliband 's questions with the audience when burley seemed to introduce an audience member as former one direction boy band member zayn malik
the man 's name was actually zaid malik
twitter users also did n't miss the opportunity to rake over burley 's previous tv clangers
the wigan - born sky news anchor has , on more than a few occasions , prompted a backlash with her questioning
in october 2012 , when burley was dispatched to machynlleth in wales to report on the disappearance of five - year - old april jones , she told volunteers searching for the little girl that the case had become a murder inquiry live on tv
the volunteers broke down at the news
at the time , labour mp tom watson accused burley of being ' insensitive bordering on cruel '
complaints were filed against sky news in 2010 after burley broke the news to two female volunteers live on camera that the disappearance of five - year - old april jones was being treated as a murder enquiry the women were unaware of the latest developments in the april jones case and were visibly distressed as the cameras continued to roll
critics accused burley of ' unethical journalism ' in 2010 , burley commented that united states vice president biden 's head looked bruised
' what 's happened to his head ? ' she asked
' it looks like he 's walked into a door
' biden was actually daubed in ash wednesday ash
in the same year , she reduced pop star and tv presenter andre to tears during a live interview after asking him whether he worried about losing custody of his children
andre , who was on the show to promote his new tour was left upset and asked for the interview to end
however , perhaps her most famous gaffe remains her 2001 declaration that ' the entire eastern seaboard of the united states has been decimated by a terrorist attack ' as she covered the unfolding 9/11 tragedy
it is a moment that her critics have n't let her forget .
