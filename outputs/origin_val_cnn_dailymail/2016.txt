twitter 's latest attempt to tackle the site 's problem with trolls is a ' quality filter '
the tool works in a similar way to its ' tailored notifications ' and involves scanning tweets for abusive or offensive words , threats or signs of harassment
it will automatically remove these tweets from a user 's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site
twitter 's ' quality filter ' will scan tweets for abusive or offensive words and threats
it will automatically remove these tweets from a user 's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site
it was spotted by twitter user dash ( pictured ) and is only currently available to verified users the tool was first spotted by twitter user dash who wrote : ' well , that 's an interesting and welcome addition , twitter ! ( was prompted about this on opening the app. ) ' mr dash is a verified twitter user , meaning he has a blue tick on his account
these blue ticks are to confirm that the accounts of high - profile , influential people and celebrities are real and not parodies , for example
a twitter spokesman said the feature is only currently available for these verified users and did not reveal if it will be rolled out further
it is likely due to the fact such celebrities fall victim to more abuse and harassment than regular users , but twitter did not confirm this
from mr dash 's tweet it appears the filter is opt - in
last week the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network
its new rules ( pictured ) say that users must not ' post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent '
the site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users reports recently claimed twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers
when people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number ( pictured )
in the future , twitter may ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number twitter already lets people block , report or mute people who are sending them abusive messages
last week the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network
its rules now say that users must not ' post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent '
twitter said an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent
stories of abuse , threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on twitter in recent years
robin williams ' daughter , zelda williams , left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father 's suicide
feminist critic anita sarkeesian was threatened with rape , sexual violence and death by twitter trolls during the ' gamergate ' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games
in the uk , journalist criado-perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce jane austen as the new face of the Â£ 10 note
twitter users isabella sorley and john nimmo admitted sending the messages to ms criado-perez and both were jailed last year
under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can , in theory , distribute it as they see fit but twitter 's rules additionally considers the people in the footage
it will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission
twitter said ' agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy ' , including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders
the changes follow reports twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers
this means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details twitter will be able to intervene
last month an internal memo sent by twitter 's chief executive costolo revealed the 51 - year - old thinks his site ' sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls '
in the memo , mr costolo said he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future
mr costolo 's comments were posted on an internal forum among twitter employees , after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse
in december , a blog post titled ' building a safer twitter ' revealed twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse
the site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile - friendly , and it now requires less initial information
it has also improved the ways in which abuse can be reported to law enforcement .
