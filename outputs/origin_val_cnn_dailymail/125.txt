top house republicans are warning hillary they wo n't hesitate to have her charged with criminal wrongdoing if it turns out she did n't provide the state department with copies of every email she sent in relation to the benghazi assault
a spokesperson for clinton has said that the former secretary of state completely complied with the requirement but gop have continued to question the veracity of that statement
a house tasked with investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in libya issued a new round of subpoenas last week for messages sent through clinton 's personal account , which was recently revealed to be the only email address she used while at the state department , mixing business correspondence with pleasure , all at a domain outside the immediate scope of the government
the controversy has bled into a separate review of the clinton foundation 's fundraising practices during hillary 's tenure in barack obama 's administration after the washington post discovered that her family 's charity accepted money from foreign governments that were also lobbying the state department
collectively , the accusations of impropriety levied at the clintons have extended into their third week , and appear to be gaining strength rather than dissipating
the email saga was a topic of discussion on multiple agenda - setting talk shows on sunday morning , and the clinton foundation 's fundraising again grabbed headlines
' the emails are a related but secondary scandal , ' a so - called clinton ' loyalist ' told the national journal
' follow the foundation money
' the clinton foundation admitted last month to accepting a donation from the algeria government in the amount of $ 500,000 for disaster relief in haiti while hillary was secretary of state and did not disclose it to the federal government
it had , at that time , an agreement with the barack obama administration that allowed it to keep taking money from foreign governments it had done business with the past
but algeria was a new donor , meaning it broke the rules when it cashed the country 's check
of importance is that algeria was lobbying the state department at the time and spent roughly the same amount on that effort as it gave to the then - secretary 's family foundation
clinton refused on sunday to talk about his wife 's email woes , saying he had an opinion , and a bias , yet felt he should keep from undercutting her messaging strategy with a comment of his own
in a dueling appearance on cnn with democratic congressman schiff of california , gop congressman darrell issa , also of california , said on the network 's state of the union program that ' voluntary cooperation ' with a house 's investigation into the benghazi attack ' does not guarantee that it 's a crime not to deliver all
' ' a subpoena which trey gowdy issued is so that in fact it will be a crime if she knowingly withholds documents pursuant to subpoena , ' darrell issa , a recent chairman of the house oversight committee said
' he needed to do that because she was n't forthcoming two - and - a - half years ago
she , in fact , hid the very existence of this until she was caught
' south carolina congressman trey gowdy called into question on sunday a photo of clinton on her phone that inspired the texts from hillary meme
' and if you think to that iconic picture of her on a c-17 flying to libya , she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand , we have no e-mails from that day
in fact , we have no e-mails from that trip ' trey gowdy is the chair of the house 's select committee on benghazi
schiff is the ranking democrat on the temporary task force
comprised of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle , the select committee has been charged by house speaker john boehner with investigating the events leading up to the sept. 11 , 2012 terrorist strike on the u.s. consulate in libya
several house committees have already looked into the assault extensively , but as darrell issa articulated sunday , gop lawmakers believe investigators were not provided with all of clinton 's benghazi associated emails and an additional review of her actions is warranted
' and we may never get many of them because we do n't know what we do n't know when it 's on a server where a click of the button can delete records forever , ' he said , referring to reports that clinton housed her email on a home - brewed server that only she and aides had access to
on sunday , schiff accused the taxpayer - funded benghazi panel of using its power ' to become an arm of the republican national committee
' ' that 's what happened this week , ' he said of committee head trey gowdy 's response to the clinton email brouhaha
' and that is deeply disturbing , because , michael , we have the secretary 's e-mails , ' schiff continued , addressing the show 's fill - in host michael smerconish
pointing out that clinton provided 55,000 pages of her correspondence to the state department , 900 pages of which were on benghazi , schiff said relevant emails have already been reviewed by house investigators and ' there is nothing at all corroborative of any of these conspiracy theories
' trey gowdy said on cbs ' face the nation that ' there are gaps of months and months and months ' between the email records that the house was provided trey gowdy said sunday morning on another program , cbs ' face the nation , that ' there are gaps of months and months and months ' between the email records that the house was provided , however
' and if you think to that iconic picture of her on a c-17 flying to libya , she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand , we have no e-mails from that day
in fact , we have no e-mails from that trip , ' the south carolina congressman asserted
' so , it 's strange credibility to believe that if you 're on your way to libya to discuss libya policy that there 's not a single document that has been turned over to congress
' the photo trey gowdy referenced inspired viral sensation ' texts from hillary
' until yesterday , after he made mention of it on national tv , it had been clinton 's profile picture on twitter
it 's now her background photo
her twit pic is now an empty avatar emblazoned with the words ' not - there.org ' ' see my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we 've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide , ' she said , drawing attention to a report on women 's rights that her organization plans to release today
the tweet is one of just two tweets that she 's sent since wednesday , when she said on the social media platform that she wants the public to see her emails and has asked the state department to release them
the other tweet commemorated bloody sunday and called on her followers to keep fighting for ' voting rights , civil rights , & human rights
' clinton refused on sunday to talk about his wife 's email woes , saying he had an opinion , and a bias , yet felt he should keep from undercutting her messaging strategy with a comment of his own a democratic strategist who spoke to the washington post , said most democrats do n't believe the the cloud of suspicion currently following clinton is ' going to have a lot of legs
' ' but there is a level of angst and annoyance about how badly the thing has been mishandled , ' the source added
a former colleague of clinton 's in the senate , california democrat dianne feinstein , implored the former new york lawmaker on sunday to make additional public remarks on the email drama
' from this point on , the silence is going to hurt her , ' dianne feinstein said on nbc 's meet the press
president barack obama finally broke his own silence on the matter during an interview that aired sunday on cbs
' i 'm glad that hillary 's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed , ' he said , and praised her service in his cabinet
further backing her , he said , ' i think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need
' he also claimed to have found out about clinton 's lack of a state department email address that automatically archives emails from the press at ' the same time everybody else learned it through news reports
' his statement follows a prediction from his spokesman on friday that he probably ' learned about that by reading the newspaper ' but was n't entirely sure .
