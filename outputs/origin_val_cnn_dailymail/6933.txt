on february 11 , 2011 , logan was the victim of a ' sustained and brutal ' sexual assault as she reported from cairo on the resignation of president mubarak
she was surrounded by a mob of 200 - 300 men after being dragged away from her tv crew in tahrir square , seconds after egyptian colleagues heard men talking about wanting to take her pants off
the group tore her clothes from her body , groped and beat her , she later told the new york times
' for an extended period of time , they raped me with their hands , ' the reporter said and she was subjected to ' aggressive pinching '
she was rescued by a group of women and up to 20 egyptian soldiers

the condition could have been aggravated by stress
she was expected to remain in the hospital for several days to recover

diverticulitis , according to the nih website , occurs when when pouches , called diverticula , form in the colon and then become inflamed

aside from her beating and sexual assault in 2011 , she was forced in 2011 to take a seven - month leave of absence after admitting her report on the attack on the u.s. consulate in benghazi , libya , was based on a discredited first - hand account
and last year she was quarantined in south africa after reporting from the ebola hot zone in liberia
