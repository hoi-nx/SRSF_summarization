the 19 - year - old , who has now been awarded a five - figure settlement over the incident , was on a family trip when she was hit by a jet at pleasure beach , leaving her needing two hours of surgery and 250 stitches
shelby clarke , now 19 , had the accident when she was only 14 at blackpool 's pleasure beach the attraction ( pictured ) , called the spectacular dancing water fountain , caused her injuries which look to doctors like she had been raped although miss shelby clarke has now agreed compensation with the pleasure beach , says her sex life has been almost ruined by the accident - and she does not know whether she will be able to have children without complications in the future
she said : ' having sex was excruciating at first
even now , i ca n't have sex as much as i would like , and so that makes me worry that my boyfriend will lose patience and cheat on me
' i do n't know if i can have a baby naturally in the future - my doctors say we will just have to wait and see
' miss shelby clarke had gone to blackpool as a halloween treat with her mum , karen , step - father , james , and her friend , sarah , in october 2009
care manager karen , 45 , said : ' we had stayed in the same hotel several times before ; it was around the corner from the pleasure beach so it was ideal
shelby clarke first met her boyfriend , danny at 17 - three years after the incident - but sexual intercourse left her crippled in pain shelby clarke ( pictured left ) was only 14 when she went on holiday with her family ( pictured right - mum and dad ) when one of the jets of the blackpool attraction knocked her off her feet and she suffered gynaelogical injuries ' when we arrived , the girls went off to the pleasure beach and arranged to be back for our evening meal
sarah was 16 and shelby clarke was 14 and they were sensible girls
' at the pleasure beach , the teenagers noticed a new attraction , the spectacular dancing water fountain , which was a series of water jets , shooting up through paving stones
the centre - piece jet was the most powerful , shooting up to 200 feet into the air
miss shelby clarke said : ' there were loads of kids running through the water jets so sarah and i joined in
but as were playing , i was hit by a very powerful jet
' it knocked me off my feet and i felt i needed to go to the toilet immediately
but i noticed there was blood everywhere
' sarah helped her back to the hotel , where karen called an ambulance
when shelby clarke ( left ) realised there was something wrong she alerted her mother karen ( right ) who - in horror - called an ambulance when shelby clarke , who was 14 at the time , was injured in the accident , she needed two hours of surgery and 250 stitches karen said : ' i did n't know what was wrong
shelby clarke told me the water jet had knocked her off her feet and she was bleeding really heavily from her bottom
' her clothes were soaked and she was pale and very groggy
' shelby clarke was rushed to hospital where she needed 250 stitches , both internally and externally
karen said : ' when i saw what had happened , i was sickened
she was badly injured , literally ripped right across from her bottom to her vagina
' the consultant took me aside and said he thought she might have been raped
by now , shelby clarke was under anaesthetic so she could n't speak up
' sarah kept telling us that her injuries were from a water jet - but the doctors said that was n't possible , because her injuries were too severe
i was beside myself with panic
' miss shelby clarke underwent two hours of surgery , and subsequent tests showed that she had not been attacked
shelby clarke has stated she is lucky to have a supportive boyfriend in danny ( right ) she spent three days in hospital and was off school for a further six weeks
she said : ' i was terrified of going to the toilet afterwards , because it was so painful
i became terrified of going to the loo
it almost became a phobia
' my periods became very heavy and so painful
my doctor gave me an implant to stop my periods , but i still suffered with pain and sudden bleeds
' i was terrified that i might start bleeding , on the bus or in class
i even had to be home - schooled for a few months because i was paranoid about being around other people
' miss shelby clarke met her first boyfriend , danny , aged 17 , but sexual intercourse left her crippled in pain
shelby clarke does not know whether she will be able to have children in the future and has stated her fear : '' i ca n't help thinking that if it had been a two year old running through the water , she might have been killed ' tests showed she had a large amount of scar tissue and she is now waiting to have it removed
miss shelby clarke said : ' i was terrified of having sex
danny was very supportive and mum helped me too
' i can enjoy sex but i ca n't have it very often - and so then i start to worry that danny might cheat on me or leave me
i 'm very lucky that danny is patient and understanding , and it has made our relationship much stronger
' miss shelby clarke does not know if she will be able to have children in the future and is also facing surgery to remove scar tissue around her cervix
shelby clarke has said she wanted to ' bring the legal action to make sure this does n't happen to anyone else ' the family took legal action against the pleasure beach who awarded shelby clarke a five - figure sum in compensation
her settlement includes money to cover possible treatment in the future when she wants children
an investigation was carried out by the health and safety executive and was very critical of blackpool pleasure beach for failing to undertake necessary risk assessments
miss shelby clarke said : ' i had to relive my ordeal , over and over , and discuss my sex life and my periods with gynaecologists , solicitors and barristers
it was very embarrassing but i was determined to see it through
' i ca n't help thinking that if it had been a two - year - old running through the water , she might have been killed
i wanted to bring the legal action to make sure this does n't happen to anyone else
' sabrina mccarron , a specialist serious injury lawyer from irwin mitchell , representing the family , said : ' this was a very tragic accident that could have been avoided had the appropriate risk assessments and safety measures been implemented
' although a health and safety executive investigation criticised blackpool pleasure beach for failing to undertake a proper risk assessment and safety measures were recommended to provide adequate protection for lawful visitors no formal admission of liability was made on behalf of blackpool pleasure beach
' an out - of - court five - figure settlement was eventually agreed and compensation has now been secured for shelby to help her access the treatment and rehabilitation she now requires to help with her recovery
' a spokesperson for blackpool pleasure beach said : ' since the incident , strict procedures have been out in place to ensure guests do not enter the fountains during a show
' clear announcements are made before the start of a show and staff man the fountain at the perimeter of the fountains
