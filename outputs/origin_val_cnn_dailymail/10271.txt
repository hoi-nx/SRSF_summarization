a leading paediatrician has said he would rather his children used marijuana than alcohol , such is the devastation that drink can cause
aaron e. carroll , professor of paediatrics at indiana university , said while he would prefer youngsters to use neither , if forced to make a choice , he would opt for pot. writing for the new york times , he said that as his children grow up , he is frequently asked - given his profession - which of the two substances he would prefer them to use
he said : ' the immediate answer , of course , is â neither "
and after sifting through all the studies and all the data , i still say â neither "
usually , i say it more than once
' but if i âm forced to make a choice , the answer is â marijuana "
' aaron e. carroll , professor of pediatrics at indiana university , said while he would prefer youngsters used neither alcohol or marijuana , if forced to make a choice , he would opt for pot his decision is based on research into a number of factors - essentially the harm caused by both drugs
but in the course of his debate , he explains that while marijuana is easy to demonise because it 's illegal , the evidence shows that in terms of harm and death , alcohol causes significantly more damage
he goes on to argue that while research has linked marijuana to changes in the brain and psychosis , as well as changes in lung function and cancer risk , ' these are all associations , not known causal pathways '
instead , he explains , there may be other factors that explain these links - perhaps people with mental health problems are more likely to use the drug , he suggests
however he warns what many of us - especially parents - do is overlook the huge dangers of alcohol
he cites statistics from the national council on alcoholism and drug dependence , which state that alcohol use is a factor in 40 per cent of all violent crimes in the united states , including 37 per cent of rapes and 27 per cent of aggravated assaults
what many of us - especially parents - do is overlook the huge dangers of alcohol , he warns no such association has been found among marijuana users
' people who are high are not committing violence , ' he explains
he goes on to add that nearly 20 per cent of male delinquents and 10 per cent of female delinquents have an alcohol problem
meanwhile binge drinking was responsible for around half of the 80,000 alcohol - related deaths in the united states in 2010 , whereas cannabis kills virtually no one
he also factors in statistics for drink driving and domestic violence - and once again , alcohol fares worse
as it does in terms of long - term dependency
professor aaron e. carroll states that while nine per cent of pot users eventually become dependent , more than 20 per cent of alcohol users do
from first - hand experience as a paediatrician , he says he has also seen more damage - some almost fatal - caused by alcohol poisoning
then there is the link with unprotected sex , drunken fights and accidents - all of which are significantly more likely when alcohol is thrown into the mix. despite being marginally in favour of marijuana over alcohol , professor aaron e. carroll denies his arguments are ' pro pot ' - nor is he burying the negative effects of the drug
indeed , he goes on to acknowledge marijuana does have risks and negative consequences - and they are ' certainly greater than zero ' .
