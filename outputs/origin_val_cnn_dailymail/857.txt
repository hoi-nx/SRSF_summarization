kp has been given no assurances about a return to england âs set - up in a phone call with the new power - broker of english cricket
mixed messages coming out of the ecb have left the impression the door is open to the maverick batsman , who was sacked last year after the ashes debacle
but incoming ecb chairman colin graves , who takes over from kp âs arch - opponent giles clarke on may 15 , has spoken to the 34 - year - old and made it clear there are no guarantees â even if he scores heavily for surrey on his expected county comeback
kp will return to surrey in the summer to play in the lv = county championship incoming ecb chairman colin graves has made it clear there are no guarantees colin graves , who instigated the conversation , hoped to keep it confidential but the tenor of the chat was that kp âs england future rests entirely with the selectors , who would consider form as well as other aspects â such as upsetting team spirit â when picking the test side this summer
a number of players , led by captain alastair cook , would strongly resist a kp comeback
though colin graves told kp he would not interfere with selection , having never done so as chairman of yorkshire , kp ( right ) remains so enthused about the slim possibility of playing for england again that he will commit himself to surrey this season
he said while commentating on tms at the world cup : â if i can do anything that can help me get back into it for england , then it âs something i want to do
â surrey still have to agree the detail of kp âs re-engagement but he is expected to fulfil at least some of his Â£ 205,000 ipl contract with sunrisers hyderabad
he would then need some practice in red - ball cricket , which he last played in the test of january 2014 that completed the 5 - 0 ashes whitewash
kp has hinted he could change his ipl contract in a bid to push for an england place after playing for the big bash league 's melbourne stars , kp has signed with the sunrisers hyderabad england cricket managing director paul downton said he watched every ball of that game and had never seen a player so disengaged from his team - mates
given the strong opposition of downton and chairman of selectors james whitaker , kp âs hopes boil down to the side doing so badly against the west indies and new zealand in the next two test series that radical changes are considered for the ashes , which starts in july
former england captain vaughan has called england âs current situation a â soap opera â , and says the team need to beat the west indies 3 - 0 to stop talk of a kp comeback
â it is clear that for kp to have any hope of playing for england â and it is only a small hope â he has to play county cricket and we will see what happens , â vaughan said on tms
â the game needs a change , it needs someone to come in and say the past is the past and to start afresh
colin graves is clearly going to do that
obviously it âs going to ruffle a few feathers but maybe that âs what they need
â maybe this is a fantastic motivational tool
if the team do nât want kp in the side then go to the west indies and win 3 - 0
play better , score more runs and win more games and kp will never play again
