an australia court has cleared the way for dutch formula one driver giedo van der garde to compete in this weekend 's melbourne grand prix after his legal challenge was ruled successful on wednesday
van der giedo van der garde won the challenge to get a spot in sunday 's race with swiss f1 team sauber , who removed him as a driver late last year despite having a contract
justice clyde croft in the supreme court of victoria said van der garde 's application was successful
giedo van der garde , pictured at testing in 2014 was the reserve driver for sauber last season lawyers for sauber argued van der giedo van der garde was an unacceptable risk because he was n't trained in the team 's car and he did not have a custom seat , but van der giedo van der garde 's lawyer tom clarke said his client was ready to work with the team to get a seat fitted before racing begins
sauber said in a statement ' the outcome is unfortunately not as expected
' ' we are disappointed with this decision and now need to take time to understand what it means and the impact it will have on the start of our season , ' sauber team chief executive monisha kaltenborn said
' what we can not do is jeopardize the safety of our team , or any other driver on the track , by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers
' but van der garde said outside court he was ready to race
' i 'm very fit and very strong
i 'm looking forward to going back to the team , work hard and do our best for the weekend , ' he said
' i 'm the fittest ever
i 've been training the last three months flat out
' van der garde also said that despite the legal battle , he was keen to work with sauber again
dutch driver claimed he was offered a race seat for the 2015 campaign but sauber reneged on deal ' i 'm looking forward to going back to the team
i had a very good relationship , i still have a very good relationship , with the team , ' he said
one of sauber 's current drivers , marcus ericsson or felipe nasr , would have to miss out for van der garde to race in one of the two team cars
' well , i think it 's up to them what they 're going to do , and up to the team
it 's not my thing , ' he said
van der garde said he would be on track at albert park later wednesday to catch up and prepare for the race .
