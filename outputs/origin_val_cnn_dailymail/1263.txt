the bank of england ( pictured ) slashed interest rates to a historic low of 0.5 per cent in march 2009 at the height of the great recession , which has had a crippling impact on prudent households khalaf , a senior analyst at savings and investment firm hargreaves lansdown , which produced the report , said : â it âs been a gruelling six years for savers in the uk who have seen the income from their cash obliterated
the future does nât look too much rosier either
â while interest rate rises may be on the cards next year , when they come they are likely to be small and slow
â interest rates were 5 per cent in september 2008 â the month us investment banking giant lehman brothers collapsed
but they were cut aggressively as the global financial crisis deepened , before reaching an all - time low of 0.5 per cent on march 5 , 2009
had rates stayed at their september 2008 level , savers would have received Â£ 130billion more interest on their nest eggs , hargreaves lansdown found
and according to bank of england figures , the amount of cash held in accounts that pay no interest at all has risen from Â£ 47billion to Â£ 150billion since the financial crisis struck
khalaf ( pictured ) , a senior analyst at savings and investment firm hargreaves lansdown , said the future ' does nât look too much rosier either ' however , mr khalaf said that without ultra-low interest rates â we would almost certainly have been left in a much sorrier state by the financial crisis â
he added : â there have also been beneficiaries of low interest rates , most notably borrowers , who have seen their mortgage payments fall substantially
â bank of england governor carney has admitted low rates â help debtors at the expense of savers â
the bank of england is expected to leave rates at 0.5 per cent again tomorrow , when the monetary policy committee finishes its latest monthly meeting
mr carney has suggested that rates could even be cut again â possibly to 0.25 per cent or even closer to zero â if ultra-low inflation persists
but he and other senior bank officials have also claimed the next move in interest rates will probably be up
it is thought rates could start to rise late this year or early next year , although mr carney has insisted increases should be â limited and gradual â
dr ros altmann , a government advisor and pensions expert , said the over- 65s have been offered â a bit of relief â through so - called pensioner bonds
these offer 2.8 per cent on one - year bonds and 4 per cent over three years
but she added : â anyone younger than 65 is really struggling to make their savings pay
