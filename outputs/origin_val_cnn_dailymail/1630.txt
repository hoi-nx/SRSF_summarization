thousands of cases of diabetes and cancer could be avoided , saving the nhs Â£ 300million , by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks , it is claimed
academics have calculated the likely reduction in consumption caused by putting up the price of full sugar drinks like coca-cola and pepsi and the resulting health benefits
the work by experts at the university of liverpool and the children âs food campaign will fuel the growing campaign to extend the principle of a duty on unhealthy products from cigarettes and alcohol to some types of drink and food
however , the drinks industry have challenged the figures , insisting a sugary drinks tax will only hit the poorest in society with higher living costs while doing nothing to improve their health
the liverpool team calculates that a tax of 20p per litre â 12p per can â would reduce the number of cases of diabetes by just under 50,000 over 20 years
they estimate there would be a fall of 33,000 in cases of stroke and heart disease and some 9,000 fewer victims of bowel cancer
malcolm clark , co-ordinator of the children âs food campaign , said a 20p per litre sugary drinks duty would save lives and money across england these figures relate to england alone and the researchers estimate it would lead to savings of Â£ 300m in the cost of treating these people over the 20 years , releasing money for other patients
soft drinks are the largest single source of sugar for children aged 4 - 10 years and teenagers , consequently any new levy would particularly hit consumption among this group
money raised from the charge would support a new children âs health fund , which would pay for sport and fitness schemes and equipment for youngsters
the campaign for a sugary drinks duty is supported by over 60 organisations , including public health and medical professional bodies , dentists , children âs charities , action on sugar and school food experts
malcolm clark , co-ordinator of the children âs food campaign , said : â current taxes on foods are a mess , and do nât support people choosing healthier options
â a 20p per litre sugary drinks duty would save lives and money across england , and ease the pressure on nhs services locally
it is a logical , proportionate and effective measure
â using the revenue to set up a children âs health fund , paying for programmes to improve children âs health and protect the environment they grow up in , would also ensure that this was a progressive measure , benefiting families in poverty and on low incomes
â public health directors in north west england and in cardiff , as well as the london health commission , have publicly backed a sugary drinks duty
professor damien walmsley , the british dental association âs scientific adviser , said : â a tax on sugary drinks and food is a no brainer
it 's a scandal that one in eight of our three - year olds currently experiences tooth decay
it 's time we tackled the problem at source
â health campaigners and doctors have controversially likened sugar and its contribution to obesity and ill - health as the â new tobacco â the research looking the impact of the levy was led by brendan collins , research fellow in health economics , university of liverpool , who has created a model showing the effect by local authority area across england
this found the areas likely to see the biggest benefits by virtue of the fact they have a younger population and higher consumption of the drinks were slough , manchester , luton , blackburn , leicester , birmingham , milton keynes , bradford and nottingham
robin ireland , the director of food active , which is supported by directors of public health in the north west of england , said : â just as extra taxes on cigarettes have helped to change purchasing habits and reduce smoking , adding 20p per litre onto the price of sugary drinks would encourage people to consume less and lead to improvements in quality of life
â we want to see the next government introduce a sugary drinks duty without delay
â citizensuk , which is an alliance of local community groups , said : â we are calling for a children âs health fund to enable a step - change in early intervention
since there is no spare money in the nhs , we are calling for a duty on sugary drinks , which will itself reduce diabetes and obesity
â director of the british soft drinks association , gavin partington , rubbished the research and its figures
he said : â this is a flawed model based on misleading figures created by campaigners in support of their cause
the overwhelming evidence suggests that ill - health is linked to a range of factors including lifestyle , levels of exercise and overall diet
â a tax on soft drinks would adversely impact the poorest in society while doing nothing to curb obesity
