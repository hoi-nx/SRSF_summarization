a computer programmer who killed his girlfriend and then almost got away with it after staging a cover - up has been jailed for five years
metcalfe claimed that the death of topliss , 47 , had been a tragic accident after she fell down the stairs at their home in hall green , birmingham
a post-mortem also ruled that her death had been an accident , but after a friend of the victim told police of domestic violence within the relationship , police re-investigated the case and charged metcalfe with murder
metcalfe , right , who has been jailed for five years following the death of his partner topliss , left
her death had initially been ruled as an accident today following a trial at birmingham crown court , he was acquitted of murder but convicted of the manslaughter of his partner of 13 years and jailed
the court heard how miss topliss , a national grid worker , was killed on november 15 in 2013 at the couple 's home
both she and metcalfe , 36 , had been drinking after she received the news that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer
hugh o'brien quinn , prosecuting , said that following an initial post-mortem , it had been concluded that miss topliss 's death had been accidental
the judge told metcalfe , pictured , that his behaviour had been ' utterly selfish ' and that he showed a ' complete lack of remorse ' however , he added : ' that was until mrs sharon wade contacted the police and told them of her concerns
' she had been a good friend of topliss
it was to her that miss topliss had complained about domestic violence from her partner
' it was then that a second post-mortem was conducted and the court heard how the pathologist discovered an injury to the victim 's cheek , consistent with a heavy punch
judge paul farrer qc said that miss topliss was a ' hard - working , successful and well - respected by her professional colleagues
' addressing metcalfe , he added : ' there must have been some disagreement between you which caused you to lose your temper
' you delivered a significant punch to the right side of her face
the blow caused her to fall backwards and strike her head against a table
' you thought of nobody but yourself
rather than trying to help her or call the emergency services , you left her lying on the floor of the hallway
' you waited approximately for two - and - a - half hours before dialling 999
' your behaviour was utterly selfish and betrayed a complete lack of remorse
you showed a callous disregard for your victim
' however , david crigman qc , defending said : ' what he has been found guilty of is one punch with disastrous consequences
' it must have happened within seconds
there was no evidence of a protracted argument
but for her falling backwards and hitting her head , the deceased would not have suffered a serious injury
' metcalfe was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter and jailed for five years at birmingham crown court metcalfe was then jailed for five years and after the hearing , detective inspector harry harrison , of west midlands police , said : ' metcalfe initially deceived the authorities into believing that miss topliss died as a result of a tragic accident
' he nearly got away with it
his crime was discovered as a result of community vigilance and courage
' this goes to show that the police need the active cooperation from the community to eradicate the evil that is domestic abuse and bring offenders to justice
