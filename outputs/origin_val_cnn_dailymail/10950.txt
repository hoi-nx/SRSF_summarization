the threat featured a picture of twitter billionaire co-founder dorsey in a gun 's cross-hairs and the twitter logo the alleged threat , first reported by buzzfeed , mentioned dorsey and included the words : ' we always come back
' in a statement to daily mail online , a twitter spokesperson said on monday : ' our security team is investigating the veracity of these threats with relevant law enforcement officials
' when entered into google translate ( which does not provide an exact translation ) the message is titled : ' tweets in response to a campaign to delete accounts

it reads : ' hey jack ... when their necks officially become a target for the soldiers of the caliphate and supporters scattered among your midst ! ' it also claimed killing employees ' outside a neighborhood pub ' would be no more preventable than the massacres of charlie hebdo killer amedy coulibaly and copenhagen shooter omar el-hussein
the message later reads : ' imagine the scene and wait for its occurrence at any moment , and the earliest opportunity ! ' virtual your war on us in the internet will pull you real wars on earth !

according to twitter 's rules : ' you may not publish or post direct , specific threats of violence against others
' twitter and youtube both removed violent material and propaganda linked to isis
