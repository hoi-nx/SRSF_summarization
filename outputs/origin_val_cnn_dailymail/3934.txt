criticism : home secretary theresa may launched a blistering attack on the human rights group cage theresa may last night launched a blistering attack on the human rights group cage , saying no excuses could be made for the appalling crimes of islamic state
in a statement to the commons , the home secretary said : â i condemn anyone who attempts to excuse that barbarism in the way that has been done by cage
â politicians have queued up to denounce the group âs research director asim qureshi , who has described is killer mohammed emwazi as a â beautiful young man â and accused the security services of radicalising him
jacqui smith , a labour former home secretary , said yesterday : â we can â and should â dismiss the outrageous apologists of cage who claimed that mohammed emwazi was just a good lad radicalised by the actions of western authorities
â the backlash continued with amnesty international coming under pressure to cut its ties with cage
a former employee urged the charity to stop treating the group as human rights defenders and heroes
sahgal , a former head of amnesty international âs gender unit , was forced out of the organisation in 2010 after describing cage as jihadis and questioning the championing of former guantanamo inmates
controversial group : cage research director asim qureshi ( left ) speaks next to political activist john ( centre ) and cage spokesman cerie bullivant ( right ) during a press conference in london last thursday â immense damage has been done to amnesty international , not least because they wo nât come clean about their association with cage , â she told the bbc
â they say various things like , they do nât work with them , they have never worked with them , or they are in a loose coalition with them
â but the point is , whether they are in a tight embrace or a loose coalition , they have taken their research from them , they have shared logos with them , they have produced briefing papers together , they have signed letters to the government together , that is working with the organisation
â she described cage âs current director , former guantanamo prisoner moazzam begg , as â uk âs most famous supporter of the taliban â
jihadi john : politicians have queued up to denounce mr asim qureshi , who has described islamic state killer mohammed emwazi ( above ) as a â beautiful young man â and accused the security services of radicalising him miss sahgal said she had never argued guantanamo prisoners â should nât be defended â , but that they â should nât be treated as heroes and human rights defenders â
unimpressed : jacqui smith , a labour former home secretary , called cage ' outrageous apologists ' she added : â the prisoners they were defending in this case were not prisoners of conscience ... what they did was create a narrative of innocence around them
â crawshaw , of the office of the secretary general at amnesty international , admitted yesterday it was â highly unlikely â they would work with cage again
asked if amnesty international had played to a â myth â of victimisation , mr crawshaw added : â i do nât think we have played to anybody âs myth
i ca nât condemn strongly enough anybody , in any context who seeks to find some justification somehow for how they can justify killing civilians
â our colleagues there ( in iraq ) are risking lives in order to document the terrible crimes of is and therefore to hear somehow that we are turning away from those things , i do think is quite extraordinary
â amnesty international was forced yesterday to admit that it worked alongside cage as recently as october
with liberty , justice and five other mainstream human rights groups , it joined with cage in a â collective â to make representations to an inquiry into the treatment of british army detainees
cage âs current director : former guantanamo prisoner moazzam begg ( pictured ) has been described as â uk âs most famous supporter of the taliban â by the former head of amnesty international âs gender unit amnesty international uk director kate allen said yesterday : â amnesty international has no formal or financial relationship with cage
â amnesty international has , along with a number of others human rights organisations , worked on issues relating to guantanamo and torture
â this has included being co-signatories on letters calling for an independent , judge - led inquiry into uk complicity in torture
we support the call for a torture inquiry
we do not support all of cage âs views or agree with how it expresses them
â charities have been urged to stop funding cage with politicians saying the organisation has acted reprehensibly in blaming uk security services for the radicalisation of emwazi .
