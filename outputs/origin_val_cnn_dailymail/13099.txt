you may not know it , but comedian noah actually made a bit of history even before being named to succeed jon stewart as host of " the daily show
" the 31 - year - old south africa comic has made only a few appearances on that show since popping up as a correspondent in december , but he 's better known within the world of standup comedy
in 2013 , noah became the first south africa comedian to perform on " the tonight show with jay leno
" he 's been on the cover of rolling stone in south africa , where he 's extremely popular
he 's joked about being the son of a black south africa woman and a white swiss man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in south africa
" my mom would be arrested
she would be fined , and still she was like ' ooh , i do n't care , i want a white man , ooh , ' " he once told an audience at london 's soho theater during his standup show " the racist
" " and my dad was also like , well , you know how the swiss love chocolate
" why mixed - race comic was ' born a crime ' race , identity and ethnicity have figured in prominently in his act
because of his parents ' then - illegal relationship , he joked , " in the streets , my father could n't walk with us
he would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me like a creepy pedophile
and my mom could walk with me , but every time the police went by , she would drop me
i felt like a bag of weed
" noah has said in his act that he lost touch with his father for several years because of apartheid
in 2012 , he told npr that he was fascinated by how united states discuss race
" i got to baltimore , and i was expecting ... because urban means built up and new , you know , " he said
" so i got there , and i was , ' whoa , it 's not as urban as people told me
' ... but it 's very black
i 'll tell you that much
" noah told cnn 's " african voices " in 2013 that after finding success in his homeland -- where he starred on a soap opera , hosted his own radio show and was the subject of the 2012 documentary " you laugh but it 's true " -- he moved to the united states for a year to try to raise his profile
he returned to his country with new material shaped by his time spent in the united states , he said
" comedy is really getting quite popular in south africa , " noah said
" it 's moving from the bastard child of entertainment into the mainstream , which is very good
i think the reason it 's doing so well is because south africa need to laugh and south africa want to laugh
" noah has moved to the united states permanently and told newsweek , " i 've always wanted to be a comedian in the world
i do n't want to be labeled a south africa comedian
" on " the daily show , " he debuted as a correspondent with a bit titled " spot the africa , " which juxtaposed modern - day south africa and the united states
what remains to be seen is whether what the guardian has described as " his combination of terribly polite , butter - would n't - melt stage presence and biting , often brutal gags " will translate into success on " the daily show
