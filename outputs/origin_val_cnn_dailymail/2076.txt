mckenzie has been sacked from his job as ukip âs commonwealth spokesman after a series of gaffes he became one of the most high profile figures in ukip after organising the party âs disastrous â carnival of colour â and comparing farage to jesus
but mckenzie has finally been sacked him from his job as ukip âs commonwealth spokesman after a series of gaffes that included calling croydon a â dump â while being the candidate there
the former professional boxer who describes himself as â not your average politician â said he was â dismayed â and â disappointed â by the decision
he told the mail : â you get these things in politics when the leader has a little reshuffle
â i âve had a very good run and thought i was doing pretty well with it , but bigger people than me have been moved around jobs
â you look at the tory party and michael gove
he was doing a fantastic job as education secretary and was moved on
it âs a bit of a shock to the system
â while standing for ukip in the 2012 croydon north by-election , mr mckenzie described gay adoption as â tantamount to child abuse â and â unhealthy â
then after mr farage pulled out of appearing at a â ukip carnival â he had organised there last year , mr mckenzie said the town was â unsafe and a dump â
in his most recent controversy , mr mckenzie earlier this month said he was â disillusioned â and â dismayed â about former boxing promoter frank maloney âs sex change to become kellie
mr mckenzie , who refers to mr farage at â guvânor â , denied that his sacking was related to his comments
he said : â the one thing with the guvânor is he âs very frank with me
if he is upset , you know about it
i do nât think it âs the fact that i âm outspoken
' when that news broke about kellie , i called the guvnor and said â farage look at what âs happened â
â he was of the same opinion of me , that it âs his life and he has got to do what he has to do , but everybody was surprised
i wish kellie the best
â despite his reputation for bizarre television appearances , including wearing sunglasses during an interview on the bbc âs newsnight last year , mr mckenzie said that he had given media training to others in the party
he said : â i ran classes for a lot of the ukip candidates
i âve given them help on how to perform
i âll give them confidence
â mr mckenzie said that he had been told that he was being sacked in a telephone call from ukip chairman steve crowther on monday

â i spoke to him briefly and asked â what âs going on ? â , but he said â i âm really busy at the moment , i will call you â
â i âve got no real bone to pick with farage
he âs an honourable type of guy , a good leader
no doubt we will speak in a few days and have a sparring session
â he added : â i can not say i âm not gutted , i âm not going to pretend , but at the same time i âm extremely loyal to the guvânor
this is the way that politics goes
â getting this commonwealth spokesman job was the best thing that ever happened to me really , at least in my political life
it led me to meet high commissioners and ambassadors of the commonwealth
â it âs a bit of a shock to the system , but you have to follow the guvânor
i âm a little bit dismayed by it all , but i âm happy if it âs better for the party

he said : â my main ambition in politics is to become the london mayoral candidate
it is up to the party
i âm sure another post will come
â mr mckenzie , who said he has never experienced racism from within ukip , denied that there was now a lack of high - profile ethnic minority figures at the top of the party
he said : â it âs quite clear that there are a growing number of black people participating in the party
â i believe i âve done an awful lot for the party in getting support from the black community
they are more ukip friendly than when i came into the party
' mr mckenzie joined ukip after previously being a member of the conservatives , lib dems and his own unity party
he has stood to be an mp , mayor of london and a local councillor , but lost his deposit on every occasion
he made a rap video during his 2008 campaign to be mayor of london and previously auditioned for the x factor
west midlands mep james carver has been appointed as the party âs new commonwealth spokesman
mr farage said : â i am delighted to appoint jim to this role
â it is part of the growth ensuring that ukip has a full and energetic team going forward to the election and beyond
