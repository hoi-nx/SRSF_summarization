the former boss of royal bank of scotland is set to pocket a Â£ 1million bonus from the state - backed lender â two years after he was dramatically forced out of his job by george osborne
there was growing outrage last night that stephen hester will get such a huge sum from a bank that was bailed out by the taxpayer
he could receive more than 500,000 shares in royal bank of scotland â worth up to Â£ 1.9million â as part of a long - term incentive scheme dating from his days in charge
however mr stephen hester , who now runs insurance firm rsa , is unlikely to receive the full entitlement because not all the terms have been met
stephen hester , left with a warwickshire hunt , is set to pocket a Â£ 1million bonus from the royal bank of scotland in january 2012 , when he was still at the helm of royal bank of scotland , mr stephen hester turned down a controversial bonus worth almost Â£ 1million after caving in to â enormous political pressure â despite the backing of the bank âs board
at the time he was being paid Â£ 1.2million a year â or 46 times the average salary of employees in britain
mr stephen hester was brought in to turn around beleaguered royal bank of scotland after the departure of disgraced predecessor fred goodwin
news that he continues to receive millions from his tenure at the bank has sparked fury after royal bank of scotland last week revealed a seventh consecutive year of annual losses
andy silvester of the taxpayers â alliance said : â until royal bank of scotland is able to stand on its own two feet , it needs to seriously rein in payoffs , bonuses and these long - term incentives
â the chancellor needs to stand up to those in the organisation who seem to have forgotten that taxpayers bailed the bank out
shareholders must be heard â and at royal bank of scotland , that includes taxpayers
â royal bank of scotland âs earnings have been hammered by a spiralling bill for its past misdemeanours â including those during mr stephen hester âs reign
last week it reported a Â£ 3.5billion annual loss and announced that former financial services authority boss sir howard davies will take over from sir philip hampton as chairman
it set aside Â£ 2.2billion to cover legal claims , including Â£ 320million to pay further fines in the us for rigging foreign currency markets and an extra Â£ 400million in the last three months of 2014 for mis - selling payment protection insurance
royal bank of scotland , which has been propped up by Â£ 46billion of taxpayers â money since the 2008 financial crisis , still has the power to scrap or delay mr stephen hester âs bonus
shareholders have complained for years that it continues to hand â extraordinary â packages to top staff
the government has a 79 per cent stake in the bank , although it is eager to see it back in private hands
however , with the share price around 370p â still well below the 455p the treasury needs to recoup its money â a sale remains a long way off
conservative mp mark garnier , a member of the influential treasury select committee , said : â success for royal bank of scotland will be when it is back in the private sector
so , given the current environment , i do nât think that people should be taking bonuses until such time that it is fully privatised again
â royal bank of scotland refused to comment .
