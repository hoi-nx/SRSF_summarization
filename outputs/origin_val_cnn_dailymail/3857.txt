when her husband left her for the woman next door mum - of - four gaynor evans was left feeling frumpy , lonely and depressed
fed up with staying in and watching tv on her own the 55 - year - old , from enfield , north london , started joining her single daughters on nights on the tiles - and it was n't long before she discovered her inner cougar
the pubs and bars were full of men in their 20s and 30s who were looking for a good time just like gaynor evans , who refused to accept her sex life was over along with her 20 - year marriage
enjoying up to two dates a week she said she 's now addicted to dating toy boys , clocking up hundreds of internet dates
what 's more , after years of fad dieting , gaynor evans said the energetic sex sessions she enjoys as a result has helped her shed more than two stones of flab and drop from a size 18 to 14
the recruitment manager said : ' when my husband left me i found myself sexually charged but with no one to go to
the only people i knew who were also single were my daughters , who are 37 and 36 , so i went out with them
' i started getting approached by much younger men and i was bemused at first , but then i thought why not ? i just wanted to enjoy myself , still have a sex life and be free
i 'm making up for lost time and it 's liberating
' gaynor evans on a night out with her daughter kate , 36 ( left ) and on another girls night out with laura , 37 ( right ) in a bid to rediscover her lost youth gaynor evans wasted no time joining internet dating sites to hunt for younger men , joining specialist websites such as toyboywarehouse.com because many conventional sites do n't allow more than a 15 - year age gap between clients
she said : ' the youngest guy i 've been out with was 20 , the same age as my youngest son at the time , and i know i 'm older than some of their mothers
there 's a huge amount of chemistry between an older woman and a younger guy and the sex has been amazing
' toy boys have such stamina
i thought i knew all there is to know about sex until i started seeing younger men
' i 'm not swinging from the chandeliers or anything , but i can find myself lost
i do make a point of only seeing them only once or twice which saves me from getting too attached
' the serial dater also makes a point of not taking her men home for saucy liaisons , where her youngest son still lives
she said : ' i never tell my two boys about these things but the girls are always informed and know what i get up to
gaynor evans makes a point of only seeing her toyboys ' once or twice ' so she does n't get too attached then and now : gaynor evans has shed two stones and dropped two dress sizes since dating younger men ' i 'm a mother first and never take men home when my kids are there , which can make it hard because 95 per cent of them do n't have their own places
they house share or still live with their parents so we ca n't go back to theirs
' instead i borrow my daughter 's flat during the day when she 's at work â she does n't mind
i did also use my other daughter 's flat once , but she was n't so happy about it
you can always find somewhere
' despite her expert planning â gaynor evans once flew a toy boy in from abroad as her youngest son flew out on holiday - she has been caught out in the past
she said : ' once i did take a guy home and my son came back when he was n't supposed to and found me delicately placed
' with hundreds of internet dates under her belt gaynor evans decided to self - publish sex and the signposts , a racy ebook charting her experiences as an unlikely cougar in august 2012
in the book she details some of her best â and worst â dates , as well as her saucy sex sessions
she said : ' i also write a blog about my antics with the same title , but i 've saved the naughty stuff for the book
' there was a hottie i met at the ascot races who scooped me off my feet and kissed me with a passion â i 'll always remember him â but other dates were n't so successful
gaynor evans has also become an agony aunt for toyboywarehouse.com and regularly dishes out dating advice to younger men
' there was a date that did n't go so well and afterwards the guy texted me rude pictures of his manhood
then there was another guy whose stutter was so bad he could n't speak at all during the date
i got one of my daughters to ring me at a staged moment and pretend there was an emergency
' madonna , left , and demi moore , right , are both famous for dating younger men although she usually only allows herself to see her toyboys once or twice , there have been a couple gaynor evans has fallen for
she said : ' sometime a first date ends in a first date but there have been one or two guys i 've fallen in love with
i saw one man on and off for four years but he 's moved abroad now , although i 'm still in touch with him
' i feel for them in a way that is measured because i know the relationship ca n't go anywhere
i kick myself because i know the chance of a long relationship is n't likely â even after five years i still have that mental barrier
i often wish i was younger
' but gaynor evans said there are more pros than cons when it comes to dating younger men
she said : ' there 's none of the domestic drudgery you have when you 're in a long term relationship and you never fall out
' when i was younger and dating before i was married you did n't have a very big pool of men to choose from â there was no internet and you just dated people you knew where you lived
now the world is your oyster
' ' i feel like i 've had a new lease of life
i 've dropped from 15 stone to 13 stone through all the sex
i never feel like eating junk food any more and i feel better than ever
' after six months of dating toyboys i lost half a stone , and when i was n't having sex i felt sluggish and the weight started creeping back on
having orgasms is the best diet ever
' ' my mum , who 's 91 , tuts at me but we ca n't all be conventional
one of my daughters is always a bit disappointed in my behaviour but the other is hugely supportive and my friends just expect it now
' ' dating toyboys has been an eye opening experience
when i found out my husband had been having an affair with our neighbour , who was also my friend , for five years i was devastated
the prospect of a lonely life was terrifying and i was scared at what awaited because as an older woman you think your life is over and you 're on the scrapheap
' ' i was scared at what awaited me but what i found was amazingly good
i wish i 'd found out about my husband 's affair sooner
' i 've reinvented myself and now i have a fresh pool to dip my toe â or my whole body into
i 'm proof you can still enjoy your life as an older single woman
