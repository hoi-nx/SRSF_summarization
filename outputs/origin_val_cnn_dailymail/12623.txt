usually the rob kardashian - industrial complex is dominated by comments and social media postings from kim , followed closely by khloe and perhaps one of the jenner children
but on sunday , it was rob , the youngest of the four rob kardashian siblings , who drew most of the attention
in an instagram post , rob kardashian compared his sister to the sociopathic amy dunne , the murderous wife played by pike in " gone girl
" " my sister kim , the b * * * * from gone girl , , , " he posted
he accompanied the text with a photo of pike 's character drenched in blood , fresh from ( spoiler alert ! ) killing her ex-boyfriend
he also unfollowed his entire family , though he changed his mind later
it 's not the first time rob has been at odds with the heavily spotlighted rob kardashian clan
he missed out on kim 's wedding to kanye west , with various ( unnamed , of course ) gossip sources reporting at the time that he was n't getting along with members of his family
khloe kardashian , who has stayed close to rob , told wonderwall.com that he may have a " kind of social anxiety
" " i just feel , especially over the last year , rob has become very introverted and has a kind of social anxiety , " she said
" he 's definitely not at his happiest place that he once was , and i know he can get to that happy place and he will
