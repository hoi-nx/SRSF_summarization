perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to wales is that this cauldron of noise , which at kick - off seemed so threatening , was reduced to a quiet hum after the 50th minute
that was the moment when gareth bale reminded us why real madrid paid Â£ 86million for his signature , why the caustic treatment of his recent performances in spain seems so odd
having drawn a foul from eytan tibi inches outside the box with his pace , he dispatched the ball into the net as simply as if from the penalty spot in any
his shot curled over the wall with surgical placement , leaving goalkeeper marciano stock still

substitute sam vokes , making his first international appearance in a year following serious injury , nearly scored , as gareth bale twice went close to getting his hat - trick
their 3 - 0 win over bosnia here in november and perfect record prior to this game , is indication of that
but they were made to look woefully short by wales
gareth bale said : â we âre in a good position now and we âve got a chance of qualifying
we will keep fighting and working hard and hopefully our performances and results will do all the talking

two nations enjoying unprecedentedly good qualifying campaigns with designs on reaching a major finals for the first time in a generation
the noise for the israel national anthem as thousands held up star of david flags told you that
the whistles greeting early touches by wales players were piercing in the extreme
gareth bale âs name over the tannoy drew louder cat calls than any
â haters gon na hate , â read a sign in the away section , directed more towards real madrid âs critical following than those here in haifa
he did have at least one fan in the home crowd
a poster of â we love you bale â could be seen behind one goal
little battles all over the pitch showed the tension

as the seconds ticked on the disapproving clamour from the home fans grew unbearable almost
allen had a shot blocked , aaron ramsey a corner cleared and then gareth bale delivered a wonderful cross to an unmarked welshman at the back stick
unfortunately it was collins , who stood on the ball from two yards out rather than apply the finishing touch that had seemed certain
the pause allowed israel to clear
