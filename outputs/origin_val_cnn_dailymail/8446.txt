a former waitress was awarded $ 1million eight years after her nightclub owner boss was convicted for sexually abusing and forcibly touching her in a storage closet at work
slama , 30 , was working at the now - shuttered new york club quo in december 2007 when her employer , malhotra , told her he wanted to talk to her about a job opportunity at a new venue
that 's when malhotra pushed slama into the closet , blocking the door with his body , and offered the waitress cocaine before asking if he could snort a line off her body , salma 's lawsuit claimed
slama said that , after she declined , malhotra then complimented her backside before telling her ' i want to sniff it off your a * * '
malhotra then grabbed her backside and chest and , according to the suit , told slama he would sniff cocaine off her breast as she cried out for him to stop
slama said that , after she continued to resist , her boss said she had to let him snort a line off her shoulder ' because you work for me ' and then slipped off one of her tank top 's straps
he then shook cocaine on slama 's shoulder and ' snorted the line ' off it before he ' began licking her shoulder and neck , ' according to court papers
slama said she tried to push her boss away the entire time but he was ' much larger and overpowered her '
it was n't until malhorta left for a cigarette break that slama said she was able to sneak out and report the incident to police
malhorta was convicted of sexual abuse , harassment and forcible touching in 2009
he was sentenced to five days of community service , according to the new york daily news
in 2010 slama filed a $ 3.5million civil suit against her former boss , suing him for sexual harassment and mental anguish
but malhorta delayed slama 's case for years because he claimed he was going to appeal the criminal conviction
after the deadline to file an appeal passed , slama was able to win a default judgement against malhorta in 2013
slama told the new york daily news she was ' relieved ' that ' this long battle has finally come to an end
' ' it has been a long and emotional road , ' she said
slama is now a restaurant manager in a manhattan hotel
she said she is proud that she stood up for herself and other victims and was relieved malhotra was held responsible for his actions .
