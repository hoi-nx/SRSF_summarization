eating too much salt may be bad for your heart â but it can protect against skin infections , research has found
a high - salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin , boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections , say scientists
in an experiment , german researchers discovered that mice which were fed a high - salt diet healed infections in their feet more quickly
too much salt may be bad for your heart but it can protect against skin infections , new research found this is because the salt had raised the activity of immune cells called macrophages , making their immune systems more responsive
the findings , published in the journal cell metabolism , may also highlight how salt was once effectively used to ward off infections before antibiotics were invented
professor jantsch , of the university of regensburg , said : ' up to now , salt has been regarded as a detrimental dietary factor ; it is clearly known to be detrimental for cardiovascular diseases , and recent studies have implicated a role in worsening autoimmune diseases
' our current study challenges this one - sided view and suggests that increasing salt accumulation at the site of infections might be an ancient strategy to ward off infections , long before antibiotics were invented
' high levels of sodium stored in the skin , especially in the elderly , can lead to high blood pressure and increase the risk for heart disease and stroke , worsen autoimmune disease and even increase the risk of stomach cancer
professor jens titze from vanderbilt university added : ' despite the overwhelming evidence linking dietary salt to disease in humans , the potential evolutionary advantage of storing so much salt in the body has not been clear
' a high - salt diet causes sodium levels to build up in the skin , boosting the immune system to fight off the germs that cause bacterial skin infections , say scientists the researchers found that infected areas in patients with bacterial skin infections also showed remarkably high salt accumulation
but in experiments high salt diet mice had increased immunity against microbial infections by boosting the activity of immune cells called macrophages
this meant that mice who had infections in their feet caused by a parasite called leishmania major were able to heal more quickly
future studies will examine how salt accumulates in the skin and triggers immune responses , and why salt accumulates in the skin of ageing adults
professor jantsch went on : ' a further understanding of the regulatory cascades might not only help to design drugs that specifically enhance local salt deposition and help to combat infectious diseases , but also may lead to novel strategies to mobilise sodium stores in the ageing population and prevent cardiovascular disease
' we also think that local application of high - salt - containing wound dressings and the development of other salt - boosting antimicrobial therapies might bear therapeutic potential
' but he warned everyone should not rush off and start a high salt diet
he added : ' due to the overwhelming clinical studies demonstrating that high dietary salt is detrimental to hypertension and cardiovascular diseases , we feel that at present our data does not justify recommendations on high dietary salt in the general population
' nevertheless , in situations where endogenous accumulation of salt to sites of infection is insufficient , supplementation of salt might be a therapeutic option
' but this needs to be addressed in further studies
