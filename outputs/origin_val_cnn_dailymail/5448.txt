brazil came from behind to see off france in a friendly at the france , with goals from oscar , neymar , and luis gustavo
france had taken the lead through a raphael varane header , and looked to be in total control before chelsea star oscar 's well - worked equaliser , but the visitors fought back strongly in the second half , and could have scored more as the game wore on
barcelona 's neymar who already had 42 goals for his country before this game , made it 43 , firing past mandanda from an angle which will have disappointed the french keeper , before wolfsburg defensive midfielder luis gustavo was given the run of the penalty area to head home from a corner

goals : oscar 40 , neymar 57 , luis gustavo 69 referee : nicola rizzoli ( italy ) france , on the other hand , threatened most from set pieces , and karim benzema , moussa sissoko and raphael varane could easily have added further goals for the hosts , as brazil looked panicky whenever a decent cross arrived in their box
as tends to be the way with such friendlies , there was no great intensity to the play , but , in flashes there was real quality , and oscar 's equaliser epitomised that
the chelsea man , operating from the left , played a lovely one - two with firmino before arriving fractions ahead of a defender to poke past mandanda
you might say it was a goal worthy of a world cup final , but , 17 years after these two sides contested one on the same ground , it had to make do with turning the tide in a friendly
france had actually started the brighter , and should have been ahead after just eight minutes , karim benzema denied by a brilliant save from jefferson , but he really should have scored his header from three yards
brazil , with manchester united target firmino playing up front alongside talismanic captain neymar , failed to find their best play early on , limited for the most part to long shots
firmino in particular was keen to get a strike away from range , but while he twice worked mandanda with powerful drives , neither could seriously have been said to overstretch the marseille stopper
indeed , while mandanda made several flashy saves throughout the game , denying luis gustavo , willian and oscar in the second half , he was rarely able to stop efforts that came from within his side 's eighteen - yard box
neymar , oscillating between the subtle touches we are used to seeing from him and a clear inability to cope with the slippery surface , should really have been the first to fire past the france keeper , after oscar had capitalised on a mistake from schneiderlin , but having squared up raphael varane , his shot lacked power and direction

in truth it owed much to patrice evra blocking off defenders , and the majority of the brazilian standing still as mathieu valbuena 's corner came over , but the real madrid centre back still did well to direct his header into the far corner
but france were never able to fully capitalise on brazilian frailties again , raphael varane failing to poke home after a free kick , and karim benzema blazing over the bar
debutant nabil fekir came closest from open play after coming off the bench , but sent his shot just wide
jefferson , who had earlier made a good save from karim benzema following another set piece , can not stop raphael varane 's header finding the corner despite having plenty of defenders in the box , brazil were unable to stop raphael varane getting a clean header on the ball to open the scoring as the almost obligatory substitutions poured off the bench the game lost momentum , but for dunga , there were real signs of encouragement
brazil were always dangerous on the counter attack , with willian a particular danger , and , set pieces aside , they looked solid defensively
this was not the free flowing football that brazilian sides are famed for , but , for the second time under dunga , brazil look tough to beat
