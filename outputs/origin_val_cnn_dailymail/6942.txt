juve travel to face borussia dortmund on wednesday night knowing that if they do not score , their germany opponents can knock them out with a single goal
so the message is clear : they must attack
head coach allegri has spoken out ahead of the game urging his team to show they are far from the side cast as ' boring ' that lead italy 's serie a - and the italian sport newspapers have reflected the boss ' vision
gazzetta dello sport , tuttosport and corriere dello sport all call for the nation 's champions to attack borussia dortmund , with a forward line including marco reus and pierre-emerick aubameyang unlikely to be restricted to an extent that they are unable to score the one goal that could send borussia dortmund through after juve 's 2 - 1 home win last month
gazzetta dello sport 's : ' go juve ! the right choice ' and tuttosport 's : ' the order of allegri : let 's attack ! ' corriere dello sport 's front page barks out : ' juve , take europe ' after allegri 's comments tuttosport 's message is the most resounding , with their front page specifically calling for juve to attack at the signal iduna park making it clear that in order to qualify , the juve need goals
the paper also calls for argentine winger roberto pereyra to be used in a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 system by allegri - who it also reports is set to be offered a new contract
both gazzetta and corriere dello sport look to juve ' talisman , former manchester city and manchester united striker , carlos tevez
gazzetta also want to see roberto pereyra deployed in a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 behind carlos tevez and alvaro morata in a game that could be worth Â£ 6.5million to juve
carlos tevez trains ahead of the last - 16 tie , and the italian papers see him as a key man for juve paul pogba takes a moment away from the training session as juve look to hold on to their lead meanwhile , corriere dello sport calls for the ' class of carlos tevez and super defence to tackle klopp '
' we go into the game with an advantage , ' allegri said ahead of the game
' we know the difficulties of the task ahead of us , no doubt about it
' i do n't expect it to end 0 - 0
we need to score at least once and if we could score two goals it would be great
' allegri believes the game in borussia dortmund will not end 0 - 0 and that his side will need to find a way to score alvaro morata hits a pass during training , and gazzetta dello sport want him upfront alongside carlos tevez the germany have been improving in recent weeks after a bad first half to the bundesliga season and have lost none of their last six league games
they are also unbeaten at home in europe this season although they have lost all three previous encounters against the italian in borussia dortmund
' we have to be ready for the strengths of borussia dortmund , their speed , their pressure , ' the italian coach added
' we have to have a technically perfect game and pounce on their weaknesses
' the italian papers called for carlos tevez to lead the attack at the signal iduna park while juve 's defence holds firm roberto pereyra ( second right ) is seen as a key man by the italian papers , who want him deployed in a 4 - 3 - 1 - 2
