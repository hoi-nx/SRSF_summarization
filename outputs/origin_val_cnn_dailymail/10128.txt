amnesty has concluded that hamas committed war crimes during the 2014 gaza conflict by firing rockets ' indiscriminately ' at civilian areas and using non-combatants as human shields
' in launching these attacks , [ palestinian jihadis ] displayed a flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law and for the consequences of their violations on civilians in both israel and the gaza , ' said philip luther , amnesty 's director for the middle east and north africa
the report concluded that rocket attacks had killed six civilians in israel , including a child
other rockets aimed at the jewish state fell short and killed at least 13 palestinian civilians , 11 of them children , on the beach in gaza , in an attack that was wrongly blamed on israel
amnesty described them as ' indiscriminate ' , and said that they killed more palestinian than israel when they misfired palestinian witnesses had claimed that an israel f - 16 warplane had killed palestinian civilians on the beach
but the amnesty report has corroborated the israel army 's account of events , which said that the deaths occurred when militants misfired their own rockets
' an independent munitions expert who examined the available evidence ... concluded that the projectile used in the attack was a palestinian rocket , ' the report said
it confirmed that during the 50 - day war , palestinian terrorists launched unguided rockets and mortars from civilian areas toward other civilian areas , constituting a breach of international law
figures released by the israel army after the war ended on 26 august showed that gaza militants fired 4,591 projectiles at israel
of those , 3,659 struck israel territory and 735 were intercepted by the iron dome air defence system , leaving another 197 falling short and landing inside the coastal enclave
militant groups used unguided projectiles which were ' inherently indiscriminate , ' the report said , noting that this is ' prohibited under international law ' and ' constitutes a war crime '
philip luther demanded that palestinian armed groups ' end all direct attacks on civilians ' , and take all feasible precautions ' to protect civilians in the gaza from the effects of such attacks ' , including launching attacks ' within or near densely populated areas
' other war crimes committed by palestinian terrorists included storing munitions in civilian buildings and u.n. schools and launching attacks from areas densely populated with civilians , effectively using them as human shields
philip luther called on both israel and palestinian authorities to cooperate with u.n. and international criminal court probes ' to end decades of impunity that have perpetuated a cycle of violations in which civilians on both sides have paid a heavy price '
hamas official taher al-nounou denied the allegations in the amnesty report , saying that hamas did not target civilians
an islamic jihad spokesman , daud shihab , said that the rocket fire was in self - defence , and did little damage in comparison to israel 's weapons
the 50 - day gaza war claimed the lives of about 2,200 palestinians and 73 israel .
