durham and warwick are new entries in the world âs top 100 universities , with oxbridge rivalling 1 harvard , it has been revealed
the uk now has 12 uk universities listed in the times higher education reputation rankings - up from 10 last year and nine in 2013 - the second highest of any individual country
the rankings also show that oxbridge rates higher than prestigious u.s. universities such as the massachusetts institute of technology ( massachusetts institute of technology ) and stanford
only the u.s. has more entries in the top 100 , with 43
germany has the next most with six
the results show that for the fifth year in a row there is an elite group of six u.s. and uk â super brands â , the authors suggested , which are â head and shoulders above the rest â
1 harvard took first place again , followed by cambridge which has moved up from fourth , and oxford , which has risen from fifth to third
taking fourth place was massachusetts institute of technology , down two on last year , while stanford fell two places to fifth and university of california , berkeley remained in sixth
other uk universities in the top 100 include imperial college london , which falls one place to 14th , university college london , which is up eight places to 17th , and the london school of economics and political science which has moved from 24th to 22nd
soaring up the rankings are edinburgh , which has moved from 46th place to 29th , and king âs college london , which has gone from 43rd to 31st
manchester takes the 50th position and bristol â which had dropped out the rankings last year - and the london business school are in the 91 - 100 band
top : 1 harvard was named number one , but cambridge and oxford came second and third respectively warwick and durham are two new entrants to the top 100 in the 81 - 90 band
across the world , oxbridge-london and paris have the highest number of prestigious universities in the world
each have five universities in the top 100
but there are concerns that other areas of the uk â beyond the oxbridge-london â golden triangle â â are losing out
phil baty , editor of times higher education rankings , said : â this has been a good year for the uk , with the south east â golden triangle â of oxbridge-london , oxford and cambridge cementing its position at the heart of higher education âs global elite , drawing in talent and investment from across the world
â 1 harvard , u.s. 2 cambridge , uk 3 oxford , uk 4 massachusetts institute of technology , u.s. 5 stanford , u.s. 6 university of california , berkeley , u.s. 7 princeton , u.s. 8 yale , u.s. 9 california institute of technology , u.s. 10 columbia , u.s. he added : â it must be a concern for the many england regions that so many of our top institutions are concentrated in oxbridge-london and the south east
â england âs top six institutions ( and seven of all 11 england universities in the ranking ) are all in the oxbridge-london â golden triangle â , and these institutions will continue to draw in the leading talent from england and beyond , supply the most desirable graduates into the local workforce and attract the lion âs share of business investment
it is a virtuous circle as success breeds future success
â leeds and sheffield universities both dropped out of the top 100 a few years ago , and there is no place for the flagship universities of major cities including birmingham and liverpool
â there is a risk that if resources for universities become even more scarce after the election , whoever wins , the rich of the south east will keep getting richer at the expense of the rest of the country
â business secretary vince cable added : â our reforms have helped to ensure uk universities are some of the best funded in the world and even more competitive for excellence â second only to the u.s.
â however , other nations are hot on our heels , which is why we have taken steps to secure the reputation of our institutions by enabling them to have a sustainable income stream and removing student number controls from the next academic year to increase quality and accessibility
â the rankings are based on a survey of about 10,000 academics in 142 countries
they were asked to nominate up to ten of the best institutions in the world for teaching and research .
