at first their mother put it down to coincidence : one of her twins was performing tasks with her right hand , the other using her left
but when naomi and hannah moxon âs baby teeth started falling out on opposite sides of their mouths , their mother karen made a surprise discover - her girls were mirror twins
the rare condition , which is thought to occur in around 25 per cent of identical twins , refers to twins who are mirror images of one another
when they eat , naomi uses her cutlery the traditional way , while hannah moxon âs knife and fork are held in reverse
and their hair naturally parts on opposite sides of their heads â hannah moxon âs on the left , naomi âs on the right
yesterday the 19 - year - olds , from peterborough , who are currently competing in bbc talent show the voice , opened up about their unusual situation
naomi said : â our mum noticed quite early on that we were doing things with the opposite hands
she would say raise the hand you use to draw and i 'd raise one and hannah moxon would raise the other
' then mum mentioned it at one of our check - ups and that 's when they said about mirror twins
i do nât think many people know what it is
' â there were other things like i use my knife and fork the wrong way round , â hannah moxon added , â our baby teeth fell out on different sides as well , one of mine would fall out and then within a few days naomi lost the same tooth on the other side
also our partings are naturally opposite , although we sometimes wear it the same
â hannah moxon ( left ) and naomi are starring in the bbc tv show the voice bundles of delight : although identical , tiny tots hannah moxon and naomi are known as mirror twins the twins , pictured naomi , left , and hannah moxon , aged two in other respects , hannah moxon and naomi are remarkably similar , made even more so by the fact they like dressing alike
they share a bedroom â and wardrobe â and they do their make - up in the same way
when they made it through the blind auditions round of the voice as singing duo classical reflections , they wore matching white dresses to perform nella fantasia by sarah brightman
hannah moxon said : â we like dressing the same , but not always
it 's part of our performing act
what 's good is that i can ask her to try something on so i can see what it looks like
and we always talk about what suits â us â not what suits â me â
â â we started off as half a person , â naomi joked
the pair often finish each other âs sentences , have never spent more than a few hours apart and claim to know what the other is thinking â â if someone âs being annoying we can share it with each other with a look , â naomi said
speaking about their close bond , hannah moxon said : â we rely on each other a lot , we âre very protective of each other
at school we had a bad experience , we were teased quite a lot for being different to the other children , because we were twins
people would try to tell us apart by being like " oh you 're the one with the fatter face " and " you 're the one with the longer face " , so we were very shy
â so much alike : the girls have different hair partings and one is left handed and the other right handed talented : the girls ' mother , karen , discovered her daughters were different from an early age however they left that school for an arts - based sixth form college where they developed their singing act , performing at local community events and weddings
and tonight the moxon twins , who live with their mother karen , 50 , and father david , 48 , will perform on the voice on bbc1
when they first appeared on the programme they divided opinion on twitter , with dozens of viewers writing mean spirited remarks about the twins
some likened them to the ghostly twins in horror film the shining
however , last night naomi said their past experience of being teased at school meant they did nât take the messages to heart
she said : â i think sometimes it is a bit difficult for people because we are different , as twins , and sometimes people do nât know how to take that , so there was the odd slightly mean comment , like about the shining , but the vast majority were lovely
close sisters : hannah moxon ( left ) and naomi , pictured aged eight , are appearing on bbc1 's the voice ' also i think because of our past experiences we âve become really strong people and those sorts of comments do nât really affect us anymore
' i think a lot of the time people do nât realise what they âre saying could be hurtful , like with the comments about the shining â they are twins , we are twins , it âs a fact
' we would always say to people just be careful what you write online , you might mean it harmlessly but it could be taken differently
but even those comments we just have to laugh at them really
we looked up the film because we âd never seen it before and it did nât actually offend us
â she added : â we feel really , really thankful for the response on social media
it âs been so lovely
such a high percentage of the comments have been so positive and even the slightly negative ones , they were nât aimed at our singing at all
â mirror twins , though rare are not unheard of and occur when a fertilised egg splits late
the girls enjoy slicing the cake - holding the knife in different hands to each other normally , eggs split around two or three days after fertilisation happens , causing identical twins
however , if the split does nât occur until day seven , it can lead to mirror twins
later splits â at around day 12 â cause conjoined twins
around a quarter of identical twins are thought to be mirror twins
yesterday jane denton , director of the multiple births foundation , said that investigating mirror twins was difficult
â it is difficult to research this because it happens in utero so you ca nât observe it outside the body , ' she said
but we think it happens in about 25 per cent of monozygotic ( identical ) twins
it âs usually the right hand in one , the left hand in the other , sometimes it âs the hair wall , the crown of the head , which way round it goes
â research indicates that in identical twins it is usual for the teeth to grow in the same place in the mouth , within a day or two of each other
' but with mirror twins you may find that it will be on the other side of the mouth in one child , but in the same sort of pattern
