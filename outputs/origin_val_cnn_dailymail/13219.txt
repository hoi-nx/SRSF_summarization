uva student leaders have scheduled a campus forum with police friday to discuss allegations of brutality following the bloody arrest of a 20 - year - old student that prompted protests at uva
the incident early wednesday involved uniformed alcohol control agents and martese johnson , an african-american student at uva
it made headlines around the country and prompted gov. terry mcauliffe to order an independent virginia state police investigation into what happened
the on - campus forum is scheduled for 1 p.m. friday
in a facebook post , the university 's student council said representatives from charlottesville , virginia , police , albemarle county police and the state alcohol beverage control were to attend the forum " to engage in a conversation about their relationship with students , or lack thereof , and about the issue of police brutality
" martese johnson 's arrest prompted protests among students demanding " justice for martese johnson " after images circulated showing his bloodied face and clothing
while what happened wednesday remains under investigation , video from the incident shows martese johnson pinned to the ground , screaming : " i go to uva ! ... you f * * * * * * racists ! what the f * * * ? how did this happen ? " an officer can be heard telling the man to stop fighting
according to the student 's attorney , watkins , " just before handcuffing him , police took martese johnson to the ground , striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head
" he needed 10 stitches to close the gash in his head , watkins said
martese johnson was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice , according to the virginia department of alcoholic beverage control , which acknowledged he suffered injuries during his arrest
the agents were placed on administrative duties during the investigation , the agency said
the black student alliance said the arrest reminds black uva students " of the gruesome reality that we are not immune to injustice
" in a news release , the university called the arrest disturbing , and university president teresa sullivan issued a statement saying that " every member of our community should feel safe from the threat of bodily harm and other forms of violence
" virginia attorney general mark herring appealed for patience
" certainly the images that we 've all been looking at in charlottesville are shocking , but it 's really important that we get the facts out and understand exactly what happened , " martese johnson said
friday 's forum will be held at a theater on the uva campus
the student council said media would not be allowed to ask questions or bring cameras into the forum but said the event would be live - streamed on the internet
" this is a student space -- a chance for students to ask the questions they feel are most pressing to virginia 's most senior law enforcement officials , " the group said on facebook
students leaders asked their contemporaries to tweet questions in advance
as of midmorning friday , only a handful of tweets had crossed using the proposed hashtag " # policedialogue
" " is the problematic influence of implicit bias discussed at all during police training , " twitter user yaejmeister asked
among other questions , one student asked why alcohol control agents have police powers
a third wondered " is catering to uva 's hypersensitivity preparing our students for the world outside of ' grounds ' ? " the incident comes amid a continuing nationwide debate over the use of force by police , particularly involving african - americans , following the deaths last summer of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , and eric garner in new york
grand juries in both communities declined to indict white police officers in the deaths , leading to angry protests nationwide and calls for renewed attention to claims of police bullying and brutality .
