doting : mother - of - one candice campbell , 25 ( pictured left and right with partner burns ) , choked to death on her own vomit after eating a kinder bueno before falling asleep on the sofa , an inquest has heard her husband - to - be burns , who had also fallen asleep , woke up to find his partner 's lifeless body slumped onto his knee
despite him desperately giving cpr to miss campbell , she could not be saved
miss candice campbell , who did not drink alcohol , had been taking a variety of prescribed medication to ease abdominal pain which she had suffered after giving birth in october 2013
at an inquest into her death , mr burns told the hearing how he had warned miss candice campbell not to eat the bar , incase she fell asleep
he told how the pair had both fallen asleep while watching a film , but that he had woken up around 5.30am to find miss candice campbell unresponsive
he said : ' candice campbell was eating a stick of kinder bueno and i told her not to eat chocolate in case she fell asleep because her medication makes her drowsy
i was worried that she may fall asleep eating it
' i must have been tired because i fell asleep
i woke up to the dogs barking and candice campbell 's head was on my lap. the first thing i remember saying to her was , " wake up , let 's go upstairs "
' i noticed her lips were blue and there was a white foam coming from her nose and food particles at her mouth
' mr burns said when he realised she was not responsive , he began cpr
an inquest heard how miss candice campbell was watching a film with her partner at their home in hull when the pair both drifted off to sleep
mr burns told the inquest that he had warned her not to eat the bar ( pictured ) he said : ' i gave her mouth to mouth and pressed down on her chest as i was taught at first aid
' i continued to scoop out food from her mouth and i saw there was the kinder bueno she was eating before i fell asleep
' i tried to resuscitate her
i blew twice into her mouth and did 32 compressions
' the inquest heard how mr burns then ran 12 doors down the street to miss candice campbell 's parents ' house to get help
her father , gibson , also attempted cpr before they called for an ambulance
dr scott , consultant neuropathologist at the queens medical centre in nottingham , carried out the post-mortem examination
he said toxicology tests revealed miss candice campbell had taken several different drugs , including diazepam , tramadol , pregabalin and ' possibly ' dihydrocodeine
he said that although miss candice campbell had not taken a ' fatal ' amount of each drug , the combination had been enough to depress the central nervous system , which left her unable to clear her airways if she vomited
dr scott said : ' i found debris impacted in the trachea and material similar to that which is found in the stomach
' where a patient may vomit and then inhale what 's been in the stomach it causes asphyxia
the cause of death is asphyxiation due to aspiration of gastric contents
there is no suggestion that this was a deliberate overdose
' during the hearing , mr gibson paid tribute to his daughter
he told the court : ' she was a good mum and would have done anything for harrison
' she loved being around people , she had a lot of friends , she was also a real family girl who enjoyed spending time with them
' senior coroner professor paul marks recorded a verdict of accidental death , calling it a ' tragic case '
he said : ' this is a very tragic case where a young mother had been enjoying an evening with her partner and fell asleep
' she vomited but was unable to clear her airways
there is not a shred of evidence to suggest candice campbell took more medication than she should have
