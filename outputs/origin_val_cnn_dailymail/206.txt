the early delivery of raspberries follows uk - grown strawberries becoming available two weeks earlier than in previous years
this is thanks to the weather this winter which the met office has said was the sunniest since records began in 1929
while the figures for rainfall and temperature were average , the number of sunny days was 125 per cent of the long - term average
olins , chairman of industry body uk summer fruits , said the raspberries were the result of a trial plot of the ' very sweet ' diamond jubilee berries planted by harry hall , who supplied waitrose with the first strawberries of the season earlier this month
just 200kg of the berries , which are grown in glasshouses , are expected this week but there should be around a tonne produced every week afterwards
mr olins said : ' this is probably the earliest we 've seen english raspberries - around two weeks earlier than normal
' waitrose 's raspberry buyer nicki baggott said : ' this is the first time we 've been able to offer uk - grown raspberries so early in the year

' raspberries were once regarded as a late summer crop , but uk summer fruits said growers are using new varieties and innovative methods to extend the season
