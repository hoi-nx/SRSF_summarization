a volcano in russia led to the cancellation of flights in alaska over the weekend
" we canceled two roundtrip flights between anchorage and bethel , and anchorage and nome after an advisory of low visibility , " alaska airlines spokeswoman halley knigge said
ash from russia 's shiveluch volcano was the culprit behind the flight disruptions saturday , said freymueller , a scientist at the alaska volcano observatory
the volcano erupted friday , shooting ash into the atmosphere some 30,000 feet
winds blew the ash cloud across the bering sea and into western alaska , freymueller said
shiveluch , which has been erupting consistently , caused a similar incident in january , he said
the airline will only operate flights when it 's safe to do so and will not fly into areas of reported ash
alaska airlines was uncertain if additional flights would be canceled , but said it 's monitoring the situation
three volcanoes are erupting on russia 's kamchatka peninsula : shiveluch , klyuchevskoy and karymsky
