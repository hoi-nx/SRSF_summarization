a dad whose video of he and his nine - month - old baby surfing made waves on the internet is defending his decision to take the infant for a ride after critics called the sport too dangerous
jorge tirado , 43 , of puerto rico spoke to inside edition 's les trent about his choice to involve his little boy in the sport and film it all with his gopro camera to upload online this week
les trent asked , ' i do think a lot of people seeing that video say that 's not something you should do with a baby
i 'm never going to put the baby beyond any reach
the baby is stuck with me and his legs [ are ] on my stomach
' jorge tirado said that the sport is not dangerous but is actually enlightening for his son who was blessed to go into the ocean for the first time
' my son first try
' i encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean , after all the ocean is the place where it all began
' by far , this is the best sport for your spiritual , mental and physical health
' like a pro : the footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board at nine months old , babies , if they are really advanced , might be crawling around on the floor , or shuffling from a to b. however , this tiny tot has been filmed surfing - as his father takes him out on his bodyboard
in the video , jorge tirado can be seen holding his son , who is unnamed , and getting him ready for a day 's surfing
the footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves , and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave
although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water , it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves
jorge tirado does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in puerto rico
not impressed ... jorge tirado 's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave the baby is visible at the height of a huge wave , bracing himself for impact , with his father propped up over him the baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave , but handles the impact well as the two ride ride through the middle of the tube of a wave , the baby is all smiles at the motion just chilling : jorge tirado , 43 , floats with his son in preparation before entering the waves beginner 's nerves : at first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water , but he soon learns to love the movement through the water the baby is then seen in the water , with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board
at times , the tot does n't look impressed , as the water cascades over him
but he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer
while taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous , it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age
pro-surfer john john florence , 22 , for example , has said that he was only six - months - old when his mother put him in a life vest and sat him on the nose of her surfboard as she paddled into waves .
