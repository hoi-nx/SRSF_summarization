united have been heavily criticised by former liverpool star molby , as the playmaker adds fuel to fire ahead of the crucial clash in the race for the champions league places
the ex-danish international is very much a favourite at his former employers and was keen to play up liverpool 's chances of pipping united to fourth
molby gave a scathing review on louis van gaal 's side and has described their position in the champions league places as a ' miracle
' molby labelled united as ' clueless ' and thinks it 's a ' miracle ' where they are in the table he told the daily star : ' i 've seen a lot of united 's matches this season and i find it quite amazing they are in the top four
the best way of describing them is clueless
' i look at united and see weaknesses
if we move the ball at pace and put them under pressure from the start then we will cause them a lot of problems
' considering the talent they have available , they just have n't performed
louis van gaal and wayne rooney wo n't be pleased with molby 's comments ahead of the clash ' but having an excellent keeper and not conceding many goals has enabled them to paper over the cracks and win games narrowly
' the fact they are fourth is a minor miracle
their performances just have n't merited a top - four place
' they are n't in the best four teams in the premier league and liverpool are in much better shape
' liverpool are the in - form team in the premier league with the champions league places in their sights
