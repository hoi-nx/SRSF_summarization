only once did ince pause for breath in dublin 8 on thursday
nothing else fazed ' the guv'nor ' on a carlsberg gig in the shadow of st patrick 's cathedral
not roy keane 's managerial qualities , his relationship with fergie , ryan giggs ' role at old trafford , where wayne rooney should play , or manuel pellegrini 's future
no. the only question which caused him to puff his cheeks and buy time , was a simple one : are liverpool a better team with steven gerrard , or without ? ince is pictured in dublin on thursday as he spoke about liverpool vs manchester united with manchester united docking at anfield on sunday , and steven gerrard â or steven gerrard as ince called him - available after injury , the query was relevant
' i think any liverpool team with steven gerrard is going to be better , not just from a footballing point of view but a leadership point of view , ' he said
' steven gerrard is like a comfort blanket
when he is in your team you feel comfortable , you think ' oh good , steven gerrard is there
' ' when steven gerrard is not in the liverpool team , players worry
but when they see him leading them out , they feel alright , ' we 've got our leader here
' ' they 've won without him , done well , but sunday is one of those games where you need your men , your warriors , and that 's what steven gerrard is
' whether liverpool manager brendan rodgers feels the same remains to be seen but ince is adamant steven gerrard should play
' if i was manager , i 'd pick him , ' he said
with or without steven gerrard , ince feels liverpool have a slight edge
steven gerrard ( right ) puts in a tackle on swansea 's bafetimbi gomis at the liberty on monday night ' if you 'd asked me a couple of weeks ago i 'd have said a comfortable win for liverpool , now , i think there 's a bit more to it as manchester united were more like the old manchester united against tottenham
' liverpool are flying and are really strong at home , and i think they will win
' not that a swallow will make a summer for a club without a championship since 1990
' the only way liverpool will overtake manchester united is to start winning titles again , ' acknowledged ince
ince is out of management since blackpool showed him the door 14 months ago , but 45 minutes in his company left the impression he could do a decent job for any number of clubs
open , engaging , informative , ince covered almost as much ground as he did in a distinguished playing career which spanned 20 seasons , eight of which he spent at manchester united , where he won plenty , and liverpool , where he won nothing
at that time , ince reckoned everyone wanted to play for those two clubs , but now they ' ai n't the big giants anymore
' ' we 're not talking about two teams fighting for the title , we 're talking about two teams fighting for champions league football
' ince feels that liverpool are a better team with steven gerrard as he looked ahead to sunday 's match at anfield ' if chelsea were playing man city the same day we 'd be talking about those two giants instead
' while building up roy keane as a contender to manage manchester united in the future , he does n't believe ryan giggs can succeed van gaal
' absolutely no chance , ' he said
' ryan giggs 's my mate and he enjoyed last year , he loved it
and now under van gaal he 's learning
but i said to ryan giggs , ' you got ta go to a club to get experience
go manage a league one side or league two side or because you 're ryan giggs you might get a championship team
' ' you ca n't just throw him into manchester united , one of the biggest clubs in the world and say ' there ya go ryan giggs
' he 's not ready for that
' ' why would you put ryan giggs in a situation where if he does n't succeed you have to sack him ? ' learn from van gaal and then go out and find your own feet
then come back and say ' i 've done five or six years
' that 's how i see the road for ryan giggs
' manchester united assistant manager ryan giggs ( left ) speaks with wayne rooney during the fa cup sixth round match against arsenal last week ince took that route , starting off at macclesfield and working his way to the premier league in just two years at blackburn , where he became the first black manager in the top flight
he has n't made it back there again , and been out of work grates
' you ca n't just say ' i 'm roy keane ' or ' i 'm ince ' and wait for someone to come
it does n't work like that
you 've got to put your cv in
' i do n't want to go to a firefighting job
i want a three - year project , where you can build and try to be successful
' ince retains the coltish enthusiasm of the tearaway teenager who broke through at west ham under john lyall in the late 80s where he played beside liam â for so long ireland 's comfort blanket
ince ( left ) is pictured speaking to son tom during his days in charge of blackpool in september 2013 ' i was watching chippy last night on tv and i could n't believe i played with him
am i that old ? surely not , but what a player , ' he smiled
' liam was n't quick anyway and he was even slower at west ham
but he had a wonderful , cultured left foot and his mind was so far in front of anyone else
' ' i was only 18 - 19 and thinking ' move over , old man i 'm taking over ' but he would flick the ball around the corners and get it back
he taught me a lesson
' then , just like today , the top flight of english football had room for outstanding 34 - year - olds
it 's still a place for old men , like steven gerrard
