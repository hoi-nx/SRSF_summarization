tottenham striker harry kane is in contention to make his england debut on friday night against lithuania in their euro 2016 qualifier
the 21 - year - old has been in sparkling form for tottenham this season - having netted 29 goals in all competitions so far
1966 world cup winner sir geoff hurst believes harry kane has what it takes to shine on the international stage for roy hodgson 's side
1966 world cup winner sir geoff hurst ( left ) believes harry kane has what it takes to be an england star thrill of a debut i âll never forget what it was like getting that first call
it was the start of 1966 and west ham âs manager ron greenwood took me aside in training and said i had been picked for a game against poland
it was real elation even if i did nât play
i made my debut a month later against germany
why this is relevant to harry kane is the confidence you get from reaching that level
that could be a very big factor for this lad
geoff hurst made his debut for england in a 1 - 0 friendly win against germany in february 1966 confidence self - belief is a huge thing in football , especially for strikers
when i got my england debut i felt 10 feet tall
with the season harry kane has had , and now this selection , his extra confidence means we should be able to expect even more from him
the challenge will be doing it again next season
people will analyse how you mark him , how you stop him
it will be very interesting to see how he reacts to that
i would say he is not vulnerable to that , when i think about his character
harry kane could make his england debut against lithuania in their euro 2016 qualifier on friday night at wembley character what i like is that harry kane has not had it all his own way - he had to fight to get in , he had to go out on loan
it has not been smooth
i was nât a world - class player coming through but we have seen lots of players who have become more successful than those around them with more talent
dedication and attitude are such key traits and harry kane has those in abundance
i saw him receive an award recently at a charity dinner
you could see how level - headed he is
harry kane has had several spells out on loan before breaking into the tottenham first - team this season the ingredients looking at harry kane , i am reminded of a speech i heard years ago by bill shankly
he was talking about chelsea âs peter and said : â peter is deceptive - he is much slower than you think he is
â i liken that to harry kane
he is deceptive - he is much better than you think he is
harry kane is a bit like thomas muller , the bayern munich and germany forward
on your first glance at thomas muller , he does nât look like a footballer
he has his socks down his shins , looks ungainly
but he âs a fantastic player
i liken harry kane to that type of all - round player
geoff hurst believes harry kane 's deceptive style of play can be compared to germany forward thomas muller ( right ) strengths i like how he shoots
he is almost always on target
he can score from distance or a tap - in - and that is a whole different skill
he can anticipate and poach
he strikes the ball cleanly and that is why he is often on target
it is also why he is so good at keeping the ball low
how often do you see him shoot over ? the other thing is they come from all directions
he will still be unpredictable next year because there is not one set place he shoots from

more than that , harry kane has football intelligence which is especially important for strikers
his awareness of space on the pitch is very good
throw in the fact he is very , very good in the air , strong physically and willing to press and defend , and you have a striker to be excited about
he is a team player
i will save my excitement until the end of next season to see if he has done it again - look at ravel morrison - but harry kane looks very good
geoff hurst is impressed with harry kane 's ( right ) ability to shoot off either foot as well as his ability in the air weaknesses i do nât think he has electric pace
but i did nât have that and it did nât do me any harm
he is not slow - he can still run at players - but it is not electric pace
teddy sheringham was like that and i think harry kane has teddy sheringham âs intelligence
despite a lack of pace , teddy sheringham made 51 appearances for england - scoring 11 goals sir geoff hurst is encouraging communities to nominate a local # grassrootshero for the fa & mcdonald âs community awards
