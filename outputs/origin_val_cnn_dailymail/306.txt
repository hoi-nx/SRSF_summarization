messi just keeps on finding new ways to stake his claim for status of greatest player ever
he 's done the two - goal games , the three - goal games , even the four - goal games ; throughout spanish on thursday he was being hailed for a game he did n't even score in
the victory over city was being seen as the most one - side 1 - 0 in the history of 1 - 0 wins and the man who set up the winner was given man of the match in all the reports of barca âs passage to the last eight
it was a game in which , for once , he had broken no records â¦ only city 's spirit , with a mesmerising display that left them doubting if they were worthy of being on the same pitch as him
messi joins in the celebrations with ivan rakitic and luis suarez after the first - half goal messi taunts the city defence on the edge of the penalty area during a classy performance messi delivered a man of the match performance as he ran the city defence ragged at the nou camp spanish paper mundo deportivo hailed the ' fantasic ' messi after his ' masterclass ' against city that included ' nutmegs , dribbles and an assist ' , while he also featured on the front cover of sport messi does that to opponents , not just bamboozling them with skill but undermining any confidence they may have that they can live with him
' the best i 've ever seen ' said javier mascherano and jordi alba called it â another recital â but in truth players do nât like what âs known as â the messi question â because whatever answer they give is going to be inadequate alongside the man they are trying to describe
â i 'm just glad he plays for us said luis enrique '
the two nutmegs â one on fernandinho and one on milner â reminded many of something the coach said before he managed barca
he said that messi stands out from the rest not because he necessarily does anything different to other players , but that he does it in big games against big name rivals
all footballers grow up being able to belittle far inferior rivals â they do it on the school playground against other kids first , then in youth academies against youngsters with less talent , and then eventually in training as senior professionals against the reserve - team centre - backs
but messi , in contrast , does it against internationals in big matches all the time
milner approaches barca star messi during their champions league tie on wednesday messi slips the ball through city midfielder milner 's legs at the nou camp it âs easy to laugh at his city victims but they are just two more of a long line as messi takes playground football on to the big stage and runs rings around everybody just as in those grainy videos of him aged six and seven playing baby-football in argentina
it was fitting that pep guardiola was looking on on wednesday night
the bayern munich coach was there with a view to scouting potential quarter - final opponents
it was pep guardiola who transformed messi from a wide attacker in barca 's front three to a deep - lying attacker â the famous false nine
anyone who thought that would be the last messi innovation was wrong â who knows where the argentine was playing last night ? he now has complete freedom to go where he wants on the pitch and spends large chunks of games with a deep right - sided midfield spot as his starting position
that was where he found himself when he seemed to draw the entire city side to him in the first half , just before he released ivan rakitic for the goal that won the game on the night for barca

on thursday in barca the over-riding sentiment was : it âs good that football is not like that anymore , and we can enjoy messi the magician to the absolute maximum .
