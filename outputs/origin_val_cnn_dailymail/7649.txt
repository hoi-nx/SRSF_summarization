passover matzos have rolled out of a century - old bakery on manhattan 's lower east side for the last time
the aron streit 's factory is the oldest in the nation still churning out the unleavened flatbread that 's essential for jewish holidays - about 2.5 million pounds of matzos were baked for april 's passover holiday and distributed worldwide
but streit 's is planning to shut down its nine - decade - old ovens by the year 's end to move into a 21st - century computerized plant located in a different part of the new york area
the contract has yet to be signed
about 2.5 million pounds of matzos were baked for april 's passover holiday and distributed worldwide packages of matzos roll off the assembly line at the factory
the factory has annual sales topping $ 20million as streit 's matzos are sold around the country and worldwide ' for decades , immigrant jewish and their descendants have made pilgrimages back to the lower east side , the jewish plymouth rock , to reconnect with their history and , of course , delight in the shopping and eating that gives the neighborhood its flavor , ' said annie polland , a historian at the lower east side tenement museum
' with the streit 's closure , you have a significant chapter of jewish lower east side history closing
' tradition is quickly disappearing in the neighborhood that was home to jewish immigrants for much of the 20th century
property values have skyrocketed , with galleries , boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements
the aron streit 's property , up for sale , is worth tens of millions of dollars
in the neighborhood , the factory will leave behind places like katz 's deli , russ and daughters and yonah schimmel among the remnants of the traditional lower east side , according to the new york times
the pressure of gentrification , however , is not what has caused the closing of the factor , said adler , a great - grandson of aron streit , who started the business after emigrating from austria
' the reality is that operating a modern factory in four old buildings has finally caught up with us , ' adler told the new york times in january

by 1925 , the business moved to rivington street , where the original assembly line winds through four six - story buildings â once overcrowded tenements with narrow , rickety stairs that are still used
however , the 48,000 - square - foot factory does not live off nostalgia , as it is a smartly run family business with annual sales topping $ 20million on about 5million pounds of matzos sold around the country and worldwide
the other mass america manufacturer of matzos is manischewitz , with israeli imports and traditional round handmade crackers also filling store shelves
demand is growing for matzos even among non-jews who enjoy them as a healthy snack baked with no fat or artificial additives
the old factory simply can not keep up with demand , said aaron gross , head of sales and marketing at aron streit 's and one of three cousins running the day - to - day operations
' i 'm fifth generation , and if we want this to last another five generations , we need to make sure that we strengthen the company to remain relevant in a very competitive market , ' said gross , the great - great grandson of streit
' the name streit 's conjures up so many happy memories of not only my childhood but of the decades since , ' says karen kriendler nelson , whose relatives organized a pre-passover family reunion at the factory
the current aron streit 's production line dates back to the 1930s and the baking process is strictly timed
it may take no more than 18 minutes from the moment the flour and water are mixed to when matzos emerge from a gas - fired , tunnel - like oven to cool in metal baskets that hang off rusty tracks , inching slowly to the packaging operation
workers from the lower east side factory have already been offered jobs at the new location ( above a pallet of matzos sits in the factory ) operations on rivington street will continue until the new plant is up and running ( above caballeros loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine ) beyond the 18 minutes , the dough rises , forbidden for this food that symbolizes the biblical flight of the jewish from egypt , who were so rushed they had no time to finish baking their ' bread of affliction
' ' nothing changes at aron streit 's , ' declared rabbi mayer kirshner , who oversees the factory 's kosher certification
some of the nearly 60 workers represent a wave of immigrants from former soviet republics , like machine operator michael abramov , who was born in uzbekistan
he has been at aron streit 's for 25 years â the only job he has ever had in america
' i 'm not bored
it 's our religion , it 's the history of the jewish , ' said the 61 - year - old queens resident
operations on rivington street will proceed until the new plant is running with state - of - the - art equipment that will speed up production
these are not your great - grandmother 's matzos , kneaded and shaped by hand
mass - produced and machine - packaged , they are a modern effort to preserve tradition
the employees are all being offered jobs at the new location , where streit 's will preserve its motto â ' the taste of a memory
' in the neighborhood , property values have skyrocketed , with galleries , boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements ( above the iconic katz 's deli in new york shares the same neighborhood as streit 's factory ) as the factory closes its doors , it leaves behind places like russ and daughters ( above ) and yonah schimmel among the remnants of the traditional lower east side
