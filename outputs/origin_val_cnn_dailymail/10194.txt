the respected academic claims he was led to believe that he was the father of a child born through in vitro fertilisation ( ivf )
he subsequently paid thousands of pounds in child maintenance after he and his wife divorced
a dna test eventually revealed the child was not his
in the first case of paternity fraud involving ivf in the uk , the lecturer claims that when his former wife travelled to a fertility clinic in spain with her ex-lover â a visit his ex-wife admits took place â the ex-lover pretended he was her husband and donated sperm
a university lecturer is suing his ex-wife for Â£ 83,500 after she allegedly swapped his sperm for an ex-lover âs while undergoing ivf ( file picture ) the case will come to the high court this week , with the parties referred to by pseudonyms
the mail on sunday knows their identities but they can not be named for legal reasons
the couple married in 2002 , and the husband â who already had two children by a previous marriage â had his vasectomy reversed so they could have a baby
but the wife failed to conceive and turned to the ex-lover for comfort
a family source said : â the marriage was turbulent
his wife got bored with her husband and had long conversations with her ex-lover
â in 2004 the husband and wife visited the ivf clinic where the lecturer provided sperm for use later
but the following year , his wife returned with her ex-lover and he donated sperm
during a third visit , she had a fertilised egg implanted with the clinic using her ex-lover âs sperm
seven months after the baby âs birth , the husband and wife separated and were divorced in 2007 , with the lecturer sharing custody of his son , now aged nine
the 60 - year - old academic has launched a high court ( pictured ) action in a bid to get Â£ 83,500 damages , including the return of child maintenance payments as the child grew older , the academic noticed he looked like his wife âs ex-lover
a dna test carried out when the boy was five confirmed he was not the lecturer âs son
his wife , now aged 53 , said there must have been a mix - up with his sperm at the fertility clinic , but denied intentionally deceiving her ex-husband
but by then the lecturer had already paid thousands of pounds in maintenance
now the 60 - year - old academic has launched a high court action in a bid to get the money back
his claim for Â£ 83,500 damages in the queen âs bench division is for fraudulent misrepresentation and the return of maintenance payments , plus interest
professor allan pacey , a fertility expert at the university of sheffield , said : â it âs extremely unlikely the clinic mixed up the sperm
it âs a bizarre case
â the lecturer âs solicitor , ellen windsor , said : â i have been involved in two previous landmark cases covering paternity fraud in the high court , both of which were successful
