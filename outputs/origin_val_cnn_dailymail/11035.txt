google was almost prosecuted by the united states government three years ago for skewing its search results , according to a confidential report
in 2012 , experts at the federal trade commission ( federal trade commission ) who were probing the company after some of its rivals complained about google âs dominance in internet search , wrote that the company was using anti-competitive tactics , to the detriment of users
the 160 - page report , which was obtained by the wall street journal , suggests that google 's algorithms were biased and it was demoting competitors ' services , while putting its own at the top of search results lists
the 160 page report , which was obtained by the wall street journal , suggests that google 's algorithms were biased and it was demoting competitors ' services , while putting its own at the top of search results lists it said that key staff members of the federal trade commission were in favour of suing the california tech giant for violating antitrust rules , before the agency settled its investigation in 2013
the internal report was written by the federal trade commission âs competition bureau , which opened its investigation into internet search engines in 2011
it said that google âs ' conduct has resulted - and will result - in real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and advertising markets
' the report also said that the tech company 's actions ' helped it to maintain , preserve and enhance google âs monopoly position in the markets for search and search advertising ' and ' will have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare '
google claims its facial recognistion ' facenet ' system is practically perfect , getting the right person 99.96 per cent of the time
the dataset uses more than 13,000 face images from the internet to measure how accurate the algorithms are at verifying whether two images are of the same individual ' our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself , rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches , ' the researchers say
' to train , we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method
' the benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency : we achieve state - of - the - art face recognition performance using only 128 - bytes per face
' on the widely used labeled faces in the wild ( lfw ) dataset , our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63 %
facenet was trained on an enormous 260 - million - image dataset and performed at an 86 percent and higher accuracy rate
it argued that the owner of the world 's number one internet search engine illegally took information from rival websites , such as trip advisor and amazon , to improve its own search ranking system and placed restrictions on websites and advertisers , the bbc reported
despite this , the federal trade commission settled its multi-year investigation of google in 2013 after the search giant agreed to some voluntary changes to its practices
this included allowing websites to opt out of having content included in competing search products
the the wall street journal noted that it 's rare for commissioners not to take staff recommendations , but that another report from a different part of the agency did n't back legal action
jon leibowitz , who was chairman at the time , said in a statement that google âs voluntary changes deliver ' more relief for united states consumers faster than any other option
' the tech firm said that the review showed the way it sorted its results did no harm to either its competitors or consumers googling information
google said in a statement that â after an exhaustive 19 - month review , covering 9 million pages of documents and many hours of testimony , the federal trade commission staff and all five commissioner agreed that there was no need to take action on how we rank and display search results
â â speculation about potential consumer and competitor harm turned out to be entirely wrong
â a representative of the federal trade commission said the agency had no comment on the report
google said that the review showed the way it sorted its results did no harm to either its competitors or consumers googling information

yelp has reiterated its assertions that google abuses its dominant position in the search market , the new york times reported
' this shows the federal trade commission had direct evidence of intentional search bias by google , ' said luther lowe , vice president for public policy at yelp
' with the federal trade commission agreeing to a weak settlement against the recommendation of professional staff , this anti-consumer behavior has been effectively greenlighted in the united states
' after the regulator made its decision public , microsoft called it a missed opportunity that was ' weak and - frankly - unusual
