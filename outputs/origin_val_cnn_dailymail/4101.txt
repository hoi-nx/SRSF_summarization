the moment the names came out of the hat , aston villa had to play west brom in an fa cup quarter - final
the same when west ham united met millwall in the carling cup in 2009
administrators must have winced , but that was the hand they had been dealt
no doubt there were similar misgivings at uefa when serbia were paired with albania in the 2016 european championship qualifiers
whoever arranged for england to meet the republic of ireland in dublin on june 7 , however , is a numpty
fans invaded the pitch at villa park after aston villa beat west brom in the fa cup the last time england played ireland in dublin in 1995 the game was abandoned due to crowd trouble the game in 1995 was marred by crowd violence and was called off after 22 minutes the two sides met at wembley for a friendly in 2013 when they played out a 1 - 1 draw after intense negotiations with police , the kick - off time has now been brought forward to 1pm
why is it being played at all ? there are 209 member associations of fifa , which means there are 207 countries that england could play without fear of significant disturbance , and one where england âs last visit was abandoned due to a riot
if a free draw sends england back to dublin , both sides will have to handle it â but this is an unnecessary risk , and not worth taking
if it ends in tears , and tear gas , again , those who came up with this incendiary fixture should not look far for the blame .
