southgate has prioritised holding talks with mauricio in a bid to resolve the uncertainty around harry kane âs summer schedule
southgate has stepped up preparations for euro 2015 this week , taking his under 21 squad to olomouc â where they will be based during the finals in june
on friday they face the czech republic here in prague
the fa have been meticulously planning their assault on the tournament and southgate has the backing of roy to take his strongest possible squad available , including harry kane
harry kane ( right ) has scored eight goals in ten games for southgate 's young lions southgate says he has a good relationship with tottenham manager mauricio but the tottenham striker âs situation is complicated by his club âs plans to play a money - spinning friendly in australia at the end of the premier league campaign , while sportsmail revealed on thursday they could also play in malaysia , too
it has led to fears that harry kane , who scored eight goals in 10 games for the under 21s in qualifying , would be exposed to burnout if he is then made to go on to the czech republic
but southgate plans to meet for talks with tottenham manager mauricio , saying : â the situation with me and mauricio is good and i have had a ( text ) exchange with harry kane , so i think that situation is good as well
â at some point , there needs to be a visit , when we say â ok , what is the plan ? â
but i am relaxed about the situation
we have got a really good relationship with tottenham and with harry kane
harry kane is currently training with the england senior squad , but southgate wants him to play in the summer harry kane 's situation is complicated by tottenham 's end of season friendlies in australia this summer â mauricio has been very good
he was asked the question â would you like him to rest ? â he replied â yes , but â â and the â but â bit has now gone from the debate
i know mauricio was really proud to play for argentina and the experiences i have had with him at tottenham and southampton is that he has always been really supportive of his international players
â as well as that , every quote i have seen from harry kane ( about playing for the under 21s 21s this summer ) has been very positive
â southgate still has a dilemma over ross , however
he has not played for the under 21s since august 2013 and everton would prefer him to rest this summer after a disappointing season
ross was under consideration for this trip , but the midfielder stayed with the senior party
ross is eligible for the u21 side , but has never played for the young lions under southgate both ross and sterling could travel to the european championships despite being in the senior squad â i do feel the situation with ross is different to that of harry kane , john stones and luke shaw , as he has never been in one of my squads , â added southgate
â i was pleased to see ross named in the senior squad
â with ross not always in everton âs starting team i think it was important this time round for roy to back him and keep him involved
hopefully that gives ross some belief in what the england set up think of him and his potential
