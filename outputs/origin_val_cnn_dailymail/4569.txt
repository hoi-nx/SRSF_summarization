they are modeled on the original muscle - cars sold between 1964 to 1966
numerous details ensure the new car maintains the look of the original , including power windows that are activated by pushing or pulling on the original window crank handle
although the bodies of the vehicles are new , some of the insides are made up of curated parts intended to improve on the ride and performance of the classic while maintaining its old - school style
the engine is a re-manufactured 1990 's - era 302 v8 supplied by mustang , which was chosen because it 's the same size as the original 289 v8 and fits perfectly in the chassis without any modifications
the engine is a fuel - injected 5.0 - liter v8 producing about 265 hp. of course with modem technology the ride is even smoother than the original with new suspension and power steering too

' ' we have about 50 people who are seriously interested in buying one of our mustangs , ' scarpello said
' the next step is to find a new facility and start building
