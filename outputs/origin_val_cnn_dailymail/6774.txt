it is three years since muamba suffered a cardiac arrest while playing for bolton in an fa cup quarter final against spurs
muamba , 26 , fell to the ground while no one was standing near him and his heart stopped for 78 minutes
gomis lies face down on the pitch after collapsing during swansea 's game with spurs medical staff attended to the french international for four minutes before he regained consciousness concerned spurs players look on as the swansea forward is attended to my medical staff and when muamba saw gomis collapse on the same pitch , he said : â not that place again
â gomis tweeted after the game that he was fine and had collapsed due to the stress of his father âs illness
but this is the third time it has happened to the french striker and muamba does not expect him to play again without being cleared by a number of medical experts
speaking to the daily express , muamba said : â i am sure he will not be allowed to play for a couple of weeks or even a couple of months
â i am 100 per cent sure he âll see a specialist
he will probably see three specialists and two of them need to give him the all - clear before he can play again
â it âs very different to what happened to me
gomis has a history of medical issues
i did not have a history , so it was a real surprise when it happened to me
