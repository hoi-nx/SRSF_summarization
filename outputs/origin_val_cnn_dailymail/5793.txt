as if he did nât already know , schmidt found out the hard way last saturday that 80 minutes can be a long time in rugby
ireland were riding the crest of a wave arriving into cardiff
ten successive wins and the grand slam there for the taking
eighty minutes later , their unbeaten run was over and now they face the very real prospect of being left with nothing to show for their efforts in 2015
a year ago they had momentum going into the closing round of the championship
they led the table with a huge points difference and , after england fell short of eclipsing that target in rome , there were no outside complications weighing on ireland âs mind in that evening âs tournament closer : beat french and the title was theirs
jared ( left ) , iain henderson ( centre ) and jordi murphy warm - up during ireland training on thursday ireland flanker sean o'brien fires out a backhand pass during ireland 's session at their base in carton house jonathan sexton ( centre ) and his fellow irish players are gearing up for their crunch clash against scotland twelve months later they are in an awkward bind â second on points difference with no exact clarity on what type of win is needed to retain their title given that england will be last into action tomorrow
adding to ireland âs anxiety is their inability to get over the try line
whereas 16 were scored in the title run in 2014 run , there have been just four in 320 minutes this term
schmidt , though , claims not to be worried about the drought , adding that a level of tolerance must be shown towards the development of his new midfield combination now that brian oâdriscoll has retired and gordon dâarcy has been omitted for the six nations
â the game is very fickle , â he claimed after announcing a team to play scotland showing two changes from wales with luke fitzgerald and cian healy getting in ahead of simon zebo and jack mcgrath
â one week you might score three tries and the next week you might not get any and you might have played better in the second week but you just did nât convert the opportunities
ireland coach joe schmit will put his friendship with scotland boss vern cotter to one side on saturday â one of the frustrations from last week is that we did create three really clear try - scoring opportunities that we did nât convert
last year , we converted a lot of our try - scoring opportunities
they are the very fine margins
â trying to make sure we get on the right side of those margins all the time is difficult and it is something we âre working really hard on , â claimed the attack coach whose specialist role in preparing the team is now under scrutiny as ireland âs meagre try tally is the joint worst in the tournament , level with french and seven tries fewer than top scorers england
the lack of finishing power has cast a spotlight on the rookie centre pairing of jared and robbie
â jared does nât have a lot of test match experience but has played a lot of super and european rugby
that breadth of experience and his maturity helps robbie work away
â brian oâdriscoll does nât leave a team and suddenly there âs no deficit
the guys who have come in in his place have done a super job , but they ca nât do the same job
â they âre doing the job with a different experience and a different knowledge of the game at that level
i âm not a patient man , i âm not going to say that we âre being patient about it but we have to be a little bit tolerant of the development that needs to take place
schmidt and vern cotter ( above ) worked together with clermont in french and in new zealand with bay of plenty â we do have a little inexperience at 12 but i do nât think you could fault robbie âs form right through the championship and he will grow into that first - receiver role when it âs demanded of him a little bit more as he gains experience
â one of the things i do feel we will get a benefit from is working our way through this championship
having a loss , the first one in over a year , we need to stay balanced in how we âre preparing and do nât necessarily have to go too far away from what we âve been doing
â schmidt , who revealed training on tuesday was as flat as it had ever been but was fresh on thursday , insists that guaranteeing victory in scotland â not focusing on the margin of a potential win â has been his approach , so much so that he admits he is nât much inclined to pass much heed of how wales fare in rome prior to saturday âs 2.30pm start ( wales need a +22 win to have bettered ireland âs points difference )
it may well depend on what that margin is but i do nât think you try to do anything different
you âre just looking to try to get the win â¦ and there âs no point trying to anticipate what the french - england result will be
â what will be really difficult is a really good scottish side
they have narrow losses right through and have a better balance to their side this week
it âs going to be a real challenge
i âve read comments about how desperate they are to give an account of themselves that is sufficient to get them over the line
