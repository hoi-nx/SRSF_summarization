an eye test that has improved the performance of british olympic stars and elite rugby players is helping transform children 's reading skills , experts claim
the Â£ 189 test â a more advanced form of a high street eye exam â has already boosted the concentration of champion skier chemmy alcott by recommending she wear pink - tinted goggles to reduce glare while hurtling 80mph down the slopes
experts also say they have improved reaction times of members of the england women 's lacrosse team
now parents claim that children taking the test are improving their reading speeds â and performing better at school
an eye test that has improved the performance of british skier chemmy alcott ( pictured ) is helping transform children 's reading skills those behind the test say it identifies people suffering from ' visual stress ' , which means their eyes are over-sensitive to black and white and words appear to swim on the page
it is thought this happens because cells in the area of the brain responsible for vision get over-excited by the pattern and work too fast , causing text to become distorted
studies suggest as many as one in four has this problem
however , most are unaware they are affected and the condition is not picked up during a routine visit to an optician
children with the sensitivity are said to lose concentration easily because they struggle to focus on text , and can fail to perform well at school despite being bright
experts at vision in learning , the company behind the test , say many can be helped by using colour - tinted glasses or a transparent sheet of coloured plastic which can be laid on top of textbooks
colour is thought to ' calm ' the cells so that the image becomes stabilised
but the colour each person needs to correct the problem is different â and scientists are unable to explain why
charlie , 14 , was lagging behind his twin sister at school but after taking the test passed his 11 - plus charlie , 14 , from colchester , was lagging behind his twin sister annabel at school and was regularly placed bottom of the class
after taking the test , he passed his 11 - plus
his mother paula said : ' charlie would say text would move around and he could n't focus
he lost confidence and was very unhappy at school
when we took him to do this test , an orange colour was placed over the text and it was a eureka moment
' the test takes place in the company 's offices in braintree , essex , but other opticians offering it can be found via the society for coloured lens prescribers
chemmy alcott , 32 , who competed as part of team gb in four winter olympics , did the test after suffering from snow - blindness
she said : ' i was skiing with a yellow - tinted lens , but the test found that my eyes had to work less hard with a pink lens
' you put your lens down just before you start to race , and it had been taking my eyes a few minutes to adjust
with the pink , it was immediate
' harlequins rugby team and ipswich town football club have also used the test
members of england 's women 's lacrosse team improved reaction times by up to two seconds on a test that involved hitting a number of random flashing lights
vision in learning founder gavin rebello said : ' the transformation with the coloured filters is often incredible
it can be the first time a parent has heard their child read properly
there can be tears in the room
