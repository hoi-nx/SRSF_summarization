a great - grandfather left with a gaping hole in his face due to cancer treatment has been given the devastating news his condition is terminal
raymond martin , 64 , has facial angiosarcoma , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels
he has already undergone a series of operations , the first of which took surgeons 12 hours to remove a tumour from his face
but the cancer returned and he required more treatment , as well as procedures to remodel his nose and face
a few months ago he developed a huge wound under his right eye , and doctors planned surgery to remove another tumour
raymond martin , 64 , has been told the cancer that has destroyed his face is incurable and there is nothing more doctors can do
he is pictured before being diagnosed ( left ) and afterwards ( right ) mr raymond martin developed a spot on his face in 2012 , which began to spread
he was diagnosed with facial angiosarcoma , a cancer of the inner lining of blood vessels in 2013 the cancer returned and mr raymond martin developed a gaping hole under his right eye
he is pictured with his family ( from left to right ) , grandson dean martin , 17 , wife alice , 63 and daughter julie martin but surgeons discovered the cancer had spread to such an extent that there is nothing more that can be done
all they can do is help change his bandages and keep him as comfortable as possible
now , mr raymond martin and his family are speaking out to raise awareness of angiosarcoma , in the hope his story can help others
mr raymond martin 's daughter nicola borthwick , 42 , said : ' they 've told us nothing more can be done now
' we only hope that marty 's story raises awareness and prevents anyone else undergoing what he has had to suffer
' mr raymond martin is now housebound at his home in scotswood , newcastle , where he is cared for by wife alice , 63
his problems began when he noticed a spot on his cheek in 2012 , but thought nothing about it
' it all started with just a spot and it was nothing special so i did n't worry about it , ' mr raymond martin said
' but the spot started to spread so i went to see a gp and it was first thought that it could be a rash or infection and i was given a course of antibiotics
' however , the antibiotics did not work and because his face got worse , he was sent to hospital for tests
angiosarcoma is a relatively rare soft tissue tumour
it usually occurs in the head , neck , and especially in the scalp of elderly people
its presentation varies from a small plaque to multifocal nodules
the treatment depends on the extent of the disease , but most cases are treated with wide excision - a surgical procedure to remove a small area of diseased or problematic tissue with a margin of normal tissue - and reconstruction
radiotherapy and chemotherapy are advocated in recurrent or extensive abnormalities in tissue
source : national centre for biotechnology information ' never in a hundred years , could i have imagined that i would be told i had cancer , ' mr raymond martin said
medics at newcastle 's royal victoria infirmary took a skin biopsy from mr raymond martin and experts identified that he had a rare form of cancer that was affecting a large part of his face
there was no other option than to perform a 12 - hour - long life - saving surgery to remove the tumour
this involved taking skin from mr raymond martin 's thigh , grafted onto his face
the operation completely changed his appearance
' i knew that the operation had to be done , so i just had to get on with it , ' he said
' when i was going home from hospital i thought ' i do n't want to look in the mirror '
it was a few weeks before i had a proper look at myself and i did get frightened as it looked like i had a bandage on my face
' following the operation , doctors were optimistic that they had removed the whole tumour and mr raymond martin underwent an intensive course of chemotherapy in the hope of killing any remaining cancer cells
but , just six months later , the facial angiosarcoma returned and once again he required further treatment at the region 's northern centre for cancer care
in 2014 mr raymond martin underwent a 12 - hour operation where surgeons removed a cancerous tumour and took skin from his thigh to graft on to his face mr raymond martin is now cared for at his home by his wife alice , 63
he hopes that through telling his story he will raise awareness to this rare form of cancer after a series of operations to remodel his face and nose , mr raymond martin believed his life was back on track and he could accept his new appearance
but in recent months a wide and painful hole began to develop under his right eye , as the cancer had once again returned
after initially preparing for surgery to remove another tumour , mr raymond martin was dealt the devastating blow that the cancer had spread too rapidly for treatment to be successful
the wound has grown and deteriorated rapidly over recent weeks mr raymond martin 's eyes bleed constantly , and he has to have his bandages changed regularly
his family have rallied around him to support him , and he now hopes , through telling his story , that others will become more aware of angiosarcoma and its devastating effects .
