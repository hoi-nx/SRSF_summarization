cleared : erp was acquitted after being accused of murdering his wife lori in a suicide pact
the scars from where he shot himself are visible a man charged with murdering his wife during a double suicide pact that went wrong has been dramatically acquitted by a jury
erp has spent more than two years in jail waiting to come to trial over the death of his wife lori
the court heard how the couple , from portland , oregon , had both signed a suicide note saying they wanted to to die on march 2 , 2013
mr erp told the court that his 52 - year - old wife shot herself twice in the head in their bedroom , before he took the rifle and tried to kill himself
he shot himself twice in the head , but survived
police were called and lori was found in bed
mr erp was arrested and charged with murder , and during the trial prosecutors claimed a post-mortem examination of lori 's body suggested she had been shot by someone else
but on wednesday mulnomah county jurors cleared him of murder , after deliberating for less than a day
during the trial , a defence lawyer told jurors the erps were deeply in love but suffered health problems and addictions to painkillers
they also faced losing their home because neither of them were in work
mr erp told the court he still missed his wife terribly , and some days still wants to die , according to a report by oregonlive
an earlier trial saw the jury reach deadlock - because they could not decide whether mr erp had shot and murdered his wife - and a mistrial was declared
but during the latest court appearance , prosecution lawyer tom cleary urged jurors to follow oregon law , which said that if they believed mr erp fired the fatal shots they must find him guilty of murder
' this is not a death with dignity case , ' the prosecutor said
the judge also instructed jurors that oregon law does n't define murder as assisting another in committing suicide , such as handing someone a loaded gun
but state law does define murder as committing the actual killing , the judge said -- actually pulling the trigger even if the person wanted to die
dr christopher young , deputy state medical examiner , testified that he determined lori erp did n't shoot herself but died by someone else 's action
mr erp 's 52 - year - old wife lori ( pictured ) was found dead at her home in bed with two shots to her head
prosecutors alleged mr erp had tried to kill her , but he successfully argued that she had shot herself however defence expert and former medical examiner dr michael propst , said it was unclear whether the woman died by her own hand
lawyer for the defence rutledge added : ' people who are murdered in their sleep by their husbands do n't leave suicide notes
' the report in oregonlive added that mr erp had not been allowed to attend his wife 's memorial service
' this has been two long years that erp has been in custody , waiting to be exonerated , ' ms rutledge said
' he has not been able to grieve
he has not been able to process what happened and his survivor 's guilt
and now he gets a chance to do that
