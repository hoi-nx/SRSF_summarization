when they âre not jeering and cheering the decision to replace him , the fans like nothing more than belting out his name to the tune of ' hey jude '
olivier giroud âs world is a little mixed up right now , but it is never boring

alexis sanchez takes on young queens park rangers defender furlong during the barclays premier league clash former real madrid playmaker ozil complains to the referee after feeling he was fouled inside the area arsenal 's colombian goalkeeper david ospina makes a good save during the first half at loftus road arsenal 's latest signing gabriel pulls up with a hamstring injury before being substituted for laurent koscielny francis coquelin , who suffered a fractured nose in arsenal 's previous match , controls the ball under pressure from henry they may have enjoyed a sunshine break in the middle east but they returned to london to find the gulf was still as it was , even though charlie austin pulled a goal back with a terrific strike on the turn , eight minutes from time
charlie austin must hope england boss roy hodgson had not gone home early
other than that , queens park rangers were left with nothing to show for a spirited performance and a bold opening
they were the better team during a high - tempo first half - hour , hustling in midfield , and attacking arsenal âs centre - halves in the air
it was physical at times
gibbs was felled by a stray elbow from bobby zamora as the pair jostled for a ball in the air , but no foul was given and there was no obvious intent
gibbs was able to continue
onuoha was forced off in the first - half and this time olivier giroud was not the problem but steven caulker
the team - mates clashed heads and onuoha was left with cut near his left eye
per mertesacker and gabriel paulista coped well with queens park rangers âs initial aerial attack , and goalkeeper david ospina commanded his area well during this period
gabriel limped off before half - time with a hamstring strain , and arsene wenger fears he may be out for three weeks

they have another chance to stop the rot on saturday against spurs
charlie austin was the only real threat , looking sharp and hungry around the fringes of the penalty box and quick on draw , striking the ball cleanly and forcing saves from ospina
he went close with a flashing drive from 20 yards , which faded an inch or two wide
chris ramsey âs team , however , could not find the goal which might have galvanised them and , as the first half wore on , they faded
arsenal enjoyed more comfortable possession and green came under threat for the first time
green responded with three solid saves to frustrate olivier giroud and one to deny santi cazorla
arsene wenger âs team came out with more urgency and purpose after the interval
' it was important to get the ball on the ground , not only fight but fight and play , ' said the arsenal boss
' in the second half , we did that
' tomas rosicky set the tone , tearing past sandro to deliver a cross from the right which clipped ozil on the shin and flew clear
ozil callled for a penalty and the replays suggested he had a strong case
henry pull him by the shirt
it went unseen and henry , having been booked in the first - half , escaped
just as arsenal started to wonder if it might be one of those days , olivier giroud pounced
an overlap and low cross from gibbs was blocked by clint hill and , when it spilled his way , the french centre - forward reacted swiftly to turn it past green from an acute angle
the second came from the same area
this time , it was alexis sanchez who , having come to life after the interval , jinked inside from the left , dummied , jinked again and screwed a low shot into the bottom corner
for alexis sanchez , it was the 19th of his debut season in england and , if green was annoyed to be beaten at his near - post , he then produced the save of the night , pushing a deflecting low drive from ozil onto the post
charlie austin pulled one back , his 15th of the season , but it was the arsenal fans who filed out into the streets of shepherd âs bush singing olivier giroud âs name , while queens park rangers fans went home fearing their time in the barclays premier league might be ticking away
' we âre in a pressure situation , ' said chris ramsey
' we need to start winning to stay in the division
