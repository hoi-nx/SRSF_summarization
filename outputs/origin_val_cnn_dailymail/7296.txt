for danny cipriani and twelvetrees , this must have felt like a monumental comedown , eight days after they had participated in one of the great occasions at twickenham
at least danny cipriani had a win to savour , although the sale fly - half finished sunday 's game in the sin - bin
for gloucester captain twelvetrees , it was a miserable result on a miserable day in salford
danny cipriani kicked five out of five to help sharks to a comfortable victory over gloucester both men had come off the bench as england thrashed france in the six nations finale only to miss out on the title again , but there was no residual goodwill as they clashed three minutes from time at the aj bell stadium , before danny cipriani was yellow - carded for a deliberate knock - on
compared to a last day of the championship that was awash with audacious artistry , this was an alien form of rugby
it was wet and windy and chilly and sharks were more pragmatic and clinical in the difficult conditions
gloucester had been in tenerife for a week of warm - weather training , which was n't ideal preparation for an arm - wrestle contest in the north west
after enjoying the sun , humphreys ' side caught a cold and yet another defeat in this fixture has left gloucester stuck in ninth place in the aviva premiership table
they continue to punch below their weight
the first half was grim fare
james hook struck two penalties for the visitors but sharks snatched a try in the 22nd minute when samoa centre johnny leota managed to ground the ball against the base of a post after andrei ostrikov had been held up short
danny cipriani converted that and added three penalties either side of the break to put his team in control
as impressive as his kicking was danny cipriani ( centre ) was all over the pitch and proved defensively solid just before the hour , the hosts claimed a second try and it was a gem
from a rolling maul on the right , the impressive chris cusiter broke infield and released tom arscott
the wing burst into the 22 and was tackled but from the ruck danny cipriani 's clever delayed pass sent lock josh beaumont over the line from close range
danny cipriani added the conversion and sharks stood firm , despite nathan hines and danny cipriani going to the bin , to ensure mark cueto celebrated his 300th game for the club with a win
gloucester had plenty of attacking possession but not enough nous and precision
brendan macken failed to release charlie sharples for a clear run to the line and moments later , when the wing received a pass in space from jonny may , he was scythed down well by leota
josh beaumont crosses the line to score the final try for sharks and put them game beyond gloucester sale 's director of rugby steve diamond was satisfied but does not believe that his side â currently seventh â are equipped to push for a play - off place despite a favourable run - in
' we 're a good side here , ' he said
' the one area that we did n't have dominance was the scrum
in every other area we were in control of it
' our first goal is to qualify for the champions cup and to do that we have to finish sixth
i think we 're probably a bit away from the top four
we ca n't compete with the super teams
on our day we can beat anyone here but we 've got two difficult games away from home
' humphreys defended gloucester 's preparations , saying : ' we had a very positive training week but we could n't translate that into a performance today
we 've been back for 48 hours to acclimatise again and we had a good training session yesterday in similar weather conditions to this
