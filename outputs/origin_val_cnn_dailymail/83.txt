a california man who had been hiding in hawaii for seven years pleaded guilty thursday to killing his wife and dumping her body in a desert in 2007
simoneau , 46 , faces 11 years in prison when he is sentenced april 30 for the death of his wife , ogawa
after serving out his sentence , he will be placed on parole for another seven years
fumoko ogawa , 41 , was last seen alive january 4 , 2007 , near her home in point loma , california
after being unable to reach ogawa for nearly a year , her family in japan raised the alarm about her disappearance , but her husband never reported her missing , said nbc san diego
her body was found january 20 , 2007 , near the bow willow campground in california âs anza-borrego desert , but she was not positively identified until june 2011
by that time , her husband had left the state
according to published reports , simoneau filed for divorce in 2002 after six years of marriage , but had a change of heart upon learning that his wife inherited a substantial sum of money from her family in japan
when ogawa went missing , police said her husband went on a spending spree , buying four luxury suvs , four boats , a motorcycle and three other vehicles , according to honolulu star-advertiser
mystery : ogawa was last since in early january 2007
her remains were discovered in weeks later buried in a shallow grave in the california desert
by the time they were identified , her husband ( right ) had fled nabbed : last year , police tracked down simoneau in oahu , hawaii , and had him extradited several months later , simoneau picked up and moved to hawaii , where he got a job as a tour guide on oahu
last september , detectives investigating fumkio ogawa 's killing tracked down her husband and had him extradited back to california
according to simoneau 's plea agreement , the man killed his spouse because of a ' sudden quarrel in the heat of passion
' initially , fumkio ogawa 's remains uncovered in a shallow grave in the california desert were thought to be an unfortunate border crosser , but a dna test determined that it was the missing woman
prosecutors said the cause of death remains unknown to this day because of the body 's deteriorated condition
throughout the investigation , simoneau repeatedly insisted that he had nothing to do with ogawa âs killing
during a court appearance after his arrest in hawaii , a defiant simoneau told the judge that he was looking forward to having his day in court and proving his innocence , reported khon2
crime of passion : the plea agreement states that the 46 - year - old husband killed his wife in a heat of passion during a fight â i miss my wife very much and i will state , for the record , i did not kill my wife
i love her very much okay , â said simoneau to hawaii news now in 2011
but when a california judge asked him thursday how he pleads to his wife âs killing , a dejected simoneau replied : â guilty , your honor
â chieko ogawa , the victim âs mother , told a japan tv station that she was disappointed with the outcome of the case
â the sentence is so light , â she lamented in an interview with ntv
â he got let off easy
we waited eight years and this is all we get
â however , the plea deal will speed up the process of releasing ogawa 's body to her family in japan for burial .
