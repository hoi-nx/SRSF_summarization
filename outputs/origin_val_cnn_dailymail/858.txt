real madrid youngster harper has been left out of the latest scotland under 19 squad scotland under 19s manager ricky sbragia claimed the reasons were ' purely tactical ' among harper 's coaches at real madrid are former france international zinedine zidane ( centre ) he told the daily record : ' the day after scotland announced the under 19 squad , and harper was nât included , spain were on the phone asking about his position and international status
' their national academy is just a few miles from real madrid âs own training ground , so they know about harper because they watch his team often enough
' despite being left out of ricky sbragia 's latest uefa under 19 championship squad , harper 's father insists that the real madrid starlet remains committed to scotland
john added : ' harper wants to play for scotland
i âm scottish , so is his mum and the rest of the family
he is committed to scotland , but if nothing is happening by the time he is 21 then he will have a decision to make because he has a life and a career to fulfil
hopefully , it wo nât come to that
' harper 's father was contacted by spain shortly after his son 's international snub ricky sbragia also still believes harper , who was born in spain , has a big future ahead of him in a scotland shirt
he said : ' he 's an exceptionally gifted lad , but sometimes we ca n't carry him
he can be a luxury sometimes
in some cases , if it 's going well , he can be a good luxury
' ' listen , harper 's time will come
the last time i spoke to him , he wanted to really settle in at real madrid and find a place there
that 's been a big thing for him
' i 've gone with the boys i 've seen most in the last six months
we keep tabs on harper and see video clips of him
we have people over there who keep their eye on him
' there are others i 've left out like dominic thomas at motherwell who will have gripes that they 're not in the squad
' but i 've picked a group of 18 which will hopefully do well for us
it 's my opinion and i 'm not saying it 's right
but the squad i 've picked is an extremely strong one
' i can only pick 18 when i really could have picked 26 or 27
i 've gone for a physical side and runners
' it 's purely tactical and there certainly has n't been a lack of enthusiasm from harper about playing for scotland
' harper is currently midway through a five - year deal with real madrid and is tipped to have a big future
