an unemployed grandmother is being dubbed the next white dee after hiring an agent months before the programme is due to begin
grandmother - of - six dot taylor , 48 , who has given up trying to find a job after 20 years out of work , has hired the same agent used by the original benefits street star used in the hope of finding fame
barry tomes who takes care of white dee ( real name white dee ) told the mirror that he believes that dorothy , from stockton , has a lucrative career ahead of her
' she is going to be one of the stars of the show
she 's a big personality and can make some cash
' barry tomes added that there were several characters worth looking out for in the new series who he believes could be equally successful
' there are a few others who will be the main focus of the show too and i advise them to get some representation
' it does n't have to be but if they get looked after in the right way then they will be able to make some money
they only have to look at what i have done with white dee
' barry tomes made white dee famous after helping her on to celebrity big brother where she reportedly accepted a Â£ 100,000 fee
dot says that she has a softer side to her than the outspoken white dee ( real name white dee : right ) which she believes will be the secret to fame at just 4ft 11 dot says she should be called ' little white dee ' now dot - who is a diminutive 4ft 11in - wants to be the new matriarch of the tv series and hopes it could bring her fame and fortune
the mother - of - five said : ' i would be ' little dee ' - i 'm fun , me - because of my size
i 'm only little , i 'm only 4ft 11
' i do n't took my age , people think i 'm younger , i act like a kid
it does n't bother me
' dot says that she has a softer side than her birmingham counterpart and believes this could be the secret to her success
' i would n't mind being the next white dee
i 'm not horrible , i 'm nice to people
' tv crews started filming in kingston road , stockton , in august last year and images released from filming revealed a broad set of characters
one resident was even seen leading a horse into the garden of one of the terraced houses in the road
homes in the street - which stand in the shadow of holme house prison - cost an average Â£ 50,000 and one in five residents is on benefits
dot and her husband have lived in a council house on adjacent cowper road for more than 20 years
barry tomes who represents both white dee and dorothy taylor says that several other characters from the second series should seek representation as he believes they could make a lot of money although dot refused to reveal how much they get in benefits , she admitted neither had worked for more than 20 years
she and her husband have four sons - aged 30 , 28 , 27 and 22 - and one daughter , 17 , as well as six grandchildren all under the age of seven
there 's also another one on the way
dot said she had ' all sorts of jobs ' in the past , including stints in a crisp factory and a nursing home , but had now ' given up ' looking for a job
the grandmother puts her lack of job interest down to her devotion to her children
she said : ' i stopped working for the kids really
' ' most of them [ jobs adverts ] they say you have to have loads of qualifications , but most people who even have the qualifications ca n't get a job anyway
filming for the second series of benefits street began last august which saw one resident leading a horse into the garden of his inner - city terraced home ' they just end up giving up
what 's the point in having all these gcses and a-levels when you still ca n't get a job
' there 's no jobs but i think that 's all over , not just the area
' asked if she was worried the area would be portrayed in a bad light , she said : ' no i 'm not worried
what you get from this area is the truth
' you know when people condemn the area and say " i would n't live there " ? you get that anywhere but this is where i have been brought up
' there are lots of characters on my street
i can always have a laugh with them and things , people are always nattering and that
