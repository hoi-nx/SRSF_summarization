we see jessica ennis-hill on tv adverts and billboards , promoting bank accounts , health insurance and sportswear
it is easy to forget we have not seen her on the athletics track for more than 18 months and it has been more than two - and - a - half years since she won olympic gold on a mild summer evening in stratford , her most recent heptathlon
her management team have done a stellar job maintaining her profile during the 18 months she has been away from competition , during which time she had her first baby , reggie
jessica ennis-hill celebrates her triumph at london 2012 - but she is more likely to be seen in adverts of late the olympic heptathlon champions is working under the guidance of long - time coach toni minichiell liz mccolgan , 10,000m won gold at world championships in 1991 , less than a year after she gave birth to daughter eilish
paula radcliffe , marathon had daughter isla in february 2007 and won new york later that year
jo pavey , 10,000m had the best season of her career in 2014 , culminating in european championships gold 10 months after having second child emily
catriona matthew , golf became the first scotswoman to win the british open , just 10 weeks after having her second child
kim clijsters , tennis won the us open in 2009 , just a couple of years after retiring to start a family
but with the announcement that she will make her comeback in the 100 metres hurdles at the great city games in manchester on may 9 come the inevitable questions
can she recapture the form that put her on top of the world and does her future status as british âs golden girl depend on it ? at the english institute of sport in sheffield , she is working her socks off under the guidance of long - time coach toni minichiello , who is learning new things every day about working with an athlete who has recently given birth
he is broadly optimistic but cautions against expecting too much from her immediately
â she âs a couple of months behind where she needs to be so we âre just building back steadily , â he said
â it âs going to be a very big challenge and i would nât expect huge things straight away
but she âs getting back to where she was in terms of some of the markers we âve put down
â back when ennis-hill won olympic gold , a 19 - year - old katarina johnson-thompson was 15th , just happy to share a start line with her compatriot
now 22 , katarina johnson-thompson is the world âs best multi-eventer and broke ennis-hill âs british pentathlon record in prague this month
asked if it was unfair to expect ennis-hill to match katarina johnson-thompson , who has already broken three national records this season , toni minichiello was coy
â you âre talking about competing with the world âs no 1 , â he said
â ask me in june and i âd be able to tell you better
â ennis-hill has not competed since finishing fourth in the 100m hurdles at the anniversary games in 2013 katarina johnson-thompson is the best multi-eventer around and has broken the british pentathlon record when asked if ennis-hill could compete with katarina johnson-thompson , toni minichiello said : â ask me in june ' ennis-hill has not competed since finishing fourth in the 100m hurdles at the london anniversary games in july 2013
an achilles tendon injury ruled her out of the world championships in moscow that summer
she continued to train during her pregnancy but it was nât until october last year that she returned to the gym , three months after giving birth.the idea that pregnancy somehow benefits female athletes is compelling
there are several examples of women reaching the pinnacle of their sport for the first time or recapturing former glory after having children
paula radcliffe was running again 12 days after giving birth in 2007 and won the new york later that year
last year mother of two jo pavey won 10,000m gold at the european championships 10 months after giving birth to emily
jo pavey later told me the challenges of being a mother far outweigh the benefits
â i know people say it âs a physiological advantage , â she said
â but you have nine months of deconditioning and end it all with a childbirth and while recovering you âre in a breastfeeding state and having no sleep for months
that ca nât be beneficial to an athletic performance in the near future
â toni minichiello has noticed some benefits in endurance work but the negatives in terms of explosive power needed for multi-eventing are more obvious
paula radcliffe was running again 12 days after giving birth in 2007 and later won the new york marathon jo pavey won 10,000m gold at the european championships 10 months after giving birth to daughter emily although ennis-hill will join katarina johnson-thompson in manchester , the first time the pair will go head - to - head will be in gotzis , austria later in the month
katarina johnson-thompson âs coach mike holmes said they were â neutral â about the potential rivalry , saying : â i adore jess but i can understand why the wider world is fascinated by their match - up and rightly so
â if jess can recapture almost her best that would leave them on a fairly even keel
if jess was in london shape , she would have the edge but if she âs 100 points off and kat is at her best it would go down to the wire in the 800m ( the final event of the heptathlon )
â toni minichiello instructs ennis-hill at the olympic stadium back in 2012 and is hoping to bring her back to the top ennis-hill and katarina johnson-thompson will go head - to - head will be in gotzis , austria later in may rupert grant , of generate sport sponsorship , claimed the pair are unlikely to directly compete for advertisers â money
â jess can play it smartly by supporting kat as her successor , â he said
â performance on the track is critical because you can only maintain a profile based on personality alone for so long
but if jess does nât repeat the success to the same level as before , she has cemented herself in the public eye enough to focus on off - track opportunities
â if she plays her cards right , though , ennis-hill could write one of the great sporting comeback stories
rupert grant , of generate sport sponsorship , claimed ennis-hill and katarina johnson-thompson are unlikely to directly compete for advertisers â money with each other ahead of the comeback of the former
