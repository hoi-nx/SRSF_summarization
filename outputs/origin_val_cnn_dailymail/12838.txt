" captain america " actor chris evans met some " true superheroes " on saturday at seattle children 's hospital in a visit with " guardians of the galaxy " star chris pratt
it was their second hospital visit as part of a super bowl bet that ended in a win for everyone
the bet : if chris pratt 's team -- the seattle seahawks -- won the super bowl , chris evans would visit seattle children 's hospital dressed as captain america
if chris evans ' team -- the patriots -- won , chris pratt would visit christopher 's haven in boston dressed as " guardians of the galaxy " character star-lord , wearing patriots quarterback tom brady 's jersey
even though the patriots won , the two chrises visited both hospitals
chris pratt wore his star-lord costume to visit boston children 's hospital in february , and chris evans donned his captain america duds to visit seattle children 's hospital on saturday , bearing gifts in the form of marvel action figures and accessories
" meeting captain america and star-lord is an experience our patients will always remember , " seattle children 's hospital said
" the kids were beyond excited to meet captain america and star-lord
" the superhero actors met oskar , 7 , who has been at seattle children 's hospital for four months for epilepsy treatment
" meeting them was a nice reprieve for us , " oskar 's mom kelli beechum said
" so many of our visitors are doctors , and the conversations are medical
i ca n't wait to watch the captain america movie with oskar
it will be like he knows him personally now
" the visit made an impression on chris evans , too , who said he felt inspired , blessed and touched after meeting " some true super heroes ! "
