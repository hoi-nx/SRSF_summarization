ahead of mother 's day this weekend , katie has revealed the highs and lows of caring for her disabled son , harvey
the 12 - year - old , whose father is former manchester united footballer dwight yorke , has ' prader-willi ' ( prader-willi ) , a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems
he is on the autism spectrum , has limited vision and ca n't walk far unaided
every day , he has to take six types of life - saving medication
' people say " how do you cope ? " but i do n't know any different , ' katie told presenters eammon holmes and ruth langsford
' he is hard work , he does play up for mummy sometimes , do n't you harvey , ' she said to him , to which he cheekily replied , ' yeah , babe
' katie said one of the biggest challenges is controlling harvey 's hunger
a symptom of his condition is a constant desire to eat which can lead to dangerous weight gain
' he just wants to eat , eat , eat and if we 're not looking he will steal food , ' katie said
' he 's a big boy because of his thyroid and with prader-willi everything is about food
' when they go on a family holiday , they have to ensure they are near a hospital ' in case something happens ' and daily life can be difficult because harvey 's behaviour is so unpredictable
katie 's mother , amy , left , helps care her grandson who was born with a rare genetic condition but as he approaches his teenage years , katie said harvey is also be a delight as his personality shines through
he loves to play instruments like the piano and drums and to draw
he produced a picture he had made especially for eammon holmes and ruth langsford during his appearance on the itv show
he told them that he loves listening to music and his favourite song is adele 's skyfall
on his health progress , grandmother amy said : ' he does n't have to use a braille machine which is a real bonus because we never thought he would be able to see let alone be able to read
' katie , who won celebrity big brother earlier this year , said she gets a lot of support from her husband kieran , 27
' he is so good with him , ' she said of kieran 's relationship with harvey
the couple have reconciled after kieran cheated on katie last year while she was pregnant with his daughter , bunny , who was born last august
they also have a son , jett , 19 months , while katie has also two children with ex-husband peter andre , princess , nine , and junior , seven , as well as harvey
the former glamour model said caring for harvey is ' hard work ' but she ' does n't know any different ' the katie family appeared on today 's this morning to raise awareness of harvey 's conditions the former glamour model said her home will be a ' mad house ' this sunday as they will celebrate mother 's day together and she will cook for her mother amy
earlier this year , katie found herself embroiled in a controversy over using taxpayer 's money for the care of harvey
during her appearance on celebrity big brother , katie hopkins said the multi-millionaire should pay for her son to have a driver to take him to and from school instead of relying on the government
harvey currently travels 50 miles daily from his home in west sussex to south london , after his local specialist school was shut down
on the show , katie claimed it would be ' ridiculous ' to pay for it herself , suggesting the car could cost as much as Â£ 1,000 a day
she also insisted she pays ' over-the - odd taxes ' which should entitle her to the same benefits as other parents
earlier this year , katie , pictured today , had to defend her right to use taxpayers ' money to help transport harvey to and from a school that can meet his needs ruth langsford holds up a picture harvey drew for her and husband and co-presenter eammon holmes in a statement released by her management at the time , she said : ' where any child that is placed in school out of the immediate home area it is the local authorities duty to provide transport that meets the child 's needs
' this is common practice for all disabled children as there are not enough suitable schools available to them
' the cost of the school placement together with transport is not means tested as it is provided for the child
' local authorities do not have special needs schools locally as these have been closed during the last 15 years as it was deemed a cheaper option to transport children out of borough
harvey waves at the cameras as he and katie arrive at the itv studios for their tv appearance katie , pictured with husband keiran at the cheltenham festival earlier this week , said he 's great with harvey ' if harvey 's school was on his doorstep , as with schools for healthy children , then this would not apply but it was the government 's choice to close the special needs schools
' meanwhile , on today 's this morning , katie addressed rumours other whether she will appear on another popular reality tv show - strictly
' i 'd love to do strictly but no - one has asked , ' she said .
