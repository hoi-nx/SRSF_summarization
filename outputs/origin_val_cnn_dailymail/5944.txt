sullivan 's bid to qualify for his first major championship ended in emphatic fashion on the second day of the hassan trophy at golf du palais royal on friday
sullivan needed to win his third european tour title of the season or finish alone in second to climb into the world 's top 50 before monday 's deadline to secure a place in the masters in a fortnight 's time
however , the 28 - year - old from nuneaton could only add a 75 to his opening 74 in agadir , with his hopes extinguished courtesy of a quintuple - bogey nine on the par - four fourth , his 13th hole of the day
england sullivan , pictured in action in agadir , has failed in his bid to qualify for the masters ' there was a lot of pressure on my shoulders to perform , ' sullivan told sky sports 4
' i tried to take it off as much as possible but came into it with not really enough preparation
' i hit a lot of good shots but the bad ones really hurt me
that 's golf and i am lucky to just have the opportunity to get into the masters to be honest
if someone had said that at the start of the year i would have said ' no chance '
' to have the opportunity to do it was amazing but it 's golf , it comes back and bites you a lot of the time
i need to go away and work harder and bounce back from this , but i am not going to be too downhearted
i look back on the golf i have played this year and i have played well
' france 's alexander levy , who needed to finish joint second or better to make the trip to augusta , also looked to have missed out after a 75 left him three over par , two shots outside the projected cut
but england 's tommy fleetwood had kept his hopes of claiming the required win alive with a 71 to finish three under , three behind the clubhouse target set by spain 's rafael cabrera-bello following a second consecutive 69
