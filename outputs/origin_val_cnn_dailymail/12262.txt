do n't bogart that spoon , man
lem me get a hit off that cone , dude
pass the bowl ... of ice cream ? could ben & jerry 's , the counterculture snack empire gone mainstream , be planning a marijuana - infused ice cream ? " makes sense to me
you know , combine your pleasures , " co-founder cohen said in an interview with huffpost live that 's been buzzing among marijuana aficionados since it aired last month
like attitudes about marijuana itself , the story went mainstream this week
co-founder greenfield noted that the duo has some experience with , uh , substances
and the company already gives a nod to the marijuana culture with flavor names such as " half baked
" marijuana is becoming more mainstream , too
four states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana , and attitudes nationwide have been changing in favor of pot , which remains banned by federal law
in january 2014 , a cnn / orc poll found that 55 % of americans favored the legalization of marijuana
only 16 % thought that in 1987 , cnn reported at the time
in colorado , where recreational marijuana use is legal under state law , edibles containing weed now make up nearly half the market for pot products , according to the denver post
alas , pot fans , cohen and greenfield no longer control the company
they sold it to unilever inc. for $ 326 million in 2000
" if it were my decision , i 'd be doing it , " greenfield told huffpost live
" but fortunately , we have wiser heads at the company that figure those things out
" a spokeswoman for the company told adweek magazine that there are n't any current plans for pot ice cream , but she left the door open to the possibility
" ben & jerry 's has n't given serious consideration to the possibility of cannabis - infused ice cream , " spokeswoman kelly mohr told adweek
" perhaps it 's high time
" of course , all this does make you wonder : what would you munch on if you got the munchies from a bowl of ben & jerry 's ? is weed legal in your state ? cnn 's lisa respers france contributed to this report .
