and then there are superyachts for " ladies
" introducing la belle , the 80 - meter gold and crystal - encrusted superyacht described as a floating " boudoir for women , " by its female designer
" there will not be any boy 's toys -- such as pool tables or beer kegs -- on board , " italian designer , bersani , told cnn
" but there will be a fantastic spa with a beauty center , large mirrors , and huge wardrobes , " she said of the concept yacht , which she claims is the first designed specifically for women
bersani came up with plans for the five - deck la belle because " i felt , as a lady , it was my duty to design something especially for us , where we can feel a woman 's touch
" there will only be off - white , ivory , and cream colors
all surrounded by furs , silk , gold , pearls , crystals , live music , aromatics and flowers , " she added
not that all women are on board with bersani 's " warm and romantic " bejeweled boat
" i do n't know any woman who lives in a dream world where these things are desirable , " said maria jaschok , director of the international gender studies centre at oxford university
" it feels somehow remote , like some sort of little girlish dream , traveling in that eternal pink cloud
" bersani , who also designs apartment interiors , defended the hyper - feminine yacht , saying : " i do n't know a single woman who does not like flowers and is not dreaming of diamonds
" if you get married , the most amazing day in your life , you want to be dressed in an amazing white long dress , looking like a princess , with a gold diamond ring on your finger , around romantic music , happy people , and plenty of flowers
" in the ultra-elite world of superyachts , female owners are practically unheard of , but that does n't mean women do n't have a huge influence over the spending of their billionaire partners
" in terms of superyacht owners , i 'd say they were upwards of 90 % male , " said trahair , of superyacht brokers edmiston
" that said , superyachts on the whole are designed for the preferences of a couple -- for their interests , design , style , and taste
" and while the person chartering a superyacht is often male , the person in charge of the holiday is often his wife or girlfriend
" male or female , trahair envisioned few clients looking to buy a " radical , gold yacht " such as bersani 's
" it could be regarded as patronizing -- a bit like barbie doll , where the assumption is that everything has to be pink , " said trahair
earlier this year , plans were revealed for world 's biggest private boat -- the $ 1 billion , 222 meter triple deuce
and they 're only going to become more lavish , according to trahair
" we 've launched yachts in the last few years that have multiple pools , helipads , a squash court
there are few things now a yacht ca n't have , " he said
" whereas a jacuzzi was a luxury in the early 2000s , now if you 've got just one , it 's rather frowned upon
you need to have a few and you need to have an infinity plunge pool that doubles as a helipad
" whether there will also be a market for gender - specific vessels , remains to be seen
