southgate has told crystal palace winger wilfried zaha he still has time to make the england under 21 squad for euro 2015
zaha won the last of his 10 under 21 caps against finland in november 2013 and has not been considered by the head coach since he pulled out of a qualifier against wales last may with injury
southgate made it clear at the start of the season he would only use players who were fully committed to playing for england and there is no question zaha would need to show he has matured to stand a chance of going to the czech republic in june
crystal palace ace wilfried zaha has scored two goals and made one assist in his last six games southgate has told zaha he still has time to make the england under 21 squad for euro 2015 but his form for crystal palace has not gone unnoticed â he has scored two goals and made one assist in his last six games â and southgate intends to visit zaha to see whether the 22 - year - old can force himself into the frame
â we have always said with wilf the door is never closed , â southgate said
â unfortunately for him , his move to manchester united never worked out , the loan to cardiff never worked out and we have had other forwards who have been in good form
â you always have to look at players who are in form and playing well
it would be foolish to rule anyone out
but we have got danny ings , jesse lingard coming back , alex pritchard has got good numbers in terms of goals and assists
wilf is going to have to play really well to force his way in
â southgate admits it would be foolish to rule anybody out of contention ahead of this summer 's tournament burnley striker danny ings has been in fine form during the premier league season at turf moor palace boss pardew said after his side beat queens park rangers earlier this month he intended to speak to southgate about why the coach would benefit from including zaha in his plans
southgate has not heard from his former crystal palace team - mate but while he would welcome the call , he stressed that zaha had scored once and made one goal in the 17 games before his burst of form
â i said to him ( pardew ) when he got the job it would be really interesting to see if he could get wilf back to where he is , â said southgate , whose side face germany at the riverside stadium this evening
â he is playing well but there has to be consistency
one of the biggest parts of my role is to go and watch players
wilf , now he is playing regularly , will be one i have to see
