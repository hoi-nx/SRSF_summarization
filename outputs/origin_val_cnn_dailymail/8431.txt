public transport was free in paris today and half of the city 's cars were forced off the road in a bid to fight pollution

anne hidalgo , the mayor of paris , said : ' i am delighted the state has agreed to put in place a partial driving ban on monday , which i have been requesting for several days
authorities were planning to ban cars with even numbers on tuesday , but the scheme was halted following improving forecasts
foreign visitors to paris , including thousands of britons on holiday , were also permitted to use their cars
but police patrols were seen booking locals who flouted the ban , forcing them to return home

' there are horrific crushes on the trains , ' said jean babin , a 43 - year - old commuter from the suburb of juvisy , who usually travels to the city in his renault
' free transport is a great idea in principle but it can potentially cause a number of problems of its own , and you do wonder who is going to pay for it all '
air quality monitors showed concentrations of potentially dangerous particulates in the pars air were above the recommended maximum
only vehicles with number plates ending in an odd number were allowed , with exemptions for taxis , electric cars and ambulances police patrols were seen booking locals who flouted the ban , forcing them to return home

authorities measure the concentration of particulates with a diameter of less than 10 microns - so - called pm10 - in the air to determine pollution levels
the safe limit for pm10 is set at 80 microgrammes per cubic metre ( mcg / m3 ) , with levels in paris monday expected to be somewhere between 40 and 55 mcg / m3
the city 's alert level is fixed at 50 mcg / m3
according to a 2011 world health organisation report , the planet 's most polluted city was ahvaz in iran with an average of 372 mcg / m3
beijing had an average of 121 mcg / m3 , while paris was measured at 38 mcg / m3 .
