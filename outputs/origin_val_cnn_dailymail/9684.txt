thai is not short of a marvellous beach or two
it is , after all , a country with 2,000 miles of coastline
there 's the beach , of course , on the island of ko phi phi lee , as featured in the 2000 film based on the alex garland novel and starring leonardo dicaprio
and there 's the small sandy cove on khao phing kan in uber - picturesque phang nga bay
the khao sok national park is one of the oldest rainforests in the world , where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps the island is now known as khao phing kan , upon which you and a chum can pose back to back with imaginary weapons , echoing the scene from the man with the golden gun of 007 ( roger moore ) and the evil scaramanga ( christopher lee )
but the problem is practically every other visitor who chooses thai for their exotic sun , sea and sand holiday wants to sit and be seen in the country 's most famous hotspots too
it gets a little crowded , to say the least
at the risk of sounding a bit of a beach snob , i want to be alone , or at least not swamped by hundreds of other sunbathers , when i 'm on my holiday , at least until i 've shaken off some stress
if you do too , you 'll adore the khao lak
and thanks to direct flights to phuket aboard thomson 's dreamliner , you do n't have to faff around catching a connecting flight from bangkok
it 's a real bonus
if you have flown long haul before , you will notice the difference - more space , both seat-wise and all around , dimmable windows , more oxygen and better lighting all make the journey more bearable
and it 's only an hour or so drive north from the airport to khao lak , or 90 minutes away from the busy and , er , colourful attractions of tourist trap patong
the jw marriott khao lak is very classy and quiet and has a glorious beach whch is free from crowds i 'll be honest , i was n't expecting such a tasteful resort
distinctly oriental in design , the jw marriott khao lak is very classy and quiet , with 250 rooms and all the facilities you need for a proper rest and de-stress , whether there 's just two of you or the whole family
there 's a nice spa , quan , offering all the usual pamperings and treatments
the range of dining options includes breakfast and international cuisine in the waterfront restaurant , thai food at ta-krai , japanese at sakura , and mediterranean at olive
there 's a deli , too , and numerous bars and lounges
it 's easy not to step outside for the whole holiday , but i was persuaded to do a little sightseeing
a trip to khao phing kan also included a look at a small rubber plantation , feeding monkeys beside a buddhist temple , cruising through mangrove swamps in a long - tailed boat , and lunch in the muslim village at panyi island
it 's all well run and very commercialised
roger more ( right ) and christopher lee on james bond island in the film the man with the golden gun more off the beaten track is khao sok national park , one of the oldest rainforests in the world , where you can meet elephants at one of the better camps
however , do be very careful to choose a well - run establishment when selecting this kind of adventure
we were taken by canoe - you do n't even have to lift an oar yourself - down the sok river , admiring the trees and waterfalls as we went
and , of course , there are dozens of snorkelling and diving sites to choose from
the jw marriott khao lak itself offers numerous sports on site , a fitness centre , and there 's golf galore nearby
ko phi phi lee featured in the 2000 film based on the alex garland novel and starring leonardo dicaprio naturally , it has plenty of places to sunbathe or take a dip , not least khuk khak beach , a marvellously empty stretch of white sand fringing the andaman sea
the resort also claims to have south-east asia 's longest swimming pool - indeed , it winds around and in between the buildings like a huge lazy river , allowing some rooms to actually be swim - up , which is great for families
the best bit for me , though , was the very private hidey - holes complete with loungers , cleverly sheltered with hedges , but still with easy access to the water
getting there thomson ( thomson.co.uk , 0871 230 2555 ) offers seven nights b&b at the jw marriott khao lak resort from Â£ 934pp , including return flights from gatwick departing april 10 , and transfers .
