it 's a key question to consider when making a hotel booking - do you want a lot of everything or the best of a few things ? as hotels launched its first venue in piccadilly , london last week , it was clear that this kind of question provides the thinking behind its brand
to find out what guests really want , london - based hotel group glh conducted research over the last two years , most recently asking 4,000 adults globally what matters most when staying in a hotel
each room at hotels ' new location in piccadilly boasts a hypnos bed and a complimentary mini-bar top three were a great night 's sleep ( 86 per cent ) , no hidden extras ( 81 per cent ) and fast and efficient check - in ( 67 per cent )
turning its back on the traditional hotel rating system , hotels is striving to meet the demands of guests looking for fully - equipped bedrooms in hotels without meeting rooms , spas or a plethora of restaurants and bars
the company has stripped back all the non-room features usually found in four - star hotels , and instead focuses on quality rooms and a personal service
the piccadilly venture is the first to open in london , with sites in hyde park , leicester square and bloomsbury next on the agenda
every hotels has opened its first london location in piccadilly , with three others planned mailonline travel stayed the night to see whether they 'd got the balance just right
piccadilly offers modern , well - equipped rooms with hypnos beds , nespresso machines , complimentary mini-bar , free wifi , a great location , hosts genuinely knowledgeable about the local area and the opportunity to choose your room before you arrive
what strikes me is that senior executives involved with the project are very realistic ; in the sense that they recognise there are many restaurants and bars to choose from in central london , that tourists will spend most of their time walking around , and that most businessmen will have office meetings in offices
and so the focus is on the accommodation , the comfort , and having facilities that do n't force themselves onto guests
the company 's research showed them that 52 per cent of brits wanted a nespresso machine in the room my deluxe room is spacious and bright with a clean and sharp finish
the complimentary mini-bar is a nice touch
with stunning views of the heart of london , yet with soundproofing giving a great night 's sleep , the rooms provide that well - deserved luxury after a day out traipsing the streets
the company 's research showed them that 52 per cent of brits wanted a nespresso machine in the room , and 41 per cent demanded a smart tv - so these are standard throughout
richard sofer , ceo hotels , said : ' what came out loud and clear was that guests wanted a great room with great tech , in a great location
' what is really important to today 's guests , regardless of whether they are travelling for business or pleasure , is they do n't want any hidden surprises
' so , not only is our wifi complimentary , but so are our mini-bars , nespresso machines , printing facilities and in room entertainment
' rooms offer views of the heart of london , with soundproofing to ensure a great night 's sleep you wo n't find just one person at the reception having to handle a queue of customers
nor will you see members of staff who see their role as simply ' a job '
smiles are in abundance , from the moment i checked - in to when i ordered a beer from the bar
the staff are as excited as senior management to see how the new venue fares in an ultra-competitive market
mike denoma , ceo of glh , added : ' we believe we conduct more research than anyone our size , we do this to help us better understand the modern traveller , who has a new set of expectations
' the hotel is hoping its varied breakfast can set it ahead of its rivals in london
a delightful selection of fruit , breads and yoghurt compliments an extensive hot food selection
crisp and steaming bacon , and wholesome sausages form the main part of the traditional fry - up
and as it 's all - you - can eat it would be rude not to fill up , right ? every hotels coventry street , london
