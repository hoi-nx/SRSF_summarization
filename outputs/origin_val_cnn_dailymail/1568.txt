she said ' with the president effectively removed from power and with no clear sign of a return on the horizon , the situation is reaching a boiling point and the power vacuum that has emerged could result in the failure of the state in the coming weeks
' the fact that iran is backing the houthis is key to their success to date
aqap have staged deadly attacks but more significant has been the emergence of a yemen affiliate of the islamic state group
' saudi 's intervention through the use of airstrikes has added fuel to the fire and may in fact lead to increased fighting between president hadi 's forces and the houthis
' the fear with the saudi involvement at this point would be that it may be seen as an act of aggression and could thus trigger further outbreaks of violence in the already troubled region
