there 's a first time for everything , is n't there ? first time in a new country
first time you go on a holiday that leaves you speechless
and the first time you take one of those ' selfies ' that everyone is talking about
the country was burma , which has just started opening up to touris , and since the best way to see the sights is by taking a river cruise , i booked up for a few nights onboard
' a floating paradise ' : a river cruise on the sanctuary ananda was the best way to see the sights the brochure promised enchantment and luxury , along with the chance to experience this fascinating land close up
i have to say , they were true to their promise
the boat , sanctuary ananda , is basically a floating paradise
the first thing i did when i got to my cabin was throw open the french doors and step on to the veranda
the second thing was to clamber on to the fluffy nest of a bed and enjoy the sight of a new world sliding past my windows
at this point , i promised myself that one day i would lie there and watch the sunrise
next morning , thanks to jet lag , that 's exactly what i did
it was so superb , i set my alarm so i could enjoy it every day
ox - cart ride anyone ? stan enjoyed his bumpy ride in the back of the taxi the only way to see the temples ...
from a balloon our guide later explained that the owners of sanctuary ananda , obviously aware of the negative impact tourism can sometimes have on real lives like these , are working with the village elders to plan for the future
the first fruits of this philanthropic project are a full - time teacher and a library in the village
the next few days passed in a blur of excitement
we stopped off to explore ancient ruins and temples that were still very much in use
one day i found myself wandering along a dusty path , wilting in the heat
i hailed a passing ox cart , which had the word ' taxi ' scrawled on the side , and got a delightfully bumpy lift back to the shore
next morning i was up before the sun had even thought about rising
i could n't sleep , and could n't face breakfast
truth be told , i could hardly stop myself from doing a dance
i live in bristol , which is pretty much home of the hot air balloon
i 've always wanted to go up in one of these outsized cuddly toys , but for one reason or another i 've never got round to it
so there i was , on a gorgeous boat in a land of loveliness , crossing my fingers for good ballooning weather
luckily , the wind stayed away and the captain announced that conditions were perfect
a few of us scampered up the bank and climbed into a vintage coach that would carry us to the take - off field
the balloon sighed into the sky just in time for the sun to rise over the 2,000 temples of bagan
as balloon rides go , it was magical
the early morning sunlight shone through the mist , picking out temples and pagodas with golden sparks
that was when i decided it was time for my first selfie
i 'm not saying it was the best picture i 've ever taken , but it is definitely one click i am never going to forget
days were spent exploring ancient ruins and temples that are still very much in use bagan at dusk : the ancient capital of burma has more than 2,200 buddhist temples and pagodas on our last evening we were treated to a candlelit feast under the night sky
as i sat there thinking nothing could improve my world , a flurry of shooting stars whooshed overhead
moments later , a harvest moon peeped over the horizon , lighting up the river
i actually had to pinch myself to make sure i was n't dreaming
our host , daniel , saw my dazed look and asked if i could think of any way , no matter how big or small , in which the company could improve my holiday experience
i 'll be honest , i tried
i gave it my full attention
i desperately tried to think of something i would have changed
but i could n't think of a thing
not a single , solitary one
i had to turn to daniel and admit the truth
it had been the perfect holiday
