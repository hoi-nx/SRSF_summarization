the aston villa manager said he refused to sanction any such move as head coach and instead picked the then unproven centre - forward regularly during the run - in
tim sherwood said : â there were people at club who wanted to bring in another striker and sacrifice kane
i would nât allow that to happen
they know who they are
tim sherwood was not prepared to ' sacrifice ' kane to bring in an expensive striker last january gabriel agbonlahor and carlos sanchez were in good spirits at bodymoor heath charles n'zogbia concentrates in training and will be hoping he guide his side away from relegation alan hutton is put through his paces in training as he prepares for aston villa 's clash against swansea scott sinclair has been given a new lease of life under tim sherwood at aston villa kane has come on significantly as a player since tim sherwood handed him his senior spurs debut the tottenham striker has been in superb form , earning an england call - up with a string of impressive displays â that âs why they should trust the people who know football within the club and not listen to outside influences who are trying to flog them a player
â if they would have brought in somebody last january and his name ended in an â i â or an â o â , the fans would have been very excited , but i âm not sure he would have given them the same output as kane has given
â since 2011 kane has experienced loan spells to varying degrees of success at leyton orient , millwall , norwich and leicester before sparking to life with 26 goals this season
tim sherwood insists only championship clubs would have been interested 14 months ago
â a lot of people would have taken him but no one would have put their hand up in the premier league , â said tim sherwood
â that just shows you how far he has come
everyone will tell you now they always believed he would be a top player
but he had a few loans and a few managers never played him
they âd like him now , would nât they
â kane has scored eight times in 10 games for the england under 21s , earning promotion to the senior squad tim sherwood revealed tottenham wanted to get rid of kane when he in charge at white hart lane tim sherwood blasted senior spurs for selling academy graduates jake livermore and caulker and said it took fans time to warm to kane
â â he âs one of our own â , they never sang that , they âve only just started and he âs had to perform like alan shearer
i chuckle when i hear it , â said tim sherwood
â i think it âs ridiculous that you let your homegrown players go , â he added
â i thought it was poor that livermore should leave , i thought it was poor that caulker should leave , i âm talking about players who are playing in the premier league week in and week out
â i think it âs wrong for clubs to continually waste money on investing for new players who you do nât know are going to settle
it âs not always about spending money
it âs also about improving the players you have within the squad
â the current aston villa boss persisted with kane and said selling him was never an option
