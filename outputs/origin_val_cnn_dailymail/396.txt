lord baron evans quit his role with the national crime agency to keep a lucrative directorship with scandal - hit hsbc a former intelligence chief has quit his role with british âs top crime fighting agency to keep a lucrative directorship with scandal - hit hsbc
baron evans of weardale , the former director - general of mi5 , has resigned from the board of the publicly - funded national crime agency ( national crime agency ) after just a year , due to a â perceived conflict of interest â as the bank has come under fire over tax - dodging allegations
in a statement , the crossbench peer admitted there has been â a lot of controversy â over claims that hsbc enabled clients of its swiss private banking arm to avoid tax
but he chose to keep his Â£ 3,000 - a - day role with the financial giant rather than stay with the law enforcement agency which is british âs equivalent of the fbi
his decision to quit the national crime agency and stay with hsbc could put further pressure on rona fairhead , who is clinging on to her well - paid positions as a director of the bank and chairman of the bbc âs governing body
lord baron evans , who was director - general of mi5 from 2007 to 2013 , wrote in his resignation letter : â there has been a lot of controversy over the alleged actions of hsbc clients and of the bank itself in recent weeks
i believe that though there is no actual conflict of interests there could be a perceived conflict of interests between my two roles
â his resignation was â reluctantly â accepted last week by the head of the national crime agency , keith bristow , who said : â i have accepted the resignation of lord baron evans with great regret
while i do not believe there is an actual conflict of interests , any perception of one has the potential to adversely affect the reputation of the national crime agency
jonathan has made an enormously valuable contribution to the national crime agency over the past 15 months
â after more than 30 years in the security service , lord baron evans retired in 2013 and soon afterwards became a non-executive director of hsbc , earning Â£ 125,000 for 40 days work a year
he also became a member of a committee the bank set up to combat financial crime , in the wake of the scandal that saw it fined Â£ 1billion in the us for allowing mexican drug gangs to launder money through its accounts
other members of the team include bill hughes , a former head of the national crime agency âs predecessor the serious organised crime agency , and the former head of hm revenue & customs , hartnett
but despite their efforts , hsbc has been dragged into another scandal that could lead to a police investigation
baron evans of weardale esigned from the board of the publicly - funded national crime agency , pictured during a training exercise earlier this year leaked documents emerged that suggested hsbc âs swiss private bank helped clients dodge millions of pounds in tax
the french authorities have since agreed that the account data , now held by the taxman , can be shared for the â purpose of investigating criminal offence â and a meeting to discuss a probe has been held at which the national crime agency was present alongside the serious fraud office , the financial conduct authority , the crown prosecution service , city of london police and eurojust
the national crime agency , set up to tackle organised crime across the country , has said it has no â live role â in any probe into the bank âs activities
lord baron evans was appointed a non-executive director of the newly established national crime agency in december 2013
its annual accounts show he was paid less than Â£ 5,000 in its first few months and would be paid less than Â£ 15,000 a year
hsbc will come under fresh attack from mps tomorrow when the public accounts committee quizzes former taxman turned bank adviser mr hartnett
chairman margaret hodge said there was still a lot of work to be done in exposing tax - dodging by british companies
â i would be amazed if hsbc were alone
