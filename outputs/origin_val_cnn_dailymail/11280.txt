samantha cameron and her two older children , nancy , 11 , and elwen , 9 , were in the gallery just beside me for pmqs â and they chose a belter
' there 's going to be quite a lot of shouting , ' i heard mrs samantha cameron warn the youngsters as the house assembled below us
this was the last pmqs of the parliament
for either dave or ed , this was possibly the last hurrah at the despatch box
as the prime minister took his seat he looked up and spotted his children
an enormous beam lit his face and he winked at them
but as he read his usual opening spiel about having ' further such meetings today ' he shot the speaker a rueful little smile , plainly acknowledging that the precious formula of words â used by premiers for decades â might never again fall from his lips
magimix time ! mr ed miliband had seemed sure he had the zinger par excellence with which to undo his great rival
the labour leader stood at the table , feet planted wide , a superior twitch on his lips as he leaned into the microphone
after a drollery about mr cameron 's ' retirement plans ' ( that tv interview which has so excited the pm 's more crosspatch critics ) , ed mil ' challenged the pm to give a straight answer to a straight question
' will he now rule out a rise in vat ? ' asked mr ed miliband
mr cameron : ' yes
' oops ! that was n't meant to happen
mr ed miliband had been expecting the pm to give a waffling non-answer
all his poise had been predicated on that
the eyebrow had been raised in a doubting manner as he put the query
his tone had been sarcastic
he knew â just knew â that cameron would not be able to give a straight answer
instead , the low swine had coughed up a horribly direct , undeniable , comprehensible ' yes '
not fair , ref ! the ed miliband team had spent hours finessing follow - up attack lines
they had envisaged accusing the darn tories of failing to be clear about their vat plans
now the so - and - so cameron had gone and ruled out any such rise
you ca n't rely on them to do anything
from my perch i could not see mr ed miliband 's eyes but a colleague who was watching him reports that they revolved like a couple of fruit - machine dials whose lever had just been given a mighty yank
his cheeks were sucked in , as were the curtains in dorothy 's bedroom as the tornado strikes in the wizard of oz. the whole house was taken by similar surprise
there was an initial silence , as perhaps happens immediately after a bomb blast before car alarms start to ring
had one of labour 's main themes for the general election just been obliterated ? it did look horribly like that
labour mps sat stony - faced as tory mps roared with laughter when mr cameron ruled out a vat increase er , er , er , er : the ed miliband mainframe went into catastrophic systems freeze
he sounded as though he had just swallowed a rubik 's cube whole
' let me say to him , let me say to him , let me say to him , ' he jibbered , gulping for air
then , with desperation : ' nobody 's gon na believe him ! nobody 's gon na believe him ! ' this drew laughter from the government benches , aghast silence from labour
lucy powell , labour election supremo , was sitting beside mr ed miliband
she was doing one of those tombstone grins they do in the tom & jerry cartoons before all the teeth drop out
mr cameron capitalised on the ambush ( which , one hears , may have been arranged with george osborne )
he pounced on labour confusion and asked mr ed miliband if he would reciprocate by ruling out a labour tax rise on national insurance
after all , pms is meant to be about questions to the prime minister , not from him
speaker bercow let it pass and mr ed miliband flailed
he offered no such promise on national insurance , allowing mr cameron to clinch the moment by accusing labour of a ' jobs tax bombshell '
only later in the afternoon did a somewhat panicked labour high command deny that it will hike national insurance tax
by then the moment had largely passed
mr cameron appeared to be enjoying his time at the despatch box , with wife samantha cameron and children nancy and elwen looking on from the public gallery the government benches were in loud , rampant tumult
sir bob russell ( lib dem , colchester ) hoiked up his trouser legs to betray two horrendously yellow socks ( he had a yellow waistcoat , too )
keith simpson ( con , broadlands ) waved a large , florid mouchoir
beside me , young nancy and elwen grinned enormously and nancy clenched her fist , punching the air with a ' yes ! '
she is like this aged 11 ? crumbs
by 30 she 'll probably be running a multinational
behind the cameron family party sat another notable visitor : boycs , cricket commentator and yorkshireman
boycs kept his counsel but if he had been offering commentary box analysis of the session one fears he might have talked of ed miliband 's stoomps bein ' uprooted
this was a comprehensive clattering of a disorientated , dazed ed miliband
it was a high - velocity whizzing which left the labour leader a sorry , smoothiefied splodge on the floor
