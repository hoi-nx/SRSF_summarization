john carver says newcastle need a clear - out this summer
the head coach is in danger of missing out on a permanent appointment following a string of desperate displays by his team , who were accused by match of the day pundit phil neville of having their flip - flops on
john carver hit back at that on friday but fired his own warning to those who have performed so poorly
and with sammy ameobi , ryan taylor and jonas gutierrez out of contract in the summer , plenty of players will come under threat
john carver says there needs to be a clear - out at newcastle in the summer sammy ameobi ( left ) is one of many players whose contracts expire at the end of the season â they know there has to be a clear - out , â he said
â it âs pretty obvious , to the man in the street and to the professionals â it has to be done
â there are people out of contract , people who are not good enough â they know that
â john carver âs words are his strongest since taking over from alan pardew in january
the magpies held a dressing - room inquest in the wake of last sunday âs 3 - 0 surrender at everton and the boss admits everyone â himself included â is fighting for his future at the club
â we all are , â he said
â that âs why i was a bit astonished when people ( phil neville ) came out and talked about us being on the beach and wearing flip - flops
how can players do that when they know that everybody is playing for their futures ? â john carver âs situation has not been helped by the lack of player investment in the january window which has left him with just 13 senior players ahead of today âs visit of arsenal
the newcastle players applaud the fans after the disappointing defeat by everton last weekend right - back daryl janmaat will deputise for suspended skipper fabricio coloccini at centre - back , despite admitting earlier in the week that he âd never played there
john carver said : â i think he âs a great professional and he will deal with it
he understands the game , he is a full international
it âs another string to his bow and i think he âll cope with it
â he âs been great around the place
he âs such a character
he âs larger than life and he âs quite funny , but he âs a good professional with it
â when we lost mathieu debuchy ( to arsenal ) it was a blow but we replaced him with a better all - round player
â but i must admit i âve never been in a position like this ( with injuries and suspension ) and i do nât think anybody i âve ever worked with has , either
â i âm missing my best players and that âs how i look at it
with papiss cisse it â s like tottenham being without harry kane
with siem de jong , it âs like them being without christian eriksen
â it âs tough , but we âre not going to use that as an excuse and throw in the towel
â darly janmaat will captain newcastle in the premier league fixture against arsenal on saturday the dutch defender is deputising for fabricio coloccini who was sent off against everton
