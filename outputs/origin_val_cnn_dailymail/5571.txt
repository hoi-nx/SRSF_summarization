everton 's rivals are taking increasing interest in midfielder mccarthy as the goodison club 's premier league plight worsens
tottenham , arsenal and united are all monitoring the stylish 24 - year - old who signed from wigan in a Â£ 13million deal
they each want a proven midfielder and mccarthy is on their lists as they assess summer targets
mccarthy ( right ) has attracted interest from united , tottenham and arsenal this season the midfielder , pictured in action against arsenal on sunday , joined everton in the summer of 2013 for Â£ 13m mccarthy signed a five - year contract on summer deadline day in 2013 but is not one of everton 's big earners and the nature of the last - minute negotiations meant assurances were given that his deal would be revised as his goodison career progressed
however , though other everton players have since opened discussions over new terms , mccarthy has yet to be approached
tim howard , seamus coleman , ross barkley and john stones all agreed new deals last year with manager roberto martinez , who himself signed a new deal last june , seeking to maintain a long - term core to his squad
ross barkley is one of a number of young players to have signed a new long - term deal with everton mccarthy has not been approached about a new contract despite his good form for the everton mccarthy , a republic of ireland international , has matured into one of the most consistent premier league players and shown his ability on the international and europe stage
in everton 's 4 - 1 europa league rout of wolfsburg earlier this season he had a pass completion rate of 98 per cent
he is highly regarded at everton and his influence on the team was sorely missed when he was out with a hamstring injury ; in the 13 games everton played without him , they won just one
arsenal and tottenham have both watched him since his return to the fold but were put off january bids knowing everton would refuse all offers
arsenal and tottenham are still interested in southampton 's defensive midfielder morgan schneiderlin ( left ) united are considering mccarthy as an alternative to roma midfielder kevin strootman ( right ) everton 's faltering season though has given them a sense a deal could be brokered in the summer
southampton 's morgan schneiderlin remains on their list of options too
united have concerns that roma 's kevin strootman may not recover quickly from his latest knee surgery and are assessing other options across europe
mccarthy has over 150 premier league games under his belt already and at 24 has his best years ahead of him .
