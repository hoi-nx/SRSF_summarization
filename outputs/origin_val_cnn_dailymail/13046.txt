as the world awaits a possible nuclear agreement between the u.s. and iran , let us not forget : this is the second time in two years that president obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the middle east
in doing so , he has ignored the regimes ' fundamental nature and the catastrophic costs these efforts have inflicted upon regional stability and u.s. national security
this month brought familiar news : more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator al-assad against his fellow syria
just in june , the administration declared the success of its deal to remove al-assad 's chemical weapons , which had been prompted by his august 2013 sarin attacks on syria civilians and the threat of u.s. airstrikes in response
the deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of al-assad 's chemical weapons arsenal , which he can no longer use to threaten syria and israel or fall into terrorist hands
however , with his actions as evidence , it was a deal that al-assad likely knew he could manipulate
even while the deal was underway , al-assad continued to attack syria civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs , exploiting a loophole in the agreement
the deal was also fundamentally flawed in that it relied upon al-assad to declare his stockpile voluntarily without sufficient third - party verification
just weeks after claiming success , the administration quietly acknowledged that al-assad had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons
al-assad has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities , as the agreement required
the deal made al-assad a partner of sorts to the administration despite the grisly , mass atrocities he continued to commit
during implementation , the administration limited its support to the moderate opposition and did little else to pressure the regime to restrain its attacks on civilians or to allow a political transition
about 50,000 more syria were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of syria throughout the region continued
meanwhile , isis further exploited the civil war , expanding into security voids
there are several troubling parallels between the administration 's deal with al-assad and the one it is now pursuing with tehran
both represent deep cynicism or a fundamentally naÃ¯ve understanding of the regimes with which we are negotiating
in both cases , the administration has tried to reach common ground with the world 's foremost sponsors of terrorist groups such as hezbollah , hamas and al qaeda -- which these regimes have funded , trained or sheltered
all of this was true before the administration started these negotiations , and it remains true today
neither tehran nor al-assad has changed ways and chosen normalization with the international community
to the contrary , external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- al-assad on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and tehran on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions
both have only reluctantly engaged and have taken steps to delay , obstruct and circumvent verifiable agreements
as continues to be the case with al-assad , tehran has been emboldened by the administration 's approach
it has increased lethal support to al-assad in syria , deployed troops and supported sectarian militias in iraq , and ramped up aid to other militant groups , including the insurgent houthis in yemen
these activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that iran helped cause by preventing political compromise in iraq and syria
as was the case with al-assad , a deal will effectively make tehran a partner to the administration in which the white house accepts the iran regime 's legitimacy by virtue of the agreement
and there will still be little confidence that tehran will actually honor the terms of any deal it accepts
even while negotiations have been underway , iran has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology
the regime has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the iaea 's access to others , including its infamous parchin base
as iaea director general yukiya amano confirmed again this week , tehran has still only partially answered one of the iaea 's long - standing , 12 questions on possible military dimensions of its passed nuclear activities
amid his continued calls for " death to u.s. , " iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal , not as a result of verified observance of a deal
tehran has demonstrated repeatedly that it will not allow verification of its passed activities or allow actual compliance to be a prerequisite for further sanctions relief
without a complete understanding of iran 's program , the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal
a regime so committed to supporting terrorism , violently oppressing its own people and others , threatening u.s. national security and destroying israel can not be trusted
and without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal
the world has witnessed the results of such a naÃ¯ve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism , a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for human life
we are seeing it once again in response to the administration 's efforts with iran
as we learned with syria 's al-assad , making a deal with a terrorist - supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road
let 's not make that mistake twice .
