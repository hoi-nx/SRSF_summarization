so here 's the question
if cech , at 33 , is available in the summer , and arsenal have a chance of buying him , what should be arsene wenger 's best offer ? jose mourinho says cech can leave chelsea if he wishes , but only for big money as he rates him one of the top three goalkeepers in the world
the three most expensive goalkeepers so far : gianluigi buffon ( Â£ 32.6m ) , manuel neuer ( Â£ 19m ) and david de gea ( Â£ 18m ) â although all were 25 or under when they made their move
chelsea manager jose mourinho has said goalkeeper cech can leave stamford bridge in the summer david de gea , manuel neuer and ginaluigi buffon are the three most expensive goalkeepers in history cech can not command such a fee at his age
a better marker may be the Â£ 9m liverpool paid for simon mignolet
is cech better than simon mignolet ? yes
so if chelsea asked for Â£ 10m for a 33 - year - old reserve , should arsenal be tempted ? yes again
the absence of a world class goalkeeper is holding arsenal back
cech could easily last another four years at the top , making him value at Â£ 10m
pat jennings was 32 when he switched from tottenham hotspur to arsenal in 1977 ; he played his last game for the club in 1985 at the age of 39
there has never been a question over his worth and cech could be as important
cech is a better goalkeeper than liverpool stopper simon mignolet whom the reds paid Â£ 9million for in 2013 pat jennings , pictured with liam brady , spent seven years at arsenal and played his final game aged 39
