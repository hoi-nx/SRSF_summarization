the mouth - watering prospect of the clasico at the nou camp does put the premier league into perspective in a week of europe failure
on sunday night we have gareth bale , cristiano ronaldo and karim benzema against luis suarez , neymar and lionel messi
meanwhile our own version of a clasico wil be taking place at anfield â but no club in the premier league has a forward line like those in spain
increasingly we âre a stepping stone to better things , having lost gareth bale and luis suarez to spain
what is obvious , however , is that the failure in the champions league was not a failure of english clubs
it was a failure of clubs with owners from abu dhabi , the usa and russia
in those champions league games there were five english players in the three starting xis
lionel messi , luis suarez and neymar jnr will be in action for barcelona on sunday night cristiano ronaldo , gareth bale and karim benzema will be hoping to fire real madrid to victory in the clasico fernandinho was signed by man city for Â£ 35million from shakhtar donetsk in 2013 man city became the last english team to be knocked out of the champions league last week man city 's players leave the nou camp looking glum after being eliminated by barcelona tottenham 's ryan mason has enjoyed an impressive season after breaking into the first team and the managers were from chile , france and portugal
the premier league may be failing but it âs not its englishness letting it down
so now that even a huge influx of global thinking and talent at both executive and playing level at football clubs has failed , perhaps we can rethink the premise that we need to keep bringing in players and directors from abroad
of course , there will always be room for the best imports
but you ca nât tell me fernandinho is a better player and better prospect than ryan mason
they do a similar job , the only difference being he is a Â£ 35million transfer and therefore deemed worthy of a place at a top - four club
it âs time to ensure that some of the proposals from the fa commission , which i sat on , come into place , not least the tightening up of work permits on foreign imports so that only the best from outside the european union can play here
we âre failing in europe anyway so the premier league need to ensure we âre not forever looking overseas for solutions .
