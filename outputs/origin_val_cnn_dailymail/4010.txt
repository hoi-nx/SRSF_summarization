five pounds does n't get you a lot these days
barely a pint of beer , let alone a square meal
but those who parted with a fiver at stamford bridge on wednesday night were handsomely rewarded
for their admission money , they saw a quite brilliant youth cup semi-final
the academies of chelsea and spurs boast some of the most - gifted teenage players in the country and how they delivered here - 90 minutes of end - to - end football and seven goals
and on the day chancellor george osborne promised the public would soon have a few more spare fivers in their wallets and declared britain the ' comeback country ' in his budget , chelsea were the ' comeback kids '

but thanks to doubles from dominic solanke and charlie colkett , plus another from brown , chelsea roared back to recover the deficit , offset shayon harrison 's late reply , and reach a fourth consecutive final
and with talents such as this , they 'll be in the black for many years to come
manchester city are likely to be their opponents , they lead leicester city 3 - 0 from the first leg
but , as was shown here on wednesday night , that kind of lead can count for little
somewhat bizarrely , chelsea 's head of youth development neil bath was formally presented with the youth cup trophy for last season 's triumph by two youth cup suits in the press room ahead of the match
it was a very belated coronation , some 10 months after they edged fulham in a rollercoaster final here
this game definitely had echoes of that memorable occasion
dominic solanke scores against spurs at stamford bridge dominic solanke scored either side of half - time as chelsea fought back from 3 - 0 down in tie but while bath had another addition for the burgeoning academy trophy cabinet , chelsea 's grip on their crown had been loosened by spurs in the first leg , goals from josh onomah and kazaiah sterling gave the north london a commanding lead at tie 's midway point
and in the opening stages , the visitors looked the more likely to extend that advantage as long - range sighters from first onomah and then shayon harrison forced goalkeeper bradley collins into evasive action
but as they had in the first leg , chelsea soon began to dominate possession , largely reducing spurs to a counter-attacking role
jay dasilva , the england under 17 international , was fleet - footed down the left , swapping lightning - quick passes with his colleagues and darting beyond kyle walker-peters at every opportunity
brown rammed the ball home from close range for chelsea 's third goal brown 's strike just before half - time put chelsea level at 3 - 3 in the tie his whipped crosses were causing a headache for spurs keeper voss - one in the sixth minute was comically bundled into his own net under pressure from tammy abraham , the referee sparing his blushes
and another on the half - hour had to be acrobatically pushed to safety
but that agility was matched by the impressive shayon harrison moments later
when zenon stylianides hooked a half - cleared corner into the danger zone , the spurs starlet watched the ball 's flight like a hawk before pivoting and volleying it home left footed while falling backwards
it was a goal that had the vine - makers reaching for their smartphones , rushing to share the moment on social media
shayon harrison appreciated his goal 's importance in the context of the tie , spurs now three goals to the good
chelsea defender fikayo tomori looks composed in possession but we have learned never to write off any chelsea team and , as half - time approached , they suddenly snapped out of the malaise and raised their game to another level
five before the break , dominic solanke gave them hope of a comeback when he turned in brown 's accurate delivery from the right - side and the crowd was buzzing when brown rammed the ball home from close range minutes later
it will have delighted those charged with nurturing a new generation of english talent to see those two names on the scoresheet
it also continued dominic solanke 's marvellous run of scoring in every round of this season 's youth cup , eight goals in total
spurs were shell - shocked and simply could n't stem the blue waves at the start of the second period
eight became nine when dominic solanke powered home a header to level the aggregate score on 51 minutes
charlie colkett celebrates his second goal and chelsea 's fifth during youth cup semi-final and when the excellent chelsea captain charlie colkett caught voss dozing with a smart curling free - kick from 30 yards , they led for the first time after 144 minutes of the tie
the hosts were rampant though spurs may have levelled things again when charlie owens fired against the post from a low stylianides cross
chelsea knew they would feel more secure with a fifth goal and it duly arrived when anton walkes clumsily clipped aina inside the box
charlie colkett , who did n't put a foot wrong all night , coolly stroked home the penalty
but that security was short - lived
with eight minutes to play , fikayo tomori was adjudged to have handled on the floor as shayon harrison tried to weave his way to goal
the spurs man ultimately found it from 12 yards but they could n't get another to force extra time
incredibly , this was the fourth time these two teams have met at under 18 standard in the past 19 days
spurs must be well and truly sick of their blue - shirted foes
for chelsea , yet another final beckons
