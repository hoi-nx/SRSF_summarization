no wonder england 's renaissance man casey turned up at doral yesterday for the wgc-cadillac championship with a broad smile on his face
yes , it had to hurt a little that he had glorious opportunities to win the last two events on the tour and did n't close the deal in either instance
but this is a man who had fallen so far in america he had n't registered a top - three finish here in five years , let alone two in a row
now , after becoming the last man to earn a spot in this elite field and on the verge of earning his first invitation to the masters for three years , it is not surprising the 37 - year - old has no trouble dwelling on the positives
england star casey is standing on the brink of a masters invitation for the first time in three years ' i 'm fine about not winning because the first thing was to earn loads of world ranking points to get me back into the top 50 , ' argued casey , who has moved from 83rd to 45th â his highest ranking since 2012
' i 'm happy on the course , happy off it , and i really think i can build on what i have achieved these past two weeks
there 's better golf ahead of me
' casey has turned his professional life around after making what he describes as ' the hardest decision of my career '
three months ago he resigned his european tour membership and woke to headlines proclaiming he had spurned the chance to play in the ryder cup , since you have to be a member to make the team
' i understood the stories and if it had n't involved me , it 's what i would have thought , ' he said
' but i have n't given up on the ryder cup
my dream is to play in several more but i just have n't figured out how to yet
' my energy has been focused on getting back in the top 50 because that 's where i will be of most use to europe
' 37 - year - old casey secured a third - place finish at the honda classic as he continues his renaissance casey was such a european tour loyalist he served on any number of committees
' it was such a difficult decision to resign that i took a few months to tell my manager guy kinnings because i felt i was betraying him and the tour , ' said casey
' but i was running out of second chances
i was going back and forth across the atlantic and it was clearly affecting my golf
' now i feel so relaxed knowing i do n't have to run myself ragged
i ca n't tell you the difference it is making
' becoming a father has also helped
golf author keith elliott highlighted long ago the positive effects the ' nappy factor ' can have on a top pro and casey is another paid - up subscriber
' the great thing is i do n't take my work home with me any more , ' said casey , who lives with wife pollyanna and infant son lex in arizona
' i used to hang around the golf course all day at home wasting time but now i 'm much more savvy
' the world 's top 50 players get invitations at the end of this month to the masters , so no prizes for guessing the next target for one of europe 's best ball strikers
ranked world no 3 in 2008 , it 's exciting to think where this second act might take him
casey has scaled the world rankings from 83rd up to 45th , his highest placing since 2012
