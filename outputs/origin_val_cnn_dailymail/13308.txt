for the first time in history over half the world 's population live in cities -- more than 54 % of us did in 2014
mass urbanization is proving to be " the single most important transformation " the world is seeing in the 21st century , according to jamal saghir , director of sustainable development at the world bank , and it shows no signs of letting up
by 2050 , the u.n. predicts 66 % of us will call a city our home
it is generally accepted that cities are the engines of economic growth , and nowhere are these engines firing harder , or populations growing faster , than in the developing world
with burgeoning higher education systems and enviably young workforces , north african cities in particular are booming
commended for their diversity , adaptability and enterprise , investors are taking note
global auditing firm pwc has now quantified and ranked africa 's urban hubs in a new report listing the continent 's top " cities of opportunity
" with the caveat that only one city per country could be assessed , pwc set out ranking locations in terms of infrastructure , human capital , economics and society and demographics
north african cities dominated the top five , with cairo claiming pole position , followed by tunis , johannesburg , casablanca and algiers
analysts cited the age of north african cities as a determining factor , with strong infrastructure across the board , incubating an environment for human capital to thrive
however , sub-saharan cities registered among the highest in terms of society and demographics , excelling in diversity and population growth , both useful when looking towards future investment
indeed , the report also offered an alternative ranking , gauging the strongest trajectories in terms of investment
gdp growth , ease of doing business , attracting fdi , middle class and overall population growth all took precedent
under these criteria , cairo could only achieve a mid-table ranking and was the only city in the top 10 north of the sahara
dar es salaam , lusaka , nairobi , lagos and accra made up the top five , suggesting a new generation of north african powerhouse economies is waiting in the wings
that being said , one city 's development does not preclude another 's
what is certain is that the battle for economic dominance is on
