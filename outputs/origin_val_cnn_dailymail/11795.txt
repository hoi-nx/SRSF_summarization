acknowledging sebastian vettel 's display , horner said : ' on a personal note it 's great to see him win
i 'm pleased for him
he looked a happy chap
' i thought he drove brilliantly
he got his head down at the front , managed the tyres and managed to make a two - stop strategy work
' the ferrari did look very gentle on its tyres in the heat and temperature ( 33 degrees centigrade )
' seb has clearly got a good feel in the car , it has good driveability and he 's very good at looking after the tyres , and in that situation he is quite often unbeatable
' looking at the bigger picture , horner added : ' although it was n't a great day for us , it was at least a good day for f1 in that in a straight race ferrari managed to beat mercedes
' the start to the new season has so far been disastrous for red bull for after complaining vociferously about power - unit supplier renault after the season - opening australian grand prix , it was brake issues that proved the team 's undoing in malaysian
daniil kvyat and daniel ricciardo could only manage ninth and 10th respectively , even finishing behind the rookie pairing from ' sister ' team toro rosso in max verstappen and carlos sainz jr who were seventh and eighth
holding up ferrari 's turnaround as an example of what can be achieved , horner added : ' they have done a good job
' it demonstrates everything is possible , and shows how things can change quite quickly
' we just have to focus on our issues and address them in the forthcoming races because we had a very tough afternoon

' it was then about trying to manage our race to make sure we got to the end , so a frustrating afternoon really
' we need to go away and understand some of the issues from the weekend and make sure we address them , hopefully in time for the next race in china
