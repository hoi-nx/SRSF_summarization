students at a high school in southern california returned to class on monday to discover that their chemistry teacher had switched gender , adopted a different first name and was dressing as a woman
amanda swager , born michael , grew up as a boy , but learned as an adult that she was actually genetically female and began transitioning
amanda swager , 32 , who teaches chemistry at chino valley unified school district , had first notified district leaders about her situation two years ago
' i was in a movie theater with my boyfriend , and some students walk in and start shooting pictures of me in a movie theater , ' she told kcal9
after discussing the situation with the school district , it was decided that amanda swager should adopt her new identity immediately
amanda swager considered her gender very much a personal matter and so the decision was taken to notify only students in her class and their parents , rather than making a blanket announcement to everyone
' we decided as a district , as a faculty , that it would do more harm than good to do a mass notification , ' amanda swager told nbc4
' instead do individual notifications in classrooms where they knew what to expect
' the district 's handling of the matter and amanda swager sudden change have come in for criticism from some parents who say they support the teacher but feel they should have been notified so they could speak to their kids about it
the chino valley unified school district have updated information of their website about amanda swager after the decision was taken that she would transition to a woman sooner than originally planned ' on a friday he was a man , on monday he was woman , ' said one parent
' this probably brought or is going to bring disruption in the classroom because all these questions need to be answered , ' said another , who identified himself as rusty
' they 're going to want to know why did the teacher did what he did
' students interviewed seem less concerned
' if it 's what she wants to do , i mean , i 'm not going to judge
it 's what she wants to make her happy , ' said a pupil called madison
a spokesperson for the chino valley unified school district said they ca n't comment because it 's a personal and private matter for the teacher
amanda swager has asked parents to not be angry with the school district
' i 've got nothing but overwhelming support from the school district , ' she said
the teacher also told nbc4 that she has no regrets and now wants to focus on doing her best job in the classroom
' it 's just relaxing to be able to wake up in the morning and just be me , ' she said
amanda swager , pictured above , had originally planned on returning to school as a woman after the summer holidays , but that timetable had to be brought forward after she was outed by pupils over the weekend while on a date
