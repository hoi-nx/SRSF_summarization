a pair of protesters who came all the way from new jersey to des moines , iowa to lodge a protest against their state 's governor , christie , were thrown out of saturday 's iowa ag summit after they yelled that christie had n't done enough to help victims of sandy
organizers of saturday 's iowa ag summit warned audience members that they would be escorted out if they caused a scene
police quickly tossed the pair , including stevens , whose sign claimed ' thousands of families ' were still displaced from their homes
mangino , a man standing with her , barked , ' i will not shut up ! ' christie had told an activist in october at a belmar , new jersey town hall meeting about post-hurricane rebuilding to do just that
' my people follow me everywhere , ' christie quipped to event organizer bruce as the protesters were marched to the exit and hundreds applauded
' i 'm magnetic , bruce , ' he said
' they ca n't stay away from me
as the pair left the auditorium , christie said that ' it really is a wonderful country that people can do that
' stevens ' sign read , ' governor christie : thousands of families still not home after sandy
' sandy was an historic 2012 storm that ravaged us 's mid-atlantic coast , killing 12 in new jersey and causing more than $ 20 billion in damage overall
mangino said outside that sandy 's aftermath forced him to abandon his home , and that he and his family have moved three times since then
tens of thousands in the new jersey were made homeless as 80 - mph winds battered the coast and flattened houses , and soe advocates insist the governor has n't done enough to help
' i 'm begging you , ' one of the hecklers yelled as she was ejected
the two were n't the only ones to disrupt the morning 's program
a lone , elderly man interrupted iowa gov. terry branstad as the event began , reading aloud from a sheet of paper a litany of complaints about ' corporate ' agriculture
he too was shown the door to the sound of cheers and one audience member who yelled ' get him out of here ! ' ' it 's all about money , ' the gray - haired activists had complained
' there 's too much corruption
' and then : ' we want clean water ! ' a group of about 50 protesters were gathered outside the elwell family food center near the iowa state fairgrounds , a mixture of organic - only food advocates , backers of ' small , family farms , ' opponents of genetically modified food crops , and animal rights activists from peta
christie , the no - nonsense governor known for boisterous outbursts on the campaign trail , reserved his most emotional words for the obama administration 's fast - evolving policy on cuba
the communist island nation , he complained bitterly , has been harboring since 1984 a fugitive who killed a new jersey police officer in 1977
the ejected christie heckler 's sign identified her as a member of the new jersey organizing project , a liberal group that is demanding more government funds to fix hurricane damage power to the ( old ) people ! an elderly protester also interrupted iowa gov. terry branstad with a litany of complaints about ' corporate ' agriculture circus : activists rallied outside the iowa ag summit on march 7 as hundreds listened inside to a procession of republican presidential hopefuls ' you can not start trading with a country that is promoting someone who is a cop - killer , ' he said of joanne chesimard , the 67 - year - old former black liberation army member who escaped from a new jersey prison in 1979 and has been on the run ever since
crazies : animal liberation activists from peta were on hand to complain about iowa 's thousands of pork farmers ' if they 're going to keep harboring fugitives , ' he said , ' i have a problem with that ... the president does n't know how to negotiate
you do n't give away the idea of trading with us for nothing
' the cuba government refused this week to extradite joanne chesimard , who has adopted the name joanne chesimard , as part of trade negotiations designed to give cuba access to us markets after a half - century of political freeze
' i can say it is off the table , ' said gustavo machin , the deputy director for us affairs at the cuba ministry of foreign affairs , during a march 2 interview with yahoo news
in december josefina vidal , cuba âs head of north american affairs , rejected a deal that would have returned joanne chesimard to the us in exchange for 5 prisoners held in the us ' every nation has sovereign and legitimate rights to grant political asylum to people it considers to have been persecuted , ' she told the associated press at the time
' we âve explained to the us government in the past that there are some people living in cuba to whom cuba has legitimately granted political asylum
' christie also attacked the white house on its economic record , hinting that he favors a wholesale rewrite of us 's tax code
fugitive : joanne chesimard killed a new jersey police officer , escaped from a new jersey prison and fled justice in cuba , where she still lives under the raul castro government 's protection ' we tax too much in this country already
we tax in a way that 's too complicated , ' he said
' we tax that money at every step along the way
we tax it when you make it , we tax it when you invest it , and then we tax you when you die â and in some states , like mine , we tax your heirs who take it
' ' it 's crazy , ' christie said
those taxes , he added , hit us in concert with an economy that 's growing too slow to be sustainable
' this is the worst recovery in modern history [ and ] the president takes a victory lap , ' he carped
and touting his own record conducting global trade missions for new jersey businesses , christie said the president 's approach has been inadequate
' i think any of us who have seen the president negotiate over the course of the last 6 years is concerned about the way the president negotiates , ' he said .
