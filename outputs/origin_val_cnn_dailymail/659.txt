he was russia 's deputy prime minister from 1997 to 1998 during yeltsin 's presidency , but found himself on the fringes of the country 's politics after a tanking economy forced yeltsin 's resignation
the politician founded a number of opposition movements after leaving the russia parliament in 2003 and he had served as the co-chair of the opposition republican party of russia - people 's freedom party since 2012
it has been reported that nemtsov angered putin 's government two years ago when he charged that billions of dollars had been stolen from funds designated for the 2014 winter olympics in sochi , his hometown
in january 2011 , he was sentenced to 15 days in jail after being arrested at a new year 's eve protest rally for ' disobedience towards police '

he was a key figure in russia 's liberal , pro-west opposition pro-west in his ideology , mr nemtsov had told u.s. diplomats he wanted to take russia on a pro-eu , pro-nato course , including eventual membership of both organisations , according to a diplomatic cable released by wikileaks
' the key , nemtsov argued , was to present this strategy as the only viable choice for russia , ' wrote a u.s. embassy attachÃ© in the note dated february 2006
but , the diplomat continued , ' nemtsov also realizes that his association with the yeltsin era will probably limit support for any initiative with his name on it , and he is counting on the next generation of politicians to carry the liberal banner
' putin has claimed mr nemtsov 's murder - yards from the kremlin - was a ' provocation ' .
