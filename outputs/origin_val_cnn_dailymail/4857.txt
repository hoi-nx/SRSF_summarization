' according to the legend , the protected daughter of a king escaped to the surrounding hills , where she met and fell in love with a young shepherd , ' said brennan-wessels
' when the shepherd asked the king for his daughter in marriage , the king refused and forbade his daughter from seeing the boy again
' the two met secretly one last time and cried until their tears filled the valleys to form the two lakes : one green as the princess 's eyes were green , and the other blue like the shepherd âs eyes

the ancient story recounts the tale of a bad - tempered widower king and his daughter in a kingdom in the western sea
he was a king , lord of alchemy and sorcerer , who lived exclusively for his daughter , antã­lia , and who would not let the princess speak to anyone
apart from the king , the princess was raised by an old nurse , after the queen had died
as the years progressed , the princess grew - up to be a beautiful young woman and able to attract the attentions of any boy in the kingdom
however , the king restricted her movements to the castle and garden , and few ever saw her
but , un-intimidated by her father , and with the help of the nurse , she escaped to the local hills and valleys , as her father slept after his lunch
during one of her escape adventures , she heard a song : the music was beautiful and enchanted her to follow it to its origins
hiding from view , the princess found a young shepard playing a flute , sitting on top of a hill
for weeks she returned , listening to the young shepard , until she was discovered behind some bushes
the shepard boy fell in love with the princess , and they continued to meet afterwards , talking , laughing and enjoying each other 's company , until the boy decided to ask the princess in marriage
early in the morning , the couple knocked on the door of the castle , and asked the servants to speak to the king
very nervous but determined , the shepard asked the king for his daughter in marriage
reacting angrily , the king refused and expelled him from the castle , and forbade his daughter from seeing the young boy
not wishing more ill - feelings , she followed the orders of her father , but met secretly with the shepard that afternoon in order to tell him that he would never see him again
antã­lia and the shepard boy cried all afternoon , embracing , and their tears formed two beautiful lakes , one green , for the princess 's eyes were green , and the other blue , for the shepard 's eyes were likewise colored
