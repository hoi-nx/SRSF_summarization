getting closer and closer , the head bison shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car âs front bumper
reacting , the filmmaker exclaims : â do nât run into our car , â just as the bison crashes into it â the impact sends the camera up and then down into his lap. shocked , a lady in the car laughs as the man readjusts the camera and begins filming the two remaining bison , who look quite content standing sideways in the middle of the road
as the bison gets closer it shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car âs front bumper speaking about the incident , the filmmaker said : â i thought the bison would simply run by our car at a full clip

there was nothing we could do to avoid being hit
