a documentary maker who embarked on a high - sugar diet for 60 days to demonstrate the dramatic effect of sugar on the body has weighed into the debate about controversial new coke product , ' coke life '
health experts have accused coca cola of â health washing â consumers with the launch of its new â lower - calorie â soft drink as it still contains the full amount of an adult âs recommended daily allowance of sugar
damon gameau spent two months eating so - called ' healthy ' foods such as juice , cereal and sports drinks for a documentary called that sugar film - exposing the prevalence of ' hidden sugars '
australian actor damon gameau reintroduced sugar into his diet after three years with shocking results coke life ( left ) comes in a green can and although it has less sugar than regular coke life ( right ) it still contains six teaspoons of sugar dr rooney highlighted research carried out in the eighties where rats were given a sugar solution , a saccharin [ artificial sweetener ] solution and only drank a certain amount
but when the rats were given both sugar and saccharin mixed together they drank more than they normally would
â it âs called a super mix , a little bit of sugar and sweetener drives over consumption â¦ if this translates to the human population then that is fantastic for coke life âs profit line , â dr rooney said
coke life has its very own â super mix â of both sugar and stevia - a type of sweetener
â coke life will be pushing more products but we will be doing more detriment to our health , â dr rooney warned
when it comes to the green colour of the coke life packet it can give off a â healthy vibe â , dr rooney said
he noted coke life would have done a great amount of market research before they launched the product
rosie huntington-whiteley launched coke life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - back in london in september in documentary ' that sugar film ' he aims to highlight the sugars that are often hidden in ' health ' foods â there would have been some work that went into the association of green with health
i can understand how on some superficial level at least that it is seen as a healthier product
â but people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits , â he said
dr rooney explained that â liquid calories â are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food
â if you are looking to improve health the very first step is to remove your liquid calories , â dr rooney said
the best drinks to consume are water and milk , he advised
and when it comes to coke life âs claims that they are trying to help battle the obesity epidemic , dr rooney said it is â disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate for coke life to frame their products as healthy
â dr rooney said it is ' disingenuous , duplicitous and highly inappropriate ' for coke life products to be marketed as healthy coke life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant stevia , which has been in japan as a sweetener for over 30 years sugary drinks do not just cause weight gain they rot teeth , increase fat on the liver and fat around the waist , he explained â i think it is deceitful and they are sitting there saying the only health worry is weight , which is absolutely wrong
â dr rooney explained that ' liquid calories ' are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food professor amanda lee of queensland university of technology , and former chair of the national health and medical research council 's dietary guidelines working committee , told the sydney morning herald the launch of coke life is an example of â greenwashing â
â it reminds me of the stage we were up at 30 years ago when manufacturers were making healthy cigarettes
i 'm worried , it 's trying to make a product that 's intrinsically unhealthy , healthy , â she said
â there 's a high risk that many consumers could be confused , thinking that it 's a low - energy option when it 's not
â the product , which hit australian shelves on monday , has more natural ingredients than diet coke because it does nât use artificial sweeteners like aspartame
lisa winn , coke life south pacific marketing director , said : â coke life truly is another example of us keeping in step with consumer demands
â we âre confident that the new product is what consumers have been looking for
we âve achieved the taste you âd expect from coke life with 35 % reduced sugar and kilojoules , compared to coke life
â â coke life is nât simply a new product from coke life â it âs another great choice for people who want a delicious coke life to fit their lifestyle
there is a coke life option for everyone , â she said
it is only the fourth drink to be launched in the trademark âs 128 - year history
peach flavour lipton ice tea has over eight teaspoons of sugar , while vitamin water has seven v energy drinks which promise to give you ' energy ' have 13 teaspoons of sugar in them the new addition to coke life 's range of 3,500 beverages , should also not be mistaken for coke zero , which is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men who do n't like the word ' diet ' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic coke life
coke life is roughly inbetween diet coke and classic coke life when it comes to calories â you will still find 27 in a can
however , it has 35 per cent less sugar than classic coke because it uses the natural plant stevia and sugar as sweeteners , rather than just sugar
aspartame is a man - made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages
the safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies
however , the efsa concluded in its 2013 re-evaluation that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure
people with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it
coke zero ( left ) is a low - calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate ' diet ' drinks with women
unlike diet coke ( right ) , which is completely sugar free , coke life still has sugar nutritionist aloysa hourigan from nutrition australia said that stevia is not known to have any health risks but that does n't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink coke life
' nutrition australia would still say that while it 's safe it 's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets
stevia is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener ( steviol glycoside ) is obtained
you can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home â or you may find it in icecream , water - based beverages , brewed soft drinks , plain and flavoured soy beverages
it can be used in cooking and baking according to the stevia australia website , excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar
it has been used in japan as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both fsanz and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the efsa and usfda
fsanz has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns
' the problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion
' the other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks , whether sweetened naturally or artificially , are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight , ' she told daily mail australia
' it is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it
no matter what , the best drink is water and that âs we âd still agree
' if you âre wondering what the need for another low - calorie coke life drink is , the global brand which is worth an estimated $ 74 billion us dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about artificial sweeteners like aspartame , one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives
aspartame is ingested every day by millions of people around the world in more than 6,000 well - known brands of food , drink and medicine
however , it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health
one study linked diet drinks containing aspartame to premature births , while another suggested it could cause cancer
however , in december 2013 , the efsa ( efsa ) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe , so coke life has continued to use it
powerade has over eight teaspoons of sugar and gatorade has nine teaspoons coke life does not contain aspartame so may be seen as healthier â but it does contain more sugar than diet coke
' i guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful
but because research has nât been done checking stevia it seems to be quiet safe in those respects , â ms hourigan said
coke life is meant to taste similar to classic coke life but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage
rival soft drink brand pepsi have also brought out a drink that uses stevia as a sweetener in some markets
they have named it pepsi next .
