christie 's son was due to make his boxing debut as a featherweight next month but this has now been put on hold because of his father 's diagnosis
during his boxing career , the former champion fought 41 bouts , taking 32 wins including 26 by knockout
he suffered eight defeats , most memorably to mark kaylor in 1985
the infamous match was preceded by an ugly scuffle at the pre-fight conference , and when the boxing finally got underway christie lost in nine rounds in a match where both men were floored
although he boxed on into the early 90s , he was never the same fighter again and hung up his gloves in 1993
christie 's greatest success came in 1982 when he defeated mow gruciano in what was then east germany to take the european middleweight belt
the father - of - one was involved in a scuffle with fellow former boxer lloyd last october during a boxing writer 's club dinner at the savoy hotel in london
frank bruno had to step in to separate the pair after they squared up , but no punches were thrown
christie said at the time : ' there was a bit of an incident with lloyd
i do n't know what planet he was on but it 's different from the rest of us
he was just mouthing off , acting the big shot
