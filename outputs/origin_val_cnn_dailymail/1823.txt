carragher has hailed the impact of chelsea goalkeeper courtois , who put a first - half error behind him to help the blues to victory against hull
chelsea went 2 - 0 up through eden hazard and diego costa , but hull pulled level after courtois gifted possession to abel hernandez just before the half - hour mark
and carragher , speaking on sky sports after the game , thinks that despite his error , there are few goalkeepers as good as the chelsea man
courtois made an error in the first half to gift hull their equalising goal against chelsea courtois gave away possession under pressure from gaston ramirez to allow abel hernandez to score ' he had a bit of a mix - up in the first half , ' the sportsmail pundit said
' he 's a world class goalkeeper to keep petr cech out and what he did last year for atletico madrid , getting to the champions league final
' he 's a fantastic keeper and he 's going to be one of the world 's best for a decade or so
' speaking alongside carragher was former arsenal striker thierry henry , who was in agreement at courtois ' excellent game despite the high - profile error
' before the mistake , he made a couple of saves that kept chelsea in the game , ' thierry henry noted
' but it 's not about the mistake , it 's about how you respond , and he responded well in the second half
' chelsea 's 3 - 2 win took them back to winning ways after a draw against southampton last time out , and restored their six - point gap ahead of manchester city at the top of the premier league
carragher ( left ) and thierry henry hailed courtois ' impact in the second half to save chelsea courtois made a string of saves , including three in quick succession , to help jose 's side to victory their win at hull was far from convincing , but according to thierry henry , getting three points in the manner chelsea did is a mark of their winning mentality
' big teams will do that to you , ' he said
' three attempts on target , three goals
it sounds simple , but that 's what chelsea are about
' hull were unlucky in the second half on a couple of occasions , but that 's what a big team does to you
they come here , they do n't really perform well , they find themselves in a difficult situation , and they managed
' one negative for jose will be the injury to diego costa , which forced him off with 15 minutes to play holding his hamstring
carragher thinks courtois ( pictured ) will be one of the world 's best goalkeepers for a decade carragher and thierry henry also believe that chelsea 's title hopes will remain successful , even without diego costa chelsea 's strike force is such that diego costa 's absence is unlikely to be a devastating blow , and the presence of remy in the latter stages actually forced a winner for the league leaders
' it looks like a hamstring injury and we know his history from the champions league final , ' carragher said of diego costa
' if it is a hamstring injury , if remy has to come in , he 's come on there [ against hull ] and he 's made a difference
' he scored in the manchester city game as well
he 's not what you 'd call top level , he has n't played that much , we know jose just likes to play the same players
he 's not at diego costa 's level , but he 's enough to go up front and take them to the title
' they 've got that gap now , if they miss him for two or three games - depending on how bad the injury is - i think they 'll be fine
