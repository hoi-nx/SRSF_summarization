a group of tourists to the bahamas enjoyed one of the country âs unique attractions when they were greeted on a boat by a herd of swimming pigs looking for a snack
an amusing video shows the pigs leaving the beach and paddling through the crystal clear water as they make their way towards the boat
the pigs swim to the side of the vessel and jockey for the best position as the tourists squeal in excitement
the two pigs swim over to the tourist boat and begin treading water around it before begging for food with the prospect of food and none as of yet being provided , the two animals becoming increasingly demanding as they tread the shallow water
they soon jump onto the edge of the boat , hang their trotters over the side of it and begin begging for food from those on board
eventually the two pigs receive food from the people on the boat and continue to hang onto the side of it with their mouths wide open in anticipation
the video concludes with the two pigs â with satisfied appetites â returning to the beach
jumping up onto the boat the two pigs hang their trotters over the side of it in search of a snack there they are greeted by even more of their kind and collectively make their way over to another boat in the hope of receiving even more food
discussing the encounter , the filmmaker wrote online : â they nearly turned our boat over
â the video was taken on pig beach â known locally as pig beach â on exuma , a district of the bahamas that consists of over 360 islands
becoming more vocal , the two pigs hang off the side of the boat and demand that they be fed eventually the pigs ' cries for food are answered and they are fed by a person on the boat there are many theories as to how the pigs arrived at the island
some believe that a group of sailors dropped the pigs off at the beach with the intention of coming back to cook and eat them , but they did n't return
others say that the pigs survived a shipwreck and managed to swim to shore
and perhaps the most cynical and least romantic suggestion is that the pigs are part of a business scheme to attract tourists to the bahamas .
