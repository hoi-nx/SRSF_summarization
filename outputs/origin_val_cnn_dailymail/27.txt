redus had a blood alcohol level of .155 when he was pulled over
his family contend that his son did make some mistakes that night , but they did not warrant the severity of the response

in the build - up christopher carter is heard on the audio repeatedly telling redus to ' stay right there '
the front - facing camera in christopher carter 's car was not working at the time , so all you can see is the back seats of his patrol car
moments later christopher carter is heard telling redus to step back before firing six bullets ( scene pictured ) you can hear redus telling the officer he is scared and during the pat down says : ' are you going to rape me right now ? ' christopher carter then tells him to put his hands behind his back as he is under arrest

are you going to shoot me if i do n't stop ? ' ' is that what cops do ? they shoot people
' all the while christopher carter keeps telling redus to stop , but he refuses to listen
redus then says : ' you piece of s * * * '
christopher carter then fires six shots at close range , killing redus
the student 's family have said he was never aggressive or confrontational but , according to corporal christopher carter , redus tried to beat him with his own baton after he was pulled over for driving erratically
redus ' family contends that even though he made some mistakes that night , he did not deserve the aggressive response by corporal carter his parents , mickey and valerie redus , and their other sons , released a statement last year saying they were ' devastated ' by the autopsy findings
' we are stunned to learn that redus was shot in the back from very close range
the report also shows that the shot to his eye was delivered at a downward angle , again from very close range , ' they wrote
' that knowledge , coupled with information from the earlier police report indicating that redus died on his back with his legs underneath him , has left us heartbroken and shaken to the core
' the family added that they did not condone his decision to drive while under the influence , but said they were ' thankful ' he arrived home safely without harming anyone else on the night in question
they added : ' redus âs mistakes do not negate the amazing and productive life he lived nor the loving , encouraging and compassionate person that he was
' while mistakes do bear consequences , the extreme and brutal results of redus âs encounter with officer christopher carter far exceed the magnitude of his mistakes
' the university of incarnate wood said they have fully supported the decision to release the audio tape of the confrontation
following christopher carter 's clearance by a grand jury , the school 's management said in a release that they hope the recording will ' put to rest much of the misinformation disseminated by persons characterizing the recording
' they reveal that during the recording , you will hear christopher carter say : ' put your hands behind your back ' â 20 times
' stop resisting ' â 25 times ' stop ' or ' stop it ' â 29 times ' stop or i will shoot you ' â 5 times ' you are under arrest ' / ' being arrested ' / ' resisting arrest ' â 3 times
