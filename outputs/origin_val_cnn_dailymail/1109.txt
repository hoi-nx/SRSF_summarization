real madrid youngster harper has been snubbed by scotland under - 19s manager sbragia because he is a ' luxury ' player who is n't big enough
the young scots travel to play three games against austria , italy and croatia in the uefa under - 19s championship
highly - rated forward harper who has netted three goals for real madrid in this season 's uefa youth league , is midway through a five - year deal at the bernabeu , and can count former club legend zinedine zidane as one of his coaches
real madrid youngster harper in action against ludogorets in the uefa youth league match scotland under - 19s manager sbragia has left harper out of his squad for the upcoming games among harper 's coaches at real madrid are former france international zinedine zidane ( centre ) he 's already been linked with a move to both liverpool and united , but that has n't been enough to earn him a spot in the squad , despite playing in the qualifiers in lithuania
however , former sunderland boss sbragia has explained it 's nothing personal with the 19 - year - old , he 's just gone for a more physical approach , despite harper standing at over 6ft tall
sbragia explained : ' our concentration is on the opening game with austria and we 've deliberately got more height in our squad
that 's one of the reasons why harper is n't in
' unfortunately , i do n't see enough of him in action
the last time he was with us , he did ok , but i wanted a little more impact
at real madrid he can float all over the place , which he does
but with us , he has to be more disciplined
' he 's an exceptionally gifted lad , but sometimes we ca n't carry him
he can be a luxury sometimes
in some cases , if it 's going well , he can be a good luxury
' highly rated forward harper has already been linked with moves to united and liverpool but the ex-manchester united reserve team coach still believes harper has a big future ahead of him
sbragia stressed : ' listen , harper 's time will come
the last time i spoke to him , he wanted to really settle in at real madrid and find a place there
that 's been a big thing for him
' i 've gone with the boys i 've seen most in the last six months
we keep tabs on harper and see video clips of him
we have people over there who keep their eye on him
' there are others i 've left out like dominic thomas at motherwell who will have gripes that they 're not in the squad
' but i 've picked a group of 18 which will hopefully do well for us
it 's my opinion and i 'm not saying it 's right
but the squad i 've picked is an extremely strong one
' i can only pick 18 when i really could have picked 26 or 27
i 've gone for a physical side and runners
' it 's purely tactical and there certainly has n't been a lack of enthusiasm from harper about playing for scotland
' harper is currently midway through a five - year deal with real madrid and is tipped to have a big future
