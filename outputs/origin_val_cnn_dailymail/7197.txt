hamilton has been busy during the off - season , parading on red carpets and awards ceremonies in suits and hats of an extravagant flavour
but for all he has enjoyed rubbing shoulders with the glitzy set , tweeting trysts with his â brothers â from the worlds of music , film and fashion , the formula one season will open in melbourne âs albert park a week today and hamilton âs attention is turning to emulating the man he counted as a hero before he had ever heard of a rapper
for last year âs championship victory , his second , put hamilton one behind the late ayrton senna
hamilton of mercedes poses at the unveiling of the new w06 at the formula one winter tests brazilian 's racing driver ayrton senna gives a thumbs up after he won the grand prix mercedes â pre-season dominance indicates that the 2015 season will be another straight title fight between hamilton â of stevenage , tewin wood , monaco and la â and his team - mate nico rosberg
â the only landmark as a kid was watching ayrton senna , â said hamilton , who , as a nine - year - old karter hid behind his father âs car so his dad would not see him cry when he learned ayrton senna had died at imola
â he had three titles and , even though i do nât really look at numbers and records , i always said that i wanted three ; to match ayrton senna
so if i have a third world championship , i would feel closer to him , although it was another era
i do nât think anyone is as good as him , but it would still be a nice feeling
â there are echoes now of ayrton senna âs era : the brazilian âs rivalry with his mclaren team - mate prost , the cerebral frenchman , went into a second season , just as hamilton âs is with nico rosberg
ayrton senna won the title in 1988 , but lost to prost in 1989
so could hamilton succumb to nico rosberg , a steelier competitor than his blond , euro - chic image once suggested ? the answer would seem to lie in hamilton âs own performance
if he drives to his potential , his natural talent will surely win him the title
but , as ever , he could be buffeted by emotional vulnerabilities
we remember 2011 when , pained by his split from singer - songwriter girlfriend scherzinger , his form suffered badly
this winter he again split from scherzinger
will that have an impact on his psyche ? hamilton has again split with former pussycat dolls singer - songwriter girlfriend scherzinger hamilton and singer scherzinger attend the gq men of the year awards at the royal opera house in london is he spending too much time flying from the states to europe , a question given impetus when he missed a day âs practice with a fever ? or are such questions an insult to a focused sportsman who , anyway , should not be begrudged the lifestyle his success has bought him ? â last year i adapted , â said hamilton , 30
â i had a mental attitude that was impenetrable
i feel that i still carry that mentality and , while it has not been easy ( splitting from scherzinger ) , i do nât think it âs going to be a problem
i feel as if i âve got enough in place to do what i need to do and be the best i can be
â hamilton drives his new car on formula one testing day in barcelona in late february for the season preview more potential turbulence lies in his contract situation at mercedes
his three - year deal expires at the end of the season and he is negotiating his own terms , having dropped simon fuller as his manager
he wants parity with the highest earners on the grid , led by ferrari new boy sebastian vettel , whose deal is worth 50million euros ( Â£ 36m )
hamilton , who is careful with his money , as even his father has joked , has surprised mercedes bosses niki lauda and toto wolff by how painstakingly detailed he has been in negotiations
â we âre in the final stages , â revealed hamilton last week
â i do nât know what the timelines are and we âre not rushing
getting it done before or after melbourne does not matter
i âm not sure i âve enjoyed it , but it âs been an experience
if i âd gone through my whole career and not done something like this i âd have always wondered if i could or could nât do it
the reigning world champion poses for a picture with mercedes team - mate nico rosberg â i âve tried to do my due diligence and understand where we are and where it can grow to benefit the team and myself
we âre not in a discussion where i âm saying after winning the championship â i want this â
naturally , the target for every driver is to try to work towards being the benchmark
â while hamilton has noticed the presence of a few more photographers in his life , nico rosberg has kept a low profile since missing out on the title in abu dhabi
he is said by a close associate to be â mega-relaxed â , and declared in the german press that he knows he can win the title
he has devised a new breathing technique for high g - force corners , in which he previously stopped inhaling
his new method will help keep his concentration high for a longer distance , or so the theory goes
former mclaren driver hamilton poses for a picture in front of the eiffel tower in paris donning shades what about the rest of the field ? williams , ferrari and red bull are expected to fight closely for the other podium places
as for mclaren-honda , they have endured a pre-season horribilis : unreliability and lack of pace compounded by an unexplained injury to perhaps the best pound - for - pound driver in the world , fernando alonso , who will miss the australian grand prix after hitting his head in an innocuous - looking testing accident in barcelona a fortnight ago
he can sit back and watch the race in the early morning of his spanish sunday
just like everyone else , it seems , he will be helpless to stop the mercedes machines
