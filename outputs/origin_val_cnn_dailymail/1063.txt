he 's such a special horse

he said ' i 'm delighted with that run , noel ( fehily ) gave him a super ride
he got him filled up coming round home turn and coming to the second - last he thought he might win , but then he just petered out
' to be fair he is better on a flatter track , but he has run a blinder and we are delighted

' de bromhead also saddled former winner sizing europe , who was seventh , beating home mr mole
he said : ' johnny ( burke ) did n't knock him around when he knew he was beaten
