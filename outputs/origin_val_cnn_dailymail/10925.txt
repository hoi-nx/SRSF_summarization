a bitter blast from scandinavia will put spring on hold for almost a week as cold temperatures and snow return to parts of uk and the temperature dips to just -3c
the cold snap has returned with a vengeance despite uk recently enjoying blue skies and sunshine with temperatures peaking at 17.5c in some parts of the country
but the weather has taken a cooler turn as an easterly breeze from northern europe sweeps across the uk - and it is expected to last until the middle of next week
in cambridge tourists refused to let the cold snap ruin their fun , and were pictured punting on the river cam this morning warmly wrapped up huddled under blankets
the met office blames the low temperatures on high pressure building in the north - east and say the midlands and the north of the country could see a dusting of snow , sleet and frost on the hills in the next couple of days
the chill , which is expected to last until mid next week , will see bitter winds make temperatures of 4 - 7c feel like 1 - 5c
the met office blamed the sharp shift in weather on high pressure shifting from southern europe to scandinavia - meaning a touch of ' polar air ' could be heading towards uk
the tourists are clearly enjoying themselves as they go punting on the river cam - and ensure they were wrapped up warmly the chill , which is expected to last until mid next week , will see bitter winds make temperatures of 4 - 7c feel like 1 - 5c across the country the weather has taken a cooler turn as icy wind sweeps across the country - and it 's expected to last until at least the middle of next week a met office spokesman said temperatures will dip as low as -3c overnight in parts of west wales , north west england and scotland
he said : ' there is a cold breeze around at the moment
today 's temperature is around 8 or 9 degrees , which is below average for this time of year
' tomorrow will be similar and perhaps even colder
it is going to be cold particularly with the moderate north easterly breeze we are experiencing
there is a chance of wintry showers with the colder temperatures and it could be a bit sleety out there
' we do have high pressure across scandinavia and it 's pulling colder air over the rest of northern europe - it 's bringing in these colder temperatures , which means we have these cold and quite cloudy conditions
' a large part of the country will see cloud over the next few days - in fact its set to be cloudy with the occasional bright spell rather than the other way round
the met office added that as the weather has been so dry recently conditions should not be too icy , although there is a risk of local , patchy frost
