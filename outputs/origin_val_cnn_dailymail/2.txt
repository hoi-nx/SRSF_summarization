the message , as jenkins relaxed at his al fresco media conference overlooking rome âs central park , was that wales have not even thought about the maths
the wales assistant coach insisted his squad are not interested in points - difference â just winning a test match against italy
they have piped a respectful tune towards today âs opponents but there is a title on the line and head coach warren gatland knows that his side must go for the juggernaut victory at the stadio olimpico
the kiwi needs his back line to go full throttle and take every point they can to close the gap on england and ireland
wales were heaped with praise for their defensive display last week but â with the wingers in danger of not scoring a try all tournament for the first time since 1995 â wing liam williams is ready to shift the focus towards attack
liam williams insists wales will pile on the points against italy in rome jenkins says the first objective is to win the game â we know a lot of things need to happen , â said liam williams
â we are on first so we âll go out , do the business and then sit back and watch the other matches
it would be nice for one of us wingers to get on the scoresheet , but it is nât about me or george north getting across the line
the only thing that matters is getting the job done
â liam williams and george north both scored during last year âs 51 - 3 rout of scotland on the final day of the competition
a similar scoreline in rome would make warren gatland âs side big favourites for the title although they would have to wait for their reward as the new trophy is already at twickenham and its replica in edinburgh
for liam williams , it is a chance to silence his critics once and for all
the 23 - year - old scarlet , formerly a blast - furnace worker , was targeted on social media during last year âs tour of south africa
his shoulder charge gave the springboks a decisive penalty try and he was then sent off in his first club game of the season
liam williams was ordered to improve his discipline and has subsequently conceded one penalty in six tests , compared to 13 in his first 16
â i had to learn the hard way , â he said
â some did nât want me to be picked in a red shirt again
i had quite a lot of stick , but it goes in one ear and out the other
on twitter , i just blocked people who were having a go
it was rubbish , really
you do nât need it
warren gatland will be hoping to get some points on the board early on against the italians wales , pictured this week in training , have travelled to rome knowing a win could secure six nations glory â i hope they âre happy that i âve started four out of five games in this six nations
i âve worked on my discipline and it âs going well
i âm trying to handle situations differently â do what i have to do and then get out , instead of getting involved in stupid things
keep my body in the oven and my head in the freezer
â sharing his surname with famous predecessors â jpr , shane and martyn to name three â liam williams will now hope to match their big - game temperament
he will look to the forwards to provide a platform for victory â although the front - row casualty list is a worry â but it is up to the back line to deliver a title - winning scoreline
the absence of sergio is a huge boost for wales
the italy captain has a foot injury and the odds of wales winning the title shifted when his omission was confirmed
mike phillips passes the ball during an open session in cardiff on tuesday sam warburton ( left ) and george north ( right ) lead the celebrations after beating ireland last week but , sticking to message , jenkins talked up the quality of his cover
â he caused us a lot of problems last year , â he said
â he is a fantastic player , a world - class no 8 , and if he âs not playing they are going to miss him
but they have good players in their back row
sergio did nât play two years ago but they were pretty strong
â sergio âs absence should temper italy âs gung - ho approach while the captaincy has been handed to hooker ghiraldini
wales centre jonathan davies said this week that ireland should â fear the wounded animal â of scotland , but italy are also limping after losing to france so wales must also be on their guard
â we âve got more than one point to prove , â said ghiraldini
â everything starts from our first phase and our scrum has to be at its best
we have guys like martin castrogiovanni , michele rizzo and mauro bergamasco with good experience
sergio is a big loss â he could play in every national team in the world â but we have to keep believing
