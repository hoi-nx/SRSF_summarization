the case of a georgia woman , whose execution was postponed for a second time monday , is once again shining the national spotlight on one of the most fundamental questions we as a nation face : when do we put our own citizens to death ? but it 's an issue on which this country is all over the place
" as it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim 's life was not taken
" that was justice anthony kennedy , writing for the majority in kennedy v. louisiana ( 2008 )
you might think at first the department of justice is n't listening
after all , the u.s. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses that are punishable by death , and not all of them involve a victim 's life being taken
they fall into three main categories : 1 ) homicide offenses ; 2 ) espionage and treason ; and 3 ) nonhomicidal narcotics offenses
while most of them involve the death of a victim , not all of them do
but what happened to all that " should n't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim 's life was not taken " language from the supreme court ? does n't the department of justice have to listen to the supreme court ? they do , and they have
the department of justice has read the high court 's fine print in kennedy v. louisiana : " our concern here is limited to crimes against individual persons
we do not address , for example , crimes defining and punishing treason , espionage , terrorism , and drug kingpin activity , which are offenses against the state
as it relates to crimes against individuals , though , the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim 's life was not taken
as with most things , there are exceptions to the rule -- though reasonable minds may differ on the reasoning behind those exceptions
apparently , when we are talking about crimes against people , the death penalty should not be expanded to nonhomicide - type crimes
if it 's a crime against the state , well , it 's game on
after all , treason is one of three crimes mentioned in the u.s. constitution , so there 's a good argument that the federal statute authorizing death for treason is " constitutional " -- because it 's actually in the constitution
( yet another reason why federal court is not a place where defendants want to be -- it 's no secret defense attorneys would rather be in state court , where the penalties are less severe and where everything is n't illegal )
while it varies from state to state , as a very general proposition , the death penalty is almost universally reserved for the crime of murder
murder is a subcategory of the broader class of homicide , and death penalty crimes are normally a subcategory of murder
as another very general proposition in the states , murder -- plus something on top that makes it more egregious -- is what will qualify as a capital crime
it would be nice to say that capital murder in the states is always defined as an intentional killing , but even that has exceptions
in fact , in some states , you can be executed for a victim 's death even if you did n't actually pull the trigger and even if you never intended a death to result
if you commit an inherently dangerous felony , and a death results , you can be charged with " felony murder , " which in some states qualifies you for the death penalty
according to the supreme court , this is constitutional , as long as the defendant significantly participated in the felony and was recklessly indifferent to human life
ultimately , it 's nearly impossible to articulate a simple rule for determining which crimes our society deems worthy of the death penalty
society 's view of the death penalty is constantly evolving , and so is the view of appropriate death penalty crimes
as a general rule , horrific murders qualify , but sometimes a nonhomicide crime such as espionage qualifies
if you are in the armed forces , even more crimes can get you executed , such as desertion
that 's particularly paradoxical that we might order our military personnel to intentionally kill in times of war and then execute them -- as was the case of pvt. eddie slovik -- for refusing to intentionally participate in the killing
of course , we have long recognized that military justice requires a degree of martial discipline that the civilian world simply does n't
while the husband - wife execution of convicted spies ( and nonkillers ) julius and ethel rosenberg were certainly high profile at the time , the modern reality is that every person executed since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 participated in a crime in which a victim died
so what exactly will earn you the death penalty ? the message is anything but clear
for crimes against the person , it has to be pretty awful : a killing plus something that makes it even worse than your garden variety homicide
if your crime is against the state , however , the supreme court will give the state some leeway in killing citizens .
