british will invest Â£ 180million over the next ten years in defending the falklands against a â very live â threat from argentina , defence secretary michael fallon said today
the announcement comes amid fears of an invasion after it emerged vladimir putin could be helping to re-arm the south american nation by leasing them 12 long - range bombers
mr michael fallon said british âs military presence on the south atlantic territory would be â beefed up â following the findings of a review by top brass
there are fears of an invasion of the falklands after it emerged vladimir putin could be helping to re-arm the south american nation by leasing them 12 long - range bombers but later he told mps that there would be no more troops or fighter planes sent to the british territory after the review found british âs military forces were at the â level required â to ensure its protection against any threat
instead the british would â modernise â its defences in the region by investing in some of the â ageing infrastructure â , as a well as upgrading a surface - to - air missile system
his comments come amid claims there is a heightened risk of invasion by argentina
mr vladimir putin is understood to be working on a deal to lease 12 sukhoi su-24 long range bombers to the country
former defence minister sir gerald howarth said the reported deal with vladimir putin was â very serious â
he said : â it is very serious indeed
vladimir putin has many problems at home and yet he is ramping up tension in the falklands
â our policy has been to deter argentina from repeating the folly of 1982
when you have a volatile political leadership , that is when things can get very dangerous
â the decision to invest Â£ 180million and continue with ground based air defences is welcome
â the long - running dispute over the sovereignty of the british overseas territory has surfaced again in recent years under the presidency of cristina fernandez de kirchner
speaking before he addressed mps in the commons , mr michael fallon told bbc radio 4 âs today programme : â the threat remains
it is a very live threat
we have to respond to it
â we do need to modernise our defences to ensure that we have sufficient troops there and that the islanders have the right to remain british and the right to proper protection by our forces
â it is our general view that the threat has not reduced
â however in the commons he admitted that no more troops would be sent , nor would any more fighter jets be deployed after a review concluded current defence of the garrison was sufficient
he told mps : â i have endorsed the assessment â¦ that the current military presence is broadly proportionate to the threats and risks we face
â our forces in the south atlantic are entirely defensive , and are at a level required to ensure the defence of the falklands against any potential threat
â for the foreseeable future we will keep our numbers at around their current levels of about 1,200 personnel , military and civilian
â british must build up its defence capabilities in response to the threat posed by russia president vladimir putin
there are claims he is ramping up tensions in in the falklands , which have been heightened in recent years under the presidency of cristina fernandez de kirchner a source said : â i think the defence secretary meant to say â modernising â rather than â beefing up â
â amid threats from argentina , mr michael fallon said the army would deploy two raf chinook helicopters which were used in afghanistan and which would replace the search and rescue sea king helicopters already in the region
the helicopters would enable the islands â garrison to mount a â swift and decisive response â to â any emerging incidents â , it was said
former defence minister sir gerald howarth said the reported deal with between russia and argentina was â very serious â he also announced the british would deliver enhanced operational communications to better â enable to the sharing of real time operational data â
british will also renew the ground based air defence system when rapier , a surface - to - air missile system , comes out of service around the end of the decade , he said
the falkland islands patrol vessel , hms clyde , would also remain in the region
â we should not drop our guard â , he told mps , insisting the british was â not complacent â and the government would continue to remain â vigilant â
Â£ 180million would also be used to improve the quality of life of those in the falklands , including improving accommodation and a new primary school
a number of projects will be carried out to replace some of the â ageing infrastructure â , including the refurbishment of mare harbour and the replacement of the existing power generation systems
a major modernisation of the fuels infrastructure is also underway , he said
but only four raf typhoon jets are stationed there permanently and there are no plans to increase those numbers , mr michael fallon admitted
his comments to the house came after he told sky news : â i âm going to be announcing to parliament later today how we âre going to beef up defences there , how we âre going to modernise our defences
he added that he intended â to reassure the islanders that we âre absolutely committed to their right to remain british and to the defence of the islands â .
