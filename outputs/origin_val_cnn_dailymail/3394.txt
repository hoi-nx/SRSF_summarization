laura robson has aborted her planned comeback at next week 's miami open , having decided her wrist is still not ready for full on match play
the former british no 1 had accepted a wildcard into the qualifying event for the prestigious tournament involving both sexes in south florida
however , she has now handed it back , as looked likely after she posted a picture of herself on saturday night at a fashion exhibition in london
laura robson attended a fashion event in london as she continues to recover from a wrist injury the former british no 1 has not played since having problems with her wrist in australia last january caution has been the watchword for robson since she underwent surgery on her wrist early last summer
she had hoped to come back at some small events in california last month ahead of indian wells this week , but that was postponed for the miami wildcard
the next possible target is a wta event in colombia next month although seeing will be believing
robson is not said to have suffered any major setback in her rehab but the view is that there is no point rushing and doing further long term damage as she is still only 21
it is now 14 months since robson last appeared , at the 2014 australian open , where problems in her wrist ligament fully flared up
it will inevitably be a long road back when she manages to regain full fitness
