on tuesday , lisa mearkle was arrested on a homicide charge following a state police investigation into the shooting

the final moments leading to david kassick 's death were captured on video which dauphin county district attorney marsico said was critical in bringing the homicide charges
it was around 4 p.m. on february 2 when the 15 - year police veteran first attempted to pull david kassick over , according to the charging documents
instead of pulling over , david kassick took off and lisa mearkle gave chase , flipping on her lights and sirens
less than a mile away , david kassick pulled into the driveway of a relative he 'd been staying with and ran off on foot into the backyard , with lisa mearkle following close behind
as they ran through the yards behind grandview drive , the charging documents said , lisa mearkle fired her stun gun , automatically engaging a built - in audio and visual recording device
marsico described the video : " she 's running , she 's tasing him , he falls to the ground
he 's sort of writhing around on the ground a little bit , " marsico said
standing several feet behind his prone body , lisa mearkle shouts for david kassick to show his hands
despite the commands , marsico said there were multiple points in the videos where david kassick is seen reaching beneath himself , his hands obscured to lisa mearkle
holding the taser in her left hand , court documents said , lisa mearkle drew her gun in her right hand and , while continuing to shout " show me your hands , " fired twice into david kassick 's back
david kassick was pronounced dead at the scene
marsico said the video was critical in determining the first criminal charges brought against a police officer in a shooting like this in his 15 years as district attorney
" he was face down on the ground , no weapon had been displayed
he did n't approach her , he did n't come toward her , he did n't verbally threaten her in any way , " marsico said of david kassick
" it 's our position that her use of deadly force was not necessary
" cnn has filed a freedom of information act request to obtain the video , which it has not independently viewed
lisa mearkle later told investigators she thought david kassick had been reaching into his jacket for a gun , according to court documents
" what was she supposed to do ? " lisa mearkle 's attorney , perry said
" she felt that this was the only option that she had
" " keep in mind she had tased this individual four times and was screaming commands to him and he kept reaching under , " perry said
lisa mearkle was placed on electronic monitoring on tuesday after posting $ 250,000 bail
" this was an extremely difficult case for all involved but in the end , we are servants of justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented , " the hummelstown borough of hummelstown said in a statement
hummelstown borough announced on wednesday that lisa mearkle had been suspended from the police department without pay .
