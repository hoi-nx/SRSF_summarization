i would love to be able to ask myself what i was doing to myself before
' i just see a massive fat person when i 'm looking at old photos
i think , ' what an earth was i doing to myself ? ' i was not eating all day when i was big - it was only at night
it was all about convenience food and the amount i ate was huge
' i would always call at mcdonald 's after work , or a chippy or takeaway
' i would always top that up with convenience food like hot pasties and sausage rolls from bakeries and fast - food places
' from the age of 10 to 32 that pattern would continue and that 's when i was really big
i was eating about 500 takeaways a year , which over that period of time is 10,000

it was constant greggs and subway and it would be every day

' as mark gadsby is a bus driver , he felt like he had to get his food quickly and on the go
he said : ' i would use a drive - through quite a bit because i could go straight through and i did n't need to get out
' i would hide the food packaging because i did n't want people to know
i was like an alcoholic craving booze
