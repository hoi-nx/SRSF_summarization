suresh raina hit an unbeaten 110 as india defeated zimbabwe by six - wickets to ensure they finished the group stages unbeaten
earlier , brendan taylor had hit an impressive 138 in his final match for zimbabwe before moving to england to play for county side nottinghamshire as a kolpak player
however , the 29 - year - old was denied a fairytale ending by suresh raina and dohni as the reigning champions were pushed hard to ensure they kept up their winning momentum
suresh raina of india celebrates after scoring a century during india 's victory against zimbabwe on saturday suresh raina waves his bat in celebration as captain dhoni congratulates his team - mate despite being an emotional day for brendan taylor , who had spoken about his sadness at leaving the international stage , he became the first zimbabwean player ever to hit back - to - back world cup centuries
and , on a record - breaking day brendan taylor passed his mentor alistair campbell for the most one - day international hundreds scored with his eighth ton
for india , they passed their first real test as they stretched their world cup winning streak to 10 â behind only australia on 25
on a green wicket , batting first always seemed like the ideal option but having won the toss dhoni said he wanted his side to be tested and face a chase , so chose to bowl
it seemed unlikely that dhoni was going to be granted his wish as his consistently impressive trio of fast bowlers , mohammad shami , yadav and mohit , each took an early wicket to reduce zimbabwe to 33 - 3
plenty of supporters were still finding their way into eden park when a fuller yadav delivery caught the outside edge of hamilton masakadza âs bat ( 2 ) and dohni took a low catch behind the stumps
suresh raina 's unbeaten 110 earned him the player of the match trophy as india kept up 100 per cent record zimbabwe skipper brendan taylor hit an impressive 138 in his final international match six balls later chamu chibhabha ( 7 ) followed his fellow opener back into the hut as he sent a thick edge into the hand of dhawan in the slips off the bowling of shami
and when solomon mire was caught behind off mohit for a turgid nine from 22 - balls , zimbabwe looked to be buckling against the world champions
however , it arguably brought zimbabwe âs two best batsmen , brendan taylor and williams , to the crease and together they rebuilt their side âs innings
the pair shared a 93 - run fourth wicket partnership as both batsman battled against each other to reach their half - centuries first , with the chase won by captain brendan taylor
williams ( 50 ) followed suit the very next ball but then fell tamely has he attempted to whack the ball hard past bowler ashwin only to be caught sharply by the spinner
brendan taylor though was nât willing to leave the international stage without a personal milestone and he found a willing partner in craig ervine to help him to his ton
brendan taylor takes his helmet off as he celebrates his second successive century as the wicketkeeper - batsman passed 73 he became the highest zimbabwean run - maker in a world cup , surpassing neil johnson âs 367 in 1999 , finally finishing with 405 runs for the campaign
and , after reaching the all - important three figures brendan taylor exploded , smashing one jadeja over for 24 runs
however , he departed in the next over as he lofted the ball to dhawan at mid-off off mohit for an impressive 138 off 110 balls
congratulated by many of the indian players , brendan taylor walked off to a standing ovation by the 30,000 strong crowd
zimbabwe âs progress could easily have been stunted by their loss of regular wickets but their deep batting line - up continued to impress as they regularly cleared the ropes
india âs spinners , ashwin and jadeja , who were seen pre-world cup as their main bowling threat , disappeared for a collective 1 - 146 from their 20 overs
brendan taylor is congratulated by india batsman suresh raina - who would go on to win the match for the champions a quick - fire 28 from raza helped propel zimbabwe to 287 all out but india âs supposedly weak bowling line - up bowled out their sixth side in six matches
buoyed by brendan taylor âs exceptional innings zimbabwe strode confidently out on to the field after the innings break
despite panyangara âs first over going for nine runs india struggled to get the ball away early on
the pressure of tight bowling and a build - up of dot balls saw the dangerous rohit sharma ( 16 ) attempt to drive a length ball from the right - arm bowler only to be caught by a back - pedaling raza at cover
dhawan departed just four balls later as panyangara âs shattered his stumps to silence the shocked crowd , to give the bowler a double - wicket maiden
zimbabwe have conceded on average just 3.25 runs in the first powerplay , the lowest of all 14 teams , and india struggled to 35 - 2 at the end of 10 overs
dhoni embraces century - scorer suresh raina as india made it 10 wins in a row in world cup matches with their side struggling kohli and ajinkya rahane shared a 50 - run partnership before the latter was run - out as he attempted to test fielder at cover and failed
zimbabwe were all over india and reduced them 92 - 4 as kohli attempted to sweep raza round the corner and was bowled for 38
with the run - rate creeping up suresh raina and dohni continued to find it hard to get the ball away but the turning point in match came when suresh raina was dropped by hamilton masakadza on 47
it was a hugely costly error as the - 28 - year - old went on to score his hundred off just 94 balls , having hit seven fours and four sixes
and , for the ninth one - day international match of his career dhoni ( 77 not out ) ended the match by sending the ball clear past the ropes for six with eight balls remaining
admittedly it was a disappointing end for zimbabwe , who âs future once again looks unclear with the lost of one of their greatest players , whilst india âs march towards a second consecutive world cup title continues at pace .
