twisted : ingrid brewer , 53 ( left ) , was found guilty of two counts of torture after she subjected her two small , adopted children to a sequence of horrific attacks with electrical cables , pipes and a hammer
she also deprived them of food and locked them in their room at her palmdale home ( right ) while she went to work brewer was initially a foster mother to the children , but she then adopted them
her conviction has raised questions about the standards applied to vetting prospective adoptive parents in the state
the la times reported that after brewer âs arrest , it emerged that she had a history of child abuse investigations going back to 2001 , when the county 's child abuse hotline received a tip - off that she was abusing her biological children
however , social workers decided to take no further action
at the time of the adoption , brewer 's file contained at least nine investigations of alleged abuse over the previous 12 years , according to the la times
both the boy and the girl were home - schooled by their reclusive adoptive mother in the middle - class suburb of palmdale
neighbours reported that brewer was aloof and unfriendly , and one was not even aware that she had children
it was only due to the bravery of the eight - year - old boy that the torture came to light
â the brother was the one that managed to get himself out of his bedroom , â sgt. brian hudson of los angeles county 's special victims bureau told myfoxla after the children escaped in january 2013
â he managed to get his sister out of her bedroom and told her , â it 's time to go , we 've got to get out of this house
â the children , he said , who were ' tired of being tied up and beaten ' , escaped without their coats in freezing temperatures , and hid several blocks away
when brewer became aware of the disappearance she called the police , who launched a search of the area
the children were found hours later , huddled under a blanket in the street in the bitter cold
they told officers about the torture they were suffering , and brewer - who told detectives that one of the reasons she was locking the children up was because they had been stealing food - was arrested
investigators said marks and injuries on the victims â bodies were consistent with the abuse they described
the children were also apparently malnourished
in december , brewer pleaded no contest to two counts of torture , according to the los angeles county district attorney âs office
brewer has been sentenced to seven years to life
she will be eligible for parole after seven years but may spend the rest of her life in prison .
