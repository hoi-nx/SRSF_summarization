by the time falardeau read about alex , a little boy who got a battery - powered robotic arm last summer , she had made peace with her son wyatt 's limb difference
her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands
at a week old , doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand
they were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die
falardeau mourned her boy 's missing arm for years but , in time , embraced her son as he was
wyatt also learned to adapt
they tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months
" his main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store , " falardeau wrote on ireport
in truth , she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism - related delays -- the limb difference was secondary
so when a friend shared a story from the " today show " with wyatt in mind , about a team of ucf ( ucf ) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6 - year - old alex using a three - dimensional printer on campus , falardeau was defensive
" he does n't need this , " she thought
her fifth - grader had a different reaction : " i want one of these robot arms ! " falardeau remembers wyatt telling her and her husband
" i could ride a bike ! i might even be able to paddle a kayak ! " there were other things the 12 - year - old boy said he would do if he had two hands
dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading
stuff she had n't really thought about but he clearly had
falardeau got in touch with the orlando students through e-nable , an online volunteer organization started by rochester institute of technology research scientist jon schull to match people who have 3 - d printers with children in need of hands and arms
the organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at enablingthefuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $ 20 to $ 50
middle and high school student groups and girl and boy scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free
the ucf team , which operates a nonprofit called limbitless solutions , is special because it 's the only group in the 3-d volunteer network making electronic arms
most 3-d arms are mechanical , which presents a challenge for children without elbows
with mechanical arms , the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow
the students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep
" it 's really just a step - by - step process of solving problems
the first problem we solved was : how do we make the hand move electronically ? and then : how do we attach this arm to a child ? " said sophomore petresky
" it 's just one problem after another we keep solving
that 's what engineering is all about
" the centers for disease control and prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the united states are born with upper limb deformities each year
comprehensive statistics are n't available for the number of children with amputations , such as wyatt
the ucf project started when manero , an engineering doctoral student , heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-d printed hand
he got involved with e-nable and met alex , a local boy teased because of his missing arm , and set about designing a robotic replacement
they gave it to alex for free
" my mother taught us that we 're supposed to help change the world , " manero said at the time
" we 're supposed to help make it better
" the students were blown away by what happened after that
the " today show " and other national news outlets featured stories about alex and manero , and then they got international attention
families in more than 25 countries have asked the ucf students to help their children
in february , microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world
each electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble
the students use the printer in the school 's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $ 350 -- through donations
petresky got involved with the design of alex 's hand because manero knew he was good with electronics
" he bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches
i went over to his house and helped him out with electronics , " he said
" i found out he was working on an arm , and i thought that was the coolest thing in the world
" eventually manero moved to germany for a fulbright scholarship and left petresky in charge of running the operations in orlando
petresky says they ask every family about the child 's favorite color , superhero and interests , so the new limb can " not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them
" as they 've designed the bionics , they 've learned that kids do n't necessarily want to blend in
children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes , disney 's " frozen , " and in wyatt 's case , the blue - skinned men from " blue man group
" for christmas , the group upgraded alex 's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling optimus prime from " transformers
" " we quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal , and much more about expressing yourself , " petresky said
" there 's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative
" the team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including wyatt
he traveled with his mom to ucf last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close
he expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month
his mom , cynthia , was most excited about seeing wyatt being celebrated for who he is
" the adoration of college students was an affirmation that money ca n't buy
he was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself , " she wrote in her ireport
" wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children
" as they got ready to leave the campus , her son told her he ca n't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm
and someday , he said , he wants to go to ucf and help other kids like him .
