pictured together on the night brittany north and her boyfriend danny dowling met for the first time in new zealand â so i sort of woke up and went : â what are you doing , what are you doing ? â he got a fright and sort of think [ sic ] he was half asleep â went to the toilet
' woke up in the morning and went ok this is where it gets awkward
do i tell him â what do i do ? thought i 'm never gon na see this guy again
so i went â do you remember peeing in the corner last night ? â and he went â no , no i did n't â and was all embarrassed
â so went over and checked the corner and there was nothing there
went â oh i 've dreamt it , what actually happened ? â â anyway he was dropping me off home , thought i 'd get dressed
went to put on my shoes and realised he 'd peed in my shoes
i did n't actually tell him
i carried on home and threw the shoes out when i got home

she loved my story and she was disappointed by his comment
â i definitely pay my taxes
