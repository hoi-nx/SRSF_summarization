hillary may be the democratic 's presidential front - runner , but the former secretary of state 's poll numbers do n't make her look the part
her ' favorable ' rating â a measure of how many americans see her in a positive light â is now ' under water , ' meaning that she has fewer fans than detractors
a cbs poll released thursday found that just 26 per cent see her favorably , compared with 37 per cent who do n't
the rest , about one - third of those polled , have n't made up their minds
barely half of democratic , though â just 55 per cent â say they hold favorable views of her
that number is down 8 points since november 2013
across the entire voting spectrum , clinton has lost 12 points of support in the intervening 16 months
her high - water mark in the cbs poll came just two months after she took over the state department in early 2009 , when 58 per cent of americans said they liked her
but the wheels fell off shortly after she left the obama administration : when her memoir ' hard choices ' his bookshelves , her favorability number bottomed out at 24 per cent
the most recent survey , conducted march 21 - 24 , shows she 's barely rebounded since then
waiting in the wings : a deep field of republicans including wisconsin gov. scott walker ( left ) , former florida gov. jeb bush ( center ) and texas sen. ted cruz ( right ) is chomping at the bit and waiting for a chance to attack clinton there 's bad news also for clinton - backers who hope her ' email-gate ' scandal has only temporarily poisoned the public perceptions
two - thirds of those surveyed said the brewing scandal had no impact on their opinion , giving her precious little ground to make up even if the controversy fades
in addition to clinton 's use of a private , unaudited email server for all her messages while she was the obama administration 's top diplomat , she continues to be dogged by accusations that her family foundation accepted millions of dollars from foreign governments during the same timeframe
cbs pollsters did not ask whether that embarrassing news had an impact on how americans see her
but her responses to the email kerfuffle have produced mixed results
americans appear evenly divided over whether clinton 's explanations satisfied their concerns
forty - two per cent said yes , while 40 per cent said no. long memory : some part of voters ' negative impressions of mrs. hillary may harken back to her time as first lady thirty - eight per cent said they believe clinton kept the state department out of the loop on her emails principally to shield work - related communications from the public
forty - nine percent believed her claim that she did it out of ' convenience
' on balance , clinton 's biggest hurdle may be her own words , stretching back into the 1990s when she was americans 's first lady
forty - seven per cent of the people cbs polled said they do n't believe she is ' honest and trustworthy ' â 5 per cent more than the number who came down on mrs. hillary 's side
