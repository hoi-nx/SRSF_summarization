a cannabis - smoking supporter of hate preacher anjem choudary has walked free from court after grooming a 15 - year - old schoolgirl on facebook
miah sent explicit photographs to the schoolgirl before inviting her to a hotel to have sex with him
the 22 - year - old from kilburn , north west london , even filmed himself in sordid trysts and sent them to the youngster who was using her nintendo ds to access facebook
he was spared jail after a court heard how miah , who has shared several of anjem choudary 's fundamentalist tweets , struck up an online conversation about the koran
miah walked free from court after sending explicit messages to a 15 - year - old schoolgirl he was grooming over social media when she told him she was uninterested in religion miah , who worked in tesco , carried on their conversations which turned to a sexual nature despite the girl having told him how old she was
he was handed a suspended sentence of 16 months at southward crown court today
earlier the court heard how he began speaking to the girl about islam but soon forced the conversation in a sexual direction
' having talked about islam , undeterred , mr miah began to chat the complainant up , ' prosecutor requena said
' having talked about islam he proceeds to chat her up , having established her real age
' he praises her physical appearance and asks if she has a boyfriend
' the court heard how he sent her explicit photographs of himself , urging her to do the same before performing a sex act in front of her on webcam
he was arrested last year after one of the girl 's teachers told her mother of their plans to meet in a premier inn in kent
' the mother , it seems , was scared and felt her daughter was in danger when this was discovered
the 22 - year - old is a supporter of hate preacher anjem choudary having shared some of the cleric 's posts on twitter ' she describes her daughter as not that mature , which leaves her vulnerable , ' added mr requena
the youngster was said to have had her laptop confiscated after engaging in explicit conversations with men on social media before meeting miah
in a statement provided by her mother she was described as ' shy ' and and ' uncomfortable ' with new people
despite admitting to knowing the girl was underage , miah claimed that he did not target her , adding : ' she looks 20
' support : miah is a fan of islamist hate preacher anjem choudary ( above ) ' he did nât seek her out , he befriended her because she was a friend of a friend , not because she looks young , she looks 20 , ' said hi barrister edward jones said
' this was a young man confused about religious beliefs , smoking cannabis to significant degree
he has now sought to reform himself
' he made a catastrophic error of judgement which he said would not be repeated
' sentencing , judge nicholas loraine-smith said while the defendant had planned ' some sort of sexual activity ' , he was not a ' predatory paedophile '
' you have not repeated this offence , so there is no evidence you are a predatory paedophile of the type i âm afraid we often see in this court , and the fact you did n't try again allows me to accept you were remorseful for your behaviour months before the police intervened
' a suspended sentence is appropriate
' a prison sentence to mark the seriousness of what you did , and a course of treatment to ensure it does n't happen again and to protect young girls
' the judge added that if the pair had met up at the hotel or if miah had approached another girl his sentence would have been more severe
' the victim was just 15 and was young for her age , her mother said she was vulnerable and not streetwise
' you had no sexual experience
you were feeling depressed and isolated , you were smoking cannabis
' i accept you were immature for your age and once these conversations were finished you did not talk to other girls
' he also praised him for being ' helpful ' to the police , who described him as a ' different person ' from the one who had committed the offences
miah was also put on the sex offenders register and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order
