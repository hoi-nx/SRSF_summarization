the us presbyterian church has voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples after a decades long debate
the church , which accounts for just under two million members and represents the largest presbyterian denomination , made the announcement after the majority of its 171 regional governing bodies approved the change
its revised constitution will now read that marriage is ' a unique commitment between two people , traditionally a man and a woman , ' as opposed to just a man and woman previously
' there is still disagreement , and i do nât mean to minimize that , but i think we are learning that we can disagree and still be church together
' the new language , which was approved by the church 's general assembly last year , had to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies
a grouping of congregations in the state of new jersey became the 86th body to do just that tuesday
the decision is likely to drive a further wedge between presbyterian presbyterian church members , who have taken opposite sides on the issue
the church has in fact been losing some of its members as it adopts a more liberal stance on social and religious issues
that being said , the fact that some many members who were against same - sex marriage have moved on to other churches made the passage of this new definition far easier for the church
at last year 's general assembly , the church also gave its pastors a green light to marry gay and lesbian couples in states where such marriages are allowed
' these decisions have been welcomed by some and are a disappointment to others , ' gradye parsons , stated clerk of the general assembly , said at the time
the presbyterians ' position stands in sharp contrast to that of the roman catholic church , the biggest single denomination among us , and fundamentalist evangelicals who strongly oppose gay marriage
in 2011 , the presbyterian church voted to approve the ordination of openly gay and lesbian clergy
the constitution 's new wording will take effect on june 21 .
