ray davies : a complicated life by rogan the exhilarating finale of a musical called sunny afternoon currently offers one of the great nightly spectacles in north london âs so - called â theatreland â , as hundreds of mostly middle - aged punters leap or , in some cases , creak to their feet , jigging and jiving to the music of the kinks
just a few weeks ago , i was one of them , and resolved as i left to learn more about the singular life of ray davies , the band âs brilliant but melancholic frontman , who wrote such timelessly wonderful hits as waterloo sunset , you really got me , lola and , indeed , sunny afternoon
ray davies ( pictured ) is the brilliant , but sometimes melancholic , frontman of the kinks well , rogan âs monumental biography has filled all the gaps in my knowledge of one of the men who made the sixties swing ( while simultaneously lampooning the sixties with his mickey - take of carnaby street dandies , dedicated follower of fashion )
gloriously rousing though it is , the stage show hardly does justice to the enigma that is ray davies
mercurial , introspective , sometimes cruel and spectacularly , almost sociopathically , mean with money , but also sensitive , principled and capable of great kindness , ray davies is above all one of the creative geniuses of our age
those who are or have been close to him , including his brother dave and the singer chrissie hynde ( the mother of one of his four daughters ) , might not always echo the sentiment , but we are lucky to have him
ray davies was born in 1944 in muswell hill , north london , on the night of an air raid
it was a suitably explosive beginning
he was the seventh child in a boisterous , tight - knit , working - class family but , more significantly , the first son
one of the pivotal episodes in shaping his complex personality came before he was three years old , when baby david arrived , rudely undermining his status
much later , dave âs musicianship would also be central to the success of the kinks , but he was resented by ray davies from day one
indeed , david still remembers a childhood mock fight in which he thought he âd accidentally knocked his older brother unconscious
he bent over him , whispering , â are you ok ? â , only for ray davies to spring up and punch him hard in the face
â i felt the pleasure that i âd knocked him over , then concern that i âd hurt him , â says dave now , â but all he really wanted was to get back at me
it âs symbolic of our whole relationship , really
â while dave grew up happy and outgoing , ray davies was troubled and solitary and was even sent to a child therapist , which ca nât have been usual in working - class north london during the fifties
the sudden death of much - loved older sister rene compounded his torment
but he found refuge in music , especially in the records of the american blues singer big bill broonzy , a discovery he credits with changing his life
with dave , and schoolfriends pete quaife and john start , he formed the ray davies quartet
he auditioned a cocky boy from the year below him at william grimshaw secondary modern , but the lad âs voice was so raspy that start âs mother would nât let them rehearse in her house
while young stewart forged his own path towards superstardom , the ray davies quartet , shedding start and adding drummer avory , mutated into the boll-weevils , the ravens and , finally , the kinks
pop group ' the kinks ' ( pictured in 1964 ) left to right : pete quaife , ray davies , avory and dave davies there are various contradictory explanations for the famous name , but the best guess is simply that â kinky â was a fashionable adjective in the early sixties
rogan implies that inspiration may even have struck thanks to a mail cartoon of a girl praying beside her bed , captioned : â all i want for christmas is a beatles , failing that , a pair of kinky boots
â similarly uncertain are the precise origins of the kinks âs first hit , you really got me , in the summer of 1964
but it reached number one and made ray davies a star
not that success tempered his extraordinary tight - fistedness
he would habitually hold open pub doors for his bandmates to enter â not out of politeness , but to ensure he was last to the bar
and the band âs manager , larry page , was present on the day ray davies âs first wife , rasa , who he âd met when she was a schoolgirl attending one of their gigs , pleaded with him , â ray , what about that coat ? â he replied , â no , you ca nât have it
it âs a lot of money
â she continued begging him , pointing out how bitterly cold it was outside , until finally he relented , and told their driver to take them to sketchley âs
she was nât asking for a new coat
he just had nât wanted to pay the dry - cleaning bill
the ray davies quartet , mutated into the boll-weevils , the ravens and , finally , the kinks ( pictured in 1964 ) ray davies âs parsimony is one of the reasons why the story of the kinks is a tale of epic in - fighting , as well as marvellous music
but only one of the reasons
besides , he was merely a spectator at their most notorious scrap when , during a show in cardiff in 1965 , his brother dave spat at avory , and avory hit dave with a cymbal so hard that many there thought they âd witnessed a murder
four decades later , ray davies himself was almost the victim of a murder , when he was shot in new orleans while chasing a mugger who âd stolen his then - girlfriend âs handbag
it was yet another traumatic incident in what has been , to quote this book âs barely adequate sub-title , a complicated life
but shining through the violence , the personality clashes , the litigation with former management , the volatile relationships with women , even a mental breakdown , are the songs â none of them more enduringly haunting than waterloo sunset
ray davies ( far left ) wrote timelessly wonderful hits such as waterloo sunset , you really got me , lola and sunny afternoon his voice might not be what it was , but ray davies was the perfect choice , and it was the perfect song , to close the london olympics three years ago
yet this book reveals it was , at first , tentatively titled liverpool sunset , and he intended it to represent the death of merseybeat , which he felt was presaged by the beatles moving away from their roots and buying big houses in surrey and st john âs wood
that was nât for ray davies
he stayed in or near muswell hill and he âs still there now , with wispier hair but the same familiar , gap - toothed smile , which we might never have known had he had his teeth capped one afternoon in 1964
he was actually sitting in the dentist âs chair , the drill whirring , when he leapt up and left the room
if he was going to make it , he told himself , it would be through his songwriting , not his looks
it was a firm statement of artistic intent and still â the most important decision i âve ever made â , insists the man who , happily for us , has never been a dedicated follower of anyone âs fashion but his own .
