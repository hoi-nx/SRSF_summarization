it 's the perfect home for those who never want to grow up
the ultimate wooden treehouse has now been unveiled in turin , italian , in the style of a ' living forest '
architect luciano pia said he wanted his ' 25 shades of green ' project to combine the childhood dreams of owning a treehouse with the modern practicalities of living in a city
mr luciano pia said he wanted to create an outdoor feel for the building , which has been three years in the making
' i wanted to give people the chance to escape having to look all the time at turin 's urban sprawl and to create a multi-storey natural alternative ' , he said
the seasonal progression of the 150 trees planted around the property create a ' microclimate ' within the building , steadying extreme temperatures during the winter and summer months
each species of plants was chosen carefully to make sure there was a rich variety of colour and blossom depending on the time of year , and in total the trees are capable of absorbing close to 200,000 litres of carbon dioxide an hour
stand out : the striking development has its own ' microclimate ' inside , thanks to the trees planted around the project is also very environmentally friendly , making use of the latest developments in technology with heating and cooling systems that utilise geothermal energy with heat pumps , and rainwater is collected and ' recycled ' to water the green
mr luciano pia added : ' this natural absorption brings pollution protection only to residents , but in the city is also helping to eliminate harmful gasses caused by cars
bright : the metal structures are designed to look like trees , which ' grow ' from the groundfloor to the roof ' i also placed the trees so that they can to a certain extent absorb some of the harsh sounds from the bustling streets outside
' ' the plants ' full foliage blocks rays of sun during the summer while letting in warm light during the winter
' the building has 63 flats each benefiting from the terraces and vegetation just beyond their windows and walls
' outside : architect luciano pia said while the wood filters the light in summer , in winter they allow light to filter into the house grand : natural wood is used throughout the property , creating a rustic feel
