pardew has called for more consistent punishments after crystal palace captain mile jedinak was retrospectively banned for four matches
video footage showed the 30 - year - old to have elbowed west ham striker diafra sakho towards the end of the crystal palace ' 3 - 1 win at upton park on saturday
mile jedinak was charged with violent conduct by the fa - a decision which irked manager pardew , although the australia international accepted it
pardew is n't happy with the fa after their decision to ban mile jedinak for his elbow on diafra sakho the midfielder missed the crystal palace ' late 1 - 0 defeat at southampton as a result and will also sit out the upcoming premier league matches against qpr , stoke and manchester city
' well , you kind of know as a manager that ( given ) the way it was sort of damned on tv that something was going to happen and that 's where we are , ' pardew said
' we have n't appealed so we will take the decision , but we want some consistency in it
the crystal palace captain ( 15 ) caught diafra sakho with his elbow during their win over west ham at upton park although the officials did n't see the incident , the tv cameras did and mile jedinak was condemned by the pundits ' i could name three or four incidents this year where crystal palace should have had a player sent off against them retrospectively
' but it was n't highlighted by the media and therefore it went under the radar , so to speak
' asked another question on the subject , pardew retorted : ' i do n't want to go any further
i 've said my point on that
