when you have so many rumours maybe one of those rumours can be true or not
' if you are asking me if i feel i will be sacked if i do n't win against barcelona , i can answer you no. i 'm sure i am not going to be sacked
' i understand that maybe in the media you have an allegation of what the owners of this club are
i think they do n't think or do n't believe we are going to win the champions league now
' i do n't think they think that the project is ready
if you are eliminated , it is because we saw a very good barcelona , better than our team , and not because we 've seen a poor city team
' speaking after the game , pellegrini added : â maybe it was not our best year to continue in europe
' we 've had important restrictions about amount of players , amount of money that we can spend , so it was a difficult year for us
