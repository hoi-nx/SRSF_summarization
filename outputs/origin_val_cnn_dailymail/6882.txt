a french marketing campaign by nutella has backfired after banning the word ' lesbian ' ( file picture ) the nutella website says : ' here you can create your custom messages and share them with those you love
' but users realised that there is a long list of words banned , which bizarrely does not allow ' lesbian ' but permits the word ' gay '
the word ' christian ' can also be written on the jars , but other religious terms such as ' jewish ' and ' muslim ' have been banned by nutella , pink news reported
the ' say it with nutella ' campaign allowed customers to have a name or message written on a jar of the chocolate spread health - related terms , presumably in case any one tried to blame the hazelnut spread on obesity , have also been banned , including the words ' cancer ' and ' diabetes '
the company , owned by ferrero , has also outlawed words which could be used to highlight their controversial ingredient palm oil , the farming of which allegedly destroys the habitats of orangutans
this may explain why ' boycott ' and ' orangutan ' make the long list of banned words
ferrero said in a statement : ' by giving customers the opportunity to personalise their nutella jar we want to create a way for them to share enthusiasm for the brand
' negative or insulting terms were directly removed from the options field
similarly , terms of communities that are often subject to attacks by malicious people were removed from the possibilities
' the news comes just a day after it emerged that marks & spencer had banned the words ' christ ' and ' jesus christ ' from being allowed on messages sent with bouquets of flowers
the policy emerged earlier after a customer was stopped from buying a Â£ 35 bouquet for a funeral because she said in the gift message that it was from a family in ' christ church teddington '
lord carey , a former archbishop of canterbury , said : ' if christ becomes an offensive word in a christian land then all of us should be alarmed
