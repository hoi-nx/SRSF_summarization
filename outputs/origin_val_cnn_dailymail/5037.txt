cerebral palsy sufferer sophie thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk â thanks to daily mail readers she was turned down for life - changing surgery on the nhs
but cerebral palsy sufferer sophie thomlinson will finally have the operation which will enable her to walk â thanks to daily mail readers
the three - year - old was denied nhs funding last year for the surgery at the same leeds hospital trust which gave aspiring glamour model josie cunningham breast enlargements
and even when readers raised Â£ 55,000 to pay for sophie thomlinson âs surgery her family were told by nhs doctors she was â not disabled enough â to qualify â despite not being able to walk
but the toddler has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon dr tae park in the us this autumn
it means that , by the time she is four , sophie thomlinson could be walking
sophie thomlinson was born prematurely with spastic diplegia â a form of cerebral palsy
she needs the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery , which involves cutting the nerves in her spine , to be able to walk freely
sophie thomlinson has strengthened her legs ahead of the operation using a specially - adapted Â£ 1,200 bicycle bought from readers â donations
doctors said this means she is an â ideal candidate â for the surgery and is likely to be able to walk completely unaided afterwards
sophie thomlinson âs mother allison , 41 , a nurse , said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved
she said : â sophie thomlinson wiped my face and she said â mummy why are you crying ? â i told her she was going to be able to walk and she said â yes ! â
â by the time she is four she could be walking
it âs very , very emotional , we just ca nât believe it
â it is frustrating that leeds turned us down but now we know that sophie thomlinson is going to have the best surgeon , so that is more reassuring
if anything goes wrong at least we know we did everything we could for her
â as it gets nearer i âm sure the nerves will kick in - it âs a big operation
but it âs what she needs and it âs the best thing for her
â sophie thomlinson understands now that she is going to walk
she knows dr park will â fix her legs â and she knows she is going on a big plane to get there
â the three - year - old was denied nhs funding last year for the surgery , but she has now been approved to have the procedure carried out by pioneering surgeon dr tae park in the us sophie thomlinson âs mother allison , 41 , a nurse , said she burst into tears when they got the news she had been approved
she said : â if it was nât for the daily mail we would nât be where we are now ' mrs sophie thomlinson said sophie thomlinson had progressed to standing up on her own since using the bike bought from readers â funds , which meant doctors had told her they were â confident â she would be able to walk after surgery
she added : â if it was nât for the daily mail we would nât be where we are now , we just ca nât thank everyone enough
â the messages we âve had are so encouraging and we âre keeping them all for sophie thomlinson in a memory box for when she âs older
â she and husband craig , 45 , from dukinfield , greater manchester , are continuing to fundraise to get to their target of Â£ 75,000 which will cover their flights to the us and sophie thomlinson âs therapy and equipment she will need after surgery
the family are fundraising through the charity tree of hope and any excess will go towards helping other disabled children .
