when it comes to shaving , boys are normally taught the art by their fathers or older brothers
but this means bad habits can also be passed down through generations
now a principal scientist from gillette has revealed the science behind shaving including how hairs behave , why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never , ever tap your razor on the sink
she also settles the debate about whether you should go with , or against the grain
when dry , the hair is around 130 microns in diameter ( left ) but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns
washing the face before a shave increases the surface area the blades can cut through said gillette principal scientist kristina vanoosthuyze dr kristina vanoosthuyze has worked in the gillette shaving technology area at the innovation centre in reading for the past nine years
every morning 80 volunteers visit the centre and shave in front of a filming rig that combines magnifying lenses , high - speed cameras and special high - intensity lighting
this has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair , and in the case of multiple - blade models , the first blade pulls the hair up , the second cuts it , the third blade acts in a similar way to the first , and so on
in some of their products , gillette also offers a vibrate function that further lifts the hair and reduces the friction caused by the blades
this footage has also revealed the differences between dry and hydrated skin and beard hair
every day 80 volunteers shave in front of a rig that combines magnifying lenses and high - speed cameras
this has revealed how the blade cuts through the hair
in the case of multiple - blade models , the first blade pulls the hair up , the second cuts it , the third blade pulls and so on when hydrated , skin is also tighter ( an image of the skin is shown before washing left and after washing right )
this exposes more of the hair 's surface area to the blade
as a result dr kristina vanoosthuyze recommends showering before shaving - and not the other way round this image is a microscopic image of cut hairs on dehydrated skin
dry hair can have the strength of copper wire and when hair and skin hydrates it swells and makes the hair easier to cut
additionally , the lubricating ingredients in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin , improving glide beard hairs are , on average , a tenth of a millimetre in diameter
when dry , the hair is around 130 microns but when hydrated this expands to almost 150 microns
this increases the surface area that the blades can cut through , and when hydrated , skin is plumper , which reveals more of the hair
before the shave , hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser : this softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it
apply plenty of shave gel : this provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother , more comfortable shave
shave with a multi-blade razor using light strokes : gillette said the razor should do the work , not the person shaving
change direction : begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain
make sure blades are not old or dull : the lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard
as a general rule if the razor begins to drag or does n't cut as closely as before , replace the blades
use aftershave : this can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin
many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection
as a result it makes more sense to shower before shaving and not the other way round
' allowing water to penetrate the hair is key for a comfortable and close shave because dry hair is difficult to cut , ' explained dr kristina vanoosthuyze
' in fact , dry hair can have the strength of copper wire
when hair hydrates , it swells and becomes easier to cut
' so , men should wash the face and neck with a mild cleanser before the shave
or at least take a shower before the shave and not the other way around
' additionally , the lubricating ingredients formulated in a shaving gel reduce friction between blade and skin , improving razor glide for a more comfortable shaving experience
' scanning electron microscopy also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek , neck and chin , for example
on the cheek these hairs resemble the shape of an egg , while on the chin they are wider on the underside than the top
the hairs of the neck look similar to those on the chin but are thicker and more robust
the skin on the cheek is also flatter than the raised bumps on the neck
this suggest that shaving in one direction on the cheek may not have the same affect when used on the neck , for example
however , dr kristina vanoosthuyze revealed that shaving in the direction of the hair is often the best place to start
' it is difficult to give a simple , straightforward answer , because the comfort of the shave - or lack of irritation - is dependent on so many more factors than simply the direction of the shaving stroke , ' she told mailonline at the launch of gillette 's proglide with flexball technology razor
' our data has shown that men who shave with proglide against the grain rated the product as high for ' gives a comfortable shave ' as those men who shaved with the grain and / or in both directions
' scanning electron microscopy also highlights how hairs and follicles differ on the cheek , neck and chin ( pictured )
on the cheek these hairs resemble the shape of an egg , while on the chin they are wider on the underside than the top
the hairs of the neck look similar to those on the chin but are thicker and more robust the skin on the cheek is also flatter than the raised bumps on the neck ( pictured )
dr kristina vanoosthuyze said : ' as a general rule , most men find shaving first in the direction of the hair growth and then following up with upstrokes provides the closest , smoothest shave with good skin comfort ' but she continued that a man 's facial hair tends to grow in different directions , so even if he thinks he shaves with the grain , some hairs will still unknowingly be cut against the grain
' as a general rule , i would say that most men find using light strokes and shaving first in the direction of the hair growth and then following up with upstrokes provides the closest , smoothest shave with good skin comfort
' and when it comes on what not to do , dr kristina vanoosthuyze said that some men place as much as 3.3lbs ( 1.5kg ) of force on the blade
' the closeness of the shave is largely determined by the quality and design of the razor , not by how hard you press , ' she added
' the best way for a close , comfortable shave is to use gentle strokes
the razor should do the work , not you
' dr kristina vanoosthuyze also explained that under no circumstances should a person tap their razor on the side of the sink
tapping the razor causes the precision blades to misalign which affects the cutting quality , but also how long the blades will last
this image shows the angle a blade takes on a typical cheek hair she also explained that under no circumstances should you tap the razor on the side of the sink
tapping the razor causes the precision blades to misalign which affects the cutting quality , but also how long the blades will last
' at the end of the shave , just rinse the razor thoroughly with water and shake off excess water before storing , ' dr kristina vanoosthuyze
and after the shave , dr kristina vanoosthuyze recommends using a moisturising lotion
' a good moisturiser will leave the skin soft and smooth and help to maintain the skin 's natural moisture barrier
' many aftershaves also contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection
this is what causes them to sting .
