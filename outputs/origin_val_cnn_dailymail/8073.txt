suspended hundreds of feet in the air amid glistening pillars of ice illuminated with ghostly lights from below , this could easily be a computer - generated scene from the latest sci - fi blockbuster movie
but in fact these ethereal photographs were taken in real life , and show extreme sportsman and climber stephan siegrist , 43 , ascending the voringsfossen icefall which is part of a gigantic glacier in eidfjord , norway
the stunning images were captured by fellow mountaineer and photographer thomas senf
while the 500ft frozen waterfall is regularly scaled by climbers during daylight , he said he wanted to capture the beauty of the falls by night
with bright lights illuminating his efforts from below , mr stephan siegrist appears to be on the set of a sci - fi movie stunning : mr stephan siegrist ( pictured ) trained as an apprentice carpenter before falling in love with mountaineering during a ski trip as a teenager
he gave up woodwork aged 26 , and has earned his living from climbing ever since he said : ' photography and filming at night is a big challenge because of the lighting
the ways to play with the factors of light , time and environment fascinate me endlessly
' i had considered for a long time how to work with artificial light , which is normally only possible in a photo studio , in major mountains
' the transparency and reflective properties of ice in the sun had often caught my eye
with its virtually unlimited number of icefalls , norway seemed like the perfect place to put those ideas into practice
' climber mr stephan siegrist was born in meikirch , switzerland , near to bern , which is within sight of the northern alps
while he trained as a carpenter , he fell in love with mountaineering after a skiing trip as a teenager
out of this world : mr thomas senf ( pictured bottom right in both images ) was primarily a climber in the early stages of his career , but began to incorporate photography into his adventures , and took these images during one trip in 2012 frozen solid : for a large part of the year the voringsfossen icefall is liquid , but during the winter months the bitterly cold air freezes it solid , allowing climbers to attempt to scale it aged 26 he gave up woodwork , became a professional mountain guide , and has made a living from climbing ever since
over the course of a near 20 - year career he has racked up hundreds of climbing hours , making first ascents on all seven continents
as well as ice climbing , as demonstrated in these photographs , he also specialises in big - wall climbing - scaling sheer rock faces that usually require more than one day to ascend - and bouldering - climbing without the use of safety harnesses or ropes
meanwhile photographer mr thomas senf qualified in mechanical engineering , but moved to switzerland aged 21 to pursue his passion for mountaineering
adventurer : mr thomas senf , who took an expedition to the icefall with mr stephan siegrist in order to photograph it , is pictured left , and right during a climb starting out purely as a climber , he and a group of friends made two first ascents of peaks in the himalayas , before he began incorporating photography into his adventures
he captured these stunning images of mr stephan siegrist during a trip to norway in 2012
he added : ' during the summer months , water tumbles from the cliff tops
come winter , this majestic landscape is transformed as the waters are suspended mid-flow creating icefalls
' climbers frequently scale them during daylight hours , but we wanted to capture their full beauty and colour at night
