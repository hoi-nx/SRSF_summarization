there was something unwholesome about the way fabregas â romance with barcelona ended
perhaps breaking such a bond required a greater explanation , hence the story on the club âs website last summer that was really quite damning and unique in its detail
the post read : â despite glowing starts to each campaign , fabregas âs contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close
â from being someone who joined in with the attack , supplying and scoring goals , the magic tended to fade later on in each season
he only scored one , six and one goals in the last 24 games of each season
fabregas ( left ) has a history of going quiet during the second half of the season in terms of goals â for some reason , he was never as good in the second half of a season as in the first
â to apply some context , such statements usually run to a confirmation that a player has left
if a club is feeling particularly venomous , it might omit the part where a player is thanked for his contribution
maybe the close relationship with fabregas , the prodigal son who returned and then left for again , meant they felt compelled to explain the step of letting him join chelsea for Â£ 30million
the talented playmaker had a blistering start to the season and has racked up 15 assists despite his slump but whatever the motive , there was a deep and intriguing point in the message
barcelona had spotted a real trend and the rational among chelsea âs fans are probably starting to see it
that âs not to overreact and criticise a player who has arguably had the greatest impact on chelsea âs title push
fabregas has been magnificent , a deep - lying playmaker ( usually ) who has the engine to roam , the sense to dictate tempo and the guile to create
first half v second half of the season 09 - 10 : 19 v 9 10 - 11 : 9 v 5 11 - 12 : 13 v 4 13 - 14 : 16 v 5 14 - 15 : 15 v 2 his number of assists is astonishing â 15 in the premier league , which is seven more than his next domestic rival
alongside nemanja matic , chelsea have a legitimately world - class midfield platform
but on wednesday night fabregas looked flat
a subjective view , certainly , but the numbers are showing the return of a curious pattern
he has neither scored nor assisted in his past nine games in all competitions , seven of which were starts
his last assist was against swansea on january 17
his previous longest run without a goal or assist this season was two
the former barcelona man suffered the fate at barcelona during his time there before he was sold to chelsea that is not to say he is playing badly in this spell
he was poor when he came on against bradford in the fa cup and was off the pace in the league game against burnley , but generally has been among chelsea âs best performers
and yet the incision is not what it was
looking at league figures alone , he managed 15 goals or assists in the first half of the season and has so far scored or created only two in the second half
it is a trend that goes back all the way to the 2009 - 10 season , fabregas âs penultimate campaign at arsenal , when his respective figures were 19 and nine
in 2010 - 11 they were nine and five and in 2011 - 12 , his first back at barcelona , he scored or created 13 in the first half of the season and four on the stretch
fabregas clashes with blaise matuidi during a night of frustration in the champions league in london last season , it was even more pronounced â 16 going out and five coming back in
it is a mystery , not least because it would be unfair to conclude he is in poor form
but he is less incisive , regardless of whether it is for individual or team reasons
certainly , his role within the side has tended to change at times recently , with jose mourinho occasionally switching between 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 and 4 - 3 - 3
and there has also been a more restrained manner in how the team is playing , perhaps because there is a greater emphasis on protecting what they have in the league rather chasing a bigger advantage
in any case , the numbers make interesting reading for the player
he certainly wo nât thank barcelona for flagging it up
the spanish international is setting a trend and began to show signs of flagging during his time at arsenal
