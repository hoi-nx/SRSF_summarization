the new head of the secret service has admitted he has agents with a drinking problem after two were accused of crashing their car while drunk at the white house
clancy , newly - installed director of the agency , made the admission in a stormy session in front of congress as he tried to get their approval to build a replica white house for agents to practice protecting the president
he was told his answers were ' hogwash ' , berated for the string of failures by the secret service , and when he said he had to build the ' trust ' of his employees , told bluntly by republican chris stewart : ' dude , you do n't have to earn their trust
you 're their boss ! ' clancy also admitted he did not know about the crash for five days , and said the two staff were still being fully paid and had not yet been disciplined , although they were on administrative rather than active duty
the hearing itself was to be an exploration of clancy 's budget request for the 2016 fiscal year - including the $ 8 million he is asking for to build a scale replica white house
but ' the 800 - pound gorilla in the room , ' as homeland security subcommittee chairman rep. carter said , was ' what happened the other night at the white house
on - duty officers at the scene , according to the washington post , wanted to arrest the agents and administer sobriety tests , but a supervisor overruled them and allowed the suspects to go home
worse , they appeared to have driven over a ' suspicious package ' that their fellow agents were in the process of investigating
clancy , it emerged on tuesday , was only told of the incident five days later
he said ' there will be accountability '
he promised new ' ethics training ' and said he had moved the accused officers to ' non-supervisory ' desk duty , but with ' no financial penalties ' such as a salary reduction or a suspension without pay
' it 's going to take time , perhaps , to change this culture , ' he said , referring to a fast - and - loose attitude inside the agency he inherited after former director julia pierson resigned last year
he said the secret service has a rule prohibiting the consumption of alcohol ' 10 hours before your duty assignment
' but ' we do n't have protocols for off - hours ' activities , ' he added
' there 's an element within our agency that does cope with stresses ... by using alcohol , ' clancy said , noting that the agency recently launched an initiative to address stress
' we 've got to find a way to help some of these people that are going toward alcohol as a coping mechanism
' porous border ? an early march off - duty party led to an incident where the agents drove through an active crime - scene investigation and crashed through a white house barrier panel members were impatient when clancy insisted he had to wait to impose discipline until his agency 's inspector general competed its own investigation
carter , a texas republican , insisted that he ' terminate ' them ' as punishment
... we 'll be watching
' ' i do n't care about the office of inspector general , ' he barked
' god love them and good luck to them
' ' i 'm disappointed that you have not waged your own vigorous , tough investigation , ' carter lectured him
' to say you 're not investigating because you want the ig of the department to investigate is hogwash
what do you think ? ' clancy suggested he had to earn agents ' trust as the new director of the agency , earning a scathing response from carter
' dude , you do n't have to earn their trust
you 're their boss ! ' he said
clancy , visibly agitated and stammering , was easy pickings
' i 'm very frustrated that we did n't know about this , that i did n't know about this
i 'm frustrated that we ca n't act until we know all the facts , ' he said
' i just do n't want to act improperly too soon
let me say this : the president , the first lady , they 're safe
we 've moved these individuals to administrative positions
' secure ? the secret service has come under fire after a series of embarrassing incidents that call into question its performance protecting the white house and the first famil grilled : clancy insisted that the allegedly drunk - driving officers have been moved to desk duty , but congressmen want them fired clancy 's budget request included $ 8 million to build a scale model of the white house in a maryland suburb for training purposes , in the hope that other institutional face - palm moments might not repeat themselves
in the last year a series of fence jumpers have made it onto white house grounds , including one who breached the building itself while carrying a knife in his pocket
and it took the secret service four days to determine that a rifleman had struck the presidential residence
' the secret service currently uses a rudimentary , not - to - scale simulation of the north grounds of the white house , using bike barricades to act as the fencing , ' clancy said
' there are no structures , vehicle gates , lighting or other aids to enhance the training simulations
' the carbon copy of america 's presidential mansion , if congress approves , would be built in beltsville , maryland , about 20 miles from the real white house , on 500 acres that already serve as a secret service training site
kentucky hal rogers rep. hal rogers suggested congress will take a trust - but - verify approach to giving clancy what he 's asking for
' we 're going to provide adequate funding for your agency , ' he said
' but it 's going to be on a short string
