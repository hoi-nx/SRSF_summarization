photos of u.s. ambassador to south koreans lippert meeting with the country 's leaders have emerged for the first time since the envoy was attacked by a knife - wielding pro-north north korea activist
lippert is recovering at severance hospital in seoul , and was able to meet with us navy admiral james winnefeld as well as members of south koreans 's ruling and opposition parties
police are charging the activist , kim , 55 , with murder after he slashed the ambassador while screaming demands for north korea reunification
the attack thursday on lippert , at a forum about reunification , prompted rival north korea to gloat about ' knife slashes of justice , ' that left deep gashes and damaged the ambassador 's tendons and nerves
lippert , 42 , is recovering well but has complained of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage , severance hospital official yoon do-heum said in a televised briefing
doctors will remove the 80 stiches on lippert 's face on monday or tuesday and say he could be out of the hospital on wednesday
hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months
police , meanwhile , searched the offices of the suspect for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved kim was detained on friday and police seized 30 copies of books and print materials from his home , some of which were pro-north south koreans , according to yonhap news
dumbfounded : kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on lippert on thursday morning , which left the ambassador covered in blood taken by surprise : injured ambassador lippert is seen leaving the performing arts center where he was slashed by kim thursday morning suspect : police are seeking an attempted murder charge against kim , who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for north korea reunification having material in support of pyongyang is not illegal , but distributing material propagandizing the isolated communist regime is banned in the south koreans
authorities plan on charging kim with attempted murder , violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction
a further charge of violating south koreans 's national security law , which bans south koreans from publicly sympathizing with the north korea government , was being considered
the anti-us activist has denied that he intended to kill lippert
as part of their investigation they have also requested kim 's past travels to north korea â seven times between 1999 and 2007 â during a previous era of inter-korean cooperation , when seoul was ruled by a liberal government
kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former north korea leader kim jong il after his death in december 2011 , police said
while the north seemed to praise the attacks in its previous comments , its committee for the peaceful reunification of korea said sunday that linking the slashing to its government was part of an ' anti-dprk smear campaign '
in custody : the 55 - year - old kim reportedly attacked lippert before he gave a speech at a breakfast meeting
above , the anti-us demonstrator being taken into custody on thursday aftermath : lippert appeared on thursday wrapped in a neck bandage after being treated for his injuries , which include slashing wounds and nerve damage kim , who has a long history of anti-us protests , said he acted alone in the attack on lippert
he told police it was meant as a protest of annual u.s. - south koreans military drills that started monday â exercises that the north has long maintained are preparations for an invasion
kim said the drills , which seoul and washington say are purely defensive , ruined efforts for reconciliation between the koreas , according to police officials
while most south koreans look at the u.s. presence favorably , u.s. infuriates some leftists because of its role in south koreans 's turbulent modern history
washington , which backed the south koreans during the 1950 - 53 korean war against the communist north , still stations 28,500 troops on the peninsula , and anti- u.s. activists see the annual military drills with seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified south koreans
' south koreans and north korea should be reunified , ' kim shouted as he slashed lippert with a 10 - inch knife , police and witnesses said

kim is well - known among police and activists as one of a hard - core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes
police did n't consider the possibility that kim , who has ties to the korean council for reconciliation and cooperation would show up for the group 's breakfast meeting , according to a seoul police official who did n't want to be named , citing office rules
outspoken : kim reportedly has a history of public outbursts
pictured above in an undated file photo from a prior protest u.s. ambassadors have security details , but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post
seoul is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the north korea border
it 's not clear how many guards lippert had , but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the middle east
seoul 's foreign ministry said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern south koreans had been injured in a violent attack
however , the japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when kim threw a piece of concrete at him , according to police
kim , who was protesting japanese 's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by south koreans , hit the ambassador 's secretary instead , media reports said , and was sentenced to a three - year suspended prison term over the attack
the website of the woorimadang activist group that kim heads describes the group 's long history of anti- u.s. protests
photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the u.s. embassy in seoul to protest the u.s. - south koreans military drills , which are to run until the end of april
north korea 's state - controlled media crowed thursday that kim 's attack reflected the south koreans people 's protests against the u.s. for driving the korean peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills
u.s. secretary of state john kerry , in saudi arabia for meetings with regional leaders , said the u.s. ' will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any u.s. diplomats

the protection of foreign dignitaries and embassies is customarily the responsibility of the host country activists in seoul , meanwhile , expressed worries that the attack on lippert would harm the public image of peaceful protesters , or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities
small to medium - sized demonstrations regularly occur across seoul , and most are peaceful
but scuffles with police do break out occasionally , and the burning of effigies of north korea and japanese leaders is also common
some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers , thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self - immolate
lippert became ambassador last october and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in seoul
he 's regularly seen walking his basset hound , grigsby , near his residence , not far from where the attack happened
his wife gave birth in south koreans and the couple gave their son a north korea middle name
an elderly man offered dog meat to the recovering ambassador , but it was rejected because of hospital safety rules
canine meat is thought to help heal wounds and is commonly offered to surgery patients
while south koreans is one of the u.s. 's closest asian allies , u.s. has been partially blamed for the severing of south koreans into two countries
in 1910 , the japanese empire took control of unified south koreans which they ruled as a colony through the end of world war ii. when the empire fell in 1945 , it was decided in a united nations agreement that south koreans be split in half at the 38th parallel
the u.s. established a trusteeship in the south while the soviet took over in the north , leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries
above , u.s. troops board a boat bound for south koreans at the onset of the korean war in 1950 however , both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified south koreans
cold war tensions between the u.s. and soviet only fueled these ambitions , and in 1950 the north korea army invaded the south backed by chinese and soviet soldiers
while the south koreans nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle , the u.s. helped booster their forces and retake their land
the fighting was disasterous for both countries , which eventually agreed to an armistance in july 1953
since the korean war is technically ongoing , the u.s. keeps troops in south koreans at the ready
however , the strong u.s. military presence in south koreans has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the west
still , south koreans remains one of the most pro-american populations in the world
according to a 2013 poll , 77 per cent of south koreans surveyed said they approved of president obama 's leadership .
