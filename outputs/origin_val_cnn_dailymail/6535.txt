i want to make it clear that i 'm not racist and it was directed personally to you , but to the characterization of the artist , that left a lot to be desired
the clip in full context is proof
i feel embarrased , i ask for forgiveness , because there is no excuse for a professional like me to make those types of comments that can be interpreted as offensive and racist in a volatile moment that we live in our country
i take responsibility for this lack of judgement in my part , but i ca n't accept that i am being called a racist and being fired for that reason and being humiliated by univision after working there for 17 years
i come from a bi-racial latin family , with family members , like my father , who is afro-latino
i am the first presenter on hispanic tv that is openly gay and i am an activist for causes that favor minorities , that have been discriminated against just like me
i openly voted twice for your husband barack obama , because i consider him a great man that respects minorities , like me , in this country
i worked on two univision shows where i commented about celebrity style , including the real family and latin first ladies and i have never offended anybody because of their skin color , sexual orientation or nationality
i am a decent person , but a human in the end that makes mistakes like this one
although the comment was unpleasant and out of line i do not deserved being called a racist and i have to defend myself for respect and love to my family , my father , my fans and my community
i was notified verbally that due to a complaint from your office i was fired
an information leak from univision executives , i was condemend in social media , trying to destroy my career in an unfair manner , without letting me know personally and without an investigation that would allow to clear up the situation
again , i offer my humble forgiveness for the misinterpreation and i assume the responsibility
