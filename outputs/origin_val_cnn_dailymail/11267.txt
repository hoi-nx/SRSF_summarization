the supreme court is weighing a free - speech challenge to texas 's refusal to issue a license plate bearing the confederacy battle flag
specialty plates are big business in texas , where drivers spent $ 17.6million last year to choose from among more than 350 messages the state allows
the state 's department of motor vehicles says nearly 877,000 vehicles among more than 19million cars , pickup trucks and motorcycles registered in texas carry a specialty plate
but a state motor vehicle board turned down a request by the texas division of the sons of confederate veterans for a license plate with its logo bearing the battle flag , similar to plates issued by eight other states that were members of the confederacy , as well as maryland

the supreme court will weigh a free - speech challenge to texas 's decision to refuse to issue a license plate bearing the confederacy battle flag the justices are hearing arguments on monday over whether the state violated the group 's first amendment rights
texas commemorates the confederacy in many ways , but it says that putting the battle flag on license plates would offend many texans who believe the flag is a racially charged symbol of repression

the first amendment dispute has brought together some unlikely allies , including the aclu , anti-abortion groups , americans united for separation of church and state , civil libertarian hentoff and conservative satirist o'rourke
' in a free society , offensive speech should not just be tolerated , its regular presence should be celebrated as a symbol of democratic health â however odorous the products of a democracy may be , ' hentoff , o'rourke and others said in a brief backing the group
sons of the confederacy veterans claim that texas is violating the group 's first amendment right of freedom of speech by not allowing them to have their logo , bearing the battle flag , on license places ( file photo ) the case could be important for how the supreme court determines whether the speech at issue belongs to private individuals or the government
texas 's main argument to the supreme court is that the license plate is not like a bumper sticker slapped on the car by its driver
instead , the state said license plates are government property , and so what appears on them is not private individuals ' speech but the government 's
the first amendment applies when governments try to regulate the speech of others , but not when governments are doing the talking
sons of confederate veterans claim on the group 's website that it ' is preserving the history and legacy of these heroes so that future generations can understand the motives that animated the southern cause ' even if the court disagrees that license plates are government speech , the state said its rejection of the sons of confederate veterans license plate was not discriminatory
the motor vehicle board had not approved a plate denigrating the confederacy or the battle flag so it could not be accused of giving voice to one viewpoint while suppressing another , the state said
the aclu suggested the court view license plates as a mix of private and government speech
for example , drivers who seek a personal touch and buy the specialized plates know the government has approved their issuance
eleven states are supporting texas because they fear that a ruling against the state would call into question license plates that promote national and state pride and specific positions on such controversial issues as abortion
a decision in walker v. sons of confederate veterans , 14 - 144 , is expected by late june .
