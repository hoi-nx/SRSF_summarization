a judge is considering whether 50 pounds of potatoes and a produce box can be used as evidence in the trial of a man accused of killing six - year - old etan patz in manhattan in 1979
the suspect , pedro hernandez , told authorities that he choked etan in the basement of the convenience store where he worked after luring the boy down the stairs with a promise of a soda
he told investigators he put the boy 's body in a plastic garbage bag , then put the bag inside a banana box and walked it about a block and a half away and put it down in an alcove with other trash
the body was never recovered
part of pedro hernandez 's job at the store was to lug boxes of produce , soda and beer up and down the basement stairs into the shop in soho
bizarre request : the defense for pedro hernandez ( pictured in court in november 2012 ) have asked to use 50lbs of potatoes in court to show he would not have been able to life etan patz 's body as he claimed ' i put it on my shoulder
i walked to the right , ' he said of the box during his videotaped confession
' i was strong at the time
' victim : etan patz was just six when he vanished while walking to his school bus in manhattan in 1979 but attorneys for pedro hernandez , now 54 , say the confession was made up and pedro hernandez is mentally ill. attorney harvey fishbein suggests pedro hernandez was scrawny , weighing only about 115 pounds , and could not have carried a heavy box that far
he is asking to bring in the 50 pounds of potatoes and the produce box for jurors to demonstrate the weight of the body
on the missing - child poster , etan 's weight was listed as 50 pounds
but prosecutors say the measurement was a mistake made by frantic parents , and medical records from just a few months before etan vanished have the boy weighing about 37 pounds
his mother , julie , testified that he was very small for his age
assistant district attorney joan illuzzi-orbon argued that the method for showing how heavy the box would be is unscientific and should not be shown to jurors because it would be wrong
' it is incompetent evidence and unscientific because carrying a body is vastly different than potatoes , ' she said
it would be the second piece of unconventional evidence on whether the confession is plausible
earlier in the trial , prosecutors showed jurors a photo of a little boy crouching in a produce box , intending to show that etan 's body would have fit into such a box
the boy is etan 's size and shape but is n't identified
defense attorney alice fontier argued that the photos were equally as unscientific
' the people have been given free reign , ' she said
' we need to be allowed to introduce ' the box
in court : pedro hernandez 's family leave court in his trial earlier this month
his daughter becky hernandez , left , testified earlier this week about the negative effect her father 's arrest has had on her seeking justice : stanley patz , etan 's father , and his daughter shira patz , left , arrive in court on march 9 the judge said he would decide on thursday
pedro hernandez made the surprising confession in 2012 to authorities who were interviewing him based on a tip from a relative
no physical evidence has been recovered , but at least five people have testified that over the years , pedro hernandez said he had killed a child in new york city
he moved from soho , where he had been staying with his sister and brother - in - law shortly after etan disappeared , to new jersey , where he has been living ever since , most recently in maple shade
etan 's parents helped galvanize the national missing - children 's movement
may 25 , the day he disappeared , is national missing children 's day .
