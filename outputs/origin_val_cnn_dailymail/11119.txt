olive oil has long been linked with lower levels of cholesterol , blood pressure and a multitude of other health benefits
and while food companies have attempted to get it into the diets of more people by adding it to margarine , a team of scientists has gone a step further
the italy researchers have discovered a way to convert the liquid state of extra virgin olive oil into a gel , without the need for other solids
italy researchers have discovered a way to convert the liquid state of extra virgin olive oil into a gel , without the need for other solids
the so - called gel oil comes in different flavours ( shown above ) known as gel oil , the food scientists said it can be added to salads and sandwiches , used in cooking and can be flavoured
variations include lemon and basil
olive oil ( pictured ) has long been linked with lower levels of cholesterol , blood pressure and a multitude of other health benefits the discovery was made by 10 chemical engineers from the italy university of calabria in the southern town of arcavacata
they used a technique called ' organogelazione ' which involves subjecting the properties of certain molecules known in the food industry , such as emulsifiers , to a range of temperatures
when these molecules are heated and mixed they were found to form new structures
the university 's food engineering department headed by professor bruno de cindio said : ' in this network structure , the oil remains ' trapped ' within the changing texture and transforms itself , in the first stage , into a gel form and , in a second stage , into a creamy spreadable paste
' he added that said that this also means it can be produced in various consistencies from a slightly stickier version ideal for dressing salads and other foods to a more solid variation that can be spread like margarine or butter on bread
the innovation has been patented and the team said it sees huge potential particularly among people with dietary restrictions or moral objections to dairy products such as vegans
the team are now hoping to create a company to sell gel oil and already developing variations flavoured with lemon and basil
valeria greco , one of the researchers of the team , said : ' our idea certainly meets the needs of a new customer profile
' people are increasingly being forced to have fast food meals and that means ready to eat products , but at the same time there is reluctance to compromise on quality and taste and our product very much caters to this market
' scientists have found olive oil could cut your heart attack risk in just six weeks
the study published in november by the glasgow university , found that regular consumption of olive oil dramatically improved chemical signals in the body linked to coronary artery disease
it added just 20mls a day â about four teaspoons - to the diet of healthy adults , which is the amount used in a salad dressing or mopped up by bread during a meal
but a range of signals for heart disease measured in the urine improved in only six weeks , according to the report published in the american journal of clinical nutrition
scientists have found olive oil could cut your heart attack risk in just six weeks
the study , by the glasgow university , found that found regular consumption of olive oil ( pictured ) dramatically improved chemical signals in the body linked to coronary artery disease researchers at the universities of glasgow and lisbon and private firm mosaiques diagnostics in germany investigated the effect of olive oil on heart health in a group of 69 men and women who did not normally eat it
the volunteers were split into two groups and asked to consume 20mls of olive oil either low or high in phenolics every day over a six - week period
phenolics are natural compounds found in plants , including olives , thought to be responsible for the protective effect of olive oil
the research team applied a new diagnostic technology by examining urine samples for a range of peptides ( produced by the breakdown of proteins ) already identified as biomarkers of diseases such as coronary artery disease ( cad )
known as proteomics , the technology can pick up altered levels of certain proteins which suggest early signs of disease before symptoms appear
the results showed both groups saw a big improvement in scores for cad â the most common form of heart disease
dr emilie combet of the school of medicine at glasgow university , said â what we found was that regardless of the phenolic content of the oil , there was a positive effect on cad scores
â any olive oil , low or high in phenolics , seems to be beneficial
â our study was a supplementation study
if people in the uk replaced part of their fat intake with olive oil , it could have an ever greater effect on reducing the risk of heart disease
