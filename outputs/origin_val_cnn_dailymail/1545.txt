the school 's public safety director , john thomas , said he was ' disturbed ' by reports the actress 's son marcel had been stopped by police on campus for having his hands in his pockets
it comes after taraji p. henson revealed she had now decided to send the 20 - year - old to historically black howard university
the mother and son are pictured above at a film screening in caucasian hollywood last april empire star henson , 44 , says her son was stopped at university of california ( file picture ) for having his hands in his pockets in an interview with uptown magazine , she said her son was racially profiled elsewhere in california beforehand and did ' exactly everything the cops told him to do , including letting them illegally search his car
' it was bogus because they did nât give him the ticket for what he was pulled over for , ' she said
' then he âs at usc , the school that i was going to transfer him to , when police stopped him for having his hands in his pockets
' after learning of the usc allegation , john thomas revealed that he too had experienced racial profiling as a teenager in a statement , he said : ' i was deeply disturbed to read news reports about a prospective student who felt profiled on or near campus because of his race
' we encourage reporting of allegations of bias and i hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother
taraji p. henson has revealed she has now decided to send her 20 - year - old son marcel to historically - black college ' i would like to look into this matter further and better understand who was involved and what took place
' as someone who personally experienced racial profiling as a teenager , i have a stake in learning more about this incident and doing all i can to reach a just resolution
' he said he was not yet clear on which police departments were involved and that ' any allegation of bias or unequal treatment by university officers would trigger an investigation that i would supervise along with the university 's office of equity and diversity '
he continued : ' it is my expectation and that of the university that our department uphold the highest standards of constitutional policing , affording equal rights and respect to all persons
' marcel is taraji p. henson 's only child , and his father was her high school sweetheart
new hit : taraji p. henson currently stars on empire as cookie lyon , the recently - released - from - prison ex-wife of a music mogul ( played by terrence howard ) after revealing her son 's ordeal , the 44 - year - old said in the interview : ' so guess where he âs going ? howard university
i âm not paying $ 50k so i ca nât sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus
also in the interview , taraji p. henson spoke about how happy she was to be one of now many black women leads on the small screen in shows like scandal and how to get away with murder
' it feels good that there âs not just one black person
i do nât like that we get fixated on one or two at a time , or three at a time
if you look at caucasian hollywood , every year there âs a handful of new faces you âve never seen before , then after that , they got five movies coming out and they âre introducing you to more talent
so i âm just so happy to see what âs happening on television right now
