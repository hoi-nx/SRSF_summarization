a couple are being forced to shut their upmarket fireplace shop because of the sound of noisy swingers upstairs
matthew and cheryl jewell have had enough of ' embarrassing ' noises coming from the sex club above their the stovestore business in chorley , lancashire
despite their attempts to drown out the sounds , they claim customers are being driven away by the noises , which start around lunchtime
matthew and cheryl jewell ( pictured ) claim it is ' embarrassing ' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs mrs cheryl jewell said : ' customers are stood here and they 're screaming upstairs
i 'm going red , customers are going red and they 're leaving the shop
' we 've spent thousands of pounds here and we 're going to have to leave
we have so many customers that return to us here
' despite their protestations , a representative of the no 3 swingers club , which has been open for two years , claims they are doing nothing wrong
no 3 club owner , who said she only wanted to known as mary , said she had suggested soundproofing , and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the the stovestore was open
she said : ' i 've done everything i possibly can
i do n't want them to move
i do n't think they like my type of business
they knew what it was before they moved in
' i 'm very disappointed and quite upset they 're moving
i do n't want to interfere with anybody else 's business
' problems began for mr and mrs cheryl jewell when the no 3 club expanded its opening hours into the working day , as well as its late night and early hours opening
' it 's more frequent now , they 're open from 1pm onwards , ' said mrs cheryl jewell
' we were changing all our days for when they were noisiest
' we know what 's going on up there , but we ca n't do anything about it
' the club website advertises the first wednesday of every month as ' greedy girl day ' beginning at midday the jewell 's business the stovestore ( pictured ) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs the couple , who have owned the shop for two years , have complained to chorley council , but say their only option is to leave
mrs cheryl jewell added : ' we 've made a couple of complaints , but there 's no law for sexual activities
it 's two years now just wasted
' according to the no 3 club website , daytime activities include ' greedy girl day ' , which takes place on the first wednesday of every month , between noon and 10pm
the two businesses share a landlord , patterson , who said he has asked no 3 club to take steps improve the situation
mr patterson said : ' the no 3 club came into the unit five years ago , cheryl jewell and matthew have been there two years
there were two other tenants before them and it was n't a problem
' now the no 3 club has extended its hours into the working day
' i 've heard the noises and it 's not acceptable
i 've spoken to the no 3 club about it on numerous occasions on behalf of cheryl jewell and matthew and they 've made no effort to improve the situation
if anything it 's got worse
' he added : ' i 've written to the no 3 club and , if and when they renew their lease , i 've told them there will be a restriction on them operating during the working day
' councillor paul walmsley , from chorley council , said : ' the council has received a complaint about the no.3 club , but as both parties are commercial premises , we do not have the powers to enforce nuisance proceedings
' we will , however , continue to ensure they are compliant with their licence agreement as we would do with any other premises
