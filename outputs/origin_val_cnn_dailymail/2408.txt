bungling : garner suffered a grazed chin after being tackled to the ground by thomas a bungling burglar was spotted and caught by his victim - because of the graze on his chin from when the pair had grappled the day before
garner suffered facial injuries when he was tackled to the ground after thomas caught him in his home in stoke-on-trent , staffordshire
garner , 49 , fled the house after grabbing Â£ 8 in cash and a Â£ 65 pair of trainers from the kitchen counter of the property in abbey hulton
but the thief returned to the home 12 hours later and bumped into mr thomas , who recognised his grazed chin and distinctive limp
the father - of - two confronted garner and managed to detain him until the police arrived
officers then arrested him on suspicion of burglary
garner - who has 43 previous convictions - was jailed for two years and four months after he admitted burglary
he asked for four other offences to be taken into consideration
sentencing him at stoke , judge david fletcher said : ' you are going to have to think very hard about how you deal with your life on your release from prison
' nobody is too old to change
if you do not , the rest of your life will be continued institutionalisation , as it has been for the last 33 years
' the court heard mr thomas had chased garner through his home after catching him rummaging around his kitchen at 8.30pm on november 26 last year
the next morning mr thomas and his 24 - year - old partner were waiting for their son 's school taxi when they recognised garner walk past their house
speaking after the case , mr thomas said : ' what are the odds of us seeing the burglar walk past our house the very next day ? ' it was pure chance he walked past at that moment
' i could tell it was him because he had a grazed chin and i was determined to make sure he was jailed so he ca n't do this again
' i knew it was him straight away but i made him remove his hood to be sure
garner - who has 43 previous convictions - was jailed for two years and four months at stoke after he admitted burglary ' he kept protesting his innocence but i kept him talking until the cops showed up
i basically did the police 's job for them
' it did n't cross my mind that he might be dangerous
it was my instinct to protect my family but i heard my little girl shouting so i went back
' it 's not a long sentence considering he 's a repeat offender
i 'm just glad i can give people peace of mind knowing he ca n't do anything while behind bars
