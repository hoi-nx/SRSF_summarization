the gangster who supplied the murder weapon which killed rhys has attempted to return to the area where the late boy âs family live , it was claimed today
james yates , who provided the smith & wesson revolver used to kill the 11 - year - old child , can not enter the croxteth park neighbourhood of liverpool where the murder took place
but the 27 - year - old applied for his exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted so he could visit a relative - meaning he could have been in the area where rhys âs parents steve and jones still live
gangster : james yates ( left ) , who provided the smith & wesson revolver used to kill rhys ( right ) , can not enter the croxteth park neighbourhood of liverpool where the murder took place mrs jones , 49 , said it was â awful â to learn of his application in a letter last saturday - the day before mother âs day , which she described as an â emotional occasion â
â i âm so upset , â she said
â i âve barely got words to describe how angry i am
i had to come home from work as it was so emotional
â how can they be allowed to apply for dropping the exclusion zone ? this is the third time this has happened now
the whole system is a farce
â the probation service said james yates would be dropped off by his father francis - who was jailed for more than four years for trying to cover up the murder - and later picked up on an agreed route
however , the moj was said to have revealed yesterday that james yates 's request had been denied
reacting to this decision , mrs jones said : â at last , common sense prevails
â but she added the continual and brazen appeals by the gang members to enter their neighbourhood were emotionally draining and unfair
james yates was released last april - leaving just one of the seven - strong gang in prison
rhys was shot by rhys , 16 , aided by six others , on his way home from football practice in 2007
shooting location : rhys died on august 22 , 2007 , outside the fir tree pub in croxteth park
james yates applied for his exclusion zone to be temporarily lifted so he could visit a relative after james yates walked free it meant only rhys , who was jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years , was left behind bars after seven people were convicted over their involvement in the horrific crime
following his release , mrs jones called james yates the â most evil of them all â
nathan quinn , kelly , gary kays , melvin coy and a 16 - year - old who can not be named have all served sentences
grief : if james yates had been successful in his bid , he could have been in the area where rhys âs parents steve and jones ( pictured ) still live james yates was 21 when he was jailed for just seven years for supplying the gun used to kill rhys and helping rhys cover his tracks
he and two other members of the croxteth crew-quinn , 18 , and kelly , 17 - winked , smiled , smirked and cheered in the dock as they were handed sentences blasted as ' disgusting ' by rhys 's family
the trial judge , mr justice irwin , told james yates : ' there is strong evidence you were an active gang member
i have no doubt you were a willing assistant helping in any way you could
' yates ' term was later increased to 12 years by the lord chief justice , who attacked the ' modern pestilence ' of gun crime
but because james yates spent almost a year in prison awaiting trial , that time counted towards his final sentence
that means he spent just over five years behind bars since being found guilty of assisting the schoolboy 's murderer
he was released on licence midway through his sentence , as is commonplace , and will be monitored outside prison for the remainder of the 12 years
rhys died on august 22 , 2007 , when rhys , armed with a revolver , cycled to his estate to try to shoot members of the rival strand gang
rhys was struck by his second bullet
the ' wall of silence ' faced by police meant that while rhys 's name swiftly emerged as the prime suspect in the shooting outside the fir tree pub , months of painstaking detective work was required to charge him with murder
the gun itself , a .455 calibre smith and wesson revolver with a six - inch barrel , may have been handed down through generations of liverpool criminals
it was made during the first world war in about 1915 , but remained in good working order
the rifling in the barrel was worn and the bullets fired by rhys were slightly undersized , causing them to tumble end - over - end
that meant the round which hit rhys was side - on when it struck him in the back of the neck , splintering vertebrae and destroying his windpipe before exiting through his throat
the croxeth crew also had an imitation walther ppk converted to fire live rounds , a british army webley revolver and a russian 7.62 handgun .
