pietersen negotiated a release from his ipl contract so that he could agree a new contract with surrey pietersen has been in australia for the world cup and this picture suggests he is struggling with jetlag the superstar batsman , sacked by england last year after their ashes whitewash defeat , is hoping a return to four - day county cricket may yet pave the way for a test recall
england and wales cricket board chairman colin graves has hinted that could be a possibility , if pietersen performs well
the 34 - year - old has said he will ' do anything ' to play for england again , and dreams of being back for this summer 's ashes rematch - a series which runs from july 8 to august 24
pietersen agreed in the close season to return to play for the zouks , as he did last summer
his commitments for them may , however , clash with part of the ashes - or his hopes of continuing to press his claims with runs for surrey
the south african - born batsman has n't given up on receiving a call - up for the ashes tests this summer the caribbean premier league season begins on june 20 and ends on july 26 and the tournament 's international director of cricket , tom moody , is confident pietersen will be there
' at this stage he sees himself very much as part of the caribbean premier league , he 's made the commitment and will have played a lot of county cricket at that time , ' he told the caribbean premier league 's official website
' we do n't see that changing , he has n't indicated that 's going to be the case ( to pull out ) but if he 's suddenly picked in an ashes test match that 's all going to change very quickly
' i think that is probably not a realistic target for him unless something dramatic happens between now and then
it 's going to be hard for him , there 's a lot of hurdles to be overcome ; one , form , which will be his easiest hurdle ; two , his fitness and three is his building bridges
there are many to be built after what has been said from both parties over a long period of time
