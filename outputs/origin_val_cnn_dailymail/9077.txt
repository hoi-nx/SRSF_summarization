it may look like a stunning rainbow of colour , but the psychedelic hue of this hot spring in yellowstone national park , is a result of years of unintended vandalism by visitors
once a brilliant shade of blue , the morning glory 's appearance has altered dramatically since the 1950s , thanks to an accumulation of coins , rubbish and natural debris
the pool has been dubbed the fading glory , due to the transformation from its original colour to the yellowy - green hue it has today
the photograph reveals a stark contrast to the fiery colours now exhibited at the tourist attraction the popular tourist attraction sees three million visitors flock to gaze at its psychedelic waters in wyoming , usa
the site first gained popularity in the 1940s when a million tourists would visit the site pool on fire ! the fierce colours are influenced by how light interacts with the water âs depth , with yellow and orange colours in the shallows and green in the deep waters the rainbow hot spring has been clogged up with debris , which block the heat vents , and affecting the water circulation in the pool it is estimated that the destruction of the hot spring has been building up for decades
research by montana state university and brandenburg university of applied sciences in germany helped to create a model that could depict the hot spring 's colours from over a century ago , when it was less frequented by visitors
now nearly three million tourists flock to yellowstone national park , compared to the one million in the 1940s , which has led to the build - up of debris in the pool
as the underwater vents started to get clogged up , water circulation was affected , decreasing the temperature of the waters and causing a migration of the orange - coloured bacteria towards the centre
adam hoffman from science friday said : ' pigments produced by swaths of those microbes â called microbial mats â are responsible , at least in part , for the brilliant yellows , greens , and oranges that now tinge morning glory and other thermal pools in yellowstone national park
' photographs from 1966 show the upper geyser basin pool 's original blue colour , before the build up of coins and rubbish the pool received its name in 1883 from mrs mcgowan , who was the wife of assistant park superintendent , charles mcgowan
as a nod to its then crystal blue colour , she named it after the blue flower , morning glory
although it was originally known by its latin name , convolutus , by 1889 it was commonly known by its current name
over three million people enjoy the yellowstone national park annually , spans an area of 3,468.4 square miles , comprising lakes , canyons , rivers and mountain ranges unless some subterranean shift happens where more hot water can again flow to the surface , morning glory will never be fully blue again half of the world 's geothermal features are in yellowstone national park , fueled by yellowstone caldera , the largest supervolcano on the continent the pool has warning signs around it , in an attempt to reduce further vandalism to its waters , ( left )
it has been dubbed fading glory , now bearing little resemblance to the bright blue flowers which gave it its name , ( right )
