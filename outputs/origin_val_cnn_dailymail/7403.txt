it comes to something when even guardiola looks surprised
after all , the former barcelona coach has seen the messi show many times before
he helped to construct it , to hone it
he could claim part - copyright
on the training fields of barcelona âs ciutat esportiva joan gamper training centre , on the slick , wet grass of the nou camp and at the best europe stadia , guardiola has watched messi make fools of many
here on wednesday night , however , as the current coach of bayern munich chose to return to his spiritual home , even he was left gasping , gaping and giggling at another night of remarkable productivity and beauty from the greatest footballer those of us on the south side of 50 have ever seen

messi âs free - kicks were nât up to much on wednesday
three times he had the opportunity to beat hart from just outside the penalty area
three times the ball flew over the crossbar
it was , in some ways , good to see that he is nât perfect , that he does make mistakes
after all , if we accept that we have the first flawless footballer in our midst then where do we go from there ? pretty much everything else , however , was exemplary and it was a nutmeg on james milner by the near touchline in the first half that provoked one of the most memorable reactions of the season from guardiola
as james milner disappeared in to a place no footballer ever wishes to go , messi was away up the field , scampering towards the retreating figures of kompany and martin demichelis with savage intent
on nights like this , messi will terrify the best defenders and , here , manchester city âs pair resembled pedestrians stranded on the central reservation of a motorway
lots of footballers can pull tricks , of course
messi is nât the only one with the moves
the key to his majesty , however , is that none of it is ever for show
he does it because he can but also because it works , because it wins matches
at times here he made the english champions look like a desperate , disparate bunch
if this is to be manuel pellegrini âs final act in europe as manager of manchester city then he will leave with messi âs scampering image burned on to the back of his eyes
james milner approaches barcelona star messi during their uefa champions league tie on wednesday messi slips the ball through manchester city midfielder james milner 's legs at the nou camp james milner slides as messi nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their uefa champions league match james milner is left on his backside as messi runs away from the england international with the ball bayern munich manager guardiola ( centre ) reacts to the ridiculous skill from messi during the match a â nutmeg â is the technique of rolling the ball between an opponent âs legs , and gains extra acclaim when the attacking player retains possession after performing the trick
the origins of the word have long been debated , with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy â a notion put forward by countdown star susie dent , of dictionary corner , who tweeted : â nutmegging in football comes from the centuries - old slang â nutmegs â , meaning â testicles â
in case messi is ever interested
â however , the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in cockney rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation , while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between america and england in the 18th century , when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the atlantic
being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster
it later caught on in football , implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked , or , nutmegged
in spanish , the skill is known as â cano â or â tunel â
they âve certainly got plenty of tunel vision at the nou camp thanks to messi
when manchester city look back on the goal that effectively ended this tie , they will ask questions
was sagna right to track neymar all the way infield , allowing scorer rakitic to proceed unimpeded from deep ? if sagna was not at fault then who was supposed to be tracking the runners ? for the visiting team the tactical debrief will not be pleasant
there was a poverty about their football at times
here in catalonia , however , the locals will have taken home only memories of the way that messi drifted infield from the right , dragging manchester city defenders towards him like moths before lifting the perfect pass in to rakitic âs path
this is what the really great players do
they create panic and prompt rash decisions
they do , as much as is humanly possible in a sport involving 22 players , win games all on their own
not long after barcelona âs goal , messi did pretty much the same thing again
this time he got a lucky bounce off his own face as he moved forwards but once again the chipped pass was perfect
once again sagna was distracted by the darting neymar but this time , somehow , there was no goal
it was to become a pattern
manchester city did nât help themselves
kompany began dreadfully and hardly improved
martin demichelis looked paralysed â perhaps he was just too aware of what his international team - mate can do â while manchester city âs central midfield players failed palpably once again to locate the barcelona midfield players queuing up to adorn messi âs creative work
at times they resorted to simply fouling messi
even silva retreated back to his own 18 - yard line to crudely halt his passage towards goal
that , in its own way , was one of the night âs most telling images

that is one of the many traits he shares with his great rival in madrid , cristiano ronaldo
in to the second half and his appetite indeed remained strong
he touched the ball three times within ten seconds of the restart and two minutes later drove a shot towards goal that hart beat away
at the death hart denied him again at the end of a 70 - yard thrust that messi began and almost finished
the manchester city goalkeeper got the better of messi at the end of the first leg , of course
he saved his penalty and messi shovelled the rebound wide
maybe that memory drove him on wednesday night but it âs doubtful
revenge is a motivation for the mortal
he âs just a genius
