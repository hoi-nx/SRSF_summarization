former scotland football captain hendry , pictured arriving at blackpool magistrates , has admitted drink driving ex-scotland football captain hendry is preparing to fight a ban from the roads after blaming his drink driving on a ' rare ' metabolism
the 49 - year old former glasgow rangers and blackburn rovers defender was arrested last month after police stopped him near his home in lytham , lancashire in the early hours of february 21
officers had claimed hendry who was nicknamed ' braveheart ' when he captain of scotland was almost twice the limit after failing a breathalyser test
but today , widowed father of four hendry disputed the reading and asked blackpool magistrates to have the case adjourned so his metabolism could be tested
the court heard that hendry admitted drinking before driving his blue ford focus , but argued the amount of alcohol he drank over a certain period of time should not have put him over the limit
his lawyer lewis - who has previously represented a string of celebrities over his expertise in exploiting motoring legal loopholes - said : ' usually we go to sentence and it is inevitable he would have to be disqualified because he has entered a guilty plea because he accepts the facts
' but the instructions i have over the amount of alcohol consumed and the time period , when you do the calculations they do n't correlate with the figure he has given
' there are two possibilities - one is because of the fact that he has got some alcohol in his system he is unaware of and the other is quite rare is we have somebody whose metabolism is such they provide a specimen of breath which does not correlate with the reading of blood
' we have had a forensic scientist give us an indication that the figures provided by the defendant do n't correlate with the figures given by the sample
' we accept the prosecution 's case - the police followed him , he was n't driving erratically , nothing unusual about that , he accepts that - the question is why is this alcohol reading being given that is being investigated
' we can establish what he consumed and when it was because there are receipts
' mr hendry might have to be tested for his metabolism in the lab with a reconstruction of the whole evening 's events
the ratio between breath and blood is not the same for everyone
' if our investigations do n't have foundation in science we would bring it back to court and have it dealt with
mr hendry wants the matter to be dealt with as quickly as possible
' he was stopped by police and arrested near his home in lytham , lancashire in the early hours of february 21 , and was found to be driving his blue ford focus while almost double the legal alcohol limit ( stock picture ) the court agreed to adjourn for a ' special reasons ' hearing in which hendry will call evidence from a forensic service scientist and two civilian witnesses who were with him on the night of the incident
hendry - who arrived for the hearing in sunglasses and a grey suit - had 63 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit is 35mg
initial forensic tests conducted on behalf of hendry had shown the figures did not correlate and further investigation was needed , said mr lewis
the solicitor added that the later sentencing bench could have the option not to disqualify hendry from driving but the conviction would stand regardless
hendry , was granted unconditional bail until april 22 when the case will be heard in full before sentencing
the 49 - year old former glasgow rangers and blackburn rovers defender has blamed his ' quite rare ' metabolism for being over the limit the ex-premier league footballer had a long playing career , captaining his country in the 1998 world cup and appearing for a series of clubs including blackburn rovers , manchester city , bolton wanderers and glasgow rangers
last week police confirmed he had been given a warning amid claims he had pestering former girlfriend kinder a beautician he had been dating after the death of his wife denise in 2009 following botched cosmetic surgery
miss kinder , 40 , claimed he looked in her window and sent her unwanted texts and social media messages after their four - year relationship ended late last year
it was also claimed the former footballer repeatedly drove past her home
the warning does not count as a criminal record but runs for 12 months to deter an individual from future conduct causing distress
tv pundit hendry had previously built up debts of Â£ 2.2million which led to him being made temporarily bankrupt by a betting firm in 2010 and losing his mansion home .
