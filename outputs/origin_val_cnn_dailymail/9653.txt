johnson has criticised a controversial government ruling to stop 430,000 civil servants talking to journalists
the mayor of london raised concerns about a change to the civil service code , quietly introduced last week , which makes it clear that officials can be sacked if they speak out before checking with a minister
cabinet office minister francis maude agreed to redraft guidance to â strengthen protection â for those speaking out to blow the whistle on scandals or abuses of public money , and include a commitment to being â as open as possible â with parliament and the public
the mayor of london , pictured during a visit to kew gardens last week , disagrees with the new rule to stop civil servants speaking to the press however , that has failed to satisfy critics who have asked why such a change has been enforced just before the general election campaign
mr johnson , a former journalist , told the daily mail : â i believe in maximum possible transparency
sunlight is the best disinfectant
â there âs virtually nothing that you can say or do that is nât instantly foi - able
although it âs painful and difficult for politicians , it âs a bloody good thing
it does lead actually to better government
i âm in favour of people being able to discuss things as freely as they can
â when i look back at my time in city hall , it âs quite incredible how i took over an operation staffed overwhelmingly by people who did nât share my political views
do we get people trying to brief the media ? absolutely not
mr johnson said he believed in ' maximum possible transparency ' â most civil servants understand that there âs a difference between being useful and helping public debate , and undermining the operation that they are in
i âm in favour of transparency
â mr johnson said he was concerned that there would be a repeat of the post-leveson â chill â between the media and the police , which he described as â crazy â
â one of the difficulties that there has been is in the case of relations between police and the media
relations between police and the media have always been pretty free , â he said
â publicity is one of the utensils of crime - fighting , â he said
mr johnson raised wider questions about historic police investigations , such as those going on into child abuse allegations dating back decades
â one thing i am concerned about is the extent to which police time and resources can be devoted to what you might call policing the past - policing previous police investigations into what may or may not have been criminal offences , â he said
â we have got to be careful
i can see the huge sensitivities , and there may be people out there who feel they have been victims
but we also need to fight everyday crimes of violence and burglary
â the cabinet office insists that the amendment to the civil service code will not affect contacts between journalists and press officers or advisers who regularly speak to the media
they insist the new provision simply â clarifies â current practice , and say whistleblowers have legal protections
the change appears have been agreed by sir jeremy heywood , the cabinet secretary , who has been dubbed sir cover up over the long delays to the chilcot report into the iraq war
however , the impetus is understood to have come from ministers , who wanted to control the flow of information from departments to make clear that they , not civil servants , are ultimately in charge
a government source insisted : â we would be deeply concerned if there was a chilling effect which limited the ability of parliament and the press to expose waste and wrongdoing â .
