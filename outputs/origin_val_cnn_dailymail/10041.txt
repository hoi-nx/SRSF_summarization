apology : police officer david duckenfield today said sorry for failing to admit that he ordered the gates at hillsborough to be opened the police chief on duty during the hillsborough disaster today apologised for lying to officials about ordering the gates to the stadium to be opened , leading to a deadly crush which killed 96 liverpool fans
as the disaster unfolded , david duckenfield told officials from the fa that ' some fans have got in through a gate ' - which he admitted today was a ' terrible lie '
the former officer said that he ' apologised unreservedly ' for failing to confess that he had personally ordered police to open the gates in order to relieve overcrowding at the turnstiles of the sheffield stadium
after the gates were opened fans rushed into the terraces , causing dozens of people to be crushed under the weight of bodies
mr david duckenfield was the officer overseeing the fa cup semi-final between liverpool and notthingham forest on april 15 , 1989 , even though he had been promoted just two weeks previously and had never been in charge of policing a football match before
yesterday he told the inquest into the fans ' deaths that he was ' not the best man for the job ' given his inexperience , and today he gave evidence about his decision to open gate c eight minutes before kick - off
after the gate opened an estimated 2,000 fans poured in , heading straight for a tunnel leading directly to the already - packed central pens three and four , behind the goal
mr david duckenfield , 70 , today recounted a conversation he had with fa officials kelly and glen kirton minutes after the match was abandoned amidst the chaos
he denied the suggestion that he had said the gates were ' stormed ' , and claimed he told the men ' something like , " some fans have got in through a gate
" ' he continued : ' i was pointing out that fans had gained unauthorised access to the ground
what i did n't say to mr kelly , i did n't say , " i have authorised the opening of the gates , " i did n't tell him that
' christina lambert qc , counsel for the inquest , asked : ' do you consider now that you told them a lie ? ' mr david duckenfield replied : ' yes , ma'am
i certainly now appreciate it was wrong and completely open to misinterpretation
' he added : ' i was probably deeply ashamed , embarrassed , greatly distressed and i probably did n't want to admit to myself or anyone else , what the situation is
' what i would like to say the liverpool families is this , i regret that omission and i shall regret it to my dying day
' i said something rather hurriedly , without considering the position , without thinking of the consequences and the trauma , the heartache and distress that the inference would have caused to those people who were already in a deep state of shock , who were distressed
' i apologise unreservedly to the families and i hope they believe it is a very , very sincere apology
' evidence : mr david duckenfield pictured in the dock , where he talked about his actions on april 15 , 1989 relatives : campaigners margaret aspinall , left , and jenni hicks , right , pictured outside the inquest asked if he was trying to hide the truth because he was responsible for the tragic events , mr david duckenfield said : ' i think in a crisis , and probably in this shock and in stress , i said something i deeply regret
' i 'm a very honest person
i do n't tell lies
i set very , very high standards , not only in myself , but my colleagues in the service and my family
' no one , but no one can understand my behaviour that day - least of all me
that was a terrible lie , in that everybody knew the truth
' earlier mr david duckenfield said he now realised ' in hindsight ' the ' most likely ' route fans would take once gate c was open was to go down the tunnel facing them and in to the central pens
miss lambert said : ' you say in hindsight you recognise that 's where a number of fans might have gone
do you think as a match commander the consequences of the decision you made , and in particular thought as to where the fans might go , is something you should have considered ? ' mr david duckenfield replied : ' i think it is fair to say that is arguably one of the biggest regrets of my life , that i did not foresee where fans would go when they came in through the gates
' the commanding officer , who was stationed in the police control box with a bank of cctv monitors , said he was ' shocked ' at the request to open the gates from superintendent marshall after police became ' overwhelmed ' by the number of fans gathered at the turnstiles
crush : 96 liverpool fans were killed by being pressed up against the ground 's perimeter fence mr david duckenfield said : ' i do n't mind telling you i was shocked and taken aback by it and thinking , " where are these people going to go if i open the gates ? " ' he said another message then came through on the police radio from mr marshall saying : ' if we do n't open the gates someone 's going to get killed
' the witness continued : ' that really was a shocking , terrifying moment to feel you had got to that situation
' another officer in the police box , murray , then said to him : ' are you going to open the gates ? ' the jury heard
mr david duckenfield said : ' i remember saying to him quite clearly , mr murray , if people are going to die i have no option but to open the gates
' he said he was left ' no option ' and thought fans would feel ' relief and comfort ' in being released from the crush of the turnstiles on to the concourse
mr david duckenfield added : ' i think it 's fair to say i was overcome by the enormity of the situation and the decision i had to make
' and as a result of that i was so overcome , probably with the emotion of us having got into that situation , that my mind , for a moment , went blank
' mr david duckenfield said there was ' every possibility ' that he panicked , and accepted that it was a mistake not to have taken steps to close the tunnel leading to the central pens
chaos : fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster after climbing over perimeter fences the gate remained open for five minutes , allowing fans to flow into the ground , but the officer said today that he did not think about where those supporters would go
he admitted : ' it certainly was a mistake and an oversight
under the circumstances , with my limited ability , i accept it was a mistake - a mistake i should n't have made , a mistake i regret bitterly
' it was a grave mistake and i apologise profusely
' at 2.59pm , when the match kicked off , mr david duckenfield said he looked towards the leppings lane terrace and had seen ' nothing untoward '
miss lambert suggested that it might have been ' obvious ' that fans were climbing out of the pens because of the number of people entering through gate c. ' it was not obvious to me , ' mr david duckenfield said
' i thought there may have been some crowd disorder or some problem and i was awaiting information
i did n't know what to think
i was looking and waiting for information
' asked when he had realised that something was badly wrong , the officer said : ' i have a recollection that a young man came from the perimeter track behind the goal and either collapsed or fell down
' he was hobbling , i remember seeing him hobbling , and there was a sudden realisation that this was not a pitch invasion , this was a serious situation
' the hearing continues tomorrow , when mr david duckenfield will be questioned by a lawyer representing victims ' families
