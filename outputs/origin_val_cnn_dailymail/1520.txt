a new south wales company has been forced to settle a tab of more than $ 10,000 with the accc , after it advertised ' 100 per cent aussie ' beer that was actually made in china
the independent liquor group was hit with an infringement notice by the accc , and had to pay the fine of $ 10,200 after its green and gold clad beer was falsely advertised
independent liquor group was fined for advertising this china brewed beer as ' aussie beer ' ' aussie beer ' labelling from march 2014 to august 2014 featured a map of aussie with ' 100 per cent owned ' inside it , and the statement ' aussie 's finest malt '
however , contrary to what its packaging suggested , the beer is made in china
the accc dished out the penalty in accordance with the australian consumer law
' country of origin representations , particularly those designed to grab the eye of the consumer by using well known symbols , colours , or slogans , must be truthful , ' accc chairman rod sims said
the accc fined the new south wales company $ 10,200 , in accordance with australian consumer law ' consumers will often place a premium on the provenance of a product , but are unable to check the accuracy of those claims
this is particularly the case with aussie made products which encourage consumers to support local industries
' consumers are entitled to expect that prominent representations made on packaging are accurate without having to check for disclosures in the fine print
