smiling children enjoy fairground rides and a small boy eagerly waves at the camera while a candy - coloured big wheel turns in the distance
the footage could show scenes from any amusement park , anywhere in the world , yet it is a propaganda video designed to show the ' lighter ' side of living under the bloodthirsty islamic state caliphate
shot in dijla city , a fairground just north of the iraq city mosul , children and adults describe life under isis control
unsurprisingly , they are all very complimentary
charlie winter , a researcher at the quilliam foundation , a counter-extremism think tank , analysed the footage
' in the video , we see men and children playing in dijla city theme park , which is located just on the outside of mosul in northern iraq , ' mr charlie winter said
' while it may seem a strange addition to is âs propaganda repertoire , is nothing unusual
' just as they do in many other videos like this , the propagandists are peddling the idea that there has been a total reversal of the status quo for sunni in is - held territory
' they are trying to promote the idea that the is caliphate is a true utopia , where sunni children are free to play safely , free from persecution and injustice
' safe to say , this is a heavily idealised version of events
' fairground fun : children and adults are asked by the interviewer what life is like under isis control and they are all very complimentary caliphate : if the footage were to be believed , children living under islamic state rule live a good life and spend their days playing in the sun deceiving : a small boy waves at the camera in an islamic state propaganda video and youngsters enjoy the fairground rides all the fun of the isis : shot in dijla city , a fairground just north of the iraq city mosul , children and adults what life is like under isis control the isis interviewer asks one child , who is standing alongside an armed companion , what his life is like
he replies : ' it is a life that is comfortable and god has willed it that it is like this in the islamic state , which will remain by the permission of god
' another reveals it is ' very good ' and he is ' at ease '
a man , who carries a young girl in his arms , tells the interviewer : ' i mean , this situation is what god prefers , he is great , it is preferred by god the almighty , all is good here , there is security that is enviable
' would we want more ? there is a huge difference now , it is better than before
' one child tells the isis interviewer that life under the caliphate is ' very good ' and said he is ' at ease ' and relaxed a man , who carries a young girl in his arms , tells the interviewer : ' all is good here , there is security that is enviable
would we want more ? there is a huge difference now , it is better than before ' charlie winter , a researcher at the quilliam foundation , a counter-extremism think tank , analysed the footage and said : ' safe to say , this is a heavily idealised version of events ' smiles : youngsters are interviewed in the video and it is no surprise they are complimentary of bloodthirsty isis the footage , which shows no women , could n't be more different to chilling new images of a sword - wielding isis executioner publicly beheading three men accused of homosexuality and blasphemy , also in northern iraq
the jihadist group , which controls swathes of iraq and neighbouring syria , has carried out hundreds of barbaric executions as it has imposed its brutal version of islamic law , many of which are photographed or videotaped
the sharia code of conduct is enforced in areas under its control ranging from 80 lashes for drinking alcohol and losing a hand for theft , to death for committing blasphemy .
