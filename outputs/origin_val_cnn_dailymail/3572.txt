former patriots player hernandez peers into a monitor as it displays evidence in his murder trial
one day there is a photograph of him smiling next to his fiancee on father 's day , a few hours before the killing
another shows hernandez on video dancing at a gas station minutes before prosecutors say he picked up the victim
former patriots football player hernandez sits with his defense attorney charles rankin during his murder trial at the bristol county superior court in fall river , massachusetts hernandez is charged with killing semiprofessional football player lloyd hernandez has made hard faces at witnesses as they come of the stand , or even flirted in some cases and still another shows the bullets that killed lloyd on june 17 , 2013
hernandez has watched the case against him unfold for more than a month , taking notes but also taking time to banter with his attorneys or make eyes at the high school sweetheart who could be called to testify against him
hernandez is accused of killing lloyd , who was dating the sister of hernandez 's fiancee
lloyd 's body was found in an industrial park near hernandez 's home
at the time , hernandez had a $ 40 million contract as one of the patriots ' star tight ends
the year before the killing , hernandez played in the super bowl and caught a touchdown pass from tom brady
the trial began in january , and now hernandez spends his days - 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. - in a courtroom , with one 15 - minute morning break and an hour break for lunch
hernandez first day of court opened with him giving his attorney a hug and talking high school sports hernandez is slighter now than he was june 26 , 2013 , the day he was arrested in lloyd 's killing
but there are still flashes of the old football star
he often enters the courtroom with a swagger
the first time he was in court after his former team won the super bowl last month , he greeted his lawyer with a big hug
he can sometimes be overheard talking high school sports with his lawyer and a court officer
one of hernandez 's lawyers , michael fee , would not comment when asked last week how hernandez is doing
the judge has directed lawyers not to speak to reporters about the case
hernandez appears to be paying close attention in court , though the judge has told lawyers no to talk to reporters about the trial for the most part , hernandez appears to pay close attention to what is happening in the courtroom , even when it is dry and technical
he stands respectfully for the 16 jurors when they enter and leave the courtroom and occasionally passes notes or whispers to his lawyers charles rankin , who sits next to him , and fee and sultan , who sit at a table in front of him
he sometimes chuckles at the pointed questions and mannerisms of sultan , who has aggressively gone after some witnesses in the case
hernandez can be more interesting to watch when the jury is not there
one day , with the jury out of the courtroom , a high school teammate of hernandez 's came in to be questioned
paradis had told investigators hernandez told him that he had a .45 - caliber gun
he also said he opened a drawer at hernandez 's home in california and found what he believed was a gun wrapped in a black shirt , and he picked it up but did not unwrap it
hernandez gave paradis the stink eye as he walked past , apparently trying to stare him down
the bench in the gallery behind hernandez 's seat is typically reserved for his family members , but lately it has been empty more often than not
on some days , he steals sideways glances at the vacant seats
by contrast , across the aisle behind prosecutors , several members of lloyd 's family occupy the front row every day
his mother , terri hernandez , who lives more than two hours away in connecticut , occasionally attends the trial with aunts , uncles or cousins
his brother , dj , a graduate assistant football coach at iowa , attended the first two days in january but has not been seen at court since
on days when his relatives come , hernandez turns on the charm
he beams a dimpled smile to the front row and occasionally whispers jokes , once telling them that he wants coffee in the carafe that court officers give him at the defense table , but all they will give him is water
at the time of the killing hernandez was playing for the patriots with a $ 40 million contract shayanna jenkins , his fiancee and the mother of his 2 - year - old daughter , comes sporadically
on those days , the two flirt and giggle together
hernandez compliments her hair and winks at her
shayanna jenkins has been granted immunity to testify
that could allow prosecutors to compel her to take the stand
it 's unclear how much she is cooperating or whether she would testify if called
on friday , shayanna jenkins attended the trial for the first time in more than a week , along with hernandez 's mother and others
hernandez tends to flirt and giggle when his fiance is in court hernandez lit up when he saw them , thanking them for coming
shayanna jenkins was not wearing the huge diamond engagement ring she typically sports on her left ring finger , but it was not clear whether hernandez noticed or why it was missing
at the end of the day , hernandez turned to look at her one last time
' i love you , girl , ' he said
