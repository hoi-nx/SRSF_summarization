zlatan ibrahimovic was sent off after a lunging challenge on chelsea 's oscar on the half hour mark but it appeared harsh as both players made forceful tackles
chelsea players surround referee bjorn kuipers as psg striker zlatan ibrahimovic is shown a red card for fouling oscar the chelsea players swarm around the referee with team - mate oscar lying injured on the floor zlatan ibrahimovic is clearly dejected having been sent off after a collision with oscar in the first - half sky sports pundit jamie carragher labelled chelsea players a ' disgrace ' for their reaction to zlatan ibrahimovic the 33 - year - old seemed apologetic as soon as he realised the impact of his challenge before the chelsea players swarmed the referee demanding action
' it was very unfortunate , it âs not a red card
i actually think he âs trying to pull his foot away
you look at it and you think oscar âs foot is as high , if not higher , ' jamie carragher said on sky sports
â if the referee is the other side then the referee might look at oscar and give the decision the other way
' jamie carragher insisted the actions from the chelsea players were the deciding factor in the dismissal
jamie carragher ( left ) and graeme souness ( second right ) slammed the behaviour of the chelsea players the 33 - year - old heads into this challenge with oscar ( left ) in the first - half which got him sent off ' the reaction from the chelsea players is disgraceful
it âs something that is sad that is coming into the game
it comes from i think mourinho âs teams , they have this reaction , it âs not a one off , ' added jamie carragher
graeme souness branded the actions of chelsea 's squad ' pathetic '
he said : ' in jamie carragher âs ( jamie carragher ) generation , when someone caught you , the last thing you wanted to show your opponent is that you âre injured , today it âs the exact opposite
if someone brushes you , you want to go down and get them in trouble
that âs how pathetic it is
' thank goodness psg stood up to that and leave here with great credit
they are the proper team
' former manchester united captain gary neville disagreed with his colleagues
he said : â listening to the lads at half - time , i âm not as damning about chelsea reacting because partly times it happened during my career when you tried to influence the referee
but for far too many times you âve seen naive english teams in europe , that have been done on occasions like that
the psg forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with oscar â here , we âve got a team that is shrewd
people at home might not like it but if the boot was on the other foot we âd be calling psg shrewd
they play the game , that âs what you need to do in european competition over the last 20 , 30 years
it âs different trying to gain those advantages
â i like the idea that it âs an english team that is shrewd and not the opposition
it comes from mourinho , he knows how to play the game
â however , gary neville did acknowledge it was a harsh decision on zlatan ibrahimovic : ' it 's not a red card for me , i think that 's a poor decision from the referee
he must have got his red card out within two or three seconds
' chelsea captain john terry ( left ) reacts after zlatan ibrahimovic 's tackle on oscar in the first - half at stamford bridge at half - time , jamie carragher had also suggested that such intimidation comes from their manager mourinho : ' i always think with mourinho âs teams that they will always be respected but they âll never be loved because of situations like this
' they take winning to another level that no other team or manager does that i âve seen over the years
' chelsea boss mourinho gestures his dissatisfaction as his side crashed out of the champions league ' we all want to win but the reaction of the chelsea players has definitely played a part and mourinho âs words in the press conference have worked
' mourinho , in his post-match interview after his side were beaten on away goals , bemoaned psg âs apparent time wasting but jamie carragher dismissed such claims as hypocrisy
â mourinho is the master of time wasting and he did that from the first two minutes at anfield last year ( when chelsea all but ended liverpool âs title hopes ) , ' he said
' i âm not criticising him , i applauded him at the time and i know it âs part of the game , but he ca nât complain about psg and that english football is clean as the only dirty tricks we saw were from chelsea by surrounding the referee and the reaction was disgraceful
â the striker is consoled by psg boss laurent blanc as he trudges off the pitch at stamford bridge jamie carragher also questioned the quality of the premier league after chelsea crashed out : ' as a football person you want to see the best teams go through , we want the english teams to do well , to go through and represent our country , ' he said at full - time
' you think of the tv deal , the money we âve got , we âre getting kidded
you see some of the players psg have got
now they âve paid big money as well but you look at arsenal , man city
we âre supposed to be the biggest league in the world , with the best players
' former chelsea defender luiz jumps into the air in celebration having fired psg back into the tie sky sports pundit graeme souness branded the chelsea players ' pathetic ' for their antics on wednesday in the sky sports studio at full - time graeme souness was keen to highlight chelsea 's behaviour was ' unacceptable ' and was full of praise for the parisians : ' it hurts me to say this but chelsea earlier with their shenanigans early on , with the manager coming out with his talk that this is the most aggressive team we âve ever played
saying they are over physical , mourinho is having a laugh , ' graeme souness told sky sports
' this is a team that is full of technique , a really good footballing team
they had to put up with a lot of stuff i find really unappealing
the chelsea players are stunned as they were knocked out of the champions league on wednesday ' that is from other players , the minute they come out of the tunnel , the first minute of the game , they are looking to get the opposition in trouble , get them booked , see if they can get them sent off
the reaction from the chelsea players on the challenge on oscar opitimises what i âm saying , ' added graeme souness
' to a man they were surrounding the referee , even costa ran 50 yards to get involved
oscar originally was nât going to get involved and then you can see in the pictures that as soon as his team - mates all raising their arms around the referee , then he gets involved
' that âs something we can deal without , it âs not the british way of doing things and it is creeping into our game which i find it totally unacceptable
