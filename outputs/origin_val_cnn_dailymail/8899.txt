mcbryde has predicted ' an arm - wrestle for 80 minutes ' when wales heavyweights wales and ireland slug it out at the millenium stadium on saturday
wales assistant coach mcbryde has stressed the winner - takes - all nature of a game that sees both teams featuring prominently at the tournament 's business end
ireland are two victories away from a first wales grand slam since 2009 , while wales must triumph on saturday to remain in the mix for silverware
warburton ( right ) will lead his country for a record 34th time when he takes the field against ireland wales coach warren gatland ( centre ) leads his players onto the pitch at the millenium stadium wales will look to racing metro inside centre jamie roberts to get them over the gainline against ireland warburton ( centre ) leads the warm - up as warren gatland 's side complete their final preparations in cardiff ' it 's going to be an arm - wrestle for 80 minutes , and that is what we 've prepared for , ' mcbryde said
' everything that goes on off the field pales into insignificance , and it 's all about what happens on the day
' they play a big pressure game , and if we can react positively to that and stay in the fight , that will give us a good chance of winning
' there is a lot of stake
ireland are on course for a grand slam , and just to get away from cardiff with a win , that 's all they will be looking to do
with regards to playing any attractive rugby , that will come second
' that 's the nature of the game at the moment , and that 's how teams are wearing each other down , and unfortunately , the spectators have got to pay a price for that
' warburton is in high spirits during the captain 's run as his side prepare for visit of joe schmidt 's side ireland have conceded just one try in three wales games this season and an average of only nine points per time across eight wales matches joe schmidt has overseen during his coaching reign
ireland are also on a 10 - test unbeaten run - england were the last team to defeat them 13 months ago - and mcbryde added : ' they are on a a bit of a roll at the moment
ten wins on the bounce speaks volumes
' this is quite a formidable ireland team , and we are going to have to be at our best to come close to them tomorrow
warburton and co will be looking to avenge their 26 - 3 loss to ireland in dublin last season ' you have got arguably two of the better teams in the wales , not being disrespectful to anybody else
on our day , i think both teams are capable of beating anybody
' with regards to motivation , we look at our own situation , and we know a win would give us an opportunity to go for the championship
' it is a double - edged sword that one
by doing that , we beat ireland and stop them getting a grand slam , but it 's all about what we can achieve and gain , as opposed to anything else
