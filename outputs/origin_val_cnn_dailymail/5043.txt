a woman broke one of the cardinal rules of flying when she lit up a cigarette on board a flight - much to the dismay of her fellow passengers
the woman , who appears to speak with an american accent has not been named , but was caught on camera smoking on an american airlines flight from nicaragua to miami
and when fellow flyers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior she blamed someone else for smoking and went on a bizarre rant
smoking : the woman , who appears to speak with an american accent has not been named , but was caught on camera , pictured , smoking on a flight from nicaragua she shouted : ' the american has declared war on venezuela
venezuela has been declared a national security threat
' ' you 're a national security threat , ' a passenger remarked off camera
' she 's gangster ' another passenger said laughing
flight attendants warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she did n't calm down , according to the daily dot
she ranted : ' venezuela previously owned the oil in venezuela
my great hero hugo chavez nationalized the oil supply so that people with all of the oil ... not exon mobil would go away ! ' bizarrely , she shouted : ' the people own the oil
' was n't me : when fellow flyers flagged down a flight attendant to complain about her unruly behavior she blamed someone else for smoking and went on a bizarre rant calm down : a flight attendant , right , warned the woman that the police would be waiting for her once the plane landed if she did n't calm down according to an eyewitness , the woman added that american president barack obama ' kills people on tuesdays
' after another warning by a flight attendant the woman protested : ' i know already the [ police are coming to take me off the aircraft
] but before i 'm arrested i 'm going to say my peace
' they already say they are arresting me so i 'm going to tell you more , ' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up
rant : ' they already say they are arresting me so i 'm going to tell you more , ' she told passengers while unbuckling her seat belt and standing up
her illegal deed was caught on camera by a flyer who then posted the video to youtube and website reddit
the redditor , with the user name ' upside down dog , ' alleged that he was on the same flight as the woman when he recorded her
he wrote : ' while the plane was waiting on the tarmac for the police to arrive , she leans over to me and asks for a cigarette
' she pulls one out of her bag and lights up
this is the point where i pull eject and run to the back of the cabin
the police arrive after 20 minutes and escort her off the plane
' she only had a single drink on the plane ( however , others told me she was pounding them back pretty hard in the terminal and she also was on prescription painkillers )
' the irony is that this sociology professor is focused mainly on women âs hysteria
due to this , customs was closed just long enough that me and most others on that flight missed our connection
smoking has been strictly prohibited on almost all airlines since 1988
passengers found to be smoking on non-smoking flights can face a fine up to $ 5,000 and be arrested and detained upon landing .
