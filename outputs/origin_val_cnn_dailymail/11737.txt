the baseball player who lost a staggering amount of weight has piled the pounds back on after discovering he plays worse as a slimmer man
the death of his cousin to heart disease inspired cc sabathia to lose a massive 17kg between october 2013 and march 2014
but the 34 - year - old played poorly and many - including himself - believe his skinny figure could not support his towering six - foot , seven - inch frame
so after dropping down to a much healthier 122kg , the major league baseballer has again ballooned to around 136kg

he 's all over the place
