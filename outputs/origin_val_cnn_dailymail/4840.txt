the united states has evacuated its remaining 100 special operations forces members from yemeni
this due to the country 's deteriorating security situation , as was witnessed on friday when four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 and injured hundreds more when they walked into the badr and al-hashoosh mosques in the capital city of sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country
a fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques
isis has since taken responsibility for the attack , but it is still not confirmed if they were in fact behind the bombings
what 's more , hundreds of members of al qaeda managed to escape from yemeni prisons on thursday and friday
in addition , the houthi issued a call to arms on saturday to fight those loyal to the embattled president hadi
the united states had already closed its embassy in sanaa last month
this after years spent working with yemeni in a quest to topple the terrorist organization aqap
aqap , which is based in the country , claimed responsibility for the charlie hebdo shooting earlier this year in paris
members of the houthi militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of friday 's suicide bombings further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between president hadi and the houthi rebels
the houthi are a shia group that has only recently gained power in the country after taking over the government in a coup - d'etat that some believe was funded by iran
in january of this year , houthi rebels seized the presidential palace , and by february they had taken control of the government
it was at this point most americans were withdrawn from the country and the embassy was shuttered
the houthi also launched a strike against president hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of aden , the country 's temporary capital
that same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of president hadi and houthi rebels battled in the same city
then on saturday , the houthi issued a call to arms to attack supporters of president hadi
this after president hadi called the houthi overtaking of the government ' a coup against constitutional legitimacy ' in one of his first speeches in weeks
he also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the saudi city of riyadh , and no doubt upset the houthi when he also announced his plan to place a national flag in the city of sa'dah , the houthi base
above all else he said he wanted unity for the country
hundreds of yemeni chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings meanwhile , should isis indeed be behind friday 's attack , that would make the situation even more dire as though they and al qaeda are both extremist sunni groups , the two have spoken out against one another in the past with al qaeda finding many isis acts and attacks far too extreme
making isis 's role in the bombings more likely is the january decree of al qaeda senior leader harith an-nadhari who spoke against the shedding of ' unlawful blood , ' such as attacks in mosques
the united states has said however they still can not confirm who is behind the attacks .
