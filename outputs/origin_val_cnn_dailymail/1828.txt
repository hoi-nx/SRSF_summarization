killer : triple killer ian mcloughlin , pictured , stabbed to death graham buck , 66 , while allowed out of prison on day release a triple killer was allowed out on day release , leaving him free to murder a good samaritan in a decision today branded a ' catastrophic failure ' by the chief inspector of prisons
ian mcloughlin stabbed to death graham buck , 66 , while allowed out from hmp springhill in buckinghamshire , where he was serving a 25 - year jail term for killing two men he believed were paedophiles
ian mcloughlin had travelled to the home of former prisoner and convicted sex offender francis cory-wright in hertfordshire in july 2013 , and filled a pillowcase with cash and family heirlooms in a robbery
mr graham buck heard his neighbour 's screams and went to investigate what was happening , but was dragged inside by ian mcloughlin , who slashed his throat
in a report drawn up in january last year but made public today , hardwick , the chief inspector of prisons , highlighted a catalogue of failings that allowed ian mcloughlin to be released
he said : ' the decision to release ian mcloughlin had catastrophic consequences
' in a highly critical report , mr hardwick warned that the system for identifying and managing prisoners released on temporary licence ( rotl ) are woefully inadequate
the number of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences , which are handed out to the most dangerous convicts , and allowed out on day release has increased from 38,000 to more than 90,000 between 2008 and 2012
but mr harding said the systems for managing these offenders in open prisons ' lack clarity and are insufficiently robust '
he added : ' there is a general presumption in favour of granting rotl
the purpose of individual releases is not clear , and there are insufficient safeguards to manage the risks presented by some higher - risk - of - harm prisoners
' wanted : ian mcloughlin met convicted paedophile francis cory-wright , 88 , in prison , and during a subsequent manhunt he was last seen at this hotel cctv , released by police at the time attack : ian mcloughlin burgled convicted sex offender francis cory-wright and neighbour graham buck heard his neighbour 's screams and was dragged inside by ian mcloughlin , who slashed his throat he said protection arrangements ' are not routinely reviewed when prisoners transfer to open prisons ' and ' risk assessment processes are inadequate '
a lack of competence and failures to share information are leading to ' indefensible releases ' , he added
ian mcloughlin had a history of violent attacks towards men he suspected of paedophilia and had failed to return to prison after being allowed out on day release before
but despite these warning signs , poor leadership and a failure to properly assess the risk he posed meant officials waved through his day release in july 2013
the convicted killer failed to return to hmp springhill while released for the day in december 2010
he went out drinking all day and returned to a man 's house where he was found by police called out to reports of two men having a row
ian mcloughlin was arrested , but not charged , for being drunk and disorderly and returned to a closed prison
yet the following year the parole board recommended he was returned to an open prison
crime scene : ian mcloughlin killed mr graham buck at the home of francis cory-wright in the hertfordshire village of little gaddesden , near berkhamsted
he was on temporary day release from jail at the time of the murder mr hardwick warned that officials had failed to appreciate ian mcloughlin 's dangerous ' pattern of drinking , identifying single male targets who he believed to be paedophiles and / or homosexuals , returning to their houses , getting involved in an altercation and attacking them '
despite these worrying signs , ian mcloughlin was sent back to an open prison in march 2013
but his multi-agency public protection arrangements ( mappa ) were not properly reviewed on his return , and his new offender manager did not even see him before he was cleared for day release , the report found
mr hardwick concluded : ' it was not appropriate to release mr ian mcloughlin for the first time since his previous failure in 2011 for such a lengthy , unaccompanied , unstructured and unmonitored rotl
' mr ian mcloughlin 's custodial behaviour was good and the prison had no security intelligence or concerns about his conduct
however , he presented a concerning risk profile
' he had previously been convicted of manslaughter and had committed at least one murder
he had failed open conditions twice before
this was his first opportunity to be released on temporary licence since his rotl failure in 2011
the risks he presented on rotl were not sufficiently assessed or managed
' ian john mcloughlin , also known as ian john baker , has been described as â astonishingly bright â , with an iq of 140
born in lancashire in 1958 , he spent much of his youth in care homes and picked up a string of convictions for petty theft and burglary
by his early 20s he was a drifter , reportedly earning money as a rent boy and sleeping rough when his cash ran out
he briefly married at 25 , but his marriage collapsed under the strain of his heavy drinking and his continued involvement in crime and prostitution
in october 1983 , he was stopped by police after crashing a stolen car in london while drunk
kept in a cell to sober up , he demanded to see the custody sergeant and told him : â i âve done a bad thing
â ian mcloughlin had killed a gay man , delgatty , smashing his skull seven times with a hammer before strangling him with a towel
at his trial , ian mcloughlin told the jury that delgatty , 49 , â who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys â had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under - age sex with a teenage boy
ian mcloughlin claimed he had â panicked â and repeatedly struck out at delgatty
he said he had thrown the tape away
the jury convicted him of manslaughter , not murder , and he was sentenced to 13 years , reduced to eight on appeal
he was released in 1989 after serving only five years
just 17 months later he stabbed gay barman peter halls , 55 , through the neck at his home in brighton
in july 1992 , he was convicted of murder and given a life sentence , with a minimum tariff of 25 years
ian mcloughlin âs 25 - year minimum term would have meant he was eligible for release on licence in 2017 but he was moved to a category d â open resettlement prison â so he could prepare for life outside
