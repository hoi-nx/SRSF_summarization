it was billy connolly who once joked that ally macleod thought tactics were a new kind of peppermint
and amusing though that might have been , it expressed a british suspicion that tactics somehow meant over-thinking the game
some will say the game is all about having good players and that the manager only has so much control
of course , you ca nât legislate for everything that âs going to happen on the pitch
but , when rodgers turns around a season by simply deploying players in different areas of the pitch , even the most hardened sceptic ought to be able to see just how important tactics are and that tweaking your system can be a game - changer
rodgers addresses his players as they prepare for the united clash at anfield the liverpool manager was under pressure earlier in the season after a poor start to the campaign the liverpool manager was on the back foot in december
his team were conceding goals , they could not score and they did nât look anything like the side they had been the previous season
people were even suggesting he might be sacked
what a bold and clever move to go to three at back and push the wing - backs on
ironically , he first did it at old trafford in december â and his reward was a 3 - 0 defeat
but they have not lost in the premier league and fa cup since then and even on that day you could see they were on to something
they had six one - on - one opportunities and should not have lost the game
it is a shrewd system
i played it with england when we won le tournoi in france in 1997 , when i had merson and scholes behind ian wright and two holding midfield players behind them
those two in the pocket â the merson / scholes pairing in my team or two of adam lallana , coutinho and raheem sterling for liverpool â have the freedom to get wide , to move in front of wing - backs or to go inside into positions that threaten in the box
adam lallana and coutinho have done it particularly well
that system has turned their results around
liverpool manager rodgers talks to midfielder adam lallana at training ahead of the visit of united rodgers issues instructions to his players before a training session at melwood on friday glenn hoddle played three at the back when he was england manager the shock factor : why liverpool âs 3 - 4 - 3 works ... the key is that no one else plays it
i watched the 2 - 2 draw against arsenal in december and although liverpool equalised in the last minute , it was clear that arsenal did nât have a clue how to play the system
liverpool had 63 per cent of the possession
and i doubt that âs ever happened to a team of arsene wenger âs playing with 11 men
liverpool can push the front three up to press the opposition high up the pitch
the wing - backs do nât have to get back and cover as much as a full - back does , so they can be right in behind and the side has five , six or even seven pressing up top
it has restored the energy to liverpool âs game , enabled them to pin teams back and to dominate possession
suddenly , they looked like the 2013 - 14 side
if you need to defend , you can drop deep and have a back five , so the system has flexibility
but liverpool usually deploy it in a positive fashion and the way in which it uses space to ensure that everyone has an option means it is incredibly hard to play against
martin skrtel heads the equaliser in injury time during the 2 - 2 draw with arsenal back in december arsene wenger tries to organise his arsenal side as they relinquished 63 per cent possession to liverpool ... but louis van gaal âs back three does nât work louis van gaal has used a back three several times in his career â in his ajax team that won the champions league , at barcelona and very successfully in the world cup with holland
but at united he has nât been able to deploy it with the success that rodgers has at liverpool
the key for me is that your back three need to be able to accept the ball and move it even under pressure
liverpool are prepared to give their defenders the ball under pressure and they âve been comfortable with that
that âs why emre can , initially signed as a midfielder , has been so important
his technique on the ball gives them a safety valve in possession at the back
united , with the likes of chris smalling , phil jones and jonny evans , have not succeeded because they are not comfortable in possession under pressure
therefore the system has nât proved to be an attacking springboard and can slow down their game
rodgers has deployed emre can , originally signed as a midfielder , as one of the back three louis van gaal has also used three at the back with united but has not enjoyed success like rodgers the likes of chris smalling ( above ) and jonny evans are not accomplished enough on the ball united have hit on a system to match rodgers sunday âs match against tottenham saw united produce an impressive performance when they looked to be back to where they should be for the first time this season
after their best results earlier in the season â the 3 - 0 win over liverpool , the 2 - 1 win at arsenal or the 2 - 1 win at southampton â they will have come away thinking : â how did we do that ? without david de gea we would have been struggling ! â but after the tottenham game , for the first time in a long time , they would have come off knowing that they dominated the game and that they had deserved their victory
that âs why i believe van gaal will stick with this format for a while , although it might need a tweak at anfield
it looks very similar to the ajax system of the early nineties
fellaini produced a smart finish to open the scoring against tottenham last weekend carrick showed no hesitation in celebrating against his former club after finding the net last sunday they played one holding player against tottenham â and having carrick back in that role really makes a difference â with herrera and fellaini as the inside right and left
juan mata and ashley young played so wide it reminded me of finidi george and marc overmars in van gaal âs ajax days
and i can see angel di maria doing that job as his confidence returns
juan mata had to stay wide , which is not his natural game , but that gave space to inside forwards
tottenham could not deal with that and felliani killed them off
they âll try to do that against liverpool âs wingbacks and pin them back
but united must ensure an extra player drops in deep alongside carrick , especially in that opening 20 minutes
i would not want to get stretched
at the right time you can press with three players in attacking positions through rooney , herrera and fellaini
but initially i would drop players deep and tell rooney to save his energy for the times when united have the ball
ashley young and juan mata played so wide against tottenham just like marc overmars and finidi george did for ajax under van gaal but it âs liverpool who now have the momentum liverpool âs win at swansea on monday was so important
if they had not won , they would have needed a win on saturday to stay in touch
now they can use this game as a springboard to the top four
win and they âre in the driving seat
they have the momentum at the right time ; their confidence is sky high
they are in the fa cup with a replay at blackburn to overcome
suddenly the season looks like it could have the potential to match last year
certainly a trophy and top - four finish was unthinkable when these teams last met
not so now , largely thanks to rodgers âs tactical rethink
on sunday at the nou camp we have the privilege of watching two of the very best when barcelona take on real madrid and messi comes up against cristiano ronaldo
but what we saw on wednesday night against manchester city has confirmed my opinion that at his very best , messi is the better player
his feet are so quick and his ability to manipulate the ball at speed is up there with maradona
what i would say is that , though messi is better when both are at their best , if they âre in a relatively unsatisfactory run of form , then cristiano ronaldo is the better player
in those periods he gives you more than sheer skill
he still contributes in other areas , with his athleticism and strength
but for me , messi is a better player
messi has been in superb form for barcelona since the turn of the year messi put in a man of the match display against manchester city in the champions league on wednesday messi trains on saturday ahead of sunday 's crunch clasico against real madrid cristiano ronaldo 's form has dipped , compared to his own high standards since winning the ballon d'or the greatest ? of the players i âve seen and played against it âs maradona
his ability to take players on with the ball seemingly stuck to his feet as he weaved around him was sublime
only messi really has come close to that
he was better than messi at free - kicks
maradona and michel platini and zico were probably the best at free - kicks and all ahead of messi in that particular discipline
but people who have nât seen maradona play should check out the dvds and watch him on youtube
can you imagine maradona today , on these pristine pitches , with the lighter , more malleable footballs , protected from the hard men by the much tougher rules of the game and in an era in which man - to - man marking has fallen out of fashion ? i would love to see that
my word , what a sight that would be .
