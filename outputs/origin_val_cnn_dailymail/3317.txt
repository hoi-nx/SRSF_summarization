mourinho insists arsenal can mount a late charge to win the premier league title , however statistics from the last 10 years show chelsea tend to finish the season off in fine form
premier league leaders chelsea have dropped an average of just 8.6 points per season during the last 10 years
if the blues replicate the form they have shown in their last 10 games during previous seasons then man city will not be able to retain the league title even if they claim nine consecutive wins
chelsea look set to win the 2014 - 15 premier league title as the blues tend to finish the season off in fine form chelsea dropped two points against southampton at the weekend but are still odds - on favourites to win the title mourinho insists arsenal have joined chelsea and man city in the premier league title race 2013 - 14 : 11 points dropped 12 - 13 : 7 11 - 12 : 15 10 - 11 : 10 09 - 10 : 5 08 - 09 : 6 07 - 08 : 10 06 - 07 : 11 05 - 06 : 6 average : 8.6 points dropped chelsea are seven points clear of man city with a game in hand of both their title rivals arsenal are even further behind as they are currently seven points behind premier league leaders chelsea , having played a game less than the gunners
however mourinho said after his side 's 1 - 1 draw with southampton : â of course arsenal are in it
they are seven points behind chelsea , but have one less match to play than chelsea
â both man city and arsenal are in the title race
it depends on the momentum for arsenal - the 3 - 1 defeat against monaco or the 3 - 0 defeat against west ham ? â so the danger is always there
but i keep saying , we are there
if someone had told me in august that , at the end of march , we 'd be six points in front with a match in hand , i 'd have signed for that immediately
' chelsea would finish the season off with over 85 points ( 85.4 to be exact ) if history is to repeat itself - based on the average number of points they have dropped in their last 10 games of the season
the maximum amount of points man city can ascertain is 85 and that would mean manuel pellegrini 's side defeating the likes of man united , tottenham and southampton
arsenal , on the other hand , will be on 84 points if they win their remaining nine fixtures of the campaign
so it appears mourinho 's statement on arsenal 's title credentials may have just been a ploy to ease the pressure on his players following their draw against southampton
