a 19 - year - old mother burst into tears when the prosecutor demanded she spend 15 years in a bali prison today - but spared her the death penalty
heather mack and her 21 - year - old boyfriend tommy schaefer were in court accused of murdering heather mack 's mother , sheila von wiese in a plush bali hotel last august and then stuffing her body in a suitcase
the prosecution at denpasar district court also want tommy schaefer to be sentenced to 18 years in jail and tears rolled down his face when he heard the news through an interpreter
since being held in jail , the 19 - year - old from chicago has been keeping her 15 - day old baby , stella , with her in the crowded cell in bali 's kerobokan
in a bizarre comment from her holding cell today , mack said with a grin that stella has six fingers on her left hand , saying : ' but do n't worry , she 's ok , thank you
' as she waited in the cell , nervously puffing on a cigarette , mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married ' in spirit '
she said : ' he has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison
she held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring
' tommy 's is blue , ' she added
it will now be up to the defence team to try to get the sentence reduced , or even thrown out
the court will resume next week when the defence begins its case
jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime

the extra fingers or toes may be small and non-functional , or they may be fully formed with bones and joints
extra digits can exist in different places on the hands and feet
extra digits can also be located in the centre of the hand or foot , and people with polydactyly often have extra digits on both hands or feet
polydactyly occurs when the body follows a different set of directions than usual while forming the hands or feet during development
it is inhertited and can be passed on by just one parent if they have the disorder
researchers are still discovering the genes that cause extra digits
but the trait may exist as part of a syndrome , which is a group of several recognisable clinical features that often occur together
