not quite as famous as â one - nil to the arsenal â was in its day , granted
but one - nil is â the spain scoreline â
it âs the margin via which , according to the scorer iniesta , spain regained self - esteem and belief by winning at old trafford in 2007
beating england , to those who were charged by luis aragonã©s with installing a â new â form of play , put spain on the map again , iniesta told me
italy and france both followed months later â old foes , bogey teams
one - nil , one - nil
alvaro morata capped his spain debut with the winner against ukraine on friday night one - nil , the scoreline , against the usa which saw spain booed out of the country before euro 2008
one - nil , the scoreline which gave them a technical knockout against germany in the confederations cup final a couple of weeks later â narrow margin , total control
portugal , paraguay , germany , holland â four games , four goals , four clean sheets
one - nil to spain , world champions 2010
they had it within their repertoire to hit threes , fours , fives
but the single - goal win was a trademark
own the ball , own the midfield , get the advantage , never look like conceding
but , friday night in seville at the beginning of holy week ( holy week ) was something different
one - nil over ukraine
a record 97th international match without conceding for â saint â casillas
a debut goal , after only 38 competitive minutes , for alvaro morata
in touch with group c leaders slovakia , who are the next home opponents â in oviedo in september
the bare bones look good
the full x-ray much less so
alvaro morata has all the hallmarks of an old style centre - forward who finishes on another night , one of those â accident nights â which hit every team every so often , spain would have lost this one
on another night , ruslan rotan would have had a hat - trick
on this night , there was the sight of the del bosque , for whom the game left â a bad taste in the mouth â , throwing his hands up in the air at the naivety and imprecision of the second half and roaring at his team : â what are you playing at lads ? â transition
it can be a glorious , strategic , rewarding process â or an unmanaged , inglorious , frustrating decline
quite where spain are in that process is debatable
for seven years between 2007 and 2014 , they dictated
but , just as when all dictatorships are overthrown , the subjects have had a good time stamping on the statues
brazil in the confederations cup final , holland at the world cup â spain were to be bullied , pushed around , made to chase , pressed to within an inch of their lives
the striker has struck up a ' thing ' with pirlo at juventus but there âs no doubt that renovation is afoot
isco , madrid âs gem of a midfielder , should have been at the world cup , should probably have been a starter
koke , dynamic , aggressive , intelligent â the heartbeat of an atlã©tico madrid side which won the spanish title and came within seconds of winning the champions league â is now a fixture
debuts have been given to costa , juan bernat , paco alcã¡cer and david de gea , while everyone waits for javi martã­nez and thiago alcã¡ntara to get fit
yet spain , europe âs reigning champions , are fighting for their dignity and automatic qualification from this group because they could not control a 1 - 1 situation in slovakia last year
they are sore and should be contemplating this midweek âs friendly against holland with queries in their minds because they could neither augment , nor control , friday night âs 28th - minute lead against a ukraine side which at first came to defend and play on the break
then , sniffing glory , piled runners forward through the spain midfield , robbing possession and launching assaults on casillas â goal
it all makes the scorer much more interesting
what spain require , even above some restored arrogance and self - confidence , even above key players avoiding injury , is for a prolific striker to emerge
alvaro morata has also been likened to madrid and france striker benzema in raãºl âs day , his goals patched up the fact that spain did nât have a world - class xi. good , but not great
when david villa and fernando torres took charge they would , regularly , add the goal or goals which gave sense , confidence , and purpose to spain controlling play via xavi , david silva , iniesta , xabi alonso , marcos senna and sergio busquets
costa â if del bosque accepts that more direct , more vertical football , quarter - backed by cesc fabregas , is central to the renovation â may become vital
meantime there âs alvaro morata â once of madrid , lately of juventus
his former madrid mentor , michel , himself a mighty forward , recently said that alvaro morata , whose debut goal on friday was more valuable than it was beautiful , was â part van marco van basten , part benzema â
it âs meant to mean that he has the direct no 9 repertoire which accounts for his 32 goals for spain at junior levels and his tournament top - scoring performance last time la rojita won the european under-21 championship
holland 's marco van basten is regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time equally , it speaks of his awareness of space and how to profit from it
â sometimes you have to really â love â football to understand strikers , â he says
â to understand , or spot , their movements behind strikers , the process of â opening up a defence â
â some people ca nât see it
some think that if you have nât scored you âve not had a good game
right now , first - touch , fluid , strategic football is in fashion â the old style centre - forward who finishes but is static is a vanishing species
if you do nât have much more to your game , you wo nât play
â when he did get to play he chose the no 7 for his back
with spain , just like at manchester united , that âs a special number
it belonged to raãºl , record scorer until along came villa â now spain âs record scorer , and not formally retired
â i dream of scoring my first goal for spain , â alvaro morata said on thursday
then : â i was angry at myself for missing an earlier chance , so i did nât really celebrate when i scored , â he told me on friday evening after the dream arrived
at juventus , he has struck up a â thing â with pirlo
â he never looks up when he hits you a first - time pass , but you learn
â just as he did against ukraine to sprint onto koke âs volley - pass
some of spain âs transition will be played out through the talents of this guy
