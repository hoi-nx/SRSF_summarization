a video has been released which appears to show rooney being knocked out cold by former manchester united team - mate bardsley
the old trafford captain and the stoke defender pulled on gloves during a night - in at rooney 's cheshire mansion last month - but bardsley 's wife tanya dismissed the incident as a joke
with only a small space in which to work in rooney 's lounge , the pair trade light blows for just under a minute before bardsley sends rooney reeling
the england striker lies motionless under a chair for several seconds before the video , obtained by the sun , cuts out
rooney , a big boxing fan , posted this picture on his instagram with professional boxer paul smith bardsley 's wife tanya moved to defuse the furore by claiming the video had been a joke ' rooney had everybody worried when he hit the floor like that , ' a source told the newspaper
' he made such a thud when he went down and he was just on his back with his eyes closed , not moving
' people were scared he had really banged his head and done some lasting damage
' everyone realised it was a stupid thing to do , but they just got carried away
' bardsley 's wife tanya later hit back at the furore caused by the release of the video
she tweeted : ' seen the sun , 2 mates havin a laugh video does n't show rooney jumping straight up and laughing with phil # cleveredit
' the video is believed to have been filmed on february 22 , the day after manchester united lost 2 - 1 at swansea
rooney is wearing a pair of white adidas gloves while bardsley pulls on a pink pair
they appear to be sparring gloves rather than the smaller , less padded sets worn in professional fights
neither man has a headguard on and while bardsley is wearing shoes , rooney is in his socks
after touching gloves , they circle each other before bardsley throws a left hand
rooney paws back without connecting
bardsley is the more aggressive throughout , and tries to go for rooney 's body , pushing him back
the pair separate but again bardsley comes on strongly , landing a right uppercut
rooney tries to respond but misses wildly before his former team - mate bides his time and throws the shot that sends rooney backwards , narrowly avoiding a chair as he hits the deck
the incident could leave rooney with some uncomfortable questions to answer from manchester united chiefs over his choice of extra-curricular activities
given he skipper 's manchester united , the forward is a regular for louis van gaal 's men
and the manchester united manager is unlikely to be impressed with rooney for partaking in such dangerous activities prior to matches and training
rooney returned to action six days later , scoring a double against sunderland

' when asked by one twitter user whether he would consider fighting rooney for charity , woodhouse replied : ' when he wakes up maybe '
rooney comes from a big boxing background and is often photographed at ringside during high - profile bouts
speaking seven years ago , rooney said his boxing training as a youngster helped his football career
' i think my boxing training was beneficial in my development as a footballer , especially breaking through to the premier league at such a young age , ' he said
' i needed that extra bit of strength that the boxing training had given me
it made it easier to play than it might have been and it 's helped me with the way my game is now
' all through my life - from the ages of six , seven and eight - when big fights were on television , i used to stay up with my dad to watch them
' i 've always loved watching boxing and i went boxing training for about three or four years when i was younger
it 's a sport i 've always been involved in
' i was doing both boxing and football training at one stage when i was about 15
but everton who i was with at the time , said i had to concentrate on one of them and i opted for football
