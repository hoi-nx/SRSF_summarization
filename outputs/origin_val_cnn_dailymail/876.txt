the pair tangled during the first half at st james ' park and appeared to aim kicks at each other before the situation turned even more unsavoury
evans appears to launch spit in the direction of the floored newcastle striker cisse subsequently retaliates , and appears to aim spit of his own back at the manchester united man evans ( left ) and cisse clash near the half - way line at st james ' park following the unpleasant set - to the fa are waiting for referee anthony taylor 's report

as cisse climbed to his feet , tv footage appeared to show evans spitting down on the floor in the direction of his opponent
cisse reacted by putting his head towards evans and seemed to spit back at him , although it is not clear if it landed on the northern ireland international
the referee missed the incident meaning the fa , who are waiting for anthony taylor 's report , can ban the pair retrospectively for six games each
last season hull city striker george boyd was banned for three matches after being found guilty of spitting at manchester city goalkeeper joe hart
however , the fa upped the punishment for spitting to six games to come in line with new fifa guidelines , which state that any player ' dismissed from the field of play for spitting at an opponent or any other person ' will be suspended ' following the match in which he was sent off until such time as his club has completed its next six matches in approved competitions
' if found guilty , cisse will be banned for an extra game because of a previous violent conduct ban for elbowing everton âs seamus coleman
afterwards , van gaal defended evans
â i did not see that ( incident ) from the bench , but i can not imagine he would do that , â said the dutchman
newcastle head coach carver said : â you ca n't do it can you ? it 's one of the worst things in football
but i ca n't comment on it , i just know there was a fracas on the halfway line and i need to have a look at it
â neither player was booked at the time by referee anthony taylor , who awarded a free - kick to newcastle for the original tangle , but if the official missed the spitting incident the pair could face retrospective action from the fa
the senegalese striker points the finger at manchester united 's defender after the incident tempers threaten to boil over as team - mates from newcastle and manchester united gather on the pitch former manchester united midfielder scholes , covering the match as a pundit for bt sport , slammed cisse while suggesting evans was nât a guilty party
â i think evans is spitting on the floor
i know evans , he âs not that type of person , â he said
â if he wants to do that then it âs not hard to miss , is it ? he âs only stood a yard away from him
what cisse does afterwards is unforgivable
â scholes â colleague , ex-liverpool and real madrid star steve mcmanaman , said : â i âd like to think he ( evans ) is spitting at the floor and not at cisse
but then cisse stands up and spits right at evans â neck from about six inches
â van gaal , meanwhile , was relieved to see ashley young steal three points on a night when all of the top four won
â i was very pleased with the win , especially here , â he said
â i lost here as a coach of barcelona and az alkmaar
i knew it was difficult and ryan giggs said there is a lot of pressure from the crowd
but we made the crowd quiet
the players share heated moments at st james ' park as they exchange points of view â but we do nât reward ourselves ( with goals )
if you do nât reward yourselves you can get negative results and david de gea had to make two fantastic saves
â it was important to win after you see all of the results of our competitors in our rat race
â everyone is now full of confidence going into the fa cup game with arsenal
â as for carver , he was furious that newcastle were denied an early penalty when chris smalling fouled emmanuel riviere
â it âs frustrating and i âm so disappointed for the guys , â he said
â for 89 minutes we were outstanding but we do nât have world - class players like they do
â to concede like we did is disappointing but what is more disappointing is the blatant penalty in the first half which was not given
anthony taylor is a human - being and he âs missed it
that would have set us up nicely
