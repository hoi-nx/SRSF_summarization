his lack of goalscoring early on in his barcelona career might have drawn some critics , but luis suarez is the best signing of the season in terms of chance creation - ahead even of premier league assists king cesc fabregas
cies football observatory have compiled the top 12 signings of the season in the top five european leagues for rigour , take - ons , recovery , chance creation , distribution and shooting - using statistics to analyse and narrow them down
and Â£ 75million summer buy luis suarez comes out on top in the ' chance creation ' category ahead of two of the premier league 's finest , cesc fabregas and swansea 's gylfi sigurdsson
luis suarez has been the best signing in terms of chance creation this season , say cies football observatory cesc fabregas is in second place on the ' chance creation ' indicator despite his 15 league this season here are how the cies football observatory key performance indicators ( kpis ) work : chance creation : ability to put team - mates in a good position to score
shooting : ability to take advantage of goal opportunities through accurate shooting
take on : ability to create dangerous situations by successfully challenging opponents
distribution : ability to keep a hold on the game through efficient passing
recovery : ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through proficient interception work
rigour : ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through robust duelling
luis suarez seems to finally be finding his feet at the nou camp , and he scored twice in the 2 - 1 win at manchester city in the first leg of barcelona 's champions league last - 16 tie - but it 's his work in support of team - mates which has really impressed his manager and supporters since his summer arrival
he has scored just 10 times in all competitions in 24 games , but there is no crisis because of a love for the new luis suarez â the one who makes their all - star front three of him , lionel messi and neymar tick
that new - found selflessness puts him ahead of cesc fabregas in terms of chance creation - despite the chelsea star 's 15 assists in the premier league this season
that has obviously come at a sacrifice though , and luis suarez has n't been able to get close to the no 1 signing in the shooting category : chelsea 's diego costa

felipe caicedo chelsea atletico fiorentina villarreal eibar luis suarez has moved from a goalscorer role to that of a provider since moving to barcelona in the summer diego costa ( left ) and cesc fabregas ( right ) have formed a deadly combination for chelsea since signing diego costa is tops the rankings for ' shooting ' as shown here by his fierce effort leading to a goal against tottenham hotspur an impressive 17 league goals put diego costa top ahead of atletico 's antoine griezmann top scorer in the premier league with 17 league goals , and having played a key part in the blues ' capital one cup triumph against tottenham hotspur on sunday , nobody would contest that Â£ 32m diego costa has settled perfectly into the stamford bridge set - up
behind him is atletico 's antoine griezmann who looked to have been signed primarily as the creative force to feed another signing , mario mandzukic , but instead has been showing his own goalscoring prowess in a more advanced role
some more surprising names in that list come from fiorentina , villarreal and eibar in the form of khouma babacar , luciano vietto and felipe caicedo respectively - with west ham 's bargain buy diafra sakho coming in just outside the top five in seventh
sanchez , despite his recent drought , is 12th

cesc fabregas is only ousted in the list focused on efficient passing by bayern munich 's xabi alonso , who is top ahead of his replacement at real madrid , toni kroos , in third
inter milan 's gary medel , who signed from relegation cardiff city in the summer is fourth with ivan rakitic fifth
players from the premier league dominate the ' take on ' group , with angel di maria ( second ) , sanchez ( third ) and sadio mane ( fifth ) - although all fall in the wake of bayer leverkusen trickster , and reported manchester united target , karim bellarabi

ermin bicakcic liverpool roma burnley celta vigo hoffenheim walter gargano ( right ) looks to have been a top signing for napoli if you trust his recovery stats dejan lovren ( left ) surprisingly tops the ' rigour ' category despite a difficult first season with liverpool burnley 's michael keane ( left ) is another surprise name on that list after moving from manchester united while there are some surprise names on the lists , perhaps the biggest is liverpool 's Â£ 20m centre back dejan lovren , who somehow finishes top of the ' rigour ' category for ' ability to minimise goal opportunities for opponents through robust duelling '
dejan lovren , widely regarded as a transfer flop , finishes ahead of roma 's davide astori - who also scored highly in the ' recovery ' category - and burnley 's michael keane
and rafael benitez seems to have done good business in signing walter gargano for napoli
he tops the ' recovery ' category with only one english - based player in the top 12 , manchester united 's daley blind - in 12th place
manchester united 's daley blind is the only top 12 player in terms of ' recovery ' from the premier league
