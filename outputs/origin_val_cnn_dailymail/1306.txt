with 40 per cent of uk choosing not to go on holiday abroad in the past year , it makes sense that the latest host of a tv show being jetted off to exotic locations does n't want to be there either
research conducted for channel 4 's new magazine - style show travel man claims 40 per cent of brits have either chosen to take their breaks within the uk or did n't want to go overseas this year
the same survey found 30 per cent of respondents , chosen to reflect a cross section of society , have n't left uk for the past five years while one in 10 brits have never been overseas richard ayoade host richard ayoade and his guest for the show 's first episode , 48 hours in barcelona a significant 40 per cent of uk did n't go overseas for their holiday in the past year , says a survey the stress of it all is a big reason for this say 31 per cent of the survey subjects , a sentiment richard ayoade can relate to on his mission to make the most of his destinations without the hassle
in the four - part series richard ayoade travels with a celebrity guest to iceland , istanbul , marrakech and barcelona , where his journey begins with similarly non-plussed traveller kathy
his other celebrity travel companions for subsequent episodes are comedian adam hills , actress jessica hynes and actor stephen mangan much like his other show gadget man 's attitude to life in general , richard ayoade aims to get the most he can out of a holiday in the least time
in barcelona , richard ayoade is particularly unimpressed by the museum at the home of lionel messi 's barcelona , the nou camp , owing to his total disinterest in football
the channel 4 survey for richard ayoade found that 31 per cent of people find the stress of holidays a deterrent despite walking being a perfectly effective way to get around the city , richard ayoade opts for a trixi pedicab tour to take in sights such as the christopher columbus monument , santa maria church , and the nou camp as efficiently as they can
to get to barcelonetta beach , richard ayoade goes for a cable car instead of going by car with kathy
in istanbul with adam hills , they go to the historic hagia sophia just before closing time to avoid the crowds and uses the triposo app to ensure all the necessary information he needs is at his fingertips
burke and richard ayoade visit the nou camp , home to barcelona , during the first episode of the new show and to see as much of marrakech as possible in a short period of time with stephen magain , richard ayoade takes a hot - air balloon ride , use a compass - like trekking guide to find their way around the busy souks and a currency converter app to aid with haggling
there is no short cut , however , when the pair appear to liven up during a cava tasting - by actually tasting the famed catalan sparkling wine
the show 's survey found 80 per cent of brits prefer to test out local food and drink when they go abroad , and 60 per cent attempt to pick up some of the language of the place they 're in
reluctant traveller richard ayoade looks for short - cuts on holiday such as the cable car to barcelonetta beach perhaps a surprise to many is that only 32 per cent of brits will chose a break at the beach over a city break while 38 per cent of respondents have been back to a previous holiday destination
australia is apparently the dream holiday destination for uk residents , however 23 per cent of us always choose somewhere within europe to take leave time
age and geography are other significant factor for travel , with 16 to 34 - year - olds going on holiday the most ( more than twice in the last year )
