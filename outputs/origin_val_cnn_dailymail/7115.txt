lawyers for boston marathon bomber tsarnaev rested their case in his federal death penalty trial tuesday after presenting a brief case aimed at showing his late older brother was the mastermind of the 2013 terror attack
the defense admitted during opening statements that tsarnaev participated in the bombings , but tsarnaev 's lawyer said he was a troubled 19 - year - old who had fallen under the influence of his radicalized brother , tamerlan , 26
closing arguments will be held next monday , april 6
if the jury convicts tsarnaev â an event that seems a foregone conclusion because of his admitted guilt â the same jury will be asked to decide whether he should be executed or spend the rest of his life in prison
during its brief case , the defense called a cell site analyst who showed that tsarnaev was at the university of massachusetts-dartmouth when tamerlan purchased components of the two bombs used in the 2013 attack , including pressure cookers and bbs
they also called mark spencer , a digital forensics expert , who testified about tamerlan âs computer history and his fascination with jihadist literature and learning how to construct bombs
tsarnaev 's lawyer told jurors that it was tamerlan who shot and killed mit police officer collier three days after the bombings
tamerlan died after a gun battle with police hours after collier 's slaying
an fbi photographer was also called in hopes of showing that tsarnaev did not target specific individuals with the bombs
fbi fingerprint examiner elaina graff was the fourth witness , who testified that tamerlan 's prints were found on a transmitter , a pressure cooker lid , a jar of nails , a caulking gun , rolls of duct tape and a soldering iron , and tsarnaev 's prints were found on just on a container of gunpowder found near the scene of his shootout with police
she did state however that prints could easily be destroyed in an explosion
file - this undated file photo provided by the fbi shows dzhokhar tsarnaev , charged in the boston marathon bombing prosecutors called more than 90 witnesses over 15 days of testimony , including bombing survivors who described losing limbs in the attack
three people were killed and more than 260 were wounded when two pressure cooker bombs exploded near the marathon finish line on april 15 , 2013
jurors saw gruesome autopsy photos of the three killed : 8 - year - old martin richard , a boston boy who had gone to the marathon with his family that day ; 23 - year - old lingzi lu , a graduate student from china who was studying at boston university ; and 29 - year - old krystle campbell , a 29 - year - old restaurant manager .
