twitter has admitted it needs to get tougher on trolls and has already introduced new ways to report abuse to weed out the perpetrators
but now it 's taking aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the site
its rules now say that users must not ' post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent '
twitter 's rules have been updated in an attempt to clamp down on revenge porn
under ' private information ' ( pictured ) the guidelines now say that users must not ' post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject 's consent '
the site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users the changes were spotted by buzzfeednews , which recently submitted a q&a to reddit when the community site took a similar stance against pornographic posts
twitter has used these questions to address the changes
both twitter 's rules and abusive behaviour policy have been updated to reflect these changes
twitter said that an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent
in february a law was passed that made posting revenge porn images and videos a criminal offence in england and wales
both scotland and northern ireland are considering similar laws
under the rules , revenge porn is considered : ' photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed , where what is shown would not usually be seen in public '
it covers images shared without the subject 's permission and ' with the intent to cause harm
offenders face up to two years in jail
this follows laws in sixteen us states - including alaska , california , new jersey and texas - explicitly relating to revenge porn
under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can , in theory , distribute it as they see fit but twitter 's rules additionally considers the people in the footage
it will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission
twitter said ' agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy ' , including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders
' users who believe that content they post has been incorrectly identified is violating the policy can appeal the decision and agents will review that request as well , ' said the firm
' content that is identified as violating our policy will be hidden from public view and users posting it will have their accounts locked ; those users will be required to delete the content in question before being able to return to the platform
' users posting such content with an intent to harass will be subject to suspension from twitter
' the changes follow reports twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers
this means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details twitter will be able to intervene
reports recently claimed twitter will start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers
when people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number ( pictured )
in the future , twitter may ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number stories of abuse , threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on twitter in recent years
robin williams ' daughter , zelda williams , left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father 's suicide
feminist critic anita sarkeesian was threatened with rape , sexual violence and death by twitter trolls during the ' gamergate ' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games
in the uk , journalist criado-perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce jane austen as the new face of the Â£ 10 note
twitter users isabella sorley and john nimmo admitted sending the messages to ms criado-perez and both were jailed last year
when people sign up to twitter they are required to provide an email address , which is then validated
adding a phone number is an optional step and is predominantly used if people want to receive text notifications or setup two - step verification
under the reported plans , once a user is banned these email addresses and phone numbers will be stored and cross-referenced each time a new user signs up to the site
last month an internal memo sent by twitter 's chief executive dick costolo revealed the 51 - year - old thinks his site ' sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls '
in the memo , mr dick costolo said he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future
mr dick costolo 's comments were posted on an internal forum among twitter employees , after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse
in december , a blog post titled ' building a safer twitter ' revealed twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse

mailonline has contacted twitter for more information about how users details will be stored under the malicious communications act 1988 , any ' indecent or grossly offensive ' message that causes ' distress or anxiety ' to the recipient can lead to prosecution
the maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than Â£ 2,500
since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet , e-mail and social networking , prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge twitter trolls
student liam stacey , who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer fabrice muamba collapsed , was charged under the crime and disorder act
two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the serious crime act , and paul chambers , who joked he would blow doncaster airport ' sky high ' was charged under the communications act 2003

tina bhatnagar , twitter 's vice president of user services said : ' over the last six months , in addition to the product changes , we have overhauled how we review user reports about abuse
' overall , we now review five times as many user reports as we did previously , and we have tripled the size of the support team focused on handling abuse reports
' we are also beginning to add several new enforcement actions for use against accounts that violate our rules
these new actions will not be visible to the vast majority of rule - abiding twitter users - but they give us new options for acting against the accounts that do n't follow the rules and serve to discourage behavior that goes against our policies
the safety of our users is extremely important to us
it 's something we continue to work hard to improve
' in recent years twitter has come under fire for failing to protect its users from trolls
