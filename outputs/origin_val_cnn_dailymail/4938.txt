amazon has won united states federal regulators ' approval to test its drone delivery service
the e-commerce giant hopes to speed packages to customers through the air - despite public concern over the safety and privacy implications
the faa said on thursday it had issued an experimental airworthiness certificate to an amazon unit and its prototype drone design , allowing it to conduct outdoor test flights on private , rural land in washington state
the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds
about 86 percent of amazon 's deliveries are 5 pounds or less , the company said
' we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making prime air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' amazon has said
the experimental certificate applies to a particular drone design and amazon must obtain a new certification for test flights if it modifies the drone
in return , the company must supply monthly data to the regulators , and conduct flights at 400 feet ( 120 metres ) or below and in ' visual meteorological conditions , ' according to the faa 's certificate
the drone operators must also have a private pilots ' license and current medical certification
amazon chief executive jeff bezos wants to use drones - small unmanned aircraft - to deliver packages as part of a program dubbed ' prime air
' the company is developing drones that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour ( 80 kph ) , operate autonomously and sense and avoid objects
amazon sought permission from the faa to test drones in outdoor areas near seattle , where one of its research and development labs is working on the technology
the company has conducted test flights outside the united states , in countries with looser restrictions
in february , the faa proposed long - awaited rules to try to set universal guidelines for drones , addressing growing interest from both individual and corporations in using unmanned aerial vehicles
the draft rules , nearly 10 years in the making , still must undergo public comment and revision before becoming final , a process expected to take at least a year
amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment
it has previously threatened to take its testing outside the united states
' in the absence of a timely approval by the faa to conduct outdoor testing , we have begun utilizing outdoor testing facilities outside the united states , ' amazon vice president paul misener said in a letter to the faa
' these non-us facilities enable us to quickly build and modify our prime air vehicles as we construct new designs and make improvements , ' he said .
