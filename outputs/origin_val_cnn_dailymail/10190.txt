ask andy murray about the most memorable victories in his career and quickly revealed are two aspects of his character â the modest and the contrarian
there is no mention of ending britain âs wimbledon men âs singles drought , nor the similar emulating of fred perry at the us open , nor the flaying he gave roger federer on centre court to win the olympic gold medal
instead , he refers to a win over an obscure journeyman ranked no 110 in the world , and another at a now - defunct and largely - forgotten tournament in california
andy murray warms up for match against kevin anderson in miami on monday the subject arises because he has the opportunity to win a 500th professional singles match on tuesday , when he takes on south african âs world no 15 kevin anderson in the fourth round of the miami open
it comes around nearly 12 years after making his professional debut as a 15 - year - old in manchester
he began with a victory over moodie , another south african
moodie was only just outside the top 100 at the time , so it was a fair indication of his opponent âs outstanding promise
andy murray does not mention that one , but recalls two of the matches that set him on his way , and most clearly the period when he was trying to establish himself on the main atp
â i remember certain wins , like the first one i had at queen âs ( at the then stella artois championships in 2005 ) against santiago ventura , â he says , referring to the then world no 110
â it might seem irrelevant now but at the time , for me , that was huge
it was big for my confidence , gave me a sense of belonging
i really remember those first few events on the tour , more than some of those in the last three or four years
coach amelie mauresmo takes a photo of andy murray during practice session â i can remember the players i played against around then
i went to newport ( rhode island ) after my first wimbledon and then i played in indianapolis and cincinnati
â by the end of that summer , not long after turning 18 , he was already knocking on the door of the top 100 and had beaten three players inside the top 30
early in 2006 comes the other match he picks out , the final of the indoor san jose open , where he beat former wimbledon champion lleyton
â that was a first atp title for me and was really important , â he says
â i was without a coach , only 18 , and lleyton was someone i loved watching growing up
to win 7 - 6 in the third set at that age against someone as good as him , with no coach there , privately meant a lot
â i did nât really feel the pressure â it was , â here i am , i âm 18 and playing an ex-no 1 in the world , a great player and nothing is expected â
â i played ( andy murray ) roddick in the semis and did nât feel nervous at all
it definitely changes over the years , you start to feel the expectation but then as you get older it changes again as you start to deal with the expectation and learn how to handle it
â andy murray takes time out to signs autographs for fans in miami on monday interestingly , ask which win took the most out of him and he instead cites one of his 155 defeats , the near five - hour loss in the 2012 australian open semi-final to djokovic
the serb subsequently managed probably the most talked about recovery in history , beating nadal two days later in nearly six hours to win the title
â against novak in the australian open was the hardest match , i âve no idea how he managed to recover and win the final
i literally could nât walk for four days
that was the match my body hurt the most after finishing
i was extremely sore , stiff , everything hurt
â andy murray is guaranteed to overtake nadal in next week âs rankings after his defeat on sunday by fernando verdasco
the spaniard heads to monte carlo to begin what is usually a triumphant roll through the european clay courts admitting he is lacking confidence and that he â needs to fix again â the nerves that have affected him this season
the 28 - year - old insisted there are no hidden physical issues behind his modest 15 - 5 record this year
normally the mere feel of the dirt under his feet imbues nadal with belief , and with djokovic targeting roland garros above all else this year , he will need all of that .
