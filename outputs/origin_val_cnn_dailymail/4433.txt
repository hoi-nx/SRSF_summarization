for earth - bound optical telescopes , the surface of venus is shrouded beneath thick clouds made mostly of carbon dioxide
to penetrate this veil , probes like the magellan spacecraft use radar to reveal remarkable features of the planet , such as mountains , craters , and volcanoes
but now , astronomers have combined the green bank telescope with the radar transmitter at the arecibo observatory to make remarkably detailed images of the planet 's surface from earth
pictured is a projection of the radar data of venus collected in 2012
striking surface features , like mountains and ridges , are easily seen
the black diagonal band at the center represents areas too close to the equator to obtain well - resolved image data the radar signals from arecibo observatory in puerto rico passed through both earth 's atmosphere and the atmosphere of venus
here they hit the surface and bounced back to be received by the green bank telescope in west virginia in a process known as bistatic radar
this capability is essential to study not only the surface as it appears now , but also to monitor it for changes
by comparing images taken at different periods in time , scientists hope to eventually detect signs of active volcanism
they believe images such as this could also reveal other dynamic geologic processes that could provide clues to venus 's geologic history and subsurface conditions
spain astronomers have revealed a new theory for a ' y ' shape on venus ( annotated image from the pioneer venus orbiter in 1979 shown )
they say it is formed by winds pushing a ' wave ' of clouds on the planet
these winds move faster at higher altitudes , creating the odd shape ' it is painstaking to compare radar images to search for evidence of change , ' said bruce campbell , a senior scientist at the smithsonian 's national air and space museum in washington , ' the work is ongoing
in the meantime , combining images from this and an earlier observing period is yielding a wealth of insight about other processes that alter the surface of venus
' venus is slightly smaller than earth but has a similar mass. it is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles ( 108 million kilometres ) , and takes about 225 days to orbit the sun. one day on venus lasts as long as 243 earth days
its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen , with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets
it 's believed that its atmosphere contributed to a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet inhospitable
the planet 's extreme high temperatures of almost 480 Â° c ( 900 â° f ) make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it
high - resolution radar images of venus were first obtained by arecibo observatory in 1988 and most recently by arecibo observatory and green bank telescope in 2012
when astronomers first started taking images of venus , they were somewhat baffled by a mysterious ' y ' shape that covered the entire planet
last week researchers say they have an answer - high intensity winds are distorting a ' wave ' of clouds to produce a stretched effect
the discovery could also reveal how similar processes take place on other slow - rotating bodies in the solar system
the latest theory was proposed by astronomers from the institute of astrophysics of andalusia ( iaa-csic ) in granada , spain , in collaboration with the university of the basque country and the institute of astrophysics and space sciences of portugal
on venus strong winds move the upper atmosphere 225 mph ( 360km/h ) , circling the planet every four to five earth days
but the planet itself takes almost 243 earth days to complete an orbit - meaning the winds are much faster than the rotation speed of the planet
the winds have a mostly constant speed at different latitude , but nearer the pole they circle the planet quicker as the circumference of the planet is smaller
this ultimately gives rise to this ' y ' shape , as the clouds at the top and bottom of the shape are moved more quickly
