the saying ' rome was n't built in a day ' could n't be more apt for super slimmer kirste crompton who has recently lost ten stone
it has taken one year , and lots of hard work , but the mother - of - five has transformed her body after running 1,820 miles on a treadmill at home â the exact distance from scotland to the italian capital
the 42 - year - old has also lost seven dress sizes in the process , taking her from a dangerous 21st and dress size 24 to a healthy and happy 11st and size 10
today , the housewife and mother runs an amazing 35 miles a week , has recently completed her first marathon and is now hoping to compete in a triathlon
she has also raised over Â£ 600 for the april jones trust , after befriending april 's mother , coral , on facebook
speaking at her home in bootle , liverpool she says : ' i ca n't believe how far i 've come
' less than a year ago i could barely walk , now i 'm running marathons and am as fit as a fiddle
' what 's more , i 'm an active mum and can actually play with my kids and take them swimming without my huge tummy getting in the way
i 'm a new person
' in april 2010 , kirste crompton , then 38 , was diagnosed with postnatal depression after giving birth to her youngest daughter , honey , now four
the mother - of - five rented a treadmill for Â£ 65 a month and turned her dining room into a home - gym she recalls : ' up until then i 'd been around 13st and a size 12 to 14
but following honey 's birth i fell into deep depression and struggled to get out of bed in the morning
' i turned to food for comfort and would lock myself in my room for hours eating
' kirste crompton 's devoted husband david crompton , 36 , a former soldier , looked after honey and kirste crompton 's other four children from a previous relationship : stockard , 9 , pacey , 11 , hermione , 13 and darcy , 16
at her lowest ebb , the mother - of - five was eating family - sized bags of crisps , drinking three bottles of white wine and eating saucepans full of pasta for dinner
' food was becoming an addiction , ' she continues , ' it was all i thought about
' within the space of four years , kirste crompton had ballooned from a size 12 to a 24 and was tipping the scales at 21 stone
she says : ' i was morbidly obese and was so ashamed of my wide girth i could n't face looking in the mirror or getting dressed in the mornings
kirste crompton , pictured on her wedding day , says she was once ' an embarrassment to my kids , ' ' more importantly , it was preventing me from being a good mother
i was so overweight i could n't pick honey up or play with my kids because my gigantic tummy was in the way
' kirste crompton explains that she was caught in a vicious circle : she felt guilty about her size which made her feel depressed and then turned to comfort food to make herself feel better
she says : ' i hated dropping the kids off at school because the other parents would stare at me and exchange looks
' i was obese and it was an embarrassment for my kids
' kirste crompton 's wake - up call came in february 2014 , nearly four years after giving birth to honey
she says : ' i was at home preparing dinner when another parent knocked on my front door
' there had been an altercation between our kids and we were trying to resolve it
but during her rant she called me a ' fat cow '
' i went bright red and felt like i was going to burst into tears , it was horrible
' in that moment , kirste crompton realised it was time to ditch the greasy snacks and calorific booze
too ashamed to be seen outside or exercise in a gym , she rented a Â£ 65 treadmill and turned her dining room into a home - gym
she says : ' it suited me perfectly because no one could watch me working out
' i downloaded a running training pack from online and started to do interval training
' walking for five minutes and then running for two
but it was very hard as i was so unfit
tosay the size 10 mother says that eating wholesome food also helped her to tackle her depression in just five months kirste crompton lost an incredible four stone and dropped from a size 24 to a size 16 , gaining the confidence to start running outside ' i tried to use it whenever i could , and when my fitness improved i started running for half an hour a day â covering 5km each time
' on top of her new exercise regime , kirste crompton totally changed her diet
she traded family - sized portions of spaghetti bolognese , cheese on toast , crisps and chocolate for fruit , yoghurt and low - calorie meals , and saw the weight start to drop off
on top of this , she stopped drinking white wine altogether , instead drinking water and fresh juice
she says : ' the exercise lifted my mood and i felt like a new person
' i was no longer suffering from sugar crashes and eating wholesome food evened out my moods and helped with my depression
' in just five months she lost an incredible four stone , dropping from a size 24 to a size 16 and developing a new hobby in the process
' i loved running , ' she says , ' i 'd developed a hobby and was becoming a good runner
' in july 2014 , weighing 17st , kirste crompton ran her first 10km race for bupa in 85 minutes
she said : ' it was a really hot day but i felt incredible afterwards
' today kirste crompton , now 11st , runs up to 35 miles a week and says that some people barely recognise her in the space of one year , kirste crompton has run 1,820 miles on her home treadmill , the equivalent of the distance from scotland to rome
she said : ' it 's incredible when i look at it like that
' this weekend i ran the wrexham marathon in six hours and 15 minutes
' before i would only run in the privacy of my home but now i run outside and feel great
' people barely recognise me , i 've changed beyond belief
' more importantly , i 'm healthy and happy and am an active mum to my kids
