tina fey 's follow - up to " 30 rock " is getting a lot of attention , not all of it good
her new netflix series , " the schmidt , " is being criticized online for dealing in offensive humor and stereotypes
the show , which had been picked up by nbc but ultimately dropped , stars ellie kemper ( " bridesmaids , " " the office " ) as an upbeat woman stuck in the 1990s after being kidnapped by a doomsday cult leader : not exactly fodder for humor , on its surface
after she 's released from an indiana bunker , kimmy moves to new york to start a life , and much of the humor comes from her misunderstanding of the modern world , her seventh - grade education and her relationships with a diverse cast of pals
since its debut , buzzfeed has declared that the show has a " major race problem , " and others criticized its treatment of an asian character named dong
slate says that the critics " are n't wrong ... but they are missing the point
" " tina fey 's high - wire act is all about the alchemy of making it ok to laugh at big , heavy issues -- like kidnapped women , the experience of undocumented vietnamese immigrants , and people with native american ancestry passing as white -- by skimming over them with a light touch , " arthur chu wrote on slate
the daily dot 's jacqueline wrote that she once hid her native american past , just like kimmy 's employer , a wealthy woman played by jane krakowski
jacqueline said that watching the show made her uncomfortable but at the same time praised tina fey 's " genius " writing
but tituss burgess , who plays kimmy 's black gay roommate , titus ( whom some have called a stereotype ) , says the whole controversy is " ridiculous
" he told the huffington post , " i just find it hilarious that people are trying to arrest us for doing the opposite of what everyone thinks we 're doing
" the show is certainly not afraid to go right up to the edge with jokes about race , age , class , gender and sexuality
consider these biting one - liners and bits of dialogue
