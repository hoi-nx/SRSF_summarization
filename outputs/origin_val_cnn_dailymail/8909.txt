' former footballer mckenzie celebrates his win with his family at the iconic york hall on saturday night boxing talent mckenzie has made the venue is home having fought all but one of his fights there boxing talent is very much in the blood for mckenzie
his father dad clinton , his trainer and cornerman here at york hall , is a former british and european light - welterweight champion
his uncle duke , meanwhile , remains british 's only modern three - weight world champion
in fact his father made his professional debut in this very ring in bethnal green in october 1976
then , in 1981 , dad clinton won his british title here too
it was also a happy hunting ground for uncle duke , who won both of his fights in this famous corner of the east end

but operating from behind his stiff southpaw jab , mckenzie dominated a cagey first round and occasionally found a home for his straight left to body
he maintained a composed pace in the second , evading ivan stupalo 's rare forward forays
mckenzie forced the croatia on to the ropes and ran out with a deserved 100 - 90 points victory in the fifth , mckenzie began to let his hands go and opened up a cut on his opponent 's head with intelligent use of his backhand
it was not until the seventh road that ivan stupalo got through , but mckenzie just flashed a grin and got back to his business
by the eighth the man from croatia was spending a lot of time on the ropes but mckenzie was unable to find a finishing blow and instead ran out with a deserved 100 - 90 points victory
the fight was part of a goodwin boxing promotion shown live and exclusive on matchroom fight pass .
