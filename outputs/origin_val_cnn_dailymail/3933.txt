henderson 's ( right ) 11 - year - old daughter lauren ( left ) was fined $ 50 for using the bathroom students at bellbridge primary school in hoppers crossing , south - west melbourne , have been punished for using the bathroom during lesson time ' i found out about it a couple of weeks ago via a bellbridge parents facebook site , ' ms henderson told daily mail australia
' there were a huge number of parents in uproar
' the school has been fully aware of this for quite some time now
' ms henderson said children had been wetting themselves in class and had to be sent home for changes of clothes , while others had to record their bathroom breaks on class whiteboards
' when kids are that age they like to do the right thing , so if a teacher says they ca n't go they 're going to hold and hold and hold , ' she said
' i have n't had to worry about [ my daughter ] having an accident , she 's 11 , but my worry is she 's going to end up with a urinary tract infection or something along those lines
' she has to write up the time she went to toilet and what time she came in , so her name goes up on whiteboard for 29 other children to see
parents have expressed their outrage after learning that students were fined and kept in during recess if they went to the toilet during class ' each child 's toileting record is up for public display - i 'd love to see how an adult would react to that in the workplace
' ms henderson said a parent who was also a school council member agreed to raise the issue at a meeting more than a week ago , but says it was ' brushed off '
' a number of parents went to individual classroom teachers who again have brushed it off , ' she said
' if there is a child using a toilet break as an excuse to get out of work deal with that particular child rather than punish the whole school
' bellbridge primary school principal clancy said she became aware of the practice on monday and has now stopped it
' of course , our students are free to go to the toilet whenever they need â and we would never stop a child from going to the toilet during class time , or penalise them for doing so , ' ms clancy told the herald sun. ' a small number of classes have deducted points earned in the ' earn and learn ' system as a way to discourage children from using the toilet during class time
' as this does not fit in with our positive approach , this no longer occurs at our school
