' i was regularly fondled and petted by pickering , as were other boys
this occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery
i began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol , which left me vulnerable to such abuse
' ms griffiths revealed she and other local roman catholic church had avoided being married in the church photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky he recalled : ' i now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses , as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication
in 1983 , i stopped going to the presbytery after pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father
' he told me that i was not welcome back and that i would burn in hell
between 1983 and 1987 , the two other boys who i know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money , alcohol and cigarettes from pickering , but i chose not to because i was terrified of him
i have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by pickering
