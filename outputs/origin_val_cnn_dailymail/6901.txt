the 22 - year - old swedish striker was performing a chant the supporters sing to him when he plays
as the programme 's credits began to roll , he sang : ' oh guidetti , puts the ball in the net - y , he 's a super swede and the h * * * are deid , walking in guidetti wonderland
' celtic striker guidetti sang the song in question during an appearance on dutch television guidetti has scored 13 goals since joining celtic on loan from manchester city this season a group of rangers fans have been petitioning scots 's first minister nicola sturgeon to ban the word ' h * * ' from football grounds
the group say the term incites ' religious hatred ' and is ' a derogatory and sectarian term for a protestant '
there is no indication that guidetti , who is on loan from manchester city , had any idea of the meaning of the chant , but he caused anger nonetheless by saying he thought it was ' a good song '
a spokesman for the anti-sectarian charity nil by mouth told the scotsman there was a need ' for a proper education programme for scots footballers '
he added : ' clubs should make it clear to them the kind of language likely to provoke others
' guidetti was repeating a song that he had heard sung in the terraces while he played celtic manager ronny deila said recently he had not given up hope of signing guidetti on a permanent basis
