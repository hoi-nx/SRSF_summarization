when confronted with the sight of a charging hippo hungry for meat , most holidaymakers would run a mile
but one snap - happy couple stayed put to capture the beast in all its glory as it bounded towards them through an african swamp
michael and jacqueline tucker were holidaying in botswana when the animal bore its fangs at them during a safari
rather than run from the hungry animal , mr tucker , 38 , whipped out his camera
as his stunning collection of photographs show , the animal changed its mind at the last minute , waddling off in search of food elsewhere as their group 's motorboat kicked in
who 's there ? an angry hippopotamus made a dash for a group of tourists in chobe national park , botswana , with one of the group able to capture the moment it nearly reached their boat in a swamp closing in : the animal moved with ' astonishing ' pace said mr tucker , a professional photographer in the area with his wife , jacqueline not happy : the beast was far from pleased when the group of tourists brought their boat into its territory of the water the encounter was not without risk though , he said , with their guide hurriedly trying to start the boat 's engine as the hippopotamus closed in
' it was astonishing the speed the hippo moved and we were definitely in danger
' our guide decided to get us up close to a pod of hippos that were resting on a small island
as we were drifting towards them with the motor off , the dominant bull decided we were too close and started charging us
' it all happened very quickly and as the hippo was gaining valuable ground by the second , we were trying very hard to get the motor boat started
' after two unsuccessful attempts the motor finally started and we managed to get away
' incredibly , i managed to get a few photographs of the charge as we luckily escaped the angry hippo
' the pictures will always remind us how lucky we were
' get your own swamp : mr tucker was able to capture the beasts ' yellowed fangs and tongue in a stunning collection of photographs getting closer : the rest of the group remained in their seats as the guide tried to restart the boat , the animal growing ever closer off you go : eventually the tour 's boat restarted , with the animal pleased to see them leave just in the nick of time do n't bother coming back : while mr tucker said he was glad to have been able to capture the encounter , he said the images remind him of how much danger they were in at the time
