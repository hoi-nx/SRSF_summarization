republican presidential hopefuls jeb bush and scott walker used their own personal email server , in a similar way to hillary clinton , in what critics claim was a bid to control what correspondence was released for public scrutiny
republican have attacked mrs hillary clinton after it emerged that during her time as secretary of state she used her own private email account to conduct official business
however an investigation by nbc news has uncovered evidence that republican front - runner jeb bush used his own private email server while wisconsin governor scott walker , who also has 1600 pennsylvania avenue aspirations , employed a similar system
state rules insist that non-classified but sensitive national security or diplomatic information can only be transmitted using secure servers
according to cnn , the florida governor used an email address on his own jeb.org server for official and personal business
however , he has now released hundreds of thousands of emails in an effort to deflect criticism
mrs hillary clinton is the 6/5 favourite to become the next resident of 1600 pennsylvania avenue , while jeb bush is the most favoured republican at 5/2 with scott walker trailing at 14/1 , according to bookmakers paddy power
cnn claimed that there is now evidence that jeb bush and his staff used his personal email server to communicate while working on official florida business
scott walker 's spokeswoman attacked mrs hillary clinton 's use of a private email server , even though he was forced to admit using a similar system while in office as a milwaukee county executive
kirsten kukowski , who represents scott walker 's political committee , our american revival , said : ' hillary clinton 's potential evasion of laws is something she should answer questions about ' wisconsin has a strong open records law with a broad presumption of access to records and the governor has very specific policies in place in his office to assure that the laws are complied with fully
' two of scott walker 's associates were convicted of political campaigning on government time
fellow republican presidential hopeful scott walker , pictured , has also been embroiled in the scandal tens of thousands of pages of emails collected by prosecutors as part of that investigation have been publicly released since the close of the probe
scott walker was never charged or convicted as a result of the investigation
scott walker 's staff has said that no such secret network exists in the governor 's office
and scott walker said last year that when he became governor in 2011 he created a ' clear distinction between things that are political and official '
he insisted that in november 2011 , after almost a year in office he introduced a policy that ' any campaign work should be done away from the capitol or state office building ' , with staffers using their ' own phone , computer and personal email '
clinton 's email server , clintonemail.com was used in the aftermath of the 2012 terrorist attack on the american consulate in the libya city benghazi a house of representatives select committee is investigating the attack and has issued a subpoena for any emails concerning libya on clinton 's personal servers
according to ware , spokesman for the select committee : ' committee on benghazi issued subpoenas for all communications of former secretary of state hillary clinton related to libya and to the state for other individuals who have information pertinent to the investigation
' the committee also has issued preservation letters to internet firms informing them of their legal obligation to protect all relevant documents
' later ware confirmed : ' committee on benghazi is in possession of records with two separate and distinct email addresses used by former secretary clinton and dated during the time she was secretary of state
' without access to the relevant electronic information and stored data on the server â which was reportedly registered to her home â there is no way the committee , or anyone else , can fully explain why the committee uncovered two email addresses
' as chairman gowdy has noted , this is why former secretary clinton âs exclusive use of personal emails to conduct official american government business is so problematic and raises significant issues for transparency
the american people have a right to a full accounting of all the former clinton âs emails , and the committee is committed to working to uncover all the facts
' current secretary of state john kerry said his department is currently assessing the 55,000 documents released by clinton vowing that they ' will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way '
the email server was housed at the clinton 's family home in cappaqua , new york
after releasing the emails to the state , clinton tweeted : ' i want the public to see my email
i asked state to release them ' .
