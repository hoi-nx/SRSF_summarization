kentucky sen. paul , a libertarian - leaning senator will officially announce his candidacy for president at a rally in louisville , kentucky on april 7 , a senior adviser to the republican politician told daily mail online
with texas sen. cruz in the race for the white house as of this morning , when he kicked off his own bid with a tweet , paul plans to follow suit and launch his own campaign in just over two weeks
louisville , the adviser said , was selected over paul 's hometown , bowling green , the city from which he set in motion his quest to become a america senator , for optimum venue space
kentucky sen. paul is scheduled to follow cruz 's lead and announce his presidential bid at a campaign - style event on april 7 in louisville , kentucky even before cruz , 44 , kicked off his 2016 bid , paul , 52 , had his eye on april 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign
but the fellow republican 's formal announcement helped to solidify paul 's plans
determined not to be the first major white house hopeful to wade into the shark - infested waters , paul intended to wait until at least one other prominent republican contender swam out to sea
already , south carolina sen. lindsey graham , retired neurosurgeon ben carson and wealthy businessman and reality tv star donald trump had publicly said they were forming presidential exploratory committees
such committees allow them to legally collect money for the purposes of travelling around the country to ' test the waters ' for a bid and to conduct polling
former florida gov. bush has made clear that he will pursue a presidential campaign but has not yet held the kind of large - scale event that typically accompanies the launch of a national campaign
cruz , voted into the senate during the last presidential election in 2012 , has selected a christian college in virginia as the backdrop for the public unveiling of his national enterprise
he 'll make the announcement this morning at liberty even though he 's yet to establish an exploratory committee
paul has not yet signed paperwork legalizing a committee either but could do so in the two weeks before he throws his name into the ring
up for reelection this year , the republican lawmaker first had to settle an in - house dispute over whether he could pursue his current job and the one that he wants at the same time
earlier this month the gop gave him its blessing to do both
as a result , the state will have a one - time caucus , paid for by paul , to determine its presidential nominee so that paul can remain on a statewide ballot as a candidate for the senate , as well
if he nabs the republican nomination for president , however , he 'll have to take the state to court in order to protect his fail safe measure , as kentucky law does not allow a politician to appear on the ballot twice for two separate positions
and secretary of state alison lundergan grimes , the loser of last fall 's senate competition , vowed to force paul to play by the rules

even before cruz kicked off his 2016 bid , paul had his eye on april 7 as a launch date for his own national campaign
but the fellow republican 's formal announcement solidified his plans additional heavy hitters presumably joining the crowded field of republican presidential candidates - former texas gov. rick perry , florida sen. marco rubio , wisconsin gov. scott walker , former pennsylvania sen. rick santorum and new jersey gov. chris christie - have offered fewer hints about when they drop the curtain on their expected campaigns
currently they are running shadow campaigns , under the guise of their leadership pacs , and have all taken the preliminary steps to build apparatuses that can compete nationally
louisiana gov. bobby jindal and former hewlett packard executive carly fiorina could also enter the race as dark horse candidates
both have hinted at possible runs , but neither has strongly signaled interest or adopted an aggressive campaign schedule compared to the likes of cruz , bush , paul and others
the candidates known to be all or mostly in have spent the better part of the year building their fan bases in early primary states , chiefly iowa , new hampshire and south carolina , and shoring up key republican donors
democrats ' top contender , hillary clinton , is also close to making an announcement , which could reportedly come early as next wednesday
the political front was mostly quiet on monday morning , however , as cruz prepared to lay out his vision for the country in a convocation speech at liberty , the largest christian higher - education institution in america , save for a few tweets from his well - known detractors paul is pictured here exiting beantowne coffee house & cafe march in hampstead during his weekend trip to new hampshire
the freshman senator has not yet signed paperwork legalizing a presidential exploratory committee but could do so in the two weeks before his campaign formally kicks off the democratic national committee hit him several times over the social media network as the ' architect of the disastrous 2013 government shutdown ' and forwarded reporters an article positing that cruz , a hispanic whose father fled communist cuba , could actually ' make the relationship between republican and latinos even tougher
' the premise of the fusion piece was that in making his debut as a national candidate at a university ' whose student body is at least half white , ' cruz , whose policies on issues like immigration are already considered ' divisive ' by some , wo n't attract the kind of support from minority groups that one would expect given his family tree
american bridge , a progressive , political action committee , tweeted that that the gop 's ' race to the extreme starts today ' with cruz 's personal announcement
in a statement the group 's president , woodhouse , also went after cruz for his role in the 2013 senate standoff that left the government in limbo for more than two weeks
' cruz shut down the government in a tantrum , opposes marriage equality , denies climate change , and opposes a woman âs right to choose even in cases of rape or incest , ' woodhouse said
' he âs everything voters hate about the modern republican in one candidate ' woodhouse claimed , ' and the entire field is already signing on to his positions
