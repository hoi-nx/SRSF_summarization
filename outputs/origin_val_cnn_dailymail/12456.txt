washington it does n't matter how many times israeli prime minister netanyahu now says he still wants a two - state solution with the palestinian
the white house is refusing to take him at his word
" we take him at his word when he said that it would n't happen during his prime ministership , and so that 's why we 've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we do n't see a chaotic situation in the region , " president obama said in an interview with the huffington post published saturday
these are the president 's first public comments since netanyahu 's party captured the most seats in tuesday 's parliamentary election
netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in palestinian statehood , despite his pre-election flip - flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes
only on thursday , two days after the election , did president obama congratulate netanyahu by phone on his victory
white house press secretary josh earnest declined to say whether netanyahu clarified his position on the two - state policy during that phone call
but obama told the prime minister that the united states would " reassess " aspects of its relationship with israeli after netanyahu 's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a palestinian state
administration officials have said the united states is now considering signing on to a u.n. resolution which supports a palestinian state
regarding comments netanyahu made tuesday about arab israeli voters going to the polls " in droves " -- comments described by some as racist -- obama told huffington post that that kind of " rhetoric " was " contrary to what is best of israeli 's traditions
that although israeli was founded based on the historic jewish homeland and the need to have a jewish homeland , israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly
" obama added : " if that is lost , then i think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who do n't believe in a jewish state , but it also i think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country
" united states house speaker john boehner , who invited netanyahu to address that controversial joint meeting of congress earlier this month , plans to visit israeli at the end of the month
while the speaker 's office says the trip was planned well before the prime minister 's re-election , it will come around the deadline for an initial nuclear deal between iran , the united states and other world powers .
