before this week , boren did n't need to add to his resume
it was impressive enough already
the 73 - year - old oklahoma president was also a former governor , former u.s. senator and rhodes
boren has become the face of the school 's stand against racism after a highly visible and passionate condemnation of a video that appears to show sae fraternity members chanting a racial epitaph
it started with a bullhorn at a campus rally
" i have a message for those who have misused their freedom of speech in this way
my message to them is : you 're disgraceful
you have violated every principle that this university stands for
" it continued with a press conference , saying fraternity members had until midnight tuesday to get out of their house
" the house will be closed , and as far as i 'm concerned , they wo n't be back , " boren said , adding that the university is exploring what actions it can take against individual fraternity members
and it extended to network television
" sooners are not racists
they 're not bigots , " boren told cnn in one of his many public reprimands
" they are people who respect each other and care about each other
" boren spent nearly 30 years in elected office before becoming the 13th president of the oklahoma in 1994
he was a u.s. senator from 1979 to 1994 , where he was the longest serving chairman of the senate intelligence committee
before that , he served four years as oklahoma 's governor
he campaigned as a reformer , with a broom as his symbol , and when elected , he became the youngest governor in the state
he was 33 at the time
boren is the first person in oklahoma history to have served all three positions , according to his university biography
boren graduated from yale university in 1963 , in the top one percent of his class
he was selected as a rhodes scholar and earned a master 's degree in politics , philosophy and economics from ou , england , in 1965
boren received his law degree from the oklahoma in 1968
both his father , lyle , and his son , dan , served in the u.s. house of representatives
zero tolerance is the only answer to racism , boren said
not just for the school , but the nation
" it 's not just the greek system , it 's not just colleges and universities
it 's ferguson , missouri
all sorts of elements of our society are involved , " he said
for now , boren said the school is looking into punishing the individuals involved , especially any of those who led the chants
" we 're trying to determine if we have enough evidence and if we can meet the federal standards to prevail in court , and , if so , we 'll take action , " boren said
" this is not a place that wants racists or bigots on our campus or will tolerate it so i think you have to send a very strong signal
" in the meantime , boren said he will work with students who are calling for a change , including unheard , a campus organization that formed in response to the police shooting of michael brown in ferguson
unheard , along with the university newspaper , anonymously received the video showing the fraternity chant and made it public boren started meeting with the group in january , well ahead of the sae video
both sides described the sessions as " constructive , " the washington post reported monday
" they are very constructive
they have very good ideas and we 're going to make it better
we 're determined to make it better , " boren told cnn .
