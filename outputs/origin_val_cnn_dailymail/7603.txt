a terrified woman who knew her sister - in - law had been murdered by their mother - in - law kept quiet about the crime for seven years because she was scared she would suffer the same fate
sarbjit eventually found the courage to speak out about the so - called ' honour killing ' and bring her murderous mother - in - law to justice
now she has shared her story with the ci show britain 's darkest taboos as she hopes her experience will encourage other victims trapped in violent marriages to speak out
she said she had no say in the decision and had huge reservations about her new family
' i felt like i was being pressured and i had to think about my parents as well
i did n't want to let them down and i had to think about the honour or the shame i would bring to the family if i had said no. ' so , i accepted what was being offered and i said yes , and went ahead with it , ' she explains
sarbjit struggled to settle into her new home where her mother - in - law bachan ruled the roost
' honour killing ' : sarbjit , left , on her wedding day with her sister - in - law surjit who was murdered by their mother - in - law and her husband when she tried to get a divorce but she did find companionship in her new sister - in - law surjit , 18 , who was married to her husband 's brother , sukhdave
both surjit and sarbjit were made to feel worthless and their lives were no longer their own
sarbjit said : ' my role in the family after i got married was to cook and clean , take care of the family , take care of the extended family if they were coming round , cooking and cleaning and then accompanying our mother - in - law to other occasions
she was constantly in charge , and she did rule the house and she would tell us what to do instead of discussing it with us
' when surjit and sarbjit both had children , their mother - in - law took over their upbringing as well
sarbjit recalls : ' there were times where we breastfeeding and she would look at us and she would say , " â the babies are not happy
maybe we should put them on the bottle
" ' when we were out one day , i rushed home to feed my baby , and the baby was sleeping
i was going to wake her up and feed her , and she said , " oh , i 've already fed her
" ' that was really shocking for me
i really felt upset thinking , even that right has been taken away from me
' while sarbjit felt powerless , her sister - in - law surjit started rebelling against their treatment
she cut her hair , started wearing make - up and made new friends she started going out drinking with
her husband and mother - in - law started beating her because they said such behaviour brought them shame - but surjit remained defiant
she then told sukhdave that she intended to leave him and wanted a divorce
upon hearing this , sarbjit said their mother - in - law was enraged and told her , ' your sister will have divorce over my dead body
' sarbjit did n't realise quite how far bachan would go to stop her daughter - in - law leaving her son until it was too late
murderous matriarch : bachan was jailed for life in 2007 for her part in surjit 's death bachan arranged for surjit to go to india with her - but the young women never returned from the trip
sarbjit said her sister - in - law had only gone because bachan tricked her
she explains : ' my mother - in - law spoke to surjit and said , " before you have your divorce i want you to come to a family trip to india with me
i did n't want to go on my own , just come with me and meet the family out there
do your duty as a daughter - in - law and then when you come back you can have your divorce
" ' when bachan returned from the two - week trip without surjit , she and sukhdave told surjit 's two children that their mother had run away and left them because she did n't love them
sarbjit knew her sister - in - law would never do such a thing and confronted her mother - in - law
' i kept saying , " where 's surjit ? " she would n't speak at first
then all of a sudden the power came back into her voice and she became that strong dominating woman again
she looked at me and said , " surjit 's been taken care of
" ' she told me , " surjit was driven out in a jeep and surjit was drugged , strangled and her body was thrown in the river
" ' sarbjit was shocked and horrified by the confession but she was too scared to go to the police and tell them what bachan had told her
she now knew what her mother - in - law was capable of and was scared she or her children could be her next victim
she said : ' my normality was terror
a woman i once called my mum , she was actually a murderer
' for years , sarbjit continued to live in fear and silence while surjit 's family tried to find out what happened to her
dci clive driscoll , a senior investigator at the metropolitan police , took on the case after surjit was reported missing by her family
but for years the case remained unsolved due to a lack of leads and no body
sarbjit today , left , and right as a scared young bride forced into an arrange marriage at the age of 19 it 's only when sarbjit finally realised that she must tell the truth that justice is served
after telling her parents what she knew , they arranged for her to meet dci driscoll
with the information sarbjit supplied , he travelled to punjab in india to try to find more evidence , advising sarbjit to sit tight and not let bachan and sukdave know the police are on to them
thanks to the people he met in india , who remembered surjit 's visit , and how her mother - in - law and husband tried to cover their tracks after her disappearance , he is finally able to piece together a picture of what happened to surjit
he said : ' it is my view that surjit was tricked into thinking she was going shopping
along the way she was driven to an area close to the river
her gold was removed from her
she was then thrown into the river ravi
' as the case grew stronger it was reported in the local press that the police had information that would soon lead to arrests
bachan and sukdave realise their crime could soon be discovered and sarbjit could give evidence against them
so they decide to get rid of her too
sarbjit reveals she was chilled to the bone when her mother - in - law told her , ' we 're going to take a trip to india '
the mother has now trained as pcso as she wants to help others in need ' i realised that i had to get out , ' sarbjit said she she fled to dci driscoll and urged him to arrest bachan , and sukhdave right away
in april 2007 , the pair , then aged 70 and 43 , were found guilty of murder following a long trial at old bailey , london , and jailed for life
sarbjit said : ' after nine years we finally got justice
' now trying to rebuild her own life , sarbjit lives with her children and has qualified as a pcso as she wants to help the police stop similar cases happening again
she added : ' i want to set up my own charity and help other victims of similar situations , because i do n't want them to go through what i did
' i want to give the support and courage and help them get their voices to the police and seek justice
i know it 's going to take time to get that but i 've got to hope i can
