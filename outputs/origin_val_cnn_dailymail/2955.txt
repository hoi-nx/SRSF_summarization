' brainwashed ' : amer deghayes was exploited by radical islamists before he went to fight with jihadists in syria , according to his mother the mother of three teenagers who ran away to syria to wage jihad says her sons were ' brainwashed ' by youtube videos and their extremist friends
inas abulsayen was left heartbroken when her sons left their home in sussex and travelled to fight with a branch of al qaeda against the assad regime
her two younger sons abdullah and jaffar deghayes have now been killed in the war - torn country , and she has launched a public appeal for their older brother amer to come home
amer , 20 , left the family home in saltdean , near brighton , in october 2013 and joined the al nusra front , and two months later his brothers joined him in syria
in april last year , 18 - year - old abdullah was killed in a battle which also left amer injured , and in october jaffar died while fighting against assad 's troops in december
despite his brothers ' deaths , amer is determined to remain in the middle east , and has ignored his family 's demands for him to return to britain
mrs inas abulsayen said her sons were influenced by radical videos which they watched online , and insisted that she and her husband abubaker were opposed to extremism
' my sons went to serve , to sacrifice , and now two of them are dead , ' she said
they felt english was a part of their lives , but everybody has a secret life
' we have our religion , but there is lots of brainwashing on youtube , in the mosques , through friends
' my sons are muslim , and they believe everyone should be free as part of humanity
i taught them about the uprising , but not about fighting , maybe they thought they are men and maybe they were brainwashed
mrs inas abulsayen said : ' i had lots of arguments with him because he talked about osama bin laden , jihad - and i did n't want my sons in this position
he had a bad view on islamic
' i heard kamara say to jaffar , " you are not young now , jaffar
you are old enough , you can look after yourself
" ' kamara died in a us air strike in aleppo last year after travelling to syria with jaffar
mrs inas abulsayen added that her sons told her they wanted to carry out humanitarian missions but instead turned to jihad once they arrived in syria
' amer was the first one to leave in october 2013 , ' she said
' he said to me , " mummy , there is a community that has english people who want to help refugees
let me make that trip
it 's not that dangerous
" ' he said to me , " mummy , i feel guilty
i have food , i have everything here - do n't be upset with me
this is the best opportunity for me
people are hungry and children are crying
" ' he is very calm , like all my sons , and he gave me a promise he would be back
he said it was just a trip to help refugees
'' if i die , you will be upset if i am martyred ' , he said to me
i said of course - you know my opinion on going to syria - i disagree with it
' father : abubaker deghayes outside his home in october , announcing that jaffar had been killed uncle : omar deghayes spent five years as a detainee in guantanamo bay before being released three months later , her two other sons left without telling their family where they were going , she said
' abdullah , the first one to die , i did n't even get to give him a hug before he left , ' she continued
he did n't say goodbye to me
abdullah left and gave his sister a hug before saying , " i 'm going to meet my mate
" ' two weeks before he left , jaffar told me he would never leave me , so i do n't know who brainwashed him
maybe he thought he could get his brothers back , i do n't know
' the boys ' uncle , omar deghayes , was a detainee at guantanamo bay for five years after being arrested in pakistan , but was eventually released without charge
in a film shot last year , amer insisted he would not return home , saying : ' my work here is not done
i came here to give victory to the people and make sure that they receive justice , and we still have n't reached the goal yet
' he added : ' the muslim nation is like one body
if one part complains , the other parts react , so i do n't see it as a syria conflict
i see it as an islamic conflict
' if he did return to britain , amer could face legal action , because the al nusra front is classified as a banned terrorist organisation by the government .
