isis have tried to justify the beheading of eight alleged informers as ' revenge ' for military operations targeting the islamists in syrian and iraqi in the militants ' latest gruesome video
the video contrasts the murders of the eight men , all blindfolded dressed in red jumpsuits , cut with footage of people who apparently have been killed or badly injured in coalition attacks on isis - held locations
the men are accused of being informers , engaged in military operations against isis
the men , who are both iraqi and syrian , are led by their murderers out of a van onto a derelict piece of land , where they are forced to kneel in a row
the captors , armed with what look like meat cleavers , stand behind their victims
behind them , the buildings appear to have been reduced to rubble
interspersed with the footage of the prisoners is footage of a dead child under the rubble and in a body bag , and a dead man at the hospital , who appears to have been shot
the makers of the video seem to want to point the finger of blame for their latest horrendous actions at the coalition forces ' campaign against isis
revenge : the militants have justified the killings as retaliation for air strikes against land they hold to make that clear , the video begins with a mock - up of a coalition airstrike , complete with a fake jet seemingly piloted by someone with an american accent
â by god we will get our revenge , â the video states
this new video has been released just days after another isis production , which claimed to show a young boy executing an alleged israeli - arab spy
at about the same time , militants fighting for the islamic state have released a video claiming to show the execution of two libyan soldiers
the militants have turned to brutal videos like these as a form of propaganda , apparently simultaneously hoping to attract new fighters and spread fear among those working against isis .
