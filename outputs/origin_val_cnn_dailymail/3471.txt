the ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus will phase out the show 's iconic elephants from its performances by 2018 , telling the associated press exclusively that growing public concern about how the animals are treated led to the decision
executives from feld entertainment , ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's parent company , said the decision to end the circus 's century - old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length as elephants have often been featured on ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's posters over the decades
' there 's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers , ' said alana feld , the company 's executive vice president
' a lot of people are n't comfortable with us touring with our elephants
13 animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018 while one elephant is on a breeding loan to the fort worth zoo
another reason for the decision , company president kenneth feld said , was that certain cities and counties have passed ' anti-circus ' and ' anti-elephant ' ordinances
the company 's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year , and alana feld said it 's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction
it 's also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations , he said
' all of the resources used to fight these things can be put towards the elephants , ' alana feld said during an interview at the center for elephant conservation
' we 're not reacting to our critics ; we 're creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the asian elephant
' the circus will continue to use other animals - this year it added a mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders to its circus xtreme show and it will likely showcase more motorsports , daredevils and feats of humans ' physical capabilities
ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus 's popular canada - based competitor , cirque du soleil , features human acts and does n't use wild animals
' there are endless possibilities , ' said juliette feld , another executive vice president of the company and a producer of feld 's marvel universe live , disney on ice and monster jam shows , among others
alana feld owns the largest herd of asian elephants in north america
it costs about $ 65,000 yearly to care for each elephant , and kenneth feld said the company would have to build new structures to house the retiring elephants at the center , located in between orlando and tampa on a rural , ranchlike property
kenneth feld said initially the center will be open only to researchers , scientists and others studying the asian elephant
eventually , he ' hopes it expands to something the public will be able to see
' ' i want everybody 's grandkids to be able to see asian elephants , ' he said
the center 's youngest elephant is mike , who will be 2 in august , and the oldest is mysore , who is 69
one elephant , 6 - year - old barack , was conceived by artificial insemination
since the center opened in 1995 , 26 elephants have been born there

in 2014 , feld entertainment won $ 25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal - rights groups , including the humane society of the united states , ending a 14 - year legal battle over unproven allegations that ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus circus employees mistreated elephants
the initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $ 190,000 by the animal - rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit
the judge called him ' essentially a paid plaintiff ' who lacked credibility and standing to sue
the judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial
kenneth feld testified during that trial about elephants ' importance to the show
' the symbol of ringling bros. and barnum & bailey circus is the elephant , and that 's what we 've been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years
' when asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants , alana feld replied , ' no , it would n't
' this week , alana feld said , ' things have changed
' ' how does a business be successful ? by adapting , ' he said
alana feld noted that when his father bought the circus in 1967 , there was still a human sideshow featuring acts such as the bearded lady and other human oddities
his father did away with that , he said
' we 're always changing and we 're always learning , ' he said
in 2008 , alana feld acquired a variety of motor sports properties , including monster truck shows , motocross and the international hot rod association , which promotes drag races and other events
