it has undergone a series of transformations over the years from a grand hall used by royals to a millionaire 's party palace
but the first record of a settlement at eltham palace was in the domesday survey of 1086 which said the manor belonged to odo , bishop of bayeux , half - brother of william the conqueror
it changed hands a number of times until 1295 when anthony bek , bishop of durham , acquired it and rebuilt the manor house before presenting it to the future edward ii in 1305
the king then passed it on to his queen isabella
successive monarchs lavished large sums on the palace
in the 1380s richard ii created a walled garden to the south beyond the moat while henry iv spent 10 of his 13 christmases as king at eltham palace
historic : work has also been undertaken to recreate the property 's 1930s garden , which sits among the ruins of the medieval palace it was a favoured residence of edward iv who built its great hall and from the 14th to the 16th century it was an important royal palace , often used by monarchs who stayed there for hunting trips in the surrounding parks , according to english heritage
henry viii passed much of his boyhood at eltham palace , english heritage says , and was the last monarch to spend large amounts of money on it
it was at eltham palace in 1515 when cardinal wolsey took the oath of office of lord chancellor in the decades that followed , it was poorly maintained and elizabeth i and the early stuarts only visited rarely
over the following two centuries it was used as a farm and a substantial villa was built in the early 19th century
at one point the great hall was being shored up with props and was being used as a barn even in 1903
in 1933 millionaires stephen and virginia courtauld took up a 99 year lease from the crown
social circles : among the guests to have visited eltham palace after the courtaulds took up their lease was composer igor stravinsky ( left ) and actress gracie fields ( right ) they set about building a stylish house that incorporated the great hall which english heritage calls ' a masterpiece of 20th - century design '
the couple transformed the grounds , which are now a mix of 1930s design and medieval remains
keen horticulturalists , the courtaulds also created a variety of garden features including a rock garden , formal rose gardens and a series of garden â rooms â , the latter being more typical of the edwardian period or arts and crafts style
according to english heritage , the building provided enough space for entertaining a broad social circle which included queen mary , composer igor stravinsky , actress gracie fields , conductor malcolm sargent , film producers basil dean and michael balcon , band leader lew stone , and politicians including rab butler and leo amery
