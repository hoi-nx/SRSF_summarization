from twilight to star wars , fans of sci fi and fantasy franchises are known for their levels of dedication
they immerse themselves in the world of their favourite characters by dressing up as them , collecting the merchandise and even going to conventions to meet others who share their passion
but some take it even further than this , spending thousands of pounds and travelling the world in pursuit of the actors who brought their favourite character to life
it 's something actor tom felton , 27 , is familiar with having grown up on screen playing draco malfoy in the harry potter
her name was tina and she would be waiting for him outside hotels , film premieres and events he attended desperate for a glimpse of the star and hopefully a picture or autograph
tom felton said : ' tina follows me to every event i attend
i 'm sure she has the best intentions but it is a little unnerving
' i first spotted her when i had a press tour in paris and i noticed this women following me around , she seemed to have an obsession with me and always seems to know where i am
' why does a middle - aged woman have an obsession with back then , a teenage boy ? ' he added that he knows tina means no harm and he finds her ' sweet ' but he said : ' she has followed my career for seven years , ultimately i am baffled as to why she wants to see me and what she wants from me
' once , tina , 56 , from swindon , waited for four hours outside an event he was attending to give him a card telling him she was sorry his dog had died after the star revealed he 'd lost a pet on social media
so intrigued as to why tina follows him around the world at her own time and expense , tom felton decided to investigate the psyche behind the superfan for a bbc documentary that airs on bbc three tonight
he even visited tina 's house and , surrounded by signed pictures of himself and posters of his friends and harry potter co-stars , he learnt why he has come to mean so much to tina
she explained : ' i went out and brought the first one after that , that was it , it spiralled
' when i saw chamber of secrets and saw this blonde slimy git after harry potter , i thought ummm i 'm going to start watching him
i think to start off with it was the character draco malfoy i liked and then gradually i got to like you , you 're lovely
tina said the actors feel like family to her because she has watched them grow up on screen tina said she has enjoyed watching tom felton grow up from being a boy as draco malfoy in the first harry potter films , left , to the man he is today , right tom felton with ( from left to right ) michael gambon , emma watson , rupert grint , daniel radcliffe , bonnie wright , jessie cave and jim broadbent promoting harry potter and the half blood prince in 2009 ' i wanted the autographs to feel closer to you , it was like a little connection
i have never had a family and following harry potter and watching you all grow up it was like seeing my own family grow up and i got attached
you seemed like a big family and i wanted to be part of that
' tom felton got a taste of just what this is like when he joined fans outside a broadway theatre to catch a glimpse of rupert grint aka ron weasley
he experienced the excitement , anticipation and the buzz the fans get from meeting their favourite star
he spoke to his harry potter friends and co-stars and author jk rowling to see how they have dealt with this kind of attention
harry potter himself , actor daniel radcliffe , said : ' it 's definitely a weird thing when are aware you account for a large part of someone 's life who you do n't know and who does n't know you - but thinks they do
' having an obsession with a character in a book is fine but when you are obsessed with someone you do n't have anything about ... i 'm more comfortable with people being obsessed with harry potter than obsessed with me

steve told tom felton his obsession started when he was bullied at school
' i did n't fit in , i was a skinny nerd who liked to dance rather than play baseball
i really identified with who harry potter is
' but the film fan admitted it 's the characters , not the actors who play them , he loves but most of all he adores writer jk rowling
so much so that he has her signature tattooed on his forearm
the actor also dressed up as batman 's the joker to experience the thrill of being a fan he said : ' if jk rowling walked through the door now you would see me lose it completely , shaking , crying freaking out
i went to new york in 2006 to see her and she signed my arm and i got it tattooed over

she said : ' you can travel every deeply into why as a society you need famous people
