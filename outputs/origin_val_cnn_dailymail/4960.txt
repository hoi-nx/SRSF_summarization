the church of england yesterday published a prayer for the general election that called on its congregations to vote for â policies that sustain the poor â
in a move likely to plunge its relations with tory leaders to a new low , the church of england issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to â help us turn our backs on self - interest â
in the wake of controversial election advice put out by church of england bishops earlier this year that urged support for the european union , the prayer also asked churchgoers to â work for unity and co-operation throughout the world â

the church of england issued an election prayer that urged its followers to pray to â help us turn our backs on self - interest â it was published in a â study guide â to the â pastoral letter â on the election produced by bishops in february
the letter was taken by tories as a campaign against the market economy , consumerism and the legacy of margaret thatcher
the new study guide from the church âs mission and public affairs division underlined the call for consideration of â relationships among the nations of europe who share a long history moulded by the christian faith â
it repeated demands for â a fresh debate â on nuclear weapons , and said those who care about tackling debt should also care â about the burdens borne by the most vulnerable in society â
two prayers were offered : in one worshippers were asked to pray to â help us turn our backs on self - interest and to support policies that sustain the poor , the vulnerable and the frightened people of this world â
a second prayer calls for protection â from the sins of despair and cynicism â and â the idols of false utopias â
a source close to mr duncan smith said : â it is truly bizarre that they are praying to sustain people in poverty
surely the aim should be to support people to lift themselves out of poverty ? which is exactly what we have been doing through our welfare reforms : giving everyone who is able to work the skills and the opportunities to do so
â sir gerald howarth , a former tory defence minister , said : â the church of england needs to be very clear that it is not endorsing the labour party , whose language this slightly mirrors
