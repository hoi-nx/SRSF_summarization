a number of pilots at low - cost airline germanwings refused to fly today following yesterday 's crash in the french that killed all 150 people on board
their decision came as it emerged the airbus a320 that dropped out of the sky and ploughed into a mountainside had been grounded over technical fears just 24 hours before
helicopter operations continued for a second day in the grim search for debris and bodies - including those of three uk nationals - that have been scattered over acres of mountain terrain
reports revealed the aircraft had suffered technical issues , including a landing gear problem , just a day before it was due to fly from barcelona to dusseldorf
a spokeswoman for the airline 's parent company , lufthansa , said one germanwings flight from dusseldorf to barcelona was cancelled because the pilots ' do n't feel they are in a position to fly '
she declined to say how many pilots declined to work today , adding that all lufthansa flights were going ahead as planned
staff at germanwings and lufthansa wept during an emotional minute 's silence for victims of the disaster at their respective headquarters in german this afternoon
a spokesman for the pilots ' union vereinigung cockpit , handwerg , insisted the decision was not because of concerns about safety
' it has nothing to do with safety
the pilots have friends and colleagues who have died , ' handwerg said on public television
' that is such a heavy emotional burden that it 's better not to get into the cockpit

it was the first fatal accident in the history of germanwings and the deadliest on the french mainland since 1974
' we understand their decision , ' said germanwings executive thomas winkelmann
industry experts also sought to reassure airbus a320 pilots that they will be safe
steve landells , a safety specialist from the british airline pilots association ( balpa ) who is himself a former airbus a320 pilot , said the aircraft is â incredibly reliable with a good safety record â
grim task continues : a french gendarmerie helicopter takes off for another search and rescue operation from syne les alpes after a germanwings airbus a320 crashed into a mountainside in the french killing all 150 people on board he told mailonline that hundreds of a320s are flying today and pilots should have â no qualms getting on one today â
a spokesman from balpa told maionline : ' balpa has gained information from the german pilot union that lufthansa and germanwings are giving pilots time off for grief
â uk pilots sympathise with their german colleagues and completely understand
â pilots have to be fit to fly , and if they feel emotionally unfit to fly , it is important they do not take to the air
it appears the company are doing the right thing in supporting them
â in a separate development , experts claimed the germanwings plane may have crashed because the windscreen cracked , causing a sudden drop in oxygen levels that rendered the pilots unconscious
reports circulating on professional pilot forums suggested the black box on the airbus a320 had been analysed and revealed that a ' structural failure ' was responsible for the disaster
this germanwings airbus a320 carrying 144 passengers and six crew which crashed in the french french flight 4u 9525 dropped out of the sky and ploughed into a mountainside in the french at more than 400mph yesterday , killing all 150 people board
in the latest theory to emerge , it is thought the windscreen gave way , incapacitating the pilots and leaving them unable to send out a distress call
that may explain what happened in what top french official segolene royal has described as the crucial minute between 10.30am - when the pilots were apparently chatting away - and 10.31am when contact was lost
flight radar data revealed the plane started its nosedive at 10.31am from an altitude of 38,000 feet
however , experts are also discussing other theories including faulty speed sensors and technical problems related to the age of the aircraft
france 's transport minister says work had begun on retrieving vital data from the cockpit voice recorder , although first pictures showed it had been badly damaged and it was not clear how much , if any , information could be analysed
this afternoon , the foreign office named 28 - year - old paul bramley , originally from hull , as one of the three uk killed
another was earlier identified as martyn matthews , a father - of - two and businessman from wolverhampton
marina bandres , a spanish - born mother from manchester , and her seven - month - old baby , julian , who is a uk national , were also among those who died .
