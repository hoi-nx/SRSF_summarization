when nick knight asked morgan , moments after the defeat by bangladesh , whether england were obsessed with stats , you half - expected morgan to hit back with : ' yes , but only 23.54 per cent of the time ! ' not long after , a shattered - looking moores told nasser hussain : â we âve got to have a look at the data â
and , hey presto , england âs latest cricket world cup fiasco had its epitaph
the raw data of this cricket world cup â four humiliations sandwiching a win against scotland â confirm what most non-ecb observers worked out a long time ago : england are not naturally inclined towards the one - day game , and make things worse by talking about a â brand â of cricket that bears no relation to the one they play or to the players they select
a solemn - looking england captain morgan arrives at sydney on tuesday morning the australians press has predictably stuck the boot in hard on england 's cricket world cup flops ian bell wears a sorry look as the batsman arrives in sydney ahead of the game against afghanistan jimmy anderson walks onto the team bus after flying from adelaide , scene of england 's latest humiliation mike atherton said that england were not as reliant on stats as some claim
but even if the truth lies somewhere between morgan âs denial and moores âs unwitting revelation , it seems clear that no other team talks numbers with as much pseudo-religious relish
and if it is true that england encourage the players to trust their gut instinct , why then do they bat as if they âve been told it âs ok to score at 4.5 for 20 overs ? if moores ca nât see that this is a team frightened by their own shadow ( and , no doubt , by their own shadow âs bowling average ) , then things are going to get worse before they get better
moores insisted he was still keen on the job , and downton â the man who once called him â the outstanding coach of his generation â â later declared â i âve got every faith in moores â , as if the chairmanship of a football club was the job that got away
but will the incoming ecb chairman colin graves and chief executive tom harrison share downton âs faith â or even have any faith in downton himself ? moores ( left ) was ridiculed for saying ' we 'll have to look at the data ' following defeat by bangladesh morgan shows the strain after england were dumped out of the cricket world cup before the quarter - finals bangladesh bowler rubel hossain ( centre ) celebrates during his team 's 15 - run victory on monday the case for moores âs defence revolves around the fact that england have been mainly hopeless at one - day cricket since the 1992 cricket world cup
and one - day cricket is all england have been playing since they won three tests in a row against india in july and august
his advocates also argue that he inherited a shambles born of an ashes whitewash , just as he did when he first got the job in 2007
unlike andy flower , he did not have jonathan trott , kevin pietersen or graeme swann at his disposal
it was , his supporters argue , never going to turn around overnight
but moores is nearly a year into his second stint , and england are going backwards
in all formats they have won 13 games out of 36 ( forgive the stat ) , including two victories against scotland
their one notable success â a 3 - 1 test win â lost much of its lustre because of india âs hopelessness
for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on twitter : @ the_topspin moores is a genuine and decent man , as ego - free as any coach on the international circuit
it is not his fault that county teams only recently reintroduced the 50 - over format
he did nât write the ecb âs strategic plan , which cited winning this cricket world cup as one of its â key measures â
and we hope he has been tearing his hair out at the failure of jimmy anderson and stuart broad to impose themselves on this competition
but ashley giles âs coaching ambitions paid the price for a single result â the world twenty20 defeat by holland
for moores , the results are beginning to look as wasteful as an eu butter mountain
and there are some crucial areas in which he must surely be accountable
moores was one of the selectors who last summer backed alastair cook as one - day captain , robbing morgan of the chance to acquaint himself with the job during the home series against india and the trip to sri lanka
that stubbornness meant morgan was learning on the job
is it any surprise that his batting has disintegrated ? then there was the tinkering for england âs tournament opener against australia
what possessed moores to demote james taylor from no 3 , and replace him with gary ballance , who had just returned from injury , rather than with alex hales , a proven match - winner in limited - overs internationals ? moores is due to rouse the likes of stuart broad for ashes in the summer - but will he still be in a job ? joe root was one of five top - order batsmen caught behind against bagladesh in test - style dismissals old foe mitchell johnson ( centre ) and the mighty australians await england again in the ashes and what of the tendency to err on the side of caution ? against bangladesh , five of the top seven were out caught in the slip cordon , as if they were playing test cricket
if these things are not moores âs department , what are ? graves must now decide whether england can risk giving the downton / moores ticket a crack at the ashes â victory in which , by the way , also forms part of the ecb âs strategic plan
waiting in the wings is gillespie , a figure colin graves admires from their time together at yorkshire , where gillespie also worked with paul farbrace , moores âs no 2
colin graves may be unimpressed with england âs out - of - date tactics in australia , and equally concerned to hear downton tell sky sports : â what has struck me has been how much influence t20 is having on one - day cricket , and a lot of our players do n't play much t20 cricket , so that is clearly something we have to look at
â well , who âd have thought it ! the sadness is that no non-england fans will lament their absence from the cricket world cup quarter - finals
they played dull , fearful cricket , stuck between a rock and a time warp
even factoring in the global schadenfreude that usually accompanies an england defeat , they have re-entered the realms of laughing stock
if colin graves is happy with that , then god help english cricket
that was the week that was kevin pietersen on the money kevin pietersen âs views may not be welcome at high command , but he had a pertinent point to make after england âs 15 - run defeat by bangladesh
â do not say we havent prioritised odi cricket ! â he tweet - screamed
â we played a back to back ashes to make sure england played 6 months of odi 's before this wc ! â and he âs right
far from helping england in either event , the rejigged schedule has , in successive winters , produced the joint - worst ashes defeat in history and their most miserable exit yet from a cricket world cup
a home loss to australia this summer and the ecb will have presided over quite the hat - trick
outspoken england critic kevin pietersen ( centre ) watches qpr vs tottenham last saturday respectfully yours , the bcci speaking of laughing stocks , the bcci press release that followed virat kohli âs invective - laden outburst against an indian journalist ( the wrong one , as it turned out ) was a classic of its genre
having already issued a peremptory â and entirely wrong â statement , in which it was claimed virat kohli had nât sworn and had apologised to the journalist in person , the indian board then issued another
the takeaway line was this : â the bcci respects the role played by the media in covering and popularising the game of cricket , and acknowledges the support of the media , in its mission to administer and promote the game of cricket in india
â so respectful are the bcci of the media that press releases on tour routinely read : â monday : no media activity
tuesday : no media activity
wednesday : no media activity
â thank goodness for the respect â¦ virat kohli enjoys a kickabout in training with india - but his team are not playing ball with the media reporters , not supporters then again , perhaps it âs just a misunderstanding
as the indian board sought to manage the damage , they wheeled out ravichandran ashwin , the thoughtful off - spinner
â media here are here to support us , â he said
â it âs very heartening to see the media turn up in huge numbers and try to support us
â it âs not known whether ravichandran ashwin handed out pom - poms and tutu skirts to the assembled hacks , but then he clearly thought he did nât need to
