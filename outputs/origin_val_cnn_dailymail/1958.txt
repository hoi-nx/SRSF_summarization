monsoon - like conditions forced the abandonment of sunday 's a-league match between the roar and phoenix - a decision that could have implications on the title race
after torrential rain had left the lang park pitch covered in large puddles , making even short passes difficult , referee alan milliner decided to bring things to a premature conclusion on 73 minutes
league leaders phoenix were leading 2 - 1 at the time and move four points clear at the top of the table because the result was allowed to stand
roar 's andrija kaluderovic and wellington 's andrew durrante struggle in atrocious conditions as torrential rain left the lang park pitch unplayable and forced an abandonment after 73 minutes luke brattan takes a tumble to the waterlogged surface under pressure from wellington 's vince lia referee alan milliner explains his decision to abandon the contest to roar player matt mckay the officials explain their decision to call off the game with 17 minutes remaining but roar coach frans thijssen reacted angrily to the decision to call off the match despite the wild weather turning proceedings into a farce
brisbane are in contention for the play - offs and frans thijssen criticised the rule that states a replay is required if the match is abandoned before half - time but the result stands if it ends after the break
he said : ' of course i 'm disappointed because this is a crazy end
' i 've never seen this , because the choice is replay if it happens in the first - half , they 're the normal rules , and if it happens in the second - half you have to play the second - half again
roar players protest the referee 's decision , having been 2 - 1 down at the time brisbane 's andrija kaluderovic attempts to get a shot away on the deteriorating surface wellington 's alex rodriguez ( left ) and brisbane 's corey brown splash through the puddles ' we all want an honest competition and adelaide and perth , they 're not happy with this because they are in a competition to be champions
' and we 're in a competition to be in the play - offs , so of course it 's disappointing
' when we had a free - kick in a dangerous position where we could score , they just call off the game and they give three points to one team and no points to the other team , that 's not an honest competition
' brisbane led after five minutes through andrija kaluderovic before michael mcglinchey equalised for the visitors 10 minutes later
then , moments before the half - time whistle , australian international nathan burns pounced to put wellington ahead
they are now four points ahead of melbourne victory , sydney fc and perth glory , who are all tied on 38 points in second place
