les noirauds is an organisation under royal patronage founded in 1876 , which collects money for children 's charities
members of les noirauds blacken their faces and dress in white top hats , ruffled collars , bright green trousers and stockings , emulating what they call # 19th century african noblemen '
the group , accompanied by reynders , appeared during a charity rally in brussels last saturday accompanied by a band dubbed the ' conservatoire africain ' ( african conservatory )
despite the criticism on twitter , very little response has come from withing the belgian political sphere , with even the left - leaning green party saying les noirauds were innocuous folklore
reynders , who on his website stresses the importance of central africa in belgian 's foreign policy , posted pictures of himself with blackened face on his blog and twitter , describing how he collected funds for children 's charities
the congo , is the largest country in central africa and was a belgian colony until 1960
millions of congo are estimated to have died and the country was decimated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when belgian king leopold ii ran congo as his personal fiefdom .
