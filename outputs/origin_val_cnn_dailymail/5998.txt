mills has two rare skin conditions , photo - aggravated eczema and solar urticaria , which cause her to break out in painful welts when she spends just seconds in direct sunlight
but it is not just the outside of monroe that suffers when she is exposed , it is her insides too
when she does , the only way to soothe her is to wrap her up in bandages ( pictured above with her doll also named monroe ) monroe , 2 , has suffered from the condition since she was born
she is pictured on the right with her late cat , marley mother sarah mills , from nambucca heads on new south wales ' mid-north coast , told daily mail australia her daughter gets headaches and stomach pains along with becoming lethargic and dizzy
' a gp just told us she gets [ the symptoms ] outside as well as inside her body , ' the 28 - year - old said
to help prevent this from happening , monroe wears a head - to - toe bodysuit to cover up as well as slathering on sunscreen and zinc , and wearing a hat and sunglasses
ms mills said it was mission for the family to go shopping or to the doctor 's , and lately the two - year - old 's reactions had become so severe that they have had to start carrying around an epipen
mother sarah mills ( pictured left with her son , hendrix , and monroe ) is fighting to have daughter 's conditions recognised as a disability exposure to the sun causes painful welts and means monroe spends most of the night awake
ms mills said she averages four hours sleep on ' a good night ' the flare - ups could also be caused by fluoroscent lights inside shopping centres she said monroe 's flare - ups could happen any time her daughter stepped into the sunlight
she could be outside for 20 seconds or just a matter of minutes before she would break out
' we just remain as indoors as much as humanly possibly , ' mr monroe said
' we run into the shops as fast as we can from the car
' if we wanted to go shopping , she âd have a flare up from the fluorescent lights
' when monroe 's skin does break out in welts , the only way to soothe her is to put her in a bleach bath , apply steroid creams , and then wrap her in wet and dry layers of bandages
this happens so often now that the little girl becomes distraught when she sees her mother getting out any type of cream
' she 's become extremely scared of creams
when she sees the sunscreen or steroid creams come out she starts crying , ' ms mills told daily mail australia
' she 's had enough of being creamed up 24 hours a day
at night , she breaks down and starts crying because she 's so itchy and in pain
' the two - year - old 's brother , hendrix ( pictured on the left ) , has autism
ms mills recently had to quit her job to become monroe 's full - time carer to prevent her breaking out , monroe dons a head - to - toe bodysuit ( pictured ) along with slathering on sunscreen and wearing sunglasses this is monroe 's every day life and her welts can last for 20 minutes to several hours
broken sleep patterns are the norm for her and ms mills who averages about four hours a night on ' a good night '
' it âs extremely heart breaking to watch her in so much pain
now that she is at the age where she can put two and two together she asks from the back seat while we 're driving to doctors : " why does the sun hate me , mummy ? " , ' ms mills said
' it just shatters my heart for her when she thinks that the sun hates her
' on top of looking after monroe , ms mills also has an autistic five - year - old son , hendrix
she recently had to quit her job to become a full - time carer
people point and laugh at monroe ( left ) when she is in her bodysuit ( right ) and ms mills wants that to stop by raising awareness of her daughter 's conditions the single mother - of - two has started up a fundraising campaign to help her cover the costs of caring for monroe , which include a special $ 50 sunscreen and $ 200 in fuel costs a month to visit a doctor in newcastle
ms mills said she spends at least $ 200 a week on meeting monroe 's needs alone
she gets no other assistance from the federal government other than a carer 's allowance because they do not recognise monroe 's conditions as a disability
' i ca n't work because of how demanding her needs are
no employer is going to be okay with me taking every second week off because monroe is in hospital , ' she said
ms mills says she has reached breaking point while caring for monroe and is trying to get more help at first , ms mills used her miracle for monroe facebook page to raise awareness of her daughter 's conditions because people were laughing and pointing at her in the street when she wore her bodysuit
' in the beginning , she was pointed at and laughed at , not just by kids but adults too
she picks up on it now and i want everyone in the world to know [ about her conditions ] and stop laughing at her , ' ms mills said
' i want people to understand the struggles she âs going through
' we have people ask her what âs wrong with her and i tell them she âs allergic to the sun and people say : " thank goodness , i thought she had been burnt "
' i 'm not saying being burnt is not bad , but there 's a light at the end of the tunnel
whereas monroe is in constant pain and doctors are happy to say stay home
' she ca n't even play in the park
