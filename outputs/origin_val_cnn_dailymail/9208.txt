ukip 's rise in popularity has been built on railing against rising immigration numbers but farage has conceded foreigners have brought one benefit to uk : the food has improved
in an interview apparently designed to soften his image , the ukip leader admitted he would ' not be very good ' as prime minister and revealed how the pressure of fronting the party of ' diy politics ' means he does not have a normal family life
but while david cameron , ed miliband and nick clegg slug it out to argue they should be in power , mr farage admitted he probably is not up to the job
when asked whether he would make a good prime minister , he told confessed : ' i do n't think that 's my role in life , i do n't think i 'd be very good at it either
' in an attempt to appear less reactionary than in previous media appearances , he tried to find the positive in a range of issues , including migration
he argued that for years uk cuisine was dire and there were few good restaurants , but the arrival of chefs from around the world had transformed the nation 's dining
he said : ' just look at the food , i am just about old enough to remember when it was awful and going out was actually quite difficult
' but he could not resist making a political point , adding : ' if you control immigration sensibly and do it properly it can be a benefit to the country and it can enrich the culture too , no arguments about that
' he used a highly - personal interview with itv 's good morning britain to show a more human side , and revealed the impact of politics on his family life and his relationship with his wife kirsten
' ukip has been a diy political party , i mean most of us have never been involved in politics before , ' he said
the tv interview appeared designed to present a softer side to mr farage , with him seen walking wistfully along a beach in the shadow of the white cliffs of dover as a result , politics caused problems in his marriage to first wife grainne , which ended in divorce in 1997
he said : ' i was , i had been married once before and it did n't end very well but then that 's life is n't it , we have our ups and downs in life
' politics had begun to impinge and that did not help
of that there is no question at all
' his second wife kirsten revealed last week how she has to stay at home and look after their children because her husband 's job running ukip means she is effectively a single mother
german - born mrs farage revealed that her husband did not even know where basic household equipment was kept
' he just called me and asked where do we keep the ironing board as he needed to iron his shirt , ' she said
' i 'm not that surprised
it is a bit worrying
' today mr farage said his wife was ' somebody who was completely honest , with no particular side , who said pretty frankly what she thought and how she saw things and i quite liked that '
he went on : ' i mean to be honest with you , i think my whole family would rather i had never gone into politics , i 'd stayed doing what i was doing , i ca n't even pretend to have a normal family relationship at this moment in time because i do n't
' asked about regrets in life , he said : ' i 've thought about that a lot , i 've thought a lot about that question and i think , frankly , if you do have regrets and if those regrets bother you , then you are not living now are you ?
