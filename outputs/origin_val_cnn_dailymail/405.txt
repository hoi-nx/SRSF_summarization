ten reasons to give manuel pellegrini a sliver of hope that manchester city can catch chelsea
ten reasons to disturb mourinho as he turns his full focus on the premier league
mourinho has a five - point lead to preserve at the top of the premier league and a game in hand if he is to bring the title to stamford bridge for the first time in five years
what had seemed set to break into a procession at times could yet become a contest if chelsea can not kick the habit of throwing away the lead
it has happened 10 times this season and the unwanted trend has accelerated since the turn of the year
thiago silva headed home to knock chelsea out of the champions league in another poor result after leading chelsea players surround the referee before zlatan ibrahimovic was sent off during the hot - tempered affair mourinho 's side have let leads slip in no less than 10 games in all compeitions this season problems seemed to kick in after the draw against sunday 's opponents southampton , at st mary 's , on 28 december
it was a day when mourinho fumed about penalties not awarded and a ' campaign ' against his team
maybe the chelsea manager had already detected signs of what might lie ahead
2014 - 15 : p43 w29 d11 l3 before jan : p28 w21 d6 l1 since jan : p15 w8 d5 l2 games are more difficult after the new year , with capital one cup semi-finals and a final and the first knock - out round of the champions league
fatigue starts to bite with a manager with a small core of players he seems happy to use , which do n't include filipe luis or remy
yet it is chelsea 's inability to close out many games which will trouble mourinho
his teams have consistently boasted this quality , and it remains
they closed out the capital one cup final against spurs expertly , but seven times in 15 games since the turn of the year they have let a lead slip
zlatan ibrahimovic blasts past gary cahill as chelsea let a 1 - 0 lead slip in paris fabregas against burnley ( left ) , while frank lampard and terry catch up as manchester city grab a point drogba struggles against bradford ( left ) as matic looks on against liverpool terry offers eden hazard consoling words against spurs ( left ) , with robin van persie equalising at old trafford diego costa fronts up to pablo zabaleta at the etihad , with schalke celebrating in front of fabregas it might be more likely to develop into a battle if manchester city were not misfiring , too
arsenal and liverpool are in more fluent form but a little further adrift
chelsea are not about to implode spectacularly
psg h ( champions league ) led twice 2 - 2 aet burnley h ( pl ) led 1 - 1
psg a ( champions league ) led 1 - 1
man city h ( pl ) led 1 - 1
bradford h ( fac ) led 2 - 0 lost 2 - 4
liverpool a ( c1c ) led 1 - 1
spurs a ( pl ) led 1 - 0 lost 3 - 5
man united a ( pl ) led drew 1 - 1
manchester city a ( pl ) led drew 1 - 1
schalke h ( champions league ) led drew 1 - 1 over the campaign , they have been easily the best in the premier league
they will probably win the title
rather , tiny problems have cropped up where there were none
if nothing else , it will keep mourinho busy in the summer , in his restless quest for perfection
he will prioritise another central defender , with raphael varane top of the list , and will work to tighten up a defence which has shown tiny uncharacteristic flaws
opposing teams will have noted how thibaut courtois , amid a brilliant season , has had issues with crosses whipped in , six yards from goal
both psg goals were headed in from this region
so was burnley 's equaliser
and manchester city 's equaliser came after he was beaten in such a duel by james milner
thibaut courtois has started to struggle to deal with crosses whipped into the box , leading to goals conceded fabregas , battling marco verratti , has not been firing on all cylinders since christmas mourinho will also like to add another defensive option in midfield , for the really big games at the business end of the champions league
missing only john obi mikel from his squad , his midfield was dominated by psg and matic , outstanding all season , played at full stretch , his passing not at its best , under pressure against blaise matiudi , thiago motta and the excellent marco verratti
the form of fabregas has been flat since his return from a hamstring injury and when he does n't dazzle he does not have the defensive strengths to satisfy his manager
there are games against teams like psg , when mourinho would like another strong athletic presence alongside matic
diego costa has been more noticeable for his physical play and histrionics than his goalscoring ability without the creative flair of fabregas , the goals have dried up for diego costa , who may be off the pace because of his ban , as mourinho claimed , but also seems to be distracted by the need to prove he will not change his physical game to appease those who do n't like it
eden hazard shows no sign of losing his mojo but drogba 's influence has faded through the season and remy does not appear to be trusted
so chelsea expect be in the market for options up front , too
mourinho always says a manager can never be happy and even if , as expected , he goes on to claim the title , he will be busy this summer
some people thought he had already built one of the great teams of the modern era , but there is work to do and no - one knows it more than him .
