europes largest budget airline has just been granted approval to develop a transatlantic service between europe and us
ryanair , the ireland - based budget carrier , plans to run services between key europe cities and the us with one - way tickets costing from as little as $ 15
the idea is part of an aggressive growth strategy , connecting airports such as london stansted and berlin with new york , boston and miami
ryanair , europe 's largest budget airline , has received board approval to develop a transatlantic service for budget passengers , with one - way tickets between the us and key europe cities costing as little as $ 15 the airline first mooted the idea of offering transatlantic flights back in 2008 and board approval comes after the airline has invested 18 months in cleaning up its image and improving customer service
it is believed it could take up to five years to realize the plan , as the airline needs to source appropriate long - haul aircraft for the routes
last year , michael oâleary , the airline âs chief executive , told the irish hotels federation conference in meath that ryanair would offer the $ 15 flights to boston and new york
however , he admitted that passengers would pay extra for everything from meals to baggage
he said : ' we can make money on 99 cent fares in europe
o'leary previously said the airline has long been looking at long - haul flight plans , but is held back by a lack of aircraft availability ' not every seat will be ( $ 15 ) of course ; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats
' in a separate conversation , mr o'leary admitted : ' we 've had a business plan ready to roll for a transatlantic , low - fares airline
' the difficulty is , i keep cautioning , is that there 's no availability of long - haul aircraft for another four or five years
' sir freddie laker revolutionised air travel with his idea for budget flights between europe and the us , but his airline failed in 1982 ryaniar is n't the only airline to consider offering budget transatlantic flights
previously , sir freddie laker launched skytrain in the late seventies to offer ' no frills ' flights to the us , but his carrier lake airways failed in 1982
zoom airlines tried a similar concept in 2002 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2008
more recently , norwegian has launched its own budget flights between london gatwick , new york , boston and los angeles from as little as Â£ 389 ( $ 415 ) return .
