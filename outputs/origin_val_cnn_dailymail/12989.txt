shankar had the idea for " power / rangers " when he was 7 years old
" this was before the internet , and my access to tv and video games was pretty limited , " the producer recalled thursday , in the midst of the " power / rangers " frenzy
" so all you really had was ( to ) tell people stories
so i 'd tell people ' captain planet ' stories , and then i started telling them these dark ' power ranger ' stories
" and i got into trouble , " he added
" because the parents were like , ' this guy , he 's ruining our children ! ' " that was more than 20 years ago for shankar
but the producer , now 30 , got his wish when his dark version of the " power rangers , " directed by friend kahn , made it online -- and proceeded to rack up more than 11 million views on youtube in less than two days
fans buzzing over bloody ' power / rangers ' ' bootleg ' in some ways , shankar is still getting into trouble
not only did the video explode the power rangers mythology , showing the impact of serving as " child soldiers , " in shankar 's phrase , but the video became a legal football after the owner of the franchise , saban entertainment , claimed infringement
first it was taken down from vimeo and then youtube
however , it was reposted in both places late friday after lawyers reached agreement , deadline reported
among the additions : a disclaimer from shankar that his " bootleg " is " my take on the fan film
not a pilot , not a series , not for profit , strictly for exhibition
this is a bootleg experiment not affiliated or endorsed by saban entertainment or lionsgate nor is it selling any product
i claim no rights to any of the characters ( do n't send me any money , not kickstarted , this film is free )
" saban entertainment has its own plans to reboot the popular ' 90s franchise with a theatrical film scheduled for 2016
' an interesting experiment ' so who are these guys , anyway ? kahn is a famed music video director , probably best known for britney spears ' " toxic , " eminem 's " without me " ( for which he won a grammy ) and taylor swift 's " blank space
" he 's also handled a number of commercials and the films " detention " and " torque
" shankar is a producer of such films as " the grey , " " killing them softly " and " dredd
" this is n't the first time he 's made a " bootleg " short
previous videos have included one featuring marvel 's punisher character and one drawing from marvel 's venom character
in a reddit ama , kahn said that " power / rangers " was " self - funded
" a special effects house , ingenuity engine , " worked six months on this and took a bath financially , " he added
shankar declined to give a budget for " power / rangers , " which was shot over a few days last year , but says it was mainly financed through favors and the principals ' money
" it was all favors , " he says , noting that star james van der beek " is one of my best friends
" the film also starred " battlestar galactica 's " katee sackhoff
both shankar and kahn like to subvert concepts and cliches
kahn said he was drawn to " power / rangers " because " it was an interesting experiment to play with reboot culture and tone control
... i did n't come into it to please a fan base , per se , but to experiment with pop culture
" and shankar ? even his look tries to upset stereotypes
in the video he made to explain " power / rangers , " he 's wearing eye makeup like the 1970s alice cooper , a look he adopted " because i do n't want to be ( an indian ) stereotype , " he told cnn
' kind of a war brewing ' shankar comes by his outlook honestly
the indian - born producer had an itinerant childhood thanks to his father 's job , traveling frequently -- various indian cities , china , singapore -- before moving on to the next place
he came to the american at 16
he says he thinks of his childhood as " jarring , " with the only constants comic books , movies and television
" just moving around so much , literally every two years , " he said
" i did n't feel like i had a friend until i was 18
if you 're moving to a different school , let alone a different country every couple years , it 's kind of jarring as a kid
there was no consistency for me in a cultural context " except for american movies and pop culture
he attended school at northwestern university in chicago , where he founded a successful ad agency , and then moved to hollywood , which he describes as " a dream of mine
" though both men were successful before , " power / rangers " has given them new visibility -- partly thanks to the bottom - up enthusiasm for the project
both filmmakers wax philosophical about the impact
" internet changes things , " kahn tweeted after congratulating supporters
" new world , new rules
" shankar observes that " power / rangers " is just another marker in a continuing debate between creativity , intellectual property and fan - driven culture
" there 's kind of a war brewing between the old world and the new world , " he said
" the internet has kind of been a nuclear warhead on a lot of businesses and a lot of industries
... it 's kind of bizarre to be thrown in the middle of it
i 'm literally just a fan making a fan video
" it 's not about dollars and cents , he added : " is that what we 're about ? we 're one massive consumerist mosh pit ? " in the meantime , he 's got plenty of other projects cooking , including a crime thriller set in a world of both puppets and humans that 's like " a really dark , violent ' muppet movie
' " it all comes down to the same impulse that drove him to tell stories when he was 7 , he says
" i 'm just a creative dude , " he said .
