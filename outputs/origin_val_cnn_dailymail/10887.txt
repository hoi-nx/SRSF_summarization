known as the ' gadget king ' heath robinson is best remembered for his drawings of farcically complicated machines which achieved very simple objectives
born in 1872 , he began by illustrating books such as hans christian andersen 's danish fairy tales and legends ( 1897 ) and tales from shakespeare ( 1902 )
during the first world war , he drew ever - more - unlikely secret weapons being used by the enemy while producing a stream of humorous drawings for magazines and advertisements
most of his cartoons have since been reprinted many times in multiple collections and the term ' heath robinson ' came to be known as an improbable , rickety machine barely kept going by incessant tinkering
one of his most famous series of illustrations were in norman hunter 's professor branestawm book which featured a brilliant if eccentric professor and his inventions
' with the new museum opening in 2016 and the country marking the centenary of the first world war , there 's a renewed interest in heath robinson 's work and we felt that it was important to keep this collection together for the nation to rediscover and enjoy
' geoffrey beare , of the william heath robinson trust , said : ' these works provide a perfect complement to the william heath robinson trust 's existing collection , which is particularly strong in illustration
' it will permit us to mount a broader range of exhibitions in our new museum and maintain our programme of touring exhibitions
' we are proud to become custodians of such an exciting collection of works by one of britain 's best loved artists
' following heath robinson 's death in 1944 , his collection was split in two , with the larger part stored in the national magazine company warehouse until the 1970s when it was bought by family friend mr simon heneage , publisher and founder of the cartoon museum
although many pieces were sold or donated by mr simon heneage , he kept the best of the collection for display in his private gallery and they will now be reunited with the other part of the artist 's collection which is in the hands of the william heath robinson trust .
