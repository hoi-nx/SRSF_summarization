spending on the security services could be merged with the defence budget to hit a key nato target , cameron indicated yesterday
the prime minister is under intense pressure from both his own mps and former generals to guarantee that the conservatives will continue to spend at least 2 per cent of britain âs national income on defence
a study published yesterday revealed that britain will miss the target by more than Â£ 2billion next year if current spending plans are maintained
missing this figure would be deeply embarrassing for mr cameron , who lectured other western leaders on the need to maintain defence spending at the nato summit in wales last year
but he indicated that he could hit the target by re-badging the Â£ 2billion budget for the security services as defence spending
prime minister cameron is under fire over claims britain will fail to meet its nato target of spending at least 2 per cent of its national income on defence next year he told lbc radio : â i have a responsibility to make sure we make the right decisions about defence and other security spending
â i look at these things in the round , so i am also concerned about the budget for mi5 , the secret intelligence service , gchq , counter-terrorism policing
to me all of these things are part of our national defence
â a study by the impartial house of commons library yesterday revealed that britain will need to spend an additional Â£ 2.2billion on defence next year in order to hit the target â and an extra Â£ 1billion every year after that
it added that current plans suggest defence spending will otherwise represent only 1.87 per cent of national income next year
but former tory defence minister sir gerald howarth condemned the move as a â complete cop - out â
an raf typhoon fighter jets was scrambled to escort a russian bear bomber when it flew into britain airspace last month
there are fears a defence funding squeeze would leave the britain reluctant to tackle such incursions he said last night : â no amount of fancy footwork or creative accountancy is going to fool anybody
adding the security budget to defence will not produce a single extra bullet or soldier
â it does nât address the fundamental problem that the britain and our allies face very real threats â a resurgent russian , complete turmoil in the middle east and many other threats around the world
former tory defence minister sir gerald howarth has condemned the move as a â complete cop - out â ' if this idea goes ahead it will be seen by all for the gimmick that it is
â mr cameron has faced repeated attacks over defence spending from former military leaders
the former head of the army , general sir peter wall , warned that the funding squeeze was leaving the britain reluctant to tackle russian incursions into its airspace and offshore waters
another former army chief , lord dannatt , said it would be â extraordinary â for a tory government to fail to meet its commitments on defence
mr cameron yesterday showed his irritation at the comments â suggesting that some vocal critics were speaking out in order to promote their memoirs
he said : â obviously they have their own book to talk â sometimes quite literally a book to talk â and sometimes they just want to make their views known
â tory rebels plan to force a commons vote on defence spending tomorrow
many are angered mr cameron has pledged to spend 0.7 per cent of our income on foreign aid , but will not make a firm commitment to meet the nato target .
