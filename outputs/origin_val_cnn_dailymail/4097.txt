anne , whose memoir of a life in hiding from the nazis became the single most poignant piece of holocaust literature , was later transferred to the belsen concentration camp in germany where she died early in 1945

he was on duty when jewish diarist anne arrived at auschwitz-birkenau ( above ) hubert zafke is now charged in the complicity of 3,681 murders - victims who were gassed or shot when he was on duty
although classed as a medic , such personnel at auschwitz-birkenau were not concerned with the health of inmates , but often poured zyklon-b pesticide crystals into the gas chamber to murder them
more than 1.1 million people , mostly jewish , were liquidated at auschwitz-birkenau
the indictment shows that hubert zafke , who now lives in the tiny village of gnevkow north of berlin , joined the hitler youth when he was a teenager in his hometown of schoenau , which now lies in poland
the son of a farmer , he attended high school and an agricultural college intending to follow in his father 's footsteps
in 1933 , aged 13 , he joined the hitler youth and six years later was in the ss. he received his grounding in concentration camp training at dachau , the first of the nazi camps where 36,000 people were murdered during its 12 - year operation
as a junior squad leader - a rank usually given to men singled out as future officer material - hubert zafke transferred to auschwitz-birkenau in the summer of 1944
he is charged with being an accomplice to the murders of the 3,681 victims between august 14 and september 14 , 1944
prosecutors said : ' he is not charged with any single specific murder but as a functionary in the nazi murder machine which he enabled
' auschwitz-birkenau was liberated by the red army on january 27 , 1945 , now world holocaust day , but hubert zafke had already gone west and fell into british hands
anne ( above ) came in on a train carrying 498 men , 442 women and 79 children from holland 's westerbork concentration camp on september 5 , 1944 , prosecution documents released at the weekend show prosecutors said hubert zafke , who transferred to auschwitz-birkenau ( above ) in the summer of 1944 , ' is not charged with any single specific murder but as a functionary in the nazi murder machine which he enabled ' he was later transferred back to poland where he was given a three year jail sentence in 1948 for his membership in the ss and service at auschwitz-birkenau
he returned to germany , married and had four sons who be brought up in gnevkow
he made a career out of manufacturing and selling agricultural products including pesticides
gnevkow lay in former germany
when the wall fell and archives in poland , germany and former soviet russia became accessible , he came on to the radar of nazi hunters
the verdict against john demnjanjuk , a former guard at the sobibor death camp in occupied poland , in 2011 paved the way for hubert zafke 's prosecution
demjanjuk was sentenced to five years in jail for his part in the murders of 28,000 dutch jews
it was the first time that there was not specific eyewitness evidence against an individual - the mere fact he was present in the camp was enough for a guilty verdict
anne , whose memoir of a life in hiding from the nazis became the single most poignant piece of holocaust literature , was later transferred to the belsen concentration camp in germany where she died early in 1945 hubert zafke does not deny his service at auschwitz-birkenau but claims : ' i heard nothing , saw nothing , killed no - one
' although he lives alone and cares for himself , his lawyer has already filed a motion seeking to have the charges dropped , claiming he is suffering from dementia
christoph heubner , executive vice president of the international auschwitz committee , said : ' for the survivors of auschwitz-birkenau this is all about justice , not revenge
justice has had to wait decades
' he added : ' those perpetrators who ensured , as members of the ss , that the auschwitz-birkenau death factory worked smoothly , and that the jewish families of europe disappeared into the gas chambers , have developed no sense of awareness of wrongdoing over the years
' therefore these legal processes are first and foremost an inquiry to the germans - who actually owns your compassion ? '
