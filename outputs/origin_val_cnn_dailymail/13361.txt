when bush spoke last week at the conservative political action conference in national harbor , maryland , the likely gop presidential hopeful did better than expected
of course , that could have been because expectations were so low
" when george w. bush was president , it afflicted liberals who thought the chief executive could n't do anything right
now that bush might run for president in 2016 , the condition vexes conservatives who believe that when it comes to choosing the gop nominee , the former florida governor is all wrong
during bush 's speech , a few dozen supporters of sen. rand paul of kentucky -- wearing red t - shirts with the words " stand with rand " -- walked out and later blasted bush as insufficiently conservative
but what should really count for a lot is that bush is sufficiently competent
he 's the grownup in a roomful of extremists who -- as they compare union members to isis ( scott walker ) or vow to abolish the irs ( ted cruz ) or bash the media ( chris christie ) -- seem most interested in applause lines
bush is a serious person with a serious shot at the presidency , something that you just ca n't say about all republicans who appear to be running
as someone who is bilingual and whose wife hails from mexico , bush can hit hillary clinton , the likely democratic nominee , where it hurts by carving into her latino support
in his 1998 gubernatorial election , and 2002 re-election , bush received over 60 percent of the latino vote
and it 's no secret that , for many latinos who might vote for bush , the make - or - break issue is immigration
that 's because many latinos see immigration as a way of determining a candidate 's character
latinos will be watching to see if bush stands up to the pressure from extremists to join the gop 's closed border chorus
they 're used to being thrown under the bus by politicians who sacrifice latinos to gin up support from non-latinos
and they wo n't put up with it
so which way is bush going to go on immigration ? for many years , he extolled the contributions of immigrants and expressed dismay that elements of his party are closed - minded and mean - spirited on the issue
he even acknowledged that , to many , the party is seen as " anti-immigrant
" lately , though , bush has injected more nuance into his views -- and turned them mushy in the process
on the question of whether undocumented youth should have a path to citizenship , for example , bush at first supported the idea , then he opposed it
and most recently , he has said that he could support such a path if congress mandates it
on the arizona immigration law , bush apparently likes the concept of enlisting local police to be " the eyes and ears " of the border patrol
but he has also been sympathetic to critics who worry that this will lead to ethnic profiling of latinos
too often , bush leaves the impression that he 'll say whatever he needs to say to avoid conflict
so it was actually refreshing to see bush use his appearance at conservative political action conference -- which took the form of an onstage interview by conservative talk show host sean hannity -- to once again speak plainly
in response to questions , bush emphasized the need to secure the united states border , insisted that immigration policy should be driven by economic concerns and the need for high - skilled immigrants , and reaffirmed support for giving undocumented immigrants driver 's licenses and in - state tuition at public colleges and universities
the crowd booed that last one
bush criticized president obama 's executive actions to prioritize deportations , but also bashed gop in congress for protesting that policy by holding up funds for the department of homeland security
finally , in response to what is often the most contentious aspect of this debate , bush also stressed the need to create a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants who are currently in the united states
" i know there 's disagreement here , " he said
" the simple fact is that there is no plan to deport 11 million people
we should give them a path to legal status where they work ... and contribute to our society
the way bush sees it , the gop is good at being against things but " we have to start being for things again
" in response to a heckler , bush stared out into the crowd to address his critic
" i 'm marking you down as neutral , " he told the heckler
" i 'll look forward to being your second choice
in the washington times / conservative political action conference presidential preference straw poll of 3,007 participants , bush came in fifth out of 17 candidates with just 8 percent of the vote
first place went to rand paul , who earned 25.7 percent
clearly , bush has a long way to go in convincing conservatives that he 's their best choice
but his appearance at conservative political action conference set exactly the right tone
voters in both parties have plenty of candidates telling them what they want to hear just to get their support
what they need are more candidates who tell them what they need to hear : the truth
that wo n't make the candidates popular
but it does make them credible
score 1 for bush .
