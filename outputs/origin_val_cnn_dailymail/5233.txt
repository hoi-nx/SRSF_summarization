brian oâdonnell and his doctor wife mary pat â who once controlled a vast global property empire â have fought attempts by bank of ireland to recover the millions for the past four years
at midday on monday , bank - appointed receiver kavanagh was due to take possession of gorse hill in killiney , south dublin , by order of the supreme court
property tycoon o'donnell and his wife mary pat , who have fought attempts by the bank of ireland to recover the Â£ 52million they owe john marton , a member of the anti-repossession group land league stand at the gates to mr o'donnell 's dublin mansion , where he has barricaded himself in a bank - appointed receiver was due to take possession of gorse hill in killiney , south dublin , pictured , by order of the supreme court and members of anti-repossession group , the land league , congregated at the oâdonnells â south dublin fortress
but now o'donnell has been accused of trespassing on the property as he refused to leave the mansion
it came after a trespass notice was nailed to the front gate of the mansion by representatives of the receivers and o'donnell was asked to leave the house immediately
but in a fresh case by o'donnell 's children , they claim the bank â fraudulently â secured the â¬ 70million ( Â£ 52million ) judgment against their parents and therefore the house can not be seized on foot of that court order , made in december 2011
cian ferriter sc , for the bank , said the oâdonnells â claims were â utterly wild â
he described the notion of any conspiracy by the bank and its advisers against the family as â deluded â
the court heard that the four offspring had in fact surrendered their rights over their home yesterday morning â but that their father was now occupying the property
representatives thought to be from the receiver 's office nail a trespass notice to the front gate of o'donnell 's home in dublin the notice means that mr o'donnell now stands accused of trespassing after refusing to leave the property immediately under orders by the court rossa fanning , for the receiver , told the court : â the property has been barricaded in this afternoon
â the court heard that in a written statement , brian oâdonnell had threatened to call gardaÃ­ ( police ) if the bank âs receiver â should harass us â
his statement , read to the court by mr ferriter , said : â my wife and i have a right of residence in gorse hill ... should kavanagh harass us at the property on march 2 , we will call the police
â mr ferriter told the court he understood that protesters from the land league organisation had â erected some sort of barricade at the property â
he added : â we understand a member of the family is in the house , brian oâdonnell
â this is the type of behaviour orchestrated by the brian oâdonnell family is in the face of what the supreme court determined
we are most troubled by that
â john martin from the land league pictured at the front door to gorse hill , where mr o'donnell has barricaded himself in mr ferriter pointed out that the couple had previously stated they were permanent residents of london , but were â now moving back in â to the dublin home
blake , 31 , told the court the bank was â attempting to remove us from the property and seize it â
he said bank of ireland had â run our family into the courts to try and get judgments and seize our assets from us
â blake added his parents â are in occupation of the property at the moment â and they have a â right of residence â
he added : â myself and my siblings , we have left
it was in the media we were going to be thrown out of the house and i understand a group of protesters have turned up to protest peacefully
' this idea people are barricaded in , i do nât know anything about that
i think it âs sensationalism by the media
â mr justice brian mcgovern said he will give his ruling on the fresh lawsuit today
meanwhile , at the gates of brian oâdonnell âs lavish vico road home last night , the situation escalated after an intense stand - off between the receivers and campaigners
shortly after 6.15pm , a blacked - out eight - seater van pulled up outside gorse hill
speaking through a small crack in the thick wooden gates and high walls , kavanagh , a receiver from kavanagh fennell , asked land league campaigners who they were
mr kavanagh asked the campaigners who owned the red car that blocked the front gate outside mr brian oâdonnell âs property
the receiver was told sharply by one campaigner that the car belonged to the â car âs owners â
the campaigner said he was not prepared to give his name or the names of his associates
but jerry beades of the land league told the mail yesterday : â we are just helping the [ brian oâdonnell ] family as we do any family facing eviction
â after several minutes , mr kavanagh and three other people left the front gate
the campaigners said it â seems likely â they will stay for the night behind the heavy gates , however , they refused to identify themselves or how many were there when asked by the mail
a red car has been parked at the gates to gorse hill to block the property , where anti-eviction campaigners are camped outside as the snow began to fall and temperatures plummeted , the campaigners made their way out on to the quiet south dublin road
one campaigner said they were going to get food before settling in for the night as he told others behind the wall that they would change shifts every four or five hours
