' i am looking forward to contributing to barcelona 's success this season
' it 's a big step in my rehab starting running again
i am very happy to be outside again instead of staying inside in the gym all the time
it 's hard work but it 's worth it
' vermaelen said barcelona had been fully aware of the extent of his injury , which had not initially been diagnosed in tests conducted at the world cup
' barcelona did notice the seriousness of the injury when they did the medical and there were two options , ' he said
' you could do surgery but they said it 's not necessary you can do it with preventative exercises , make it as strong as you can and then it should n't be a problem
' we spoke to a lot of specialists and they all said it 's possible to do without surgery so for me it was an easy choice to go that way
' it did n't work out
we tried for a couple of months and i could feel it was n't the same as before
' so we went to get some advice from another specialist , a very famous one , and he said maybe it 's time to do surgery
i am just following the programme the surgeon told me to do and it 's going well
