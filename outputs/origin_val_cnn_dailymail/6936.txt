a polite sign posted outside a toilet at a shopping centre has raised the question â at what age should children go to public restrooms alone ? the notice , which reads â please boys over 6 years of age use men âs restroom â , was taped to the wall of a women âs toilet at an oklahoma outlet mall , in america
the oklahoma city moms blog posted the image on facebook , sparking debate worldwide
â if you were shopping at a local mall and saw this picture , what would your reaction be ? , â the photo âs caption read
the post comes after calls for more gender - neutral family bathrooms where dads and mums can both take their children
â the new dad added : â the first public men 's room that i go into that has one gets a free shout out on my fb page ! âª # â bethechange
â parenting expert ryan from support service babybliss told daily mail australia the age of when a child should go into a public toilet alone is a â tough question â
â it depends on the child really , â she said
â i think six is too young
i âm not sure if i âd want them to go in a public toilet on their own , â ryan explained
â some boys want to do that at that age , you have to judge the child and whether it is a safe environment
toilets are always an unknown
in australia , many shopping centres have family bathrooms for parents to take their kids â for me , i don â t think i would let them go in on their own , i would want to take them with me
it âs usually when they are a bit older - around 7 or 8 â that they want to go in alone , â ryan said
â what if the child has got a disability or a mental age of two or needs assistance ? , â she asked
ryan also pointed out that in australia most public toilets in modern shopping centres have a family room that can be used by mums and dads
â i actually took my goddaughter into a family toilet yesterday at bondi junction , westfield , in sydney , she âs three
earlier this week hollywood actor ashton kutcher raised the issue of gender neutral bathrooms on his facebook page ashton kutcher , seen here with his partner mila kunis , sparked the debate about a lack of baby changing rooms in men 's toilets at what age would you allow your child to go into a public toilet on their own ? at what age would you allow your child to go into a public toilet on their own ? now share your opinion â i thought â is it only for women ? â but the sign says â parents â and there was a man and a women sign , so i would think most men are allowed to go into them , â ryan reasoned
â i think in this country in the big shopping centres they do cater for men , we do nât have changing rooms in our public toilets whereas the obviously do in america
â we have actual parenting rooms where you can change nappies , there are toys and my goddaughter did nât want to leave
â ryan did note that in some places such as restaurants there are not even any changing facilities
sydney dad mark elias , whose son jacob is almost two years old , told daily mail australia he would let his child go to a public bathroom at â 11 to 12 years â
â but it depends on the kid and the maturity level and the place you are at , â he added
' this day and age it 's better to cautious
' meanwhile , bowman , a mother of three and member of the kings cross parents and carers association , in sydney , said : ' i think it 's clear this sign is inappropriate
i ca n't imagine it complies with any hospitality standards code
' ' parents i know make decisions based on the needs of their child as an individual
maturity of a child has nothing to do with their birth age
some six year old children have the maturity of a four year old , ' ms bowman explained
' part of being a parent is making the best decision for your child 's welfare regardless of the pressure and expectations others impose
' personally i 'll be doing as i see best for each of my three children regardless of this sign , ' she added
at what age would you stop accompanying your child into a public bathroom ?
