scarlets boosted their european champions cup qualification ambitions by seeing at parc y scarlets
the home side remain outside of the top six , but are now just three points behind connacht in the battle to book a place among europe 's elite
it was a deserved win for the llanelli - based region , who put a big dent in leinster 's play - off hopes with just five rounds of action remaining
both sides welcomed back six nations squad members with british and irish lions prop cian healy making his first leinster start since september , while wales centre scott williams had not pulled on a scarlets jersey for six weeks
and the scarlets ' vice-captain came to the fore in a bright start from the home side , which was rewarded with a penalty from fly - half shingler after 10 minutes
however , leinster began to grow into the game as the half wore on and on 18 minutes they showed the clinical edge of champions to claim the game 's opening try
after leinster had set up an attack in the home 22 , former nrl star ben te'o cut an exquisite angle through the scarlets midfield before stepping his way to score at the posts
fly - half gopperth landed the simple conversion
the wasps - bound number 10 added another three points following more pressure from the visitors , but scarlets responded strongly and crossed for their first try just before the half - hour mark
some slick handling by the home backs had leinster on the back foot and scotland back - rower barclay did well to squeeze in at the corner - although it needed the television match official to confirm the number eight had avoided touch in the process of touching down
shingler was short with the conversion and it meant leinster held a slender 10 - 8 advantage at the interval
however , a well - worked team try from the scarlets wiped out that advantage 11 minutes after the restart
after strong work from the forwards which took play to the leinster line , the home side appeared to have butchered an overlap
however , they regrouped well and silky hands from kiwi centre regan king put full - back jordan williams over
a long - range gopperth penalty reduced the arrears to two points , then it needed a try - saving tackle from barclay to deny opposite number jack conan , with james davies claiming a crucial turnover
the outstanding barclay was then involved at the opposite end of the field , bursting through to set up the scarlets third try , finished off with an outstretched hand by replacement rory pitman
shingler could n't land the conversion and seven points separated the sides going into the final 13 minutes
replacement rhys priestland landed a penalty to put more distance between the sides and leinster left empty handed after a score by full - back zane kirchner was ruled out by the tmo in the final minutes .
