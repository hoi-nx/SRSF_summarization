a republicans state senator from maine is in hot water after posting an image on facebook that suggested american president obama is going easy on the isis terror army because it includes some of his family
the posting plays on the discredited conspiracy theory that holds obama is secretly practicing muslim
' why have n't i done anything about isis ? because i 'll deal with them at the family reunion , ' its caption reads
willette , a part - time lawmaker who makes his living selling real estate , shared it march 1 on his facebook wall
' ' i 've been very good over the last year and a half about not posting things about obama , but this one was too good to pass up , ' he wrote in the posting
' i promise this will be the last one for some time
' willette apparently found it on the ' news today ' facebook feed , which supplies a daily diet of anti-obama , anti-clinton and anti-islam material including ' meme ' photos , videos and cartoons
isis , the self - proclaimed islamic state of iraq and al-sham , is an army of terrorists that occupies more than two - thirds of syria and iraq
the group counts tens of thousands of fighters among its ranks , including many drawn from other middle eastern and european nations
its soldiers have been seen in gruesome videos , beheading captured prisoners and burning them alive
president obama has embraced a ' coalition ' approach of airstrikes to fight isis , but has not authorized the pentagon to deploy american ground troops in the region
in a prepared statement on monday , he apologized for posting the item â but did n't say whether he still agreed with it
it was no longer on his facebook page as of monday afternoon
' common sense ' : mike willette 's campaign postcards from the 2014 election season called him a ' rare breed of public servant ' ' i apologize for posting this on facebook , ' willette 's statement read
' like too many people these days , i fell into the trap of posting something first and then thinking later
it was an error in judgment
' the maine democratic party pounced on the scandal , saying willette 's behavior was ' extremely disappointing and shows a severe lack of judgement
' party chairman phil bartlett 's statement slammed willette for perpetuating a ' false racial , religious and ethnic slur at a time when our state and country should come together
' ' this reflects very poorly on the maine gop and we urge their leadership to denounce sen. willette 's actions , ' wrote party chairman phil bartlett
willette himself was a democrat until 2010 , according to the bangor daily news
he switched parties when the maine gop took over control of the state senate .
