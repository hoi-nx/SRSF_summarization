the white house is reportedly considering a new power play in the israeli - palestinian conflict that would paint netanyahu into a corner just days after his stunning come - from - behind victory in his country 's hotly contested elections
in the final days of campaigning , netanyahu vowed in an historic u-turn that his government would never agree to the creation of a palestinian state
but now president obama is contemplating using the un as a trump card to force the issue
under a plan outlined by foreign policy , the state department would ease away from decades of opposition to a un security council resolution demanding peace talks and a final rapprochement between israeli and the pa
the white house cautiously avoided commenting on its future plans on thursday when it was bombarded with questions by reporters on the topic , saying only that it would ' evaluate what our path is forward ' is in light of netanyahu 's comments
not so fast ... the white house is considering a netanyahu smackdown in the form on un leverage to force him into breaking a campaign promise about peace with palestinian watching and waiting : state department spokeswoman jen psaki said wednesday that the us is evaluating its options â leaving the door open for lifting opposition to a un two - state solution pushed on israeli the us and israeli leaders have a famously chilly relationship
a former top - level obama campaign aide helped organize voters aligned with netanyahu 's political opposition â even as the president refused to meet with netanyahu this month , saying he did n't want to influence the election 's outcome
the obama administration hoped to see netanyahu 's left - wing rival , herzog , prevail on tuesday
diplomats at the un privately learned in the run - up to election day that the us would not press the un security council on peace talks if herzog were to win , since he would likely have carried the ball on his own
but with netanyahu poised to organize a coalition government comprised of right - wing and ultra-orthodox parties opposed to a palestinian state , all bets are off
state department spokeswoman jen psaki told reporters on wednesday that ' we âre currently evaluating our approach
we âre not going to prejudge what we would do if there was a un action
' the chief spokesman for white house reiterated the administration 's position on thursday and made clear that no decisions had been made yet on the us ' part
he also refused to characterize the president 's reaction to netanyahu 's victory , stating that , obviously , the president was ' aware ' of it when asked by a reporter if obama was ' disappointed ' with the election results
complicating the situation , the pa says it might take grievances against israeli , stemming from last year 's brief gaza war , to the international criminal court
the palestine liberation organization âs top diplomat in the us explained to foreign policy that the pa could formally accuse israeli of committing war crimes when it fired rockets into populated areas in response to sustained attacks
israeli has said it did all it could to avoid casualties among civilians , but insists militants from the hamas terror group took shelter where collateral damage would be greatest in order to discourage return fire
turning to the international criminal court for redress would prove costly for palestinian , however
the us provides about $ 500 million in annual aid to the pa , and $ 400 million of that is drawn from an economic support fund that members of congress from both sides of the political aisle have threatened to cut off
the us has paid out approximately $ 5 billion in aid money to the pa since the 1990s , according to the nonpartisan congressional research service â representing about one in four dollars it receives from the international community
but at the end of january an astonishing 75 out of 100 us senators signed a letter to secretary of state kerry warning that any palestinian action against israeli in the international criminal court would be met by a budget axe
the 2015 budget appropriations bill , signed by obama , explicitly prohibited funding for the pa if it were to initiate â or even actively support â an international criminal court probe related to war crimes accusations against israeli
big chill : president obama has had the frostiest relationship with israeli of any us leader since the 1970s the senators warned kerry that mahmoud abbas was illegally challenging ' israeli âs legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory
' pa president mahmoud abbas officially joined the international criminal court late last year
in the days following the seating of the new congress in january â long before netanyahu notched his surprising re-election win â the state department seemed to lean toward supporting the senate
state department spokeswoman jen psaki told reporters then that action in the international criminal court could have unspecified ' implications ' for future us - palestinian aid
' congress has a great deal of power in that regard , ' she said
but administration officials are now leaning toward using the un to force netanyahu into a tricky spot
' we are signaling that if the israeli government âs position is no longer to pursue a palestinian state , we âre going to have to broaden the spectrum of options we pursue going forward , ' a us official told politico
and jeremy ben-ami , who leads the pro-israel but left - wing group j street , told the paper that he expects the obama administration to look very closely at the possibility of either joining , or at least not blocking an internationally backed move at the un to restate the parameters for ending the [ arab - israeli ] conflict
' white house chief of staff denis mcdonough 's remarks to the group on monday at its national conference in washington , d.c. could shed further light on the administration 's position
the israeli election , and the obama administration 's reactions , come against the backdrop of us negotiations with iranian over its nuclear ambitions and netanyahu 's forceful objections that a nuke in tehran would be an existential threat to israeli
kerry , us 's top diplomat , phoned netanyahu to congratulate him on his victory , but did so from switzerland where he was meeting with his iranian counterpart
president obama called the israeli leader thursday afternoon , the white house said .
