the clintons are going back to the white house this spring â onstage , that is
' clinton , ' the brainchild of two australian brothers , makes its off - broadway debut in april with a hysterical premise and a gentle look back at the ' 90s
the play celebrates the first baby - boomer president â the one who preferred briefs to boxers , played a sax on national tv , presided over an economic boom and got himself impeached
the cast of characters includes dick morris , newt gingrich , monica lewinsky and former clinton special prosecutor starr , who sings ' a starr is born ' and ' sexual relations
' ' clinton the musical ' stars tom galantich ( left ) as the wholesome and intelligent bill clinton , duke lafoon ( right ) as the sex - crazed ' bill clinton , ' and kerry butler ( center ) as hillary rodham clinton â the only person who can see both of them yes , she 's there too : monica lewinsky ( left ) , the president 's white house - intern lover , makes appearances in ' clinton ' all is forgiven ? as hillary rodham clinton ( left ) prepares to run for president , her husband 's legendary sexual appetite could come back to haunt her ' the thing that endeared bill clinton and continues to endear him to the america public is that he was a very identifiable human being , ' said paul hodge , who wrote the music and lyrics and co-wrote the story
' he was clearly human and he had flaws like everyone
' there 's a dancing press corps in the show , and music that takes you back to celine dion , hanson and the spice girls
' it really does its job of taking down america and uplifting it at the same time , in a weird sort of way , ' said dan knechtges , the tony award - nominated director and choreographer
' two men will play the 42nd president â one a wholesome , intelligent clinton , and another a randy , rogue one ( tom galantich and duke lafoon share the task
) only hillary rodham clinton can see both
that bifurcated idea was first proposed by michael hodge , paul hodge 's older brother , a lawyer in australian , who co-wrote the story and now consults daily with his brother via skype on last - minute changes
' it seemed like a good device to sum up a very complicated man but also something that had a lot of opportunity for humor , and also something that allowed us to tell a story that everyone knows in way that they do n't know , ' said paul hodge , a ph.d. candidate in musical composition at the university of queensland
no ' bimbo eruptions ' ? it 's unclear whether bill clinton accusers gennifer flowers ( left ) , juanita broaddrick ( center ) and paula jones ( right ) made any apearances in the new off - broadway production kerry butler , the tony award - nominated star of ' xanadu , ' will play hillary rodham clinton just as the former secretary of state debates whether to run her own presidential campaign in 2016
the paul hodge brothers kept an eye on hillary rodham clinton 's career as they wrote the show , reworking her part and throwing in topical humor , like jokes about her email
' that 's part of the fun of doing something that 's set in the past where people know what 's going to happen in the future but the characters in the past do n't know what 's going to happen , ' said paul hodge , 27
' that 's an opportunity for comedy
' the show was first presented in a shortened form at the edinburgh fringe festival in 2012 , before playing the new york musical theater festival last year
it opens off - broadway at new world stages on april 9
the paul hodge brothers have been adding and shaping the show , and only two songs remain from the fringe show
characters have also been deepened
' there was not enough starr
you can never get enough starr , ' paul hodge joked
bill clinton 's tenure was highlighted by a failed health care reform plan and record budget surpluses
he faced constant scandals , capped by an affair with a white house intern that made him just the second president to be impeached
the show notes that the clinton presidency also coincided with the start of the cable boom and the 24 - hour news cycle , developments that have buffeted the leaders who follow
' i think it was a time when the distance between the public and the presidency evaporated , ' said paul hodge , whose humor is rooted in shows like ' the simpsons , ' '' 30 rock , ' '' arrested development ' and ' the unbreakable kimmy schmidt
' ' a starr is born ' : an actor portraying independent counsel starr ( left ) makes an appearance in the show , along with the president 's ' i did not have sexual relations with that woman ' moment ( right ) the idea of making a musical about the clinton presidency came about a decade ago when the paul hodge brothers saw ' paul keating ! , ' a musical about australian prime minister paul keating
they went with their dad , robert hodge , who afterward commented : ' it 's good , but i do n't think politicians make great subject matter for musicals , except maybe bill clinton
' ' we went , ' of course ! '' paul hodge said
the brothers insist they have no domestic political axe to grind , seeing as they are australian citizens
they wanted simply to see the president as a flesh - and - blood man
' i admire bill clinton , ' paul hodge said
' he 's a very complicated person , but i think we all are
my view of all of the people involved in the story is that they 're all very complicated human beings
