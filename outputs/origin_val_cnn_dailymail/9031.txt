nick clegg will pledge that his party will bring forward plans to decriminalise possession of drugs nick clegg will today press ahead with plans to decriminalise possession of all drugs â despite charities warning the move will wreck thousands of lives
the liberal democrat leader is to pledge that his party will bring forward plans to ensure those caught with drugs for â personal use â will no longer face criminal prosecution
instead , the maximum penalty would be a fine
the move covers the powerful â skunk â strain of cannabis and hard drugs such as crack cocaine and heroin , as well as â soft â drugs including marijuana and amphetamines
mr nick clegg will use a joint event with virgin boss and long - time pro-drugs campaigner sir richard branson today to claim that the move will spare thousands of young people a criminal record
but experts last night condemned the move , saying it will push thousands of youngsters into addiction and mental health problems
a poll of 100 charities by the centre for social justice found that 69 per cent of charities in the field would be concerned if the government decriminalised cannabis
more than half â 56 per cent â said cannabis use would increase if its use was decriminalised
christian guy , the think tank âs director , said : â drug addiction is ripping britain âs poorest communities apart
our network of 300 front - line charities sees this on a daily basis
many are right to be worried that liberalising cannabis laws will lead to more people taking drugs and developing harder use
â politicians need to listen to these experts
they are the people who witness the devastating impact of drugs in our poorest neighbourhoods day in , day out
â mary brett , a trustee of the charity cannabis skunk sense , said there was a â severe contradiction â between the policy and mr nick clegg âs concern for mental health
she said : â nick clegg demonstrates complete ignorance of the facts on drugs like cannabis and skunk
there is overwhelming evidence of a link between skunk and mental health problems like psychosis and schizophrenia
â if you decriminalise or legalise drugs then children will think it is okay to do , that it is safe
â mr nick clegg will use a joint event with virgin boss and long - time pro-drugs campaigner sir richard branson to claim that the move will spare thousands of young people a criminal record mr nick clegg âs intervention comes weeks after a major academic study found that use of powerful skunk cannabis trebled the risk of having a psychotic episode
under the liberal democrat proposals â which have been vetoed by david cameron in government â drug users would no longer face prosecution if caught carrying drugs deemed to be for personal use
the maximum penalty would be a fine , with no criminal record
persistent drug users would be referred for treatment or put on education programmes
a spokesman for mr nick clegg said the deputy prime minister believed drugs should be treated as a â health issue , rather than a criminal justice issue â
â nick clegg is anti-drugs , â he said
â but just throwing people into the criminal justice system is nât working â skunk use is going up
â mr nick clegg speaks during a visit to church in 2010 after revealing he is no longer an atheist he had seemed happy to be considered an atheist
but it appears nick clegg has had a change of heart â and admitted he is warming to god
the liberal democrat leader yesterday spoke of the â great joy â he experiences when attending mass with his catholic wife miriam
he told premier christian radio he was now uncomfortable being labelled as an atheist
â i now accompany miriam and the children , and do so with great joy , to mass pretty much every weekend , â he said
â i sometimes think it must be the most wonderful thing to be infused with faith
it âs not something that âs happened to me , it âs not happened to me yet
â in 2007 , mr nick clegg was asked if he believed in god and replied simply : â no. â he later said he had â enormous respect â for people of religious faith but was not an â active believer â
mr nick clegg has always said he is happy for his children to be brought up as catholics
his eldest son antonio now attends the london oratory , one of the country âs leading catholic state schools .
