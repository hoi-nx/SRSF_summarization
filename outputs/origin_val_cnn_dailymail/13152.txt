i am a friendly , hard - working ohio native
it 's how a lot of my friends in new york city describe midwest
it 's as if we 're assembled at " the flyover wonder bread factory , " devoid of color or depth
we supposedly represent all that is wholesome in america
that may be true , but " friendly and hard - working " is so ... bland
if you think i 'm being a tad harsh , ask anyone who is n't from the midwest to describe someone born and raised in america 's heartland
my favorite definition came from a colleague raised in florida
she struggled to describe us at first , then said , " simple
" um , like the amish ? " no , " she said , flustered
even my fellow midwest have a hard time coming up with interesting descriptors
cnn legal analyst danny is a proud native of north , michigan
first thing out of his mouth , " friendliness ! " after that , he struggled , too
" boy , let me see ... um.
. not easily agitated ? " i rolled my eyes
" that is so bland , danny
" he paused , then said , " i 'll take bland over the rap florida gets any day
" even my new friend , jared zak , from wisconsin struggled
the best he could come up with was " hearty
" i asked these questions after interviewing dayton , who wants his native minnesota to divorce itself from the midwest
" we 're midwest if you 're looking at it from new york city or from anywhere on [ the east ] coast , " dayton told me
" but then again , that 's someone else 's definition
i think it 's time for us to claim our own
" dayton and his brother , andrew , whose father is the state 's governor , are minneapolis businessmen whose clothing store and restaurant have a decidedly local flavor
dayton , after touring scandinavia ( many minnesotans are of norwegian descent ) , became enthralled by the region 's strong identity
it proudly embraced its chilly weather , its food , its culture , its ... northiness
so why , he questioned , did n't minnesota ? when dayton got home he hired a minnesota company to make stocking hats for his clothing boutique that said , " north
" they sold out and dayton 's idea headed , well , north
minnesotans just got it , he said
i admit , i did n't get it , until i thought more about it
minnesota -- or should i say minneapolis -- is criticized , by some of my compatriots , for being " minnesota nice , " the sort of " nice " ( fake ) that is n't remotely the kind of " nice " ( sincere ) for which midwest are renowned
but , hey , i have an open mind
you could argue that minnesota , along with north dakota , parts of illinois , indiana , wisconsin and michigan , are in the northern region of the america
and , you could argue ohio , pennsylvania and west virginia are eastern states
the only truly midwest states are illinois , missouri , iowa , kansas , nebraska and south dakota
go ahead , argue among yourselves , but know that mr. dayton is n't talking only about geography when it comes to labeling minnesota -- " the north
" he 's talking about image and , although he wo n't say it , branding
" the new york times had done an article highlighting different thanksgiving side dishes , " dayton told me
" for minnesota , they named grape salad as our signature side dish
and no one in minnesota had ever heard of grape salad ... it was kind of a harmless example , but if we do n't tell the rest of the country who we are , we end up with grape salad
" that story got under my skin , especially when i looked up the new york times idea of ohio 's signature side dish : english pea and onion salad
the new york times extolled the salad 's " deliciousness " by saying it " calls to mind the processed - food delights that , for decades , characterized the cooking of the midwest
" seriously ? the new york times is n't solely to blame for the midwest 's image problem
cayton is a distinguished professor of history at miami university in ohio
he wrote a book called " the identity of the midwest : essays on regional history
" " the midwest , " he told me , " has always been a dynamic and diverse place , but that image does n't fit with what people want to believe
" and , by people , cayton means politicians who routinely use the midwest as code for a place in time that never actually existed : crime - free and populated with hard - working people who all look and worship the same
" arguing about the midwest , " cayton says , " has become arguing about america as a whole
" so , listen up , campaigning politicians ! stop trying to bond with the midwest with your bowling prowess ( or lack thereof ) and for goodness ' sake , stop eating corn dogs at state fairs
and while i 'm at it , political reporters , please stop interviewing voters in diners ! i 'm not maligning bowling ( my dad , tony , is in the amateur bowling hall of fame ) or corn dogs , but those things do n't represent the modern midwest
it is so much more dynamic and , yes , diverse
chicago is not like detroit
st. louis is not like pittsburgh
indianapolis is not like columbus , or dayton or cleveland or cincinnati
and , minneapolis is not like any of them , either
minnesota boasts 10,000 lakes and a corresponding love of cold - weather sports , such as pond hockey
yet , i 'm from canton , ohio , and i have never touched a hockey stick ( although those other " northern " states certainly have excellent puck - handling abilities )
minneapolis also has a thriving cultural community , is home to 19 fortune 500 companies and has a cuisine all its own that is not based on processed foods
and , at the moment -- it has what many polite midwest ca n't abide by -- attitude
you know , minnesota nice
definition ? as my pal from wisconsin puts it , " sarcastic , pretentious and exclusionary
arrogant minnesota , " dayton joked
" that 's what everyone thinks of when they think of minnesota
right ? no , again , this is n't about being better
it 's not a relative thing
it 's just i think there are a lot of great things happening in minnesota
it 's not being recognized
i think it 's important for the reasons we 've discussed that there is recognition of what we have to offer
and so it 's just putting forth our story
it 's not trying to make it look better than it is
it 's not comparing ourselves to anyone else
" i do n't know if dayton will be successful , but i do understand why he wants minnesota to define minnesota
you do n't attract the best and the brightest with " friendly
" " there is a competition for talent , " dayton said
" and it 's a national competition , even an international competition
" maybe ohio should join the rebranding club and become " the east
" ' cause you know what ? i may be friendly and hard - working , but i 'm not simple
so stop asking me if i 've ever gone " cow tipping
" or i just might go all minnesota on you .
