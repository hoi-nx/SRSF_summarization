at first glance fliers and explorers globe appears to be an ordinary antique , hidden in a small over-looked office in downtown brooklyn , at the end of a nondescript hallway
on closer inspection , however , you will discover it is actually one of the world 's most fascinating relics , celebrating the giddy heights of exploration and adventure
what makes the artefact precious is not its beauty or age , but for the inclusion of the inked signatures and routes of nearly every single famous explorer and aviator in modern history , from sir edmund hillary , to neil armstong and amelia earhart
the american geographical society 's fliers and explorers globe : the signature of amelia earhart , the first female aviator to fly solo across the atlantic , is prominently featured the society acquired the 18 - inch globe in 1929 as a gift from american geographical society president finley
he invited early heroes of exploration and aviation to draw their routes and sign their names e.p. hillary was immortalised on the spherical relic , along with more recently , ann bancroft , who was the first woman to successfully finish a number of arduous expeditions to the arctic and antarctic this 18 - inch globe is hidden beneath a dark cloth in the headquarters of the american geographical society , the oldest established national geographical organisation in the united states
the valuable tradition of the globe signing started in 1929 , when the society president , and editor - in - chief of the new york times , finley would personally go down to the manhattan docks to welcome returning adventurers
explorers would ink their routes and names on the prized object , documenting their piece of history in the moment it happened
among those commemorated is amelia earhart who set records becoming the first woman to fly across the atlantic in 1928 , and was the first individual to fly over both the atlantic and pacific
tragically the aviation pioneer mysteriously disappeared in 1937 as she was trying to circumnavigate the globe from the equator , and was legally declared dead in 1939
on may 20 , 1927 , pilot charles lindbergh embarked on the world 's first solo non-stop flight from new york to paris
enduring a 33.5 - hour crossing , the 25 - year - old was victorious and received international stardom , and his route was marked onto the globe to document the achievement
sadly tragedy stuck in 1932 when his 20 - month - old son was kidnapped and tragically murdered in what was called , ' the crime of the century
' in the society 's own words , the globe is ' a priceless and unique symbol of humanity 's unquenchable drive to explore the universe
' a crowning glory of the american geographical society institution , the globe would not have always seemed as out of place
the society was created in 1851 following sir john franklin 's disappearance on his arctic mission
a group of like - minded explorers banded together to create a rescue mission , and thus , the american geographical society was born

bill anderson despite the mission being unsuccessful the american geographical society grew in popularity , with scholars , businessmen and government officials joining the ranks , at its then office , a celebrated neo-classical building in washington , to discuss latest geographic news
unlike rivals , national geographic society , who focused on photography and popular geography , the new york based society placed its efforts on sponsoring expeditions , geographic research and education
the society was the principal map resource for the united states for decades , and at its peak had a permanent staff force of over 80 , contractually making maps for the government
government revenues died down after the war , and with the american geographical society losing a lot of donations , the headquarters were sold in 1970

it is strange that the globe , arguably the most fascinating in the world , is hidden away with nobody to witness the journey of wiley post , who in 1933 was the first to fly around the world , or robert peary , the first man to the north and south pole
current executive director , john konarski iii , said : ' it sits in my office and no one sees it
i 'd like to get it into the public
' the society is facing a revival , with plans to relocate back to manhattan , to the redeveloping south street seaport neighborhood , poignantly close to where the finley would first ask explorers to leave their ink mark on history
wiley post , first pilot to fly solo around the world , inked his route on the american geographical society 's globe this unique artefact bears inked routes of their world changing adventures , but is rarely seen by anyone the 18 - inch globe sits proudly in the office , holding a small slice of history of the world 's most celebrated explorers
