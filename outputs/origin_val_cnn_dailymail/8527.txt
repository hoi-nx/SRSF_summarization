thailand officials are set to release a two - minute animated video in chinese to discourage tourists from taking their clothes off in inappropriate places when on holiday
the move follows a public outcry after an image of a woman going topless in the common area of the toilets at at don mueang international airport in bangkok while getting changed went viral
although the nation has a reputation for vibrant red light areas , public nudity is strictly forbidden in thailand and even taking one 's clothes off in the relative privacy of the ladies is apparently considered by locals to be offensive
the image that caused a public outcry of a woman changing in the toilets at a bangkok airport the woman in the picture is said to have been chinese , although this can not be verified , and while the incident raises barely an eyebrow with many - when shared on english speaking sites the woman who took the photo was vilified more than the woman changing - the thailand government felt moved to act
another woman in the toilets took the above image and posted it to the facebook page of csi la with the comment : ' chinese tourists are terrible ! i saw a group of chinese tourists stripping in the ladies ' room
some were topless , some bottomless
so disgraceful ! ' the image , which has since been shared widely on social media platforms , shows only one woman and her reflection in the mirror - it has since been removed from the site
a spokesperson for don mueang airport confirmed the incident took place there but was keen to not blow the incident out of proportion
a spokesperson for don mueang international airport in bangkok confirmed the incident happened there ' in general , chinese tourists in thailand are well - behaved and have brought substantial revenue to the country
if we see something inappropriate , we 'll issue a warning or impose a penalty on a case - by - case basis , ' the airport stated
the ministry of tourism and sports is going a step further with a video telling tourists how to behave in their country , and instructing them to keep their clothes on , set to appease public outrage
the video will be posted on travel blogs and tourism websites as soon as this week in a move they hope will go some way to ending some thailand locals ' animosity towards chinese visitors
anek , head of the ttaa ( ttaa ) , asked thailand people not to share the photo any further due to the risk of offending the chinese
a public beach in thailand , where nudity on beaches is considered offensive to locals ' the chinese government has made a campaign telling its citizens how to behave when travelling abroad
the campaign might reach only the big cities
' as the host , we should just nicely warn them
we should not berate them by sharing the photo , ' mr anek said public nudity in thailand is illegal and it 's considered disrespectful to locals - mostly buddhist or islamic - to go topless in public
however , there are a number of naturist resorts in the country such as chan resort in pattaya where guests must agree to abide by international naturist rules of etiquette .
