cornell said in the interview that both he and isis members worked together on the terror plot , which involved planting pipe bombs and going on a public shooting rampage
reporter macke asked cornell in the interview ' was it their idea for you to plant pipe bombs at the capitol and have people running outside to shoot them ? ' ' it was mix of both of our ideas , ' cornell answered
' cornell , who repeatedly identified himself as muslim , said he wanted to carry out the attack because of ' the continued u.s. aggression against our people and the fact that u.s. , specifically president obama , wants to wage war against islamic state
