twenty uberx taxi drivers are facing prosecution for using their own cars to pick - up regular passengers
the drivers are facing fines of up to $ 110,000 each per offence for breaching the passenger transport act
despite being served with 77 court attendance notices , the popular app service , which is used by thousands of australian , has told drivers who are fined that it will cover their penalties
' we do n't believe anyone should be penalised for providing safe , reliable rides in their cities and , as always , we stand by our partners fully , ' an uber spokeswoman told fairfax media on monday
the app - based car service recently called on the nsw government to implement the ' illegal ' ride - sharing platform in a bid to make it a permanent transportation option
it pledged to create thousands of jobs for drivers , and customers who use their ride - sharing service
. the submission by the company to the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal review said it 's services provide a ' safe , reliable and affordable choices for consumers ' as well as offering job opportunities to areas of high unemployment rates in sydney
the drivers are facing fines of up to $ 110,000 each per offence for breaching the passenger transport act ' when comparing the areas uber partners live and the unemployment rate in certain regions , it is clear they come from those areas where unemployment and under - employment are high , ' the company said
' uber is helping to provide flexible economic opportunities for people who have previously not had access
' in new south wales uber does not accept any partner that has any australian criminal history recorded with crimtrac or who has had their license suspended or has any record of a drink or drug driving record in nsw
' but a transport for nsw spokesperson told daily mail australia that it is illegal for drivers in nsw to participate in ' ride - sharing ' activities like uberx
' while uber pty ltd does not breach the passenger transport act 1990 by offering the service , drivers transporting passengers for a fare do , ' the transport for nsw spokesperson said
nsw law states that the taxi service is required to be run through a licensed operator , meaning it is prohibited for the drivers to use their personal cars for the service ' any driver operating in these circumstances are potentially committing a number of offences , including driving without authority and offering a service without accreditation
a submission , which was made in january , said nsw transport minister berejiklian had refused to meet with representatives of uber

uber 's director of public policy oceania brad kitschke wrote in the submission that ' 100 percent of partner drivers who passed uber 's background checks were subsequently able to obtain government authority from the roads and maritime service ' .
