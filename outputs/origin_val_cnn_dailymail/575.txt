from elaborate hats to colourful coats and skyscraper heels , this week 's cheltenham festival has proved as memorable for its fashion as it has for the drama unfolding on the course
but today , racing fans were left shivering in their flimsy frocks as the heavens opened and gave everyone a soaking
luckily , most had come prepared with umbrellas , turning the racecourse into a sea of bright colour as the brollies were unfurled
beneath them were racegoers dressed in an array of colourful ensembles , with some braving the downpour in bare legs and spike heels while trying desperately to keep their elaborate titfers dry
more still , perhaps with an eye to the weather rather than fashion , shucked off their finery and replaced it with waterproof cagoules
despite the downpours , most of the men and women arriving for the final day of racing action managed to look cheerful - perhaps with the prospect of seeing veteran jockey ap mccoy compete in the final gold cup of his career in mind
ap mccoy , who has won the prestigious trophy no fewer than five times during his 20 - year career , will compete for the final time aboard the hotly - tipped irish bay gelding , carlingford lough
' it 's impossible to not back ap mccoy 's last ever ride in the gold cup , ' comments ladbroke 's jessica bridge
' it would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20 - time champion jockey

' also on hand to see ap mccoy compete in his final gold cup was zara tindall who arrived looking glamorous in a brown wool coat by irish designer costelloe and sporting a chic cocktail hat decorated with traditional pheasant feathers
zara tindall 's appearance made it a full four out of four for the queen 's granddaughter , who made her first visit to the racecourse on tuesday where she saw her and husband mike 's horse monbeg dude fail to deliver and take a lowly 14th place in his race
she reappeared for a second time on ladies ' day and opted for another costelloe ensemble , this time a black and grey checked coat and a detailed black cocktail hat
for the second day in a row , she spent most of her time watching the action unfold from the grandstand and chose not to join her aunt , the duchess of cornwall , in her private box
