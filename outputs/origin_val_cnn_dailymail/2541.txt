motorists face a new speed camera blitz and Â£ 100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of uk âs busiest roads motorists face a new speed camera blitz and Â£ 100 fines as 20mph limits are imposed on some of uk âs busiest roads
until now , lower speed limits have been restricted to smaller roads in residential areas or near schools
but in a major policy shift , 20mph limits are to be introduced on major arterial roads â and policed by the latest digital speed cameras
campaigners say it is the start of a radical new nationwide attempt to slow traffic down
london mayor boris johnson yesterday revealed that eight pilot schemes will be run on â red routes â â the main arterial roads that carry a third of the capital âs traffic
bristol , manchester , birmingham , edinburgh and many other towns and cities say they also intend to introduce the new limits
motorists caught breaking the 20mph limit face a minimum Â£ 100 fine and three points on their driving licence
the aa says the new limits are being driven more by â dogma â than road safety
a spokesman said : â these 20mph zones are popping up like spring daffodils
â there is a lot of fear among drivers that , with 20mph being a relatively unfamiliar speed , widespread speed camera use will make them look more at their speedometers than at what is happening on populated streets in front of them
â if the 18 - month trials in london are judged a success , the 20mph limits will be made permanent and imposed on 30 miles of key â red routes â considered by transport bosses to be â more local road than motorway â
some 175 miles of residential streets , about a quarter of the capital âs roads , already have 20mph limits
the trend is spreading across uk
following a pilot scheme , bristol has spent more than Â£ 2.3million installing 20mph signs
manchester is consulting on half the city being similarly covered , and 6,000 edinburgh residents have signed a petition against a Â£ 2.2million scheme to make up to 80 per cent of the scottish capital a 20mph zone
alec james , of sustrans â a charity campaigning for healthier and cheaper transport â said of the london announcement : â this is a significant step up â and the next step on the road for more 20mph limits
mayor of london boris johnson , pictured , wants to introduce new 20mph speed limits across the city upper street in islington , pictured , is also going to be hit by a 20mph limit as part of the 18 - month trial â it âs pioneering
for the first time 20mph limits are being imposed on main arterial roads â not just quiet residential roads where there is little traffic
we expect other cities to follow london âs lead
â but the aa says while 20mph limits have their place , they should not be introduced where they will increase traffic jams and pollution â and where residents want them , not imposed in a â blanket â fashion
a blanket rollout of 20mph zones in towns and cities will result in millions of pounds in fines pouring into treasury coffers , the aa warned last night
motorists caught on speed cameras going over 20mph will be fined a minimum of Â£ 100 , and get three points on their licence
the money goes to the treasury
until 2007 , safety camera partnerships kept all the cash they raised from fines , often using it to buy more cameras to generate more money
this led to motorists complaining that the cameras were being used as â cash cow â revenue - raisers
to defuse the controversy , the system was scrapped and all fines are paid directly to the treasury , which in turn returns the cash as a general road safety grant to pay for cameras and â other measures â
the aa says it does not oppose 20mph limits where appropriate and where they are supported by residents , but it fears many councils and campaign groups are being driven by â an inherent or institutional prejudice against the motor car â
a spokesman said : â the blanket rollout of so many 20mph limits and zones is going to push lots of money into treasury coffers and give them a cash windfall
worried drivers may feel well and truly fleeced if they are caught on camera and fined for being marginally over the speed limit
â other councils which have implemented or are committed to adopting new 20mph limits include portsmouth , oxford , bristol , newcastle , warrington , sheffield , york , middlesbrough , edinburgh , liverpool , brighton & hove , leicester , cambridge , coventry , bath & north east somerset , darlington , wigan , rochdale , shipley , bury , bolton , nottingham , calderdale , together with numerous london boroughs
under the new london scheme , the first road to convert to 20mph next month will be commercial street in shoreditch , linking into plans for tower hamlets and hackney to become 20mph boroughs
transport for london said : â safety cameras across london are being upgraded to new digital cameras which will have the capability to help police enforce 20mph speed limits â , adding that it hoped the new limits will reduce the number of pedestrians , cyclists and motorcyclists killed or seriously injured by 40 per cent by 2020
rod king , founder of the â 20 âs plenty for us â campaign group , said : â the current 30mph national limit is being rejected as â unfit for purpose â for communities so we âre setting out a series of government actions required for a planned transition to a uk default urban limit of 20mph by 2020
â a department for transport spokesman said : â research shows 20mph zones can save lives and this government has made it easier for councils to introduce them
â it is for local authorities to set speed limits and for the police to decide how best to enforce them
â the spokesman added : â we are undertaking a three - year research project to better understand the effect of 20mph zones and their impact on local communities
