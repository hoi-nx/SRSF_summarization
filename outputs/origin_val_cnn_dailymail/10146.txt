a man rushed to hospital for a kidney transplant has spoken of the dilemma he faced after learning the donor organ could be infected with hiv
gartside had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney and pancreas had become available
the transplant window was so small that after putting the phone down at 3am , he was rushed from his home in plymouth to oxford for the operation
but upon arriving , he was told that the organs had come from the victim of a drugs overdose - and it would be two weeks before tests revealed if they were hiv free
gartside , 40 , had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney had become available
but he faced a dilemma after learning the donor organ could be infected with hiv mr gartside , 40 , was born with type 1 diabetes , and his kidneys began to fail by the time he was 32
he said : ' they showed me into a room and told me the donor organs had come from a death by drug overdose and asked if i still wanted to go ahead
' because the person died by drug overdose , they would n't know whether the donor had hiv for two weeks
' it was a scary process having to say yes or no after sitting in the back of an ambulance for hours
' i thought : " do i risk it and say yes , or do i say no and wait another 18 months , or even longer ? " ' in the end , i went ahead with it
' the kidney transplant surgery took 10 hours and left mr gartside with 32 staples in his stomach
after the surgery , he was sick for days , unable to even stand up straight , and was concerned about the risk of hiv
two weeks later the hiv results came back - and were , to his relief , negative
he has since made a full recovery
mr gartside said : ' my diabetes has completely changed - it 's amazing - and even that does n't describe how good i feel
' it 's a second chance and i will be forever grateful to the donor 's parents for making that decision
' two weeks after the kidney transplant , the hiv results came back - and were negative he has now set up a support group for transplant patients - the mayflower support group - which supports patients going through the transplant procedure
he explained : ' doctors have the clinical experience and can tell you what 's going to happen during surgery , but they do n't have a realistic explanation of what is going to happen for the patient
' it 's good to have someone to talk to who has been through what they 're about to go through
' the transplant has made me feel like i really want to give something back
' last year , two patients in wales died after being given kidney transplants infected with a parasitic worm
hughes , 42 , and stuart , 67 , were each given a kidney from a transplant donor who was carrying the deadly worm in his organs when he died
doctors were not aware the donor had the worm - known as halicephalobus , which lives in soil and is found in horses - when the transplant operations were carried out at the university hospital of wales in cardiff
mr stuart and mr hughes began to ' deteriorate rapidly ' after their surgery and died less than three weeks later
the two men are part of only five cases ever recorded across the world - and all have died from the worm infection
mr stuart , of cardiff , and mr hughes , of bridgend , had kidney transplants in november 2013 but both died before christmas
a post-mortem examination revealed they both died from infection called meningeoencephaltis which was caused by the parasitic worm .
