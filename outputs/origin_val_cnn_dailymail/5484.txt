a ' sadistic ' double murderer has been granted clemency by the indonesian president widodo , while two of the bali nine ringleaders remain on death row
just weeks after chan and sukumaran were denied clemency , dwi trisna firmansyah had his death sentence reduced to life
the 27 - year - old was one of three killers involved in the brutal premeditated murder of a shop owner and his school - aged son in april 2012,news corp reported

the trio broke into the man 's shop and hit him over the head with a wooden bat while he was taking part in his morning pair
when the man 's son tried to come to his father 's aid he was also killed
the pair may be waiting months for their execution as other prisoners pursue lengthy appeals after the murders the group stole the shop owner 's car , along with a number of mobile phones and phone credit
their appeal to the supreme court earlier this year failed , but firmansyah was then shown mercy amid the indonesian president 's tirade against convicted drug smugglers
this comes after it was revealed chan and sukumaran could have their executions delayed for months as other death row inmates take on lengthy court appeals
it has been revealed by the indonesian attorney - general prasetyo that the execution of the bali nine duo will take place at the same time as several other foreigners on death row
this could delay the pair 's execution as all avenues of legal appeal for the other eight convicted drug offenders must be exhausted before their death sentence can be carried out
the indonesian governor - general has said the death row inmates will be executed ' simultaneously ' sukumaran , left , and chan , right , will be put through an ' assimilation ' process as they prepare to face the firing squad this means chan and sukumaran may have months to wait before they face the firing squad
mr prasetyo also claims the death row inmates will be put through an ' assimilation ' process which he believes will help them mentally prepare for their death
' they will be accompanied by religious figures until they 're truly ready , ' he said
the two men are currently being held in isolation cells where they are able talk to each other
their interaction with other inmates is limited to one nigerian who is also on death row

although the appeals process may be lengthy there have been no orders to transfer mr sukumaran and mr chan from the prison referred to as ' death island ' president widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores the pair 's lawyers will return to jakarta court on thursday to challenge president widodo 's decision to deny clemency to all drug offenders
their last appeal was adjourned until march 20 as the president 's representative did not have the required legal documentation
two weeks earlier , the administrative court dismissed their argument that president widodo failed to consider their rehabilitation
the claim was rejected on the grounds that the court had no authority to overturn presidential decree
the australian government , alongside several notable public figures , have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of mr chan and mr sukumaran
foreign minister bishop has written to the indonesian government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions

i have conveyed to the organisers about that and they promised that none of sukumaran 's paintings will be at the exhibition , ' sydjonggo said
' it does n't mean that we are forgetting myuran
no. but we just do n't want to be involved in the discourse about the execution which is now already politicised , ' he added
the money raised by auctioning off the prisoners artwork was to be used to continue funding the art program at the kerobokan prison as well as building a gallery intended to showcase the works of ex-prisoners who were mentored by mr sukumaran
mr sukumaran has been unable to paint since his transfer to ' death island ' however prison authorities say mr sukumaran will eventually be allowed to have his art materials
