rochdale mp simon danczuk welcomed news of the charges
he said : ' i welcome today 's news that more alleged perpetrators of child abuse are being brought to justice
i have spoken to the director of children 's services at rochdale council earlier today and have been fully briefed on the developments
' he added : ' i have been critical of child protection agencies , and especially greater manchester police , in the past regarding their handling of these cases
but credit where credit is due , these arrests demonstrate the progress that has been made
' we have seen in recent months that rochdale is far from the only town in the country to have experienced this type of abuse
the difference in rochdale is that we now have much better systems in place for protecting children and all agencies are working together to catch the perpetrators
' finally , it should be recognised that these arrests could not have happened without the incredibly brave actions of survivors of abuse
i know from personal experience just how difficult it is for survivors to speak out about their abuse
so i want to pay tribute to the young women who have suffered this abuse and have worked with police
' the crown prosecution service said the majority of alleged offences took place when the complainants were under 16
nazir afzal , chief crown prosecutor , said : ' these defendants now stand charged with serious criminal offences and have the right to a fair trial
