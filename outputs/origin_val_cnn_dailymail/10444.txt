rooney celebrated a goal with a boxing routine as the england captain made light of being knocked out in his own kitchen by a former team mate rooney falls backwards to the old trafford turf , mocking pictures reportedly showing him being knocked out in his kitchen , as ashley young laughs in the background pictures emerged last night showing the striker wearing boxing gloves as he and bardsley - a former manchester utd player - went up against each other in a bout
during the jovial night - in last month at his cheshire mansion , rooney found himself on the receiving end of a heavy punch
the england player was said to have been visibly shaken by the blow during the incident and footage appeared to show him falling backwards after being struck
although the england forward could face a grilling from manchester utd chiefs , who are said to pay the striker Â£ 300,000 per week , rooney seemed to be treating the incident as nothing more than a bit of light - hearted fun
after scoring the third goal in yesterday 's match in manchester , rooney ran to the crowd before pumping his fists
he then closed his eyes before falling backwards to the old trafford turf
after scoring the third goal in the reds ' match against tottenham hotspur yesterday afternoon , rooney threw fake punches before falling to the ground even referee mark clattenburg appeared to see the funny side of the manchester utd and england striker 's celebration speaking of the kitchen playfight , a source told sun : ' rooney had everybody worried when he hit the floor like that
he made such a thud when he went down and he was just on his back with his eyes closed , not moving
rooney was playfighting with bardsley , who plays for stoke city ' people were scared he had really banged his head and done some lasting damage
everybody realised it was a stupid thing to do , but they just got carried away
' the incident is said to have come the day after manchester utd suffered defeat at swansea , while his wife coleen and their children kai and klay were on holiday in barbados
the clip is said to last around a minute and shows pair trading blows and friends laugh and joke
according to the sun , the pair 's bout intensifies before bardsley delivers the knockout punch , which leaves rooney lying flat out on the kitchen floor
the incident could leave rooney with some uncomfortable questions to answer from manchester utd manager van gaal
mr van gaal is unlikely to be impressed with the 29 - year - old for partaking in such dangerous activities prior to matches and training
this is due to most footballers having clauses in their contracts banning them from taking part in certain activities to prevent the risk of them being injured
bardsley is a former team - mate of rooney 's with the pair having played together at manchester utd before the scotland international left and signed for sunderland in 2008
he moved to stoke city last year and his wife tanya has also recently found fame , starring in itv reality show the real housewives of cheshire

speaking seven years ago , rooney said his boxing training as a youngster helped his football career

it made it easier to play than it might have been and it 's helped me with the way my game is now
' all through my life - from the ages of six , seven and eight - when big fights were on television , i used to stay up with my dad to watch them
' i 've always loved watching boxing and i went boxing training for about three or four years when i was younger
it 's a sport i 've always been involved in
' i was doing both boxing and football training at one stage when i was about 15
but everton , who i was with at the time , said i had to concentrate on one of them - and i opted for football
