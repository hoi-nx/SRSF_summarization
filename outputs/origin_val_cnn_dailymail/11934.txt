embattled whole pantry founder gibson has expressed concern over her family 's safety in her first comments to media since she admitted her terminal cancer may have been ' misdiagnosed '
in an interview with daily mail australia , ms gibson claimed her son 's childcare details , her home address and floor plan had been posted online amidst the fierce backlash against her
she said that was the reason ' police came to our home checking in on my safety ' last week
ms gibson also hit out at some of her critics , saying that while she understood ' everyone 's anger and confusion ' , some people had responded ' maliciously '
gibson : doubt has been cast on the whole pantry founder 's stories as people demand answers from the health guru doting young mum : ms gibson has expressed concern about her family 's safety after her son 's childcare details were allegedly placed online ms gibson 's remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business , with local publisher penguin books and a u.s. publishing house dumping ms gibson 's whole pantry recipe book
the whole pantry , a popular app , gained media attention because of ms gibson 's remarkable story about cancer survival ' our address being posted online to a website ... is not ok , ' she said , providing daily mail australia with screenshots of her address posted on whole pantry facebook
the instagram star did not address questions concerning her cancer diagnosis , saying she would ' have a statement live this week ' where she would address medical questions
' our address being posted online to a website ... is not ok , ' she said , providing daily mail australia with screenshots of her address posted on whole pantry facebook
' i do think it 's important for myself and the company to recognise everyone 's anger and confusion surrounding this last week , though this does n't justify how others have perpetuated this or responded so maliciously
' she has not provided evidence of her childcare or floor plan claims at time of publication
her remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business , with local publisher penguin books and a u.s. publishing house dumping ms gibson 's whole pantry recipe book
the book had been written in conjunction with her hugely successful app of the same name , which is set to feature on the apple
the app gained popularity after ms gibson claimed she warded off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis through diet and a holistic approach to life
but after close friends last week cast doubt on these claims , ms gibson herself admitted in an interview with the australia that an announcement last year that her cancer had spread to her liver , spleen , blood and uterus was a ' misdiagnosis '
ms gibson explained why she today wiped all her remaining photos from her instagram account - some had already been removed - and had the whole pantry facebook page deleted
' at the end of the day , i am a human being on the receiving end of comments , questions and emails and even if the public are used to a digital interaction with me , it does not warrant some of the recent responses , ' she said
the whole pantry was voted apple âs best food and drink app of 2013 and will feature on the apple
the technology giant did not respond to daily mail australia 's requests for comment on tuesday she said the social media accounts were ' further encouraging interactions between those who were angry and encouraging personal data , information or other security - sensitive content to be shared or made light of
' my son 's childcare details were posted online in the midst of this , so i 'm sure you can understand how unnecessary , concerning and threatening that is
' ms gibson said the statement she was writing was taking ' longer than anticipated ' because of media requests and ' constantly arising issues ' , ' with the paramount focus being protecting the safety of myself and my son '
victoria police told daily mail australia they visited an elwood home last tuesday evening ' as part of a welfare check
they left shortly after with nil concerns
' some of ms gibson 's former followers have taken to social media to try to ' expose ' her - posting images of her drinking alcohol before she became a clean - living star and old claims about her battle with cancer
the gibson uncovered whole pantry facebook page has been sharing images of her sipping beer clean - living gibson , seen here with a pint in her hand , told the friends who have spoken out about her to ' make yourself invisible to me , and my life ' the administrators of the belle gibson uncovered whole pantry facebook page , which has been sharing images of her sipping beer and champagne and eating vegan doughnuts , said they are doing so because ms gibson ' fiercely censors the whole pantry facebook page '
' the reason is simple , to educate and inform the many people who have already commented on this page feeling betrayed , deceived and let down by someone who they trusted , ' they wrote
' many people followed this person , they believed in her and some even abandoned conventional medicine in favour of embracing her lifestyle in desperate hope they could cure their illnesses
on monday afternoon , australia publisher penguin books said it had been left with ' no other option ' but to stop supplying her book in australia
' despite our best endeavours , penguin books has not received sufficient explanation from ms gibson , author of the whole pantry recipe book , in response to recent allegations , ' the comapny said in a statement
' we remain hopeful that we will receive the formal assurances we have requested in the coming days
ms gibson has deleted thousands of photos and social media posts which directly reference her multiple cancer diagnoses , but an example of them - seen by daily mail australia - can be found below : back in july 2013 , ms gibson posted on the whole pantry facebook page : ' it 's unfortunate that there is someone on my instagram trying to discredit the natural healing path i am on
' she went on to say : ' as always , with everything , this is my journey and i encourage you to do what is best for your body and situation with love and an open mind
' i have been healing a severe and malignant brain cancer for the past few years with natural medicine , gerson therapy and foods
' it âs working for me and i am grateful to be here sharing this journey with over 70,000 people worldwide
thank you for being here - xx belle
' in a reference to her liver cancer , she posted on instagram under her account @ healing_belle , a photo of a pink smoothie enriched with ' extra support '
' this one is for my rash ( thanks , liver cancer ) , inflammation ( thanks flying ) and for general immunity
' in another instagram post she wrote : ' going from 6 weeks to live , to celebrating my fourth year with brain cancer , i know now that respecting your own journey and intuitively healing , listening and living as your body , mind and path intended is staple
' in july 2014 , she broke the news of further illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal instagram page
it read in part : ' with frustration and ache in my heart / / my beautiful , gamechanging community , it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that i 've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer
' one is secondary and the other is primary
i have cancer in my blood , spleen , brain , uterus , and liver
i am hurting , ' ms gibson wrote
about 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up , revealing she was undergoing ' german integrative oncology protocol '
the whole pantry ( pictured above , in cookbook form ) is also a popular app , which costs $ 3.79 to download
the app is slated to appear on the new apple watch
