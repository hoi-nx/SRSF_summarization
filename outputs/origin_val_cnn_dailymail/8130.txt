a design flaw has left a fighter jet that 's part of the pentagon 's most expensive project ever incapable of carrying highly advanced bombs
the f-35b 's internal weapons bay is too small for a sdb ii ( sdb ii ) load , according to an inside defense report
though it 's mandated that an f-35b jet , designed by lockheed martin , hold eight sdb iis in the bay , only four reportedly fit
the f - 35 program will reportedly cost a whopping $ 590 billion over the next decade
trouble in the skies : the f-35b 's internal weapons bay is too small for a sdb ii ( sdb ii ) load ( file photo ) the f-35b is one of three variants of the f-35 program , which has proved expensive and troublesome to get off the ground
the f-35b features a lift fan that will allow it to make short takeoffs and vertical landings , inside defense reported
in the us , it will be used by the united states marines corps
however , the f-35b is the centerpiece of the british royal navy 's new aircraft carrier - based fleet
the ministry of defense has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned british aircraft carriers - the hms queen elizabeth and the hms prince of wales
the f - 35 program has been plagued by massive cost overruns and delays
joe dellavedova , a spokesman for the f-35 program , said in an inside defense interview last week that changes are being made to the f-35b jet so it can be released on schedule
dellavedova also said that lockheed martin will likely get the alterations contract down the line in 2015
' this is not a new issue to us , ' dellavedova told inside defense
' we 've been working with the sdb ii program office and their contractors since 2007
' the fit issues have been known and documented and there were larger and more substantial modifications needed to support sdb ii that have already been incorporated into production f - 35 aircraft
' these minor or remaining changes were put on hold until the aircraft reached a sufficient level of maturity to ensure that the needed changes would not adversely impact any ongoing sdb ii [ ii ] developments
' inside inside defense reported that the jsf ( jsf ) program office so far has not publicly recognized problems - and that eight internal and 16 external sdb iis are in fact meant to go on the f-35b
bombs away : the sdb ii can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared , laser , and radar homing - to hit targets , defense contractor raytheon says defense contractor raytheon is behind the sdb ii bomb
the company proclaims on its website ' sdb ii can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets , reducing aircrews ' time in harm 's way
the weapon 's small size allows fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as previous , larger weapons that required multiple jets
sdb ii 's size has broader implications for the warfighter and taxpayers , as it means fewer attacks with less time spent flying dangerous missions
' the sdb ii can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared , laser , and radar homing - to hit targets , the company says
the sdb ii weapons system is fully accommodated by both the jsf - the united states air force version - and f-35c - the us navy version , company executive white told inside defense
white told the news outlet ' i think it 's just the b. when we did our fit checks on the jsf , the a and the c basically had the same bay
' 353 f - 35bs are being bought by the united states marines corps , inside defense reported
according to the news outlet , approximately 17,000 weapons will come from the united states air force 's sdb ii program .
