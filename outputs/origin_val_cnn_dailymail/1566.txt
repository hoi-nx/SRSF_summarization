hoyle , 48 , is on trial accused of killing a former royal marine who died when an alleged stunt in a vintage tiger moth aircraft went wrong a former royal marine pilot killed his passenger after crashing his aircraft while performing a ' foolish and dangerous ' loop - the - loop at a low height , a court has heard
hoyle , 48 , allegedly carried out the acrobatic manoeuvre in his tiger moth plane , despite passenger rogers being too big for the move to be carried out safely
the court heard how hoyle , described in court as a novice , was ' reckless ' for attempting to perform the stunt at a height ' at which recovery was improbable '
hoyle 's ' risk - taking ' allegedly caused the plane to nose - dive into a field near witchampton , dorset , killing mr rogers
the 26 - year - old was a former royal marine who served in afghanistan and northern ireland
hoyle , from broadstone , dorset , also suffered serious injuries during the crash , from which he has since recovered
he denies manslaughter and endangering the safety of an aircraft
opening the case at winchester crown court , michael bowes qc , prosecuting , said : ' the prosecution case is that the fatal crash was caused as a result of conscious risk - taking by hoyle , in that he flew the aircraft in a way which created an obvious risk of serious injury to rogers , and hoyle either chose to disregard it or was indifferent to it
' the prosecution submits that what he was intending to do was plainly dangerous and created an obvious risk of serious harm
' mr bowes told the jury of six men and six woman that , at 18st 7lbs and 6ft 2in , mr rogers ' size placed restrictions on how the aircraft should be manoeuvred , something hoyle should have known and made the flight unsafe
he said hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft , making him a ' novice ' in it , and that he was not trained to perform the loop - de - loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting
the jury was told the flight was the second hoyle had flown from the compton abbas airfield in dorset that day , having taken another friend up in his plane earlier
mr bowes said he had successfully completed several loops with the other passenger and that gps tracking suggested he crashed near where these previous acrobatics had taken place
' the location of the fatal manoeuvre and the improbability of hoyle 's own account of the loss of control , and evidence from eye witnesses on the ground , all point to the fact that this was indeed an attempted loop , ' said mr bowes
the plane crashed into a field near witchampton , killing mr rogers
the 26 - year - old was a former royal marine who served in afghanistan and northern ireland and ran a maritime security company hoyle had flown 35 hours in the aircraft , making him a ' novice ' in it
he was not trained to perform the loop - de - loop manoeuvre he was alleged to have been attempting , the court heard the court heard how the pair took off from the airfield at about 2.49pm , with the weather described as ' a pleasant spring day '
the fatal crash happened a short time later , at 3.08pm
hoyle , who had a private pilot 's licence , had flown 184.8 hours at the time of the crash , but only 35 hours in the tiger moth , making him ' inexperienced ' in it
mr bowes described to the jury how eye - witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash
the plane , built in 1940 , then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first
mr rogers was sat in the front seat of the plane , with hoyle behind him ' the prosecution say eye - witnesses saw the aircraft entering a loop , ' said mr bowes
' that point is absolutely disputed by the defence , who say it never happened
thereafter the aircraft entered a spin from which it did not recover
' eye - witnesses on the ground saw the aircraft attempt a loop manoeuvre just before the crash
the plane , built in 1940 , then entered a spin and smashed into the ground nose first , the court was told mr bowes said hoyle had ' no formal training in aerobatics
' he also told the jury the plane was flying too low to attempt a loop manoeuvre
when interviewed , hoyle claimed he lost control of the aircraft due to ' a control restriction
' he said that following a left - hand turn , the rudder remained to the left
hoyle told investigators who launched a probe into the flight that he pulled back on the stick in an attempt to regain control of the aircraft , which may have made it appear as though he was performing a loop
during his interview , hoyle said he understood an aircraft needed to be at 3,000ft to 3,500ft to recover from a spin
however , mr bowes said the plane had been much lower than that when he performed loops earlier with his previous passenger , nicholas diamond
' the prosecution case is that it was an attempted loop and it was far too low because when the plan got out of the loop it was too low to do anything about it , ' said mr bowes
after the crash , horrified bystanders dialled 999 and paramedics and fire crews rushed to the scene to help
emergency teams spent around an hour cutting away the fuselage at the front of the plane so they could free mr rogers
mr rogers , who was in ' a very bad way ' , was flown to dorchester hospital on a coastguard helicopter
hoyle was also taken to dorchester hospital for treatment to his injuries
mr rogers was pronounced dead later that day
a post mortem examination showed he died as a result of multiple injuries
the court heard from an expert , who told the court it was ' reckless ' of hoyle to attempt a loop manoeuvre at the height he was flying
although gps data of the final seconds of the flight was lost , it did show he was flying 1,423ft above the ground moments earlier , thousands of feet lower than he should have been before starting a loop
hoyle had previously ' dangerously ' performed loop manoeuvres far below the height a novice should have been doing them
emergency teams spent around an hour cutting away the fuselage at the front of the plane so they could free mr rogers
he died later that day at dorchester hospital the jury has been told inexperienced pilots , such as hoyle , should be no lower than 3,000ft after completing a loop - the - loop
mr bowes said gps data showed that on a flight on february 12 , 2011 , the former royal marine dropped to 393ft above the ground when apparently performing a loop
aviation expert connolly told the court that the heights at which he was performing the acrobatic stunts were described as unsafe and ' plainly not simply foolish , but dangerous '
reading his expert report , mr bowes said mr connolly believed it was only ' a matter of luck ' that hoyle had previously performed loops successfully
mr connolly said it was ' beyond belief ' that hoyle was unaware of the guidance on the height at which aerobatic manoeuvres should be performed
he said : ' to attempt a loop at such a low height with his limited level of experience was quite simply reckless in my opinion
' mr connolly believed hoyle 's explanation that the spin had been sparked by a jammed rudder was ' not credible '
the expert concluded that what hoyle was doing before the crash was a ' deliberately attempted loop '
mr bowes said : ' he was clearly aware of the recommended height limitations for aerobatic manoeuvres and yet chose to disregard them , possibly encouraged by previous experience , having done it at that very low height
' mr connolly 's view is that ... what he was attempting to do was plainly dangerous and created a serious risk of harm to his passenger , rogers
' on previous occasions tracked by the gps , hoyle was also flying lower than he should have been even when not performing manoeuvres , the jury was told
according to the gps data , hoyle performed loop-the-loop manoeuvres in his three previous flights before the fatal crash - twice on february 12 and once earlier that day
in each case , the aerobatics were performed above the manswood area , near where the deadly crash occurred , the court heard
on the day of the crash , the data showed that in the first flight hoyle was flying at 1,000ft before dropping to 409ft , apparently after doing a loop
mr bowes said the data proved hoyle was going back to the area where he had previously performed loops , even if it did not show he was doing one before the crash
' this occurred in the same location that the aircraft carried out other aerobatic manoeuvres on all three of the previous flights , ' said mr bowes
' he was going back to manswood to do what he did at manswood , which was loop de loop
' the jury was shown photographs of the wreckage surrounded by emergency crews
an investigation into the fatal crash was carried out by the air accidents investigation branch
the court heard that the investigation had found no sign of malfunction with the plane 's rudder
mr bowes described how the tiger moth was a training plane used by the raf until 1952 and 4,000 were built in the second world war with many still in use as recreational aircraft around the world such as the one involved in the accident which was built in 1940
