a georgia police chief who said he accidentally shot and seriously injured his wife while the couple were sleeping in bed has resigned , the peachtree city police department said wednesday
william mccollom stepped down as chief of police in peachtree city nearly a week after a prosecutor announced that although the new year 's day shooting appeared accidental , william mccollom could eventually face a misdemeanor charge accusing him of recklessly taking a gun to bed after drinking alcohol and taking sleeping medication
the shooting in peachtree city , an upscale community of 35,000 people south of atlanta , left margaret mccollom paralyzed below the waist
" i have had had two families in peachtree city -- my police family and my personal family
in light of the recent tragedy in my personal family , i need to continue to focus my time and efforts there , " william mccollom said in a message posted wednesday on the police department 's facebook page
medics and police rushed to the mccolloms ' home early on january 1 after the chief called 911 to say he accidentally shot his wife as both were sleeping -- by inadvertently moving a gun that he had taken to bed with him
" the gun was in the bed , i went to move it , put it to the side , and it went off , " william mccollom says in a recording of the 911 call
later in the call , the operator asked william mccollom , " were you asleep also when this happened ? " " yes , " the chief , 57 at the time , replied
last week , ballard , district attorney for a several - county area that includes peachtree city , said a georgia bureau of investigation probe found the following : -- william mccollom went to bed on new year 's eve after consuming alcohol and sleep medication
-- after barking dogs awoke him in the middle of the night , he got up , picked up his glock 9mm gun from a dresser and checked the house
after finding nothing , he returned to bed , placing the gun under the sheets
-- william mccollom woke up to the sound of a gunshot that struck his wife 's right side
a wound on his right hand corroborates his claim that his palm blocked the ejection of a spent shell
-- forensic analysis of the sheets shows that the gun was fired from under the sheets
investigators concluded there was no evidence to suggest mccollum intentionally shot his wife , and that he did n't appear to have any motive to harm her , ballard said
still , ballard said he would ask a grand jury on april 15 to indict mccollum on a misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct , " since the chief took a loaded gun to bed with him after ingesting alcohol and sleep medication
" margaret mccollom has been staying at a spinal cord rehabilitation center , being treated for paralysis below the waist and other complications , ballard said last week
william mccollom was named the police chief in october after being interim chief for three months , cnn affiliate wsb reported
