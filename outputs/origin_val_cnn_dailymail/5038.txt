she was found guilty yesterday of first degree murder for stabbing her husband to death , chopping up his body with a knife and a saw , packing it into two plastic totes , and dragging it with her as she moved three times in six years
loretta burroughs was about to move for a fourth time on may 17 , 2013 , from ventnor , mays landing nj to villas , mays landing nj , when authorities arrived at the door of her new home with a search warrant
they were investigating her for fraud in relation to the disappearance of her husband , daniel s. burroughs , 63 , who was reported missing on september 1 , 2007
' she asked if we were also searching the ventnor house , ' testified sgt. lynn dougherty of the atlantic county prosecutor 's office
when told that they were , loretta burroughs 's physical demeanor ' changed completely
she lost the color in her face , she was wringing her hands , very nervous
' in the guest bedroom closet of loretta burroughs 's ventnor home , detective caroline macdonald of the atlantic county prosecutor 's office discovered two large boxes wrapped in multiple plastic garbage bags
as she started to open the bags , she smelled the distinct odor of decomposition and called the medical examiner
the boxes were transported to the morgue
it contained the victim 's skull and jawbone
dr charles f siebert jr , a forensic pathologist , began opening the boxes
both were surrounded by nine layers of plastic bags in alternating directions , siebert testified
he also found dryer sheets , air fresheners , and scented beads to mask the odor of death
inside the first container , siebert testified , he found a woman 's handbag
' i described it as olive but i did n't know the color , because it had been sitting in decomposition fluid , ' he said
inside the handbag were a ' cranium and mandible ' â a skull and jawbone
the second , larger plastic container contained more bones , including the left upper arm and lower legs
siebert testified that he saw cut marks on the ribs that were consistent with stab wounds
he determined that the person had died by homicide
dr alexander , a forensic odontologist , or dentist , from cranbury , mays landing nj , testified that he positively identified the remains in the plastic tote as being daniel burroughs
alexander compared loretta burroughs ' dental records to the teeth in the skull
fontana , a forensic anthropologist with the new jersey state police , testified about the condition of the bones in the boxes
' there was no gnawing from animals and no bleaching of the bones , ' she said
' that means the bones were in a protected environment , with no sun exposure , and not exposed to the environment where they were attacked by animals
' fontana then used a replica of a human skeleton and photographs to explain to the jury what had happened to the bones
she said the right tibia , which is the large bone of the lower leg , had been cut with a knife and a saw
because the cut edge was the same color of the bone , she said it had been sawed at the time of death
several vertebrae were missing , and others showed signs of trauma , including ' linear cuts as if produced by a knife
' demonstration : fontana , forensic anthropologist with the new jersey state police , uses a replica skeleton to show the jury where the bones of the victim 's leg had been sawed
forensic anthropologist fontana testified that all the wounds to the victim 's ribs were made with a knife
the third rib on the left side was completely fractured
fontana testified that several of the body 's 24 ribs were also missing
of the ribs that showed trauma , the injuries were consistent with knife wounds
' there is a pattern of dismemberment , ' fontana testified
dismemberment , she explained , is usually done ' to hinder identification and for ease of transport
' chief assistant prosecutor levy argued that loretta burroughs murdered her husband , danny , for money
danny disappeared on august 3 , 2007
a few days later , loretta burroughs told friends and family that he had left her
she said he drove off with a younger woman in a yellow hummer with florida license plates
in reality , the prosecutor said , loretta burroughs had killed him , and her gruesome plot had begun months before the murder
loretta burroughs worked at the mey house in egg harbor township , mays landing nj , now called somers place
in early june 2007 , she asked attorney hyberg , whose mother was in mey house , to draft a power of attorney
loretta burroughs told the attorney that she and her husband were selling their home , but danny was going out of town
with the power of attorney , loretta burroughs could complete the sale
she did not charge loretta , ' in gratitude for the attention she was paying my mother , ' hyberg testified
a power of attorney needs to be notarized
in june 2007 , loretta burroughs asked dwyer , whose mother was also in the mey house assisted living facility , if he knew anyone who could notarize it
' she said her husband had left her , the house was sold , but the deal was n't finished because he left , ' dwyer testified
' i agreed to help her out , ' he said
' she was overly good and generous with my mother
' in june 2007 , dwyer asked his sister - in - law to notarize the power of attorney
although danny was supposed to sign the document , he did not
instead , the prosecutor said , loretta burroughs signed danny 's name to it
loss : ray had to sit through the trial but said he believed the graphic images of his brother 's remains were what had convinced jurors of his sister - in - law 's guilt ray , right , was finally able to hold a memorial for danny on may 10 , 2014 , almost seven years after he reported his brother missing
' my brother won this case for himself , ' ray said
nicole didomizio , loretta burroughs 's daughter by another man , testified that her mother frequently signed danny ' name
in fact , she saw her do it between four and six times
after danny 's death , the prosecutor said , loretta burroughs used the forged document to sell their home
the profit was $ 77,101
but the money was locked up in escrow , and danny was entitled to at least half of it
' she ca n't get the money if she is married , ' levy , the prosecutor , said
' but she can get it if she is divorced
' loretta burroughs filed for divorce on february 28 , 2009 , 18 months after she killed her husband
she told her divorce attorney , alsofrom of northfield , mays landing nj , that her husband had moved to florida and did not give an address
alsofrom published a notice of her divorce complaint in the press of atlantic city
loretta burroughs received half of the money when she filed for divorce , and the other half when the divorce was finalized , alsofrom testified
as a result , the prosecutor said , between the profit from the house , and selling danny 's possessions , such as his tools and his collection of remote controlled model airplanes , loretta burroughs received close to $ 100,000
' the defendant has gotten away with it for over eight years , with nothing left but the bones , ' levy said in his closing statement
' the story ends with the defendant being $ 100,000 richer and danny in the defendant 's closet
' after two hours of deliberation , the jury convicted loretta burroughs of murder and hindering her apprehension
for danny 's grieving half - brother , raymond wantorck , of glenolden , pa , the conviction was bittersweet
' since they found my brother in may of 2013 , i was kicking and fighting that i wanted it to go trial , ' he said
' i wanted my brother 's remains to be shown to the jurors
' i have to think to myself , it is my brother that brought justice to this case
he brought justice to himself
pictures of his dismembered , horribly mutilated body , won the case
' ' my brother won this case for himself , ' ray said , ' and maybe for me
