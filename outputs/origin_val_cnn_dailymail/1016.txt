the scots have suffered repeated embarrassment on the big occasions against unfancied nations like costa rica and peru through the years
scotland manager strachan is confident his side can handle being favourites vs gibraltar on sunday against a gibraltar side which has shipped 21 goals in four games in their first ever uefa qualifying campaign , however , strachan expects last night 's 1 - 0 win to prove valuable
' i got what i expected from the players , ' said the scotland boss
' some played better than others , that happens
i have a system in mind for sunday
we 'll have a look at it now
' it does bring a pressure when people expect us to win easily - but we go into it feeling good about ourselves
every game you play , you go into it thinking the other team is going to score , no matter who they are
' it is a different challenge from germany - but it 's still a challenge
' the scots threatened to blow michael o'neill 's inexperienced , makeshift side away in the opening half hour , with ikechi anya a threat
berra ( front ) headed in scotland 's only goal in wednesday 's 1 - 0 friendly win over northern ireland berra ( centre ) wheels away in celebration after netting the decisive goal of the match at hampden park content just to win the game after debutant matt ritchie marked the occasion with a corner assist for berra 's third scotland goal strachan added : ' matt ritchie got better as the game went on , got more of the ball and was more comfortable , he 's tidy in everything he does
that 's a big thing in international football , not to give ball away
' he can be pleased with his debut - it was far better than mine â¦ ' the first half hour was good for a friendly
we had a good attitude
i was pleased with the number of chances we made and the way we made them
' then it kind of lulled in last 15 minutes of the first half into a friendly atmosphere
we kicked on for the first 10 minutes of the second half , then it died again , then we came good in the last 15
' i 'm delighted with the number of chances we made and the number that northern ireland did n't make
strachan was full of praise for matt ritchie on his scotland debut - after his assist for berra 's winning goal ' they made it hard for us
it 's different in this game if you can score early , but we kept plugging away and trying to do the right things
' there are one or two things i 'd like us to do better but i was delighted to win the game and get a clean sheet
' with celtic 's scott brown a second half substitute , strachan handed the captain ' s armband to darren fletcher , the west brom midfielder marking the night with a man of the match award
' i was really pleased for darren fletcher
it was a big decision for him to move but it 's been a good decision for him and for west brom
i 've got decisions to make for sunday now , good ones
