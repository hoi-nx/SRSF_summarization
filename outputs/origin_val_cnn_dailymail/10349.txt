scotland may not have won at twickenham since 1983 â but captain greig laidlaw insists there is no reason why cotter âs men should head south with an inferiority complex this weekend
from what he has seen in his first season in the premiership with gloucester , greig laidlaw reckons england âs players are anything but invincible
they are good , he says , but no better than those currently wearing the dark blue
scotland captain greig greig laidlaw ( above ) insists that england are not invincible ahead of saturday 's clash â i âve always thought highly of the england players but seeing them down there just shows me that we can win , â said greig laidlaw
â they are not invincible , that âs definitely not the case
â i believe they are good players but you look at glasgow warriors when they played bath in europe this season and how well they did
â bath were going well in the premiership but glasgow beat them at home and arguably could have won down there , too
it was nât really glasgow âs first team as they had a lot of injuries that day â and it probably was close to bath âs first team
â greig laidlaw âs emotions are running high ahead of the calcutta cup clash , especially after team - mate stuart hogg told sportsmail he feels there is a lack of respect for scottish rugby south of the border
greig laidlaw made a similar point before the start of the six nations , based on the experiences of his first season with gloucester , following his move from edinburgh
scotland full back stuart hogg ( left ) accused the english of lacking respect for scottish rugby for greig laidlaw , a win at twickenham will not only belatedly ignite scotland âs six nations campaign , following defeats to france , wales and italy , it will give him bragging rights in the gloucester dressing room and make him even more proud to be a scot south of the border
â respect has to be earned and that is something we âll be aiming to do at the weekend , â he said
â the england boys will respect us if we do a job on the field
â we âre not far away from getting things right but i âm getting pretty sick of telling people that , i really am
it âs up to us as players to step up , go again and put in that performance against england
â we have had some tough talking from the coaches this week and rightly so since the defeat to italy â but it has been good as we have been shooting ourselves in the foot a lot of the time and we have to change
â we have now seen both sides of cotter this week
he is a hard man and rightly so
he has high standards and we have certainly seen what he is all about â and that âs good
we know what is expected of us and he is a very clever coach who wants to make sure we come away from twickenham with a positive result
â greig laidlaw also has two very personal reasons for wanting to lead scotland to what would be a famous victory at twickenham
the first is to emulate his uncle , roy laidlaw , who helped his team to a calcutta cup win back in 1983
the other is to wipe out the memory of last year âs 20 - 0 defeat by england at murrayfield
it still makes him bristle and was arguably his worst performance in a scotland shirt
england captain chris robshaw lifts the calcutta cup at murrayfield last year after a 20 - 0 victory nothing went right for greig laidlaw that day and , after missing two penalties and struggling to make any sort of impression on the game , the scotland skipper was replaced by chris cusiter after 65 minutes
the boos that rang round the stadium at the final whistle hurt greig laidlaw and he knows that defeat , on top of scotland âs dreadful six nations campaign so far this season , makes it vitally important to put things right at the home of english rugby
â that was personally one of my worst games for scotland , to be honest , â he admitted
â i do nât think many of the boys played well that day for whatever reason
â it was made worse because we were playing england
it is the oldest game in the world and you want to do yourself proud â and we did nât
â cotter âs analysis this week has been about going back a bit further into previous six nations tournaments and he has been on our case
he has certainly been on my case , that âs for sure , after he brought up that match
â we âve had a look at that last game when we lost 20 - 0 and he pointed out mistakes in that match and told us we need to learn quickly and not make those same mistakes again
â we certainly want to turn around that defeat and how we have performed in this six nations , if we can , by winning at twickenham and there is slightly more added spice to the fixture because it is england down there
â i âve talked to my uncle roy about their win in 1983 but that was a different group of players and the guys who won more than 30 years ago have made their own bit of history
â it âs up to us now to make our own bit of history and go down there and be strong and have the mentality that we can impose our game on them â and not worry about what is coming out of the other changing room
â england centre luther burrell is mobbed by his team - mates after he scored a try in last year 's match much will rest on the performance of second - row jonny gray , who turns 21 on saturday
he has already come of age for scotland and is calling the line - outs
in the absence of big brother richie through injury , there is now even more responsibility on his shoulders
there was an indication against the italians of how much jonny gray is respected by cotter when , with greig laidlaw taken off and vice-captain ross ford off injured , he was asked to fill in as skipper near the end of the game
it was a dream come true for the second row , who knows he has a huge role to play against england
â it âs very special to be a part of the scotland squad in the first place , then to lead your country is something you grow up dreaming about , â he said
â to have done that , even if for only a couple of minutes against italy , was a huge honour and a very special feeling
jonny gray ( above ) will have a big role to play if scotland are to upset the odds and beat england â the result was hugely disappointing but we have to put that behind us now
â we have been looking at the england game and what we need to fix and we âre just training hard to try to get it right
â it will be a huge occasion in an amazing stadium against a tough england team
they have got a very strong pack and the driving maul is a real strength of theirs , so that is an area we will be working hard on this week
