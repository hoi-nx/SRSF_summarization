the sounds recorded on one of the " black boxes " recovered from downed germanwings 9525 firms up investigators ' theory that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit and then crashed the plane
" for god 's sake , open the door ! " capt. sondenheimer screamed as he banged on the cockpit door , pleading with the co-pilot
thirteen minutes later , the plane slammed into the french alps
the audio from the plane 's cockpit voice recorder has not been released , but the german newspaper bild published sunday what it claims is a summary of the transcript from the recording
cnn translated bild 's report -- which the newspaper says is based on the 1.5 hours of audio that was on the cockpit voice recorder -- but can not independently verify the information
france 's accident investigation agency , bea , told cnn that the agency is " dismayed " by the voice recording leak to bild
martine del bono , a spokeswoman for the agency , said the leak could not have come from a bea agent
she said the agency considers the report mere " voyeurism
" according to bild 's report , sondenheimer told co-pilot andreas lubitz that he did n't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff
andreas lubitz tells him he can go anytime
andreas lubitz is believed to have locked the pilot of flight 9525 out of the cockpit before putting the plane on a rapid descent into the mountains , french alps authorities have said
the flight took off 20 minutes late
after reaching cruising altitude , sondenheimer asked andreas lubitz to prepare the landing
once that 's finished , andreas lubitz again tells the captain he " can go anytime
" there is the sound of a seat being pushed backward after which the captain says , " you can take over
" at 10:29 a.m. , air traffic radar detects that the plane is starting to descend
three minutes later , air traffic controllers try to contact the plane and receive no answer -- shortly after which an alarm goes off in the cockpit , warning of the " sink rate , " bild reported
sondenheimer begs andreas lubitz to let him in
passengers then begin to scream , according to the transcript obtained by bild
a loud metallic bang is heard at 7,000 meters ( almost 23,000 feet )
a minute and half later and 2,000 meters ( about 6,500 feet ) lower to the ground , an alarm says " terrain -- pull up ! " " open the damn door ! " the pilot says
it 's 10:38 , and the plane is at 4,000 meters ( about 13,000 feet )
andreas lubitz 's breathing can still be heard on the voice recorder , according to bild 's report
two minutes later , investigators think they hear the plane 's right wing scrape a mountaintop
screams can be heard one final time
cockpit recordings are some of the most sensitive and closely held parts of aviation crash investigations
they 're never officially released , according to cnn aviation reporter richard quest
quest called it " unbelievable " that the black box audio would be leaked in this manner
communications between air traffic control and a plane 's cockpit can be downloaded privately , but that 's less common in europe than it is in the united states
an edited and redacted version of the transcript is usually published in part of a final report on an incident
although search teams have recovered the cockpit voice recorder , the flight data recorder remains missing
that device could reveal crucial details about what happened during the final moments of the flight
jean pierre michel , lead investigator for the french alps inquiry , said on saturday that investigators are not ruling out any scenario with respect to the crash out at this point
but french alps authorities have said that andreas lubitz appeared to have crashed germanwings 9525 deliberately into the french alps on tuesday as it flew from barcelona , spain , toward dusseldorf , german , with 150 people on board
much attention has focused on andreas lubitz 's state of mind since then , with suggestions that he may have had mental health issues
andreas lubitz , 27 , passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014 , a german aviation source told cnn
an official with lufthansa , which owns germanwings , said that the exam only tests physical health , not psychological health
the official also said that the company was never given any indication andreas lubitz was depressed , and that if he went to a doctor on his own , he would have been required to self - report if deemed unfit to fly
a dusseldorf clinic said he 'd gone there twice , most recently on march 10 , " concerning a diagnosis
" but the university clinic said it had not treated andreas lubitz for depression
the speculation about andreas lubitz ' mental state is based on a letter found in a waste bin in his dusseldorf apartment
the note , which was " slashed , " said andreas lubitz was not able to do his job , city prosecutor christoph kumpa said friday
the fact that investigators found " ripped , recent medical leave notes , including for the day of the offense , leads to the preliminary conclusion that the deceased kept his illness secret from his employer and his professional environment , " prosecutors said
germanwings corroborated that assertion , saying it had never received a sick note from andreas lubitz
a handful of publications , citing unnamed sources , have reported that andreas lubitz suffered from various psychological maladies
cnn has not been able to confirm these reports
andreas lubitz suffered from " generalized anxiety disorder , " and from severe depression in the past , le parisien newspaper reported sunday , citing sources close to the investigation
in 2010 , andreas lubitz received injections of antipsychotic medication , the paper said
he was also prescribed a medication that influences neurotransmitters , but it 's unclear when that happened , according to le parisien
the newspaper said investigators found a handful of pills in his apartment in addition to two sick notes , which forbade him from working from march 16 to march 29
the times and the wall street journal , citing unnamed sources , reported friday that andreas lubitz suffered from mental illness and kept his diagnosis concealed from his employer
a subsequent report from the times on saturday , citing two officials with knowledge of the investigation , said andreas lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk
however , an official with lufthansa , said that if andreas lubitz had vision problems , they would have been discovered during his pilot recertification medical examination
authorities have not ruled out the vision problems could have been psychosomatic , according to the times
citing an unidentified senior investigator , german newspaper die welt said that andreas lubitz suffered from a severe " psychosomatic illness " and that german police seized prescription drugs that treat the condition
andreas lubitz suffered from a " severe subjective burnout syndrome " and from severe depression , the source told the newspaper
news reports also stated that antidepressants were found during the search of his apartment
investigators are expected to question his relatives , friends and co-workers as they try to pin down what could have prompted the co-pilot to steer a jetliner full of people into a mountainside
andreas lubitz had a girlfriend , a teacher at a school in dusseldorf not far from his apartment , according to german media
who was co-pilot andreas lubitz ? dozens of people attended a remembrance ceremony saturday for the victims of the crash at a church in a nearby town , digne-les-bains , france
most of the people on the plane were from german and spain
relatives of the victims and local residents also gathered saturday afternoon by a simple stone memorial set up near the crash site , in the village of le vernet
flowers have been laid there , in the shadow of the snow - covered peaks of the french alps
the mayor of one local community said he had seen andreas lubitz 's father on thursday evening , describing him as " a man in deep distress
" " we get the impression that that man is bearing the whole weight of the disaster on his shoulders , " bartolini , the mayor of prads-haute-bleone , said saturday
" i can tell that this is a man whose life is totally broken , " bartolini said
" he had so much emotion in him
