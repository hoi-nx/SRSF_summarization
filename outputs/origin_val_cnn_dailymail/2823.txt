the 26 - year - old wife of former real housewives of new york star aviva drescher 's 79 - year - old father george has revealed intimate details about the couple 's ' steamy ' marriage , insisting that , despite their 53 - year age gap , the couple 's love life is more passionate than ever
dana , who married reality star george in an intimate ceremony in malibu last year - which his daughter aviva chose not to attend - explained to daily mail online that , before meeting george , she was close to giving up on the idea of finding a soul mate who would live up to her standards
' before george , i only ever dated men my age or younger and i âd never had an orgasm , â dana , who is from miami , says
but then i met a man 53 years older than me and finally i see what all the fuss is about
â my husband has the stamina of a 20 - year - old
george thinks nothing of making love to me for at least five hours every night and he wears me out ! â the couple 's unconventional romance began in march 2011 , when george , who appeared on a number of episodes of real housewives before his daughter aviva was fired from the reality series last year , walked into dana 's miami salon for a pedicure
thanks to his healthy tan , the manicurist admits that she thought the infamous playboy - who became renowned among real housewives viewers and castmembers alike for his ' sickening ' , ' inappropriate ' and ' disgusting ' behavior towards women - was as young as 60 years old
and when george asked her for an email address following his appointment , dana insists that she had no idea he was looking to pursue anything other than a business relationship
but two months later , he surprised her by asking her out on a date
â i wo nât lie , at first it never even crossed my mind to see george as anything other than a successful businessman who could help me grow my business , ' she says
' but i could n't see the harm in in saying yes
â the pair shared a romantic candlelit meal and dana began to feel a mutual attraction
â the more time i spent with george , the more i began to fancy him , ' she recalls
happy couple : the pair married in an intimate ceremony on the beach in malibu , which george 's daughter , former real housewives of new york star aviva drescher , chose not to attend moving on : george 's first wife , aviva 's mother , passed away a number of years ago â i loved how intelligent , successful and charismatic he was and suddenly the age difference did nât seem to matter so much
â and while george 's over-the - top sexual antics were the source of much horror among aviva 's real housewives co-stars , it seems to have worked wonders with dana
about a month into their relationship the pair slept together for the first time , and dana revealed that any concerns she had about their severe age gap quickly disappeared after the pair spent their first night together
â until i met george i had never ever experienced an orgasm , ' she admits
â but the first time we slept together , all that changed
â i thought he might have a wrinkly body and need viagra
but george âs physique is unbelievable as he works out every day â and viagra was the last thing he needed
â he âd studied tantric sex in india and i lost count of the number of times we had sex , but we were still at it when the sun came up
â he was so skilled , he blew my mind
i lost count of how many orgasms i had
' ironically , while george 's talents in the bedroom proved particularly effective when it came to wooing his wife , his playboy lifestyle seemed to have the opposite effect on the real housewives - and their viewers
indeed , castmember carole radziwill once went as far as to say of the aging lothario and his ' uncomfortable ' behavior : ' the problem is he 's so over the top , it 's uncomfortable to watch
' i love a good drama - whether a screaming match or a hair pulling - but i 'm with the audience on this one : get george off the tv
playboy : during his appearances on his daughter 's reality show , george formed a reputation with her castmates for his overtly sexual behavior sun - filled fun : george and dana insist that their age gap does not bother them ' it 's sickening to hear an old man sexually degrade women in all kinds of vile ways
' but despite his less - than - chivalrous behavior during his appearance on real housewives , it did n't take much for george to win dana over - and the couple 's relationship quickly began to go from strength to strength , despite the then - 23 - year - old not even knowing his real age
despite knowing george was a widower with three daughters and two sons , all older than her , dana admits that she did n't actually ask his real age until six months after the pair began dating
â by then i was so in love , i did n't care , ' she admits
' but on his birthday , i said to him , â tell me the truth
â â he took a big drink of wine and took my car keys from me in case i ran away
then he said : â i âm 77
â so many things ran through my mind , about the prospect of having children with someone so much older , or the possibility of him dying years before me
â but i could n't let age stand in the way of true happiness with my soul mate
â in august 2013 , george proposed during a family dinner at his daughter âs house and the happy couple tied the knot in a romantic ceremony on the beach in malibu a year later
and while george 's daughter aviva , who was often forced to defend her father 's shocking behaviour to her castmates , did not choose to attend the couple 's wedding , dana insists that the 44 - year - old gave them ' full blessing ' before they walked down the aisle
â george âs kids gave us their full blessing , ' she explains
family ties : although aviva ( r ) chose not to attend her father 's wedding to dana , the couple insist that the 44 - year - old gave them her blessing motherhood : aviva and her husband reid drescher ( l ) have two children together ( pictured ) ' after losing their mum , they are glad to see him so happy again
it was so romantic and afterwards we flew to hawaii on honeymoon
â but not everyone has been so thrilled for the couple
dana admits that some friends have accused her of acting like a â prostitute â in marrying george , who is reported to be worth about $ 50 million
â to this day , people point and snigger if they see us holding hands or kissing , ' dana admits
' it did upset me , but i 've grown a thicker skin and refuse to let some people âs small mindedness ruin our happiness
â george is not my sugar daddy
i am a successful woman in my own right
' i did n't need looking after by a rich man before and i do nât now either
i married him for love
anyone who spends five minutes with us will know we âre the real deal
â dana says that the pair are desperate to start a family as soon as possible - so desperate in fact , that george revealed during an appearance on real housewives that he has had his sperm frozen so that dana can opt to have his children even after he has died
but dana insists that she has put any fears about george dying before he gets to see their unborn child grow up to the back of her mind
â of course i worry , but life is too short and for all i know , i could die before him , ' she says
â i think i am the luckiest woman in the world to have found george
in our eyes love is not a number
