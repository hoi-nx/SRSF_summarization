keeping up a quick pace to the finish line , penix did n't look like someone who had walked nearly 240 miles in the footsteps of frontiersman daniel boone , an arduous trip through the appalachian terrain that was inspired by his own family 's pioneering roots in the kentucky wilderness
the michigan steel mill worker , toting a 40 - pound backpack , completed his 16 - day journey on thursday
it started in tennessee , wound into virginia and took him to hallowed ground in kentucky â the place where fort boonesborough was built in 1775 after daniel boone and his band of axe men had carved out boone trace
the path became an important early artery for settlers heading westward
' i ca n't wait to sit down , ' the 46 - year - old curtis penix said after being greeted by family and other supporters
' i have n't had a soft chair in a long time
physically , i feel fine
i feel like any other day i would get up for work
... i could keep going if i wanted , but i do n't want to

' during his adventure , penix slept outside , crossed rivers on foot , trudged through rain and mud and endured blistered feet
he started his journey on march 10 near kingsport , tennessee â the same place where daniel boone 's group left in march 1775
penix followed the famous frontiersman 's route into virginia and through cumberland gap into kentucky
after five days of traveling alone , penix was joined by walking companion fox , 42 , near the virginia - kentucky border
fox 's father , john fox , is president of friends of boone trace , a nonprofit group that hopes to preserve the historic route as a hiking trail and a memorial to the pioneers
' the american dream started on this road , ' curtis penix said
his trip was inspired by his fifth - great grandfather , joshua penix , who followed boone trace on his way to fort boonesborough
' this is where grandpa joshua came in 1779 , ' curtis penix said
' so he would have been right here somewhere in this little area
' his ancestor did quite well for himself in the frontier
he eventually acquired 1,400 acres near paris in central kentucky , but later parceled it off and sold it , penix said
joshua penix eventually became a plantation owner in virginia
among those welcoming penix and fox on their arrival was donna jones , who said some of her ancestors were among the settlers at fort boonesborough
their names are among those etched on a monument honoring the pioneers
' anybody that would spend this many days to get here certainly has an understanding of what our ancestors did to make all of this available to us now , ' jones said
' i just think that 's a wonderful for someone to do , to raise our level of awareness

curtis penix ' 5th great grandfather , joshua penix , was one of daniel boone 's men who walked to fort boonesborough in 1775 and helped blaze a trail from cumberland gap to the fort explorer : daniel boone and his band of axe men had carved out boone trace in the 1700s
the path became an important early artery for settlers heading westward at the start of his trip , penix said , he was determined to ' rough it , ' just like the pioneers
on his first day , he waded across seven streams and rivers on foot , including one that was knee deep
' i quickly found out that by getting your feet wet and then continuing to walk , you could get what the pioneers called " scalded feet , " ' he said
the foot blisters were enough to dissuade him from river crossings and take the bridges instead
he endured steady rain during his first four days
at the end of one day , he started shivering uncontrollably , he said
' rather than end my trip there , i bit the bullet and i decided to stop in at a motel and dry off and warm up , ' he said
' that was kind of a low point
i had tried to do this
sleeping under the stars , fording the rivers , carrying all my own food
' his attitude changed after a park ranger told him the pioneers stopped at settlements for food , warm places to sleep and to resupply before reaching the kentucky wilderness
after that , he said , he accepted the generosity from people offering meals and places to sleep , including carports and garages
with help from groups including friends of the boone trace , penix charted the most historically accurate route for his journey
penix said he got lost just once , on a mountainside in virginia
he estimated about 60 percent of his trip was on roads and the rest through woodlands or fields
while the early pioneers faced dangers from indians , penix 's biggest threat was vehicles on roads that lacked shoulders for him and fox to walk on
' when a large truck would come by , we had this little technique where we would lean ( on their walking sticks ) into the ditch and away from the road , just long enough for them to go by , and then we 'd pop back out on the road , ' he said
penix planned to visit daniel boone 's grave in kentucky 's capital city of frankfort and then return home to monroe , michigan
