while manager tony pulis wound down after a crushing fa cup quarter - final defeat to soft soul on his favourite radio station , his west brom team flushed the defeat out of their system with a trip to the go - karting track
very different approaches but both seemed to have the desired effect of melting away the disappointment
a narrow victory over stoke may have lacked petrol fuelled highs or many thrills of any description , but it lifted west brom to 13th in the table , consigning two defeats to local rivals aston villa within a week to distant memory
tony pulis ' west brom squad went on a go - karting trip after their fa cup quarter - final defeat darren fletcher ( right ) said the midweek trip was kept under wraps for fear of sending out the wrong message ' i let them have a couple of days away from me , ' said tony pulis about the aftermath of a 2 - 0 defeat which ended in a pitch invasion and fa cup probe into seats being thrown by west brom supporters , ' i was obviously bitterly disappointed myself and i can be a bit snappy at times
so i took myself away from the firing line
' you either have a passion or you do n't and sometimes i get myself in such a state i am best away from people
' despite saturday 's win â thanks to brown ideye 's headed goal â taking west brom 11 points clear of the relegation zone tony pulis said his aims were unchanged
' i still want 40 points , ' he said
' i 'm not concerned about what others do , i would be in my grave by now if i sat worrying about every goal that goes in
i listen to smooth radio and a bit of music rather than worry about what other people are doing
' west brom beat stoke at the the hawthorns on saturday thanks to brown ideye 's headed goal darren fletcher said the midweek go - karting trip was kept under wraps for fear of sending out the wrong message to fans
' we did n't want to show the world we doing it and we did n't want the fans to see us trying to do stuff like that straight after losing to aston villa
we gave ourselves a little lift , it was just for us as the lads
they were down , it was hard to lose two games to aston villa , especially the fa cup game
i think it worked quite well so maybe we 'll go karting again next week
' darren fletcher , 31 , is enjoying a resurgence at the hawthorns after joining on a free transfer in january from manchester united , where his later years were blighted by a struggle with ulcerative colitis
he bossed the midfield against stoke but claimed he rolled over on the racing track
' in the interests of team spirit , i let the rest of the lads win , ' he joked , ' the top three were gardner , [ joleon ] lescott and [ saido ] berahino , they were saying the brummie lads did the business
gards organised it and he definitely had the fastest car
