ceglia faces trial on a charge he fraudulently claimed ownership in facebook
his civil lawsuit against founder mark zuckerberg was thrown out after he was accused of doctoring a software development contract he signed with mark zuckerberg in 2003
authorities say he made it appear mark zuckerberg promised him half ownership in return for $ 1,000 in start - up money
search : u.s. marshalls released this wanted poster in the search for the fugitive who escaped house arrest ceglia was criminally charged in 2012 and went on to plead not guilty to fraud charges
he was due to go on trial in may
however , it emerged this week that ceglia had one missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet
lawsuit : ceglia sued facebook founder , mark zuckerberg ( pictured ) , in 2010 ' i do nât know where he is , ' his attorney , fogg , admitted
' i have nât got a clue
' speaking to reuters , fogg said ceglia 's tracking device had been found at his home , in new york 's rural allegany county , after the u.s. marshals service was dispatched to check on him on sunday
he said he has not heard from ceglia , adding that u.s. district judge vernon broderick has now scheduled a court hearing for tuesday that was ' most definitely spawned by the recent event '
last april , buffalo federal judge richard arcara officially closed the book on mr ceglia 's multibillion - dollar lawsuit claiming half - ownership of facebook , granting mr mark zuckerberg 's motion to dismiss it the ruling affirmed a magistrate judge 's recommendation from a year earlier , saying the suit should be thrown out because the 2003 software development contract ceglia had based it on was faked
ceglia had claimed that he and mark zuckerberg had signed a contract , ' the face book ' , that included a provision entitling him to half - ownership of facebook in exchange for start - up money for the firm
at the time , mark zuckerberg was a freshman at harvard
although facebook 's lawyers agreed the pair had a contract , they said references to the social network were slipped in for the lawsuit
claims : ceglia - who claimed he had been promised a 50 per cent share in facebook ( pictured ) - was due to go on trial on may 4
however , he is now missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet mark zuckerberg had previously done some programming work for ceglia 's company , streetfax.com
the lawyers argued that the only valid contract between the pair related to that company
at the time of ceglia 's arrest , manhattan u.s. attorney preet bharara said the suspect - who also provided allegedly falsified emails - was seeking a ' quick payday based on a blatant forgery
' ' the contract is a cut - and - paste job , the emails are complete fabrications and this entire lawsuit is a fraud , ' attorneys for mr mark zuckerberg and his palo alto , california - based company added
' mark zuckerberg has now declared under oath that he did not sign the contract attached to ceglia 's complaint and that he did not write or receive any of the purported emails
' on monday , fogg said that ceglia - who has pleaded not guilty - has ' always been concerned with justice '
' he has always been concerned about if he 'd get a fair trial , ' the attorney added
ceglia has twice tried to get the charges dropped
he is also appealing against the 2014 ruling
november 22 , 2003 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ' i have recently met with a couple of upperclassmen here at harvard that are planning to launch a site very similar to ours
if we do nât make a move soon , i think we will lose the advantage we would have if we release before them
' i âve stalled them for the time being and with a break if you could send another $ 1000 for the facebook ( sic ) project it would allow me to pay my roommate or jeff to help integrate the search code and get the site live before them
please give me a call so that we can talk more about this
' january 1 , 2004 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ' i think it is unnecessary at this point , with all of the extra work i have done for you , to be held to the original completion date
i should not be penalized for delays that were out of my control , namely that there have been so many unspecified requests from the streetfax project that you wanted to be placed as a priority , thereby delaying my start on our second project
' thus , i am requesting a written waiver on your part exempting me from the obligation to give you additional ownership in the project that is outlined in our original contract
' january 5 - mr ceglia to mr mark zuckerberg ' it is well past january 1 and to my knowledge you do n't have a single thing done for the site ... you know perfectly well that you ca n't just take a person 's investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in harvard
' i 've been stalled long enough on this thing and if i do n't see something soon i 'll no choice but to contact the school and perhaps your parents in dobbs ferry and let them know what 's going on
' february 2 , 2004 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ' ceglia , i have a rather serious issue to discuss with you , according to our contract i owe you over 30 % more of the business in late penalties which would give you over 80 % of the company
' first i want to say that i think that is completely unfair because i did so much extra work for you on your site that caused those delays in the first place and second i do nât even think it is legal to charge such a huge penalty
' mostly though i just wo nât even bother putting the site live if you are going to insist on such a large percentage
i âd like to suggest that you drop the penalty completely and that we officially return to 50/50 ownership
' february 6 , 2004 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ' sorry it âs taken me a few days to respond , ( sic ) now that the sites ( sic ) live i feel i must take creative control and i just can not risk injuring my sites ( sic ) reputation by cheapening it with your idea of selling college junk , nor do i wish to spend my time shipping out coffee mugs to rich alumni
the site is cool as it is and i do nât care about making any money on it right now , i just want to see if people will use it
' february 7 , 2004 - mr ceglia to mr mark zuckerberg ' mark zuckerberg , all i can think is your parents have handed you everything your entire life and after all this time and energy and money that you think in your head that an ok way to act is to just say - oh i âve changed my mind i do nât think it âs cool to make money and that that should be that
' april 6 , 2004 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ' ceglia , i have become too busy to deal with the site and no one wants to pay for it , so i am thinking of just taking the server down
my parents have a fund that i can tap into for my college expenses and i would just like to give you your two thousand dollars back and call it even on the rest of the money you owe me for the extra work
at this point i wo nât even really be able to work on the facebook until summer
' april 6 , 2004 - mr ceglia to mr mark zuckerberg ' grow up , take a f * * * ing ethics class , choke yourself with that silver spoon of yours
' july 22 , 2004 - mr mark zuckerberg to mr ceglia ( a week before facebook was incorporated ) ' ceglia , i am guessing that you do nât want to talk to me but i wanted to say happy birthday and that i hope to resolve our differences
i see that what i did was wrong and i am really sorry that i behaved as i did
please give me your address and i will mail you back the $ 2000 for your trouble , more if it will repair our business relationship
' another summer is here and i still do nât have any time to build our site , i understand that i promised i would , but other things have come up and i am out in california working during break
i just do nât want the obligation of having to answer to you for not following through and i wo nât be able to
