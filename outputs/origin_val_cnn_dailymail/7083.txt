when kim unveiled those platinum blonde locks yesterday , her new style was met with mixed reviews
but the 34 - year - old âs decision to hit the bleach bottle again is one i can understand
kanye west says he prefers the reality star âs lighter locks and who can blame him , from marilyn monroe to brigitte bardot , we âre a society obsessed with iconic blonde bombshells
hailed as the beauty idol of the 2010s , it âs no wonder kim decided to re-join the ranks of famous blonde stars
a study last year by hair - care brand schwarzkopf showed that blondes make up 30 per cent of the retail hair dye market and contribute to 60 per cent of salon business - those numbers are surely set to rise with kim âs look sparking a wave of women going over to the lighter side
hairdressers may say a drastic hair change like kim âs is a sign of something dramatic going on in a person âs life , but that was nât the case for me when i decided to take the plunge from brunette to blonde last november
while i âve been known to reach for reach for the hair dye immediately after a break up , going blonde was nât a spur of the moment decision but more a reflection of my realisation that life âs too short not to have fun
and do blondes have more fun ? in my experience , definitely
extreme new look : rosy had her hair dyed at the bleach london salon in dalston by hairstylist naoya rosy , pictured before , left , and after , right , said was as if someone had finally lifted my invisibility cloak rosy said she now gets lots more attention from men after going platinum my hair was bleached at the bleach london salon in dalston by hairstylist naoya
the whole process , including blow dry , took three and a half hours in total
as i had previously coloured my hair , it was treated as a colour correction rather than a virgin bleach
naoya first applied a pre-lightener mixed with peroxide to the ends of my hair to lift the colour out , then after applied the mixture to my roots ( as they process faster ) to ensure it was all an even colour
the bleach was then washed off and a golden toner was applied to banish any brassy tones
i now get my roots done every 6 - 8 weeks to maintain the look
as a brunette i often felt mousey , invisible and way older than my 25 years
sometimes i could even feel myself slowly blending into the background in social situations and no change of outfit or make - up seemed to make a difference
when my hairdresser naoya at bleach london suggested i âd suit a light blonde tone , i first balked at the idea , worried it would ruin the condition
platinum seemed like a big step from the subtle tints , golden tones and buttery highlights i was used to
but when a friend of a friend dyed her natural brown locks a stunning bright blonde and i saw how happy she looked , i knew it was just what i needed
an extreme colour change takes a lot of guts and i applaud women like kim for taking risks and not sticking to the same look
i do nât agree that she âs lost her signature style , if anything she stands out from the crowd even more
the first thing i noticed when i left the hairdressers was the amount of people suddenly staring at me , it was as if someone had finally lifted my invisibility cloak
rosy says the most noticeable difference after her new look was how she was treated by men rosy said she went from ' mousey ' ( left ) to being served first at a bar after going blonde ( right ) kim unveiled her new look with husband kanye west at paris fashion week yesterday if you fancy having light locks , get ready for a lot of stares from strangers - bright hair is more uncommon so people tend to unconsciously let their gaze linger
my friends and family loved my new look but all agreed i looked like a completely different person - a sentiment shared by my colleagues at work who did nât even recognise me when i walked into the office the next day
the most noticeable difference of all was the way men treated me
they say that gentlemen prefer blondes , and whether that âs true or not , they most certainly prefer me as one
while i would never base my self - worth on how appealing i am to the opposite sex , i must admit i now find it flattering to get served first at a bar or walk into a room to a flurry of turning heads
rosy said she met her current partner - and found herself inundated with offers - after changing her hair colour rosy said there are downsides to being a blonde , left , but says she would never go back to being brunette 1
avoid daily shampooing to help hair retain moisture
get a trim every 8 weeks to refresh the cuticle
sleep on a silk pillowcase to reduce friction
keep heat styling for special occasions only
brush hair using a tangle teezer or mason pearson brush
after being single for six months , i also suddenly found myself inundated with offers and it âs no coincidence that the day after my blonde transformation i ended up meeting my current partner
but what i appreciate the most is how members of both sexes listen to me more in conversation
when i speak as a platinum blonde , people pay attention
why ? it âs more than my hair colour , it âs because i finally feel confident
it may be even more of a stereotype than the out - dated â dumb blonde â jokes , but confidence really is the most attractive quality to possess
i did nât just look like a different person , i felt like one
it was as if overnight i had become more outgoing , sociable and self - assured
of course , there are downsides
like the memes of kim circulating the internet , people have stopped me to ask if i âm wearing daenerys â wig from game of thrones or tell me i remind them of legolas
overall , it âs a small price to pay for feeling this great
i âve gone blonde and i âm not going back .
