german is bracing itself for a period of chaos and instability amid claims greece will exit from the euro , finance minister schã¤uble said german is bracing itself for a period of chaos and instability amid claims greece will exit from the euro
finance minister schã¤uble said he is resigned to the possibility of a greece exit from the calamitous euro experiment
in a tv interview on thursday evening he was asked if he could envisage it and he replied : ' yes , because the responsibility , the ability to decide what happens , resides with the greece , and because we do not know what the leaders intend to do in greece , we can not exclude it
' chancellor angela merkel has also run out of patience with the new anti-austerity government in athens , reports suggested
their comments represent a tectonic shift from the previous undiluted support german offered greece - a country whose financial mismanagement is loathed by eu lawmakers
and in recent days tensions between berlin and athens have spiked even further
the new alexis tsipras government first threatened to seize german businesses and assets if german did not provide billions of pounds of compensation for damages caused during the nazi occupation during world war ii. greece also made a threat to send refugees - terrorist suspects among them - from its shores to german if berlin did not support it in ongoing debt crisis talks
' if they deal a blow to greece , then they should know the migrants will get papers to go to berlin , ' panos kammenos told a meeting of his right - wing party independent greeks
he also said that if some of the refugees were members of the terrorist group isis , it would be europe 's fault because of its position on greece 's economic problems
on thursday the greece ambassador in berlin made an official complaint to the foreign ministry about the behaviour of schã¤uble towards his greece counterpart yanis varoufakis
the ambassador claimed that schã¤uble had called varoufakis naã¯ve , a charge he denies
schã¤uble said greece can only get more funds if it sticks to the agreements with its creditors

chancellor angela merkel ( right ) is said to have run out of patience with the new anti-austerity government in athens he said : ' europe stands ready to help greece , but greece must be prepared to help itself
the problem will not be solved by turning others into scapegoats
' his comments were made as a new poll showed 52 per cent of german would be happy for greece to quit the common currency while 80 per cent believe that greece is not acting seriously in trying to adhere to its obligations on debt repayments and financial reforms
a greece exit would plunge german 's financial institutions into crisis and the impact on other countries - including the british - could be severe
there would almost certainly be a ' flight to safety ' as depositors pull euros out of other potentially vulnerable eurozone members such as portugal , spain and italy to avoid taking a hit
europe company share prices would also fall sharply
experts say british would be hit extremely hard
almost half of british trade is with europe and a continental slump would translate into lost orders and jobs while the financial chaos would also hit the city .
