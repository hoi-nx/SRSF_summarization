islamic state murderer jihadi john had links to the 2005 bomb plotters who tried to blow up london 's tube system just weeks after the horrific july 7 attack which killed 52 people , it has been revealed
emwazi , who was unmasked as islamic state 's cold - blooded executioner last week , was a member of a terror cell that was known to have links to the failed july 21 , 2005 attacks on london
documents have revealed a key figure of his london - based terror cell talked to one of the terrorists on the day of the attempted tube bombing - the would be terrorist was later jailed for life over the failed attack
emwazi , who was brought up in west london , was subject to a no fly order and was on a terror watch list but still managed to leave without detection
it was revealed this week that he was a ' person of interest ' to security service as a member of a cell known as the london boys , which was set up to recruit and raise funds for somalia - based terror group al shabab
security service was also aware of emwazi for six years before he appeared on a hostage video for the first time in august 2014
and now , even more worryingly , it has been revealed at least one member of his network had a connection with the worst terrorist atrocity to take place on uk soil
the failed july 21 attacks came just two weeks after four men blew themselves up on london 's tubes and a bus , killing 52 people and injuring more than 700 in 2005

the documents show that security services were aware that associates of the 12 - strong west london terror group had joined the four july 21 bombers at a training camp in cumbria a year before the attempted terror attack
on friday , johnson lashed out at home secretary theresa may for watering down strict anti-terror powers which may have helped emwazi escape the net and travel to syria
the london mayor accused his tory leadership rival of giving the ' benefit of the doubt ' to terror suspects like emzawi
mr johnson 's attack comes amid the growing controversy over who is to blame for security service 's failure to stop ' known wolf ' emwazi leaving uk for the front line in syria in 2013
the government 's independent reviewer of terror legislation david anderson admitted security service may have ' slipped up '
but he said : ' one wo n't know until there 's been an inquiry or a report of some kind
' but experts believe emwazi was helped to escape uk by his terror associates who had been allowed back to london by the government in 2011
mayor of london johnson ( pictured right ) lashed out at home secretary theresa may on friday for ' watering down ' strict anti-terror powers which may have helped emwazi escape the net and travel to syria it is understood that three members of emwazi 's network were made subject in 2011 to control orders brought in by the last labour government , which meant they had to live outside london
but the control orders were disbanded by the coalition and they were instead subject to tpim â terrorism prevention and investigation measures â which allowed them to return to london and re-engage with emwazi
two of the men on these weakened orders â known only as bx and cc in the court documents â aided with money , a false identity and bogus travel documents by the london jihadi cell
the power to relocate terror suspects was reintroduced a fortnight ago , under growing pressure from the security services
mr johnson slammed the 2011 ' mistake ' to scrap the ' internal exile ' powers contained in labour 's control order regime
the mayor of london said : ' we need to keep a very , very close eye on these people
' the decision to modify the control orders , to water them down i think in retrospect looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able , when you are controlling these people to be able to relocate them , to take them away from their support networks and look after them , to monitor them properly
' we are now back on the right track and it just confirms to me the vital importance of us being able to monitor these people , to keep tabs on them , to look at what they are saying to each other in their email , their electronic contact
' this whole thing needs to be tackled very , very robustly
' we need to have a very strong security response that gives our people , gives our security services and the police the surveillance powers that they need
' uk journalist david haines ( pictured ) who was killed by jihadi john - believed to be emwazi labour 's shadow home secretary yvette cooper shadow backed the london mayor 's attack on mrs may
she said : ' we warned the government from the start not to abolish control orders
i said in parliament many times that those relocation powers were immensely important and that removing them would make it easier for terror suspects to organise
' the labour shadow minister added : ' at the very least , the prime minister should ask the intelligence and security committee to examine the period following the scrapping of relocation
' parliament needs to know whether the legislation to alter counter terror powers affected the uk 's ability to prevent people travelling to syria
' the home secretary has a duty to protect national security , so if the decisions she made on legislation against expert advice have weakened national security instead , the public and parliament have a right to know
' a home office spokesman said : ' control orders were not working and were being struck down by the courts
' tpim have been endorsed by the courts , counter-terrorism reviewers , the police , and the security service
' following a review of the powers available to manage the terrorist threat , the range of measures available under the tpim act is being extended including a measure to allow tpim subjects to be relocated to different parts of the country
' additionally the counter-terrorism and security act , which became law this month , will bolster our already considerable armoury of powers to disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight , reduce the risks they pose on their return and combat the underlying ideology that feeds , supports and sanctions terrorism
