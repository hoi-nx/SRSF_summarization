jurors were shown pictures of a little boy stuffed in a box to recreate the way six - year - old etan patz was allegedly discarded after being choked to death
a boy of etan 's height , weight and age was pictured in court on friday curled up in a zip - up bag and squeezed into a produce box similar to the one pedro hernandez said he used to store the child 's corpse in 1979
etan , who went missing as he walked to school , was never found
he was declared dead in 2001
horrific : this recreation shows a little boy stuffed inside a bag then a cardboard box
it is allegedly the way etan patz 's lifeless body was discarded after he was choked to death on the way home from school etan ( left ) , whose body was never found , was declared dead in 2001
pedro hernandez ( right ) is the suspect defense attorneys , who claim pedro hernandez 's alleged confession is fiction , will begin presenting evidence on monday in the trial that is expected to last for at least another month
pedro hernandez , from maple shade , new jersey , told authorities he choked etan in the basement of a soho bodega and then put his body in a bag and tossed it in a box
in february , the trial was transformed by the discovery of three boxes of evidence from the investigation , including more than 1,400 pages of information
alice fontier , one of the attorneys representing pedro hernandez , said the findings could mean witnesses will be recalled
' given this massive disclosure at this point , in the middle of the trial , there may be issues , ' she said
the boxes were found recently at a harlem police station that covers public housing complexes in the area , prosecutors said late last week
' confession ' : defense attorneys claim pedro hernandez 's alleged confession ( pictured ) , when he told police he strangled etan in the basement of a soho bodega in 1979 , was fabricated fighting for justice : here , etan 's father stanley patz and his sister shira patz are pictured outside court the location is miles from the precinct near where etan disappeared on may 25 , 1979 , as he walked to school
etan 's body has never been found , and he was declared dead in 2001
the boxes contain police records from the investigation , notes from assistant district attorneys who worked on the case and handwritten memos from a detective who investigated longtime suspect ramos , who was never charged
some of the information involves two informants who were working with prosecutors to try to link ramos to etan 's death
other boxes contain missing - person posters , records of people arrested and catalogs of files made by the original detective on the case
tragic : this is the missing poster which was made and plastered around new york after etan 's disappearance immediately after the discovery in mid-february , assistant district attorney joan illuzzi-orbon said that prosecutors were working to turn over the information to the defense attorneys
outside court , defense attorney harvey fishbein said it was unclear what the documents contain but he hopes they wo n't affect the case and he does n't want a mistrial
' we want it resolved for mr pedro hernandez , ' he said
' he 's been in jail for three years , so we definitely want to continue this case
' pedro hernandez , a former bodega worker , pleaded not guilty to etan 's murder after telling police he strangled the boy .
