a man is distraught after visiting his wife 's grave to find that a stranger has been buried in the plot next to her that he had bought for himself
and to make matters worse , it is the second time this has happened to charara , 75 , at the united memorial gardens cemetery in plymouth , mich.
in 2011 he and his daughter , waad , had learned a stranger had been placed in the plot next to his late wife mahassen charara , who died at 44 from a brain aneurysm in 1996
following a lawsuit and a settlement with the cemetery , they thought they had put that traumatic and emotional experience behind them
they reached a settlement and received the plot back after his wife passed away , the family had purchased three more plots in 1997 which were paid off in 2000 , according to fox 2
mr charara said the latest mistake hurts
' it 's been a couple days , i still get upset when i try to eat
it hurts , ' he said
waad charara , mr charara 's daughter , said she nearly dropped the phone when her father called breaking the news waad said she received a frantic call from her father who broke the news , according to the washington post
' i almost dropped the phone , ' she said
' it was shocking because this was the second time it had happened and it was devastating to think that we 'd have to go through all of this again
my jaw was on the floor
' the most recent person buried in the plot , a man who has not been named , was placed in the wrong grave in february , according to the arab american news
mr charara made a trip to the cemetery on the 19th anniversary of his wife 's death on march 17 when he made the discovery
he also found his wife 's grave had been disturbed as it was covered in dirt from the man 's burial
the charara family then contacted cemetery officials to inform them of this second mistake , and the family was informed that they might have to have their family member 's body exhumed and relocated
waad said the error is tragic for both families involved
' what 's even harder is the other family , ' charara told the arab american news
' islamically putting someone in the grave and then taking them out , it 's just horrible
mr charara , as he fights back tears , said the latest mistake has left him hurt ' i just ca n't imagine if someone else comes along and says ' that 's our spot '
' but we 've owned these plots for 19 years and now these people have to make that decision of moving their father
how horrible is that ? ' baydoun , one of the chararas ' attorneys , who also represented them in 2011 , said he does not know what led to this mistake , but that the family will sue if there is no immediate action
the first time he took legal action on behalf of the chararas , he said he learned that the cemetery has a history of ' disastrous record - keeping ' , he told the post
the united memorial gardens has told the family they are going to make a proposal following the incident the cemetery is used by several muslims in the community and contains an islamic that is supposed to maintain the procedures and protocols of islamic burials
four years ago , waad said her father was in such shock from the news that a man with the same first and last name and been placed in his plot that he ended up in hospital
and in light of the most recent mistake , baydoun said he made it very clear to the cemetery that the charara family will not settle on anything that does not confirm this will not ever happen again
' we are waiting right now for the cemetery 's response
they 've indicated that they were going to make a proposal , he said
' i do hope the families at some point have a discussion between each other and come to a resolution
' many muslims in the area use the cemetery as it has an islamic that is meant to maintain the procedures and protocols of islamic burials
