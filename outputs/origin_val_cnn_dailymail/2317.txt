fuel retailers are ripping off the public and businesses on diesel charges , according to the rac
the wholesale price of diesel is 1p a litre more than for petrol , yet diesel is almost 6p more at the pumps , it said
there is scope for a diesel price cut of around 4p a litre to restore some parity to the market , the rac added
the automotive company calls out retailers , saying businesses in particular are paying excessive charges on diesel as sales of the fuel increase the rac âs comments came as it highlighted government figures which showed total fuel sales were up 3.5 per cent in february compared with the same month last year
diesel sales last month , at 2.42billion litres , represented the fifth highest monthly total since 1990
but petrol sales are among their lowest for 25 years
businesses , which are more likely to run on diesel are being ripped off by retailers who are looking to offset losses from low petrol prices because companies traditionally run on diesel , they are particularly hard hit by the fuel rip - off
rac spokesman simon williams said : â it âs hard not to think that business is being taken for a ride
' with sales of diesel at an all - time high the retailers have maintained a higher margin on diesel , perhaps to subsidise petrol sales
