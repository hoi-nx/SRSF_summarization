ultra-conservative mp nile has lashed out at sydney 's mardi gras celebration , saying parenting , ' not promiscuity ' should be celebrated
the christian democratic party nsw mp made his comments on his official facebook page just as the party was getting underway across sydney and came as a television advertisement was aired during the parade , which claimed same - sex marriage would disadvantage children
a spokeswoman for mr nile , who spent the day campaigning in coffs harbour , said the post was designed to remind people of the importance of traditional relationships

marriage equality advocates have slammed an advertisement that aired during sydney 's mardi gras celebrations on saturday night claiming children from same - sex couples are disadvantaged
' with so much coverage and celebration of mardi gras , it 's important to also be thankful for natural relationships - for the mum and the dad , ' the spokeswoman said
' without that traditional relationship , natural reproduction would n't be possible
it 's very important to celebrate natural couples and those values
' his controversial comments came as an advertisement claiming same - sex marriage disadvantaged children aired on tv on saturday night
it was organised and paid for by the australian marriage forum , a group ' disappointed with the one - sided debate ' surrounding the issue
the 40 - second spot starts with a mother at a park saying : ' we hear a lot about marriage equality , but what about equality for kids ? ' dr david gend , president of the australian marriage forum and a family doctor based in toowoomba , queensland , says in the commercial that ' so - called marriage equality forces a child to miss out on a mother or a father '
the gay and lesbian rights lobby accused the commercial of not only missing the point on marriage equality , but of also attempting to fight a losing battle
' that 's not equality ; that 's not marriage , ' dr david gend says
it also asks for supporters to donate money to the group
marriage equality advocates have slammed the ad , and said the campaign is trying to mislead people on the issue
' the first point for us is that marriage equality and same - sex couples having children are two different equations , ' glrl co-convenor koonin told daily mail australia
' same - sex couples already can and do have children - marriage equality is not going to change that
' if the people behind this video were really thinking of the children , they would support marriage equality so that all kids , including those with same - sex parents , could say their parents are married
' mr koonin also said most australians could see through claims that marriage equality disadvantages children , and that most had ' moved on ' from that discussion
' they definitely are n't fooling anyone , ' he said
' if they want to make that claim , have some evidence to support it
' the majority of evidence shows there is no disadvantage to children with same - sex parents , and in fact most are slightly better off than average
' dr david gend , president of the australian marriage forum says in the commercial that ' so - called marriage equality forces a child to miss out on a mother or a father '
the controversial australian marriage forum commercial starts with a mother at a park saying : ' we hear a lot about marriage equality , but what about equality for kids ? ' the commercial has been widely criticised on social media , with more than 1200 people disliking the video on youtube , compared to just 150 who liked it
according to its website , the australians marriage forum is ' an organisation that has been set up to encourage australians to discuss the issue of same - sex marriage with some discernment and caution
' it also states marriage equality would ' have enormous consequences on our culture ' and calls for a ' open and honest debate ... free of the intimidation that so many defenders of natural marriage have been subject to in recent years
