parents are increasingly pressuring doctors to delay vaccines for young children , raising the threat from preventable diseases such as the flu , measles and mumps , a new study suggests
researchers from the university of colorado surveyed 534 physicians across the country with 93 per cent reporting that they had received requests for jabs to be rescheduled
some parents wanted to space shots out so their children were n't jabbed so many times in one sitting while others worried about possible vaccine - related neurological complications
children in the u.s. receive around 29 vaccines for about 14 illnesses between birth and six years , based on recommendations from the cdc
growing trend : parents are increasingly pressuring doctors to delay vaccines for young children , raising the threat from preventable diseases such as the flu , measles and mumps , a new study suggests three - quarters of the doctors surveyed said they agreed to vaccine delays at least some of the time , even though they knew it was potentially harmful
in some cases , practitioners feared they would lose patients from their practice if they pushed the recommended vaccine schedule too hard
only three per cent said they had refused such requests
overall , 25 per cent of doctors said the demand for injection delays were up from the previous year
parents who refuse to vaccinate their children have faced scrutiny after a measles outbreak in california blighted more than 100 adults and children since december
most cases are tied to an outbreak at disneyland in california , which likely began with a traveler who brought it in
however , the exact source of the disneyland - linked cases is not known
doctors are concerned about unvaccinated or under - vaccinated children becoming ill and spreading disease to others
the potential repercussions are worrisome and are happening ' right now with the measles outbreak , ' said dr. allison kempe , a university of colorado researcher and a member of the federal cdc 's vaccine advisory committee
the survey , conducted in 2012 , did n't ask doctors which particular vaccines parents asked to delay
the recommended cdc vaccine schedules are based on research around what time they will be most effective at preventing disease
delaying shots targeted for certain ages means they may be less effective later on
it also makes it more likely that children will never get vaccinated , because parents get too busy or forget to schedule another doctor 's visit , said dr. frenck , an infectious diseases specialist at cincinnati children 's hospital medical center
he was not involved in the new study , published in monday 's pediatrics
' people just do n't understand that these diseases are all there , they 're not gone
they 're just being kept at bay right now
if people stop vaccinating , they come right back , ' frenck said
doctors involved in the university of colorado investigation were all certified members of the american academy of pediatrics and the american academy of family physicians - the two leading groups of doctors who treat young children .
