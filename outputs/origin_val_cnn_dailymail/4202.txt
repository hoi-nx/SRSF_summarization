mrs kashelle knox admitted that while shy at first , and desperate for her husband to be there for the birth , she was forced to accept the circumstances
' i told my friend i was feeling a bit funny , i was a bit nauseous , and as we were lining up for food i got more nauseous and said " i 'm just going to sit here " and i was thinking i just needed to vomit , ' she said
' so i said " i 'm just going to lie over there and vomit "
i thought it was hunger nausea , but then i started having contractions
' i was a bit hesitant to relax into the contractions because i knew andrew ( right ) would n't make it. , but after a few contractions i was like , this baby is coming now whether i like it or not , ' mrs kashelle knox ( left ) said mrs konx 's two children , 22 month old tarquin and her little brother , cuddle up on the couch ' i was a bit hesitant to relax into the contractions because i knew andrew would n't make it
' he could n't find someone to look after our other child who was at home and had just been put to bed , so he was calling a friend to pick me up and bring me home , but by the time she had got there my waters had broken
' that 's when my midwife recommended i move to a quiet corner and so i moved five metres away and had the baby
' where i was , it was quite secluded even though it was next to the footpath , and i still had my clothes on at that point
the proud parents are still yet to decide on a name for their newborn , who was born almost two weeks ago ' it 's tough now because it 's such a unique situation you want the name to be receptive of how unique the birth was , ' mrs kashelle knox admitted ' i had to ask the friend i was with to find shirts because i knew he was coming - and then i took my shirt off and squatted over that so i could have him on that rather than the grass and dirt
' we collected about six items of clothing that we went home with as well as ambulance blankets
' the proud parents are still yet to decide on a name for their newborn , who was born almost two weeks ago
