the boston marathon bombing trial jury on thursday saw the remains of a pressure - cooker bomb that prosecutors say tsarnaev hurled at police during a gunfight four days after the bombing
jurors also got a chance to see jihadist files recovered from his laptop
the bomb , described as similar to the twin bombs set off at the race , was extracted from a honda in which it embedded itself on a watertown , massachusetts street after tsarnaev and his older brother , tamerlan , detonated it during the gunfight
the pressure cooker was the same type as was used in the bombs that killed three people and injured 264 on april 15 , 2013 , said fbi special agent corcoran , though the pieces found in watertown were more intact than those discovered at the race 's finish line
the boston bombing jury was shown images of a pressure cooker bomb that tsarnaev allegedly threw at police during a shootout in the neighborhood on watertown the pressure cooker bomb in watertown was lodged into a honda and was more intact than the two found at the boston marathon finish line the lid of the device landed two houses away , in a local child 's hockey goal pieces of the bomb shrapnel were found on nearby roofs , lawns , and lodged in the siding of homes up to a block away a piece of shrapnel metal seen above with bbs stuck to it on the street where the tsarnaev 's threw pipe bombs and a pressure - cooker bomb , on the left
on the right , a remnant of the bottom of the watertown pressure - cooker bomb tsarnaev , 21 , could be sentenced to death if he is convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he and tamerlan , 26 , tried to flee boston ' those pieces were typically more fragmented , more cut up , ' corcoran testified in u.s. district court in boston , looking at both the main pot and its lid , which was found halfway down the block from the blast site , in a child - sized soccer goal in a home 's side yard
' this was a better representation of the pressure cooker as a whole
' tsarnaev , 21 , could be sentenced to death if he is convicted of charges that include carrying out the bombing and shooting dead a university police officer three days later as he and tamerlan , 26 , tried to flee boston
the watertown gunfight in the early hours of april 19 , 2013 ended when tsarnaev hopped into a black mercedes and attempted to run over three police officers who were trying to arrest tamerlan
the officers jumped out of the way but tsarnaev ran over his brother , who was briefly caught up in the vehicle 's wheels and dragged
tsarnaev 's lawyers opened the trial early this month by bluntly admitting he carried out the bombing and shooting
their goal is to convince the jury that the plot was driven by tamerlan , with tsarnaev a junior partner in the scheme
proving that could persuade the jury to sentence the younger brother to life in prison without possibility of parole , rather than death

' the bombing killed restaurant manager krystle campbell , 29 , graduate student lingzi lu , 23 , and 8 - year - old martin richard
massachusetts institute of technology police officer collier , 27 , was shot dead three days later

local media have reported that the officer , donohue , was wounded after tamerlan tsarnaev had run out of bullets in the one working firearm the brothers had
' the written investigatory report concerning the laurel street incident is anticipated to be completed within two months , ' ryan said in a statement
a spokeswoman said the report would include ' ballistic information ' but declined to confirm whether it would address how donohue was wounded
the jury earlier in the trial heard testimony about how donohue nearly bled to death , though prosecutors asked no specific questions about who had fired the bullet that wounded him .
