a radical british islamist who stabbed a football fan in the head with a pen and skipped bail to join isis has uploaded a new photograph showing him posing with a notorious german jihadi in syria
abu rahin aziz , 33 , from luton , fled the british before he was handed a 36 - week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in london 's west
since joining isis he has spent much of his time of social media posting provocative message aimed at his largely western audience - including threatening mps at the coming general election and attempting to justify the brutal burning to death of murdered jordanian pilot moath al-kasasbeh
now he uploaded a photograph showing him posing arm in arm with notorious german jihadi denis cuspert , who had been a relatively successful rapper under the name deso dogg before trading in his faux - gangster lifestyle to wage jihad on behalf of the islamic state terrorist group

abu rahin aziz , 33 , who tweets under the name ' abu adbullah britani ' , is an associate of hate cleric anjem choudary who was once a member of radical group ' muslims against crusaders '
although his twitter pages have been repeatedly removed thanks to the anonymous cyber activist group 's # opisis campaign targeting jihadi social media users , abu rahin aziz repeatedly sets up new accounts , which he users to taunt the west
in january abu rahin aziz contemplated on twitter which method he would use to destroy his british passport , confirming his intention not to return to the british
he wrote : ' still deciding to what to do with my british passport , could burn it , flush it down the toilet
' also in january , abu rahin aziz used twitter to incite violence from jihadis who are still living in the west
' muslims in the west given instructions to strike the enemies of islam and muslims within their own countries , ' abu rahin aziz wrote
' wonder who will strike first ? ' could it be british first to be attacked ? they 've attacked us with jets killing scores , plus they have many muslims in prison as war on islam
' maybe sit and wait outside ta offices ? maybe some other interests , maybe an mp

abu rahin aziz 's latest tweets showed him posing with german rapper turned jihadi , denis cuspert
the 39 - year - old , who now calls himself abu talha al-amani , embraced radical islam and travelled to syria to fight with militants before becoming the group 's main propagandist
in february it was revealed that the militant - who has starred in several grisly beheading videos for the islamic state - was being spied on for the fbi by a syria woman he thought was his wife
the jihadist also posted a photograph of himself and dr ali , 38 , on twitter which was captioned : ' this is us breaking our bail conditions being together in british
' ali , a former nhs surgeon , fled the british in 2013 the spy transmitted critical information about the rapper and his isis colleagues before escaping to turkey - where she was arrested and then turned over to the us , according to the german newspaper bild
the paper said german and us intelligence sources confirmed the existence of the operation , fox news reports
the unidentified woman fled syria after her handlers told her it was no longer safe to continue the mission as militants had began to hunt and flush out infiltrators
she is now thought to be in the us
german newspaper bild believe denis cuspert may have been targeted for the operation because of his womanising past
in german he fathered three children by three different women , including one who he dumped just before embarking on his career as an isis poster boy
denis cuspert arrived in syria in 2013 from a so - called german jihadi colony in egypt
german rapper denis cuspert is the best known of the three known rappers to have joined the islamic state radical : known on stage as deso dogg , the wannabe gangster ( left ) traded in his failing career to embrace the extremist group 's radical brand of islam rapping jihadis : emino is no trendsetter - at least three other failed rappers - including german 's deso gogg ( left ) and us 's douglas mcauthur mccain ( right ) have joined isis in recent years last month the us added rapper denis cuspert to its list of ' global terrorists ' - freezing all his assets under us control and prohibiting any transactions with him in the future
the state department said : ' denis cuspert is emblematic of the type of foreign recruit isis seeks for its ranks - â individuals who have engaged in criminal activity in their home countries who then travel to iraq and syria to commit far worse crimes against the people of those countries
' last november , denis cuspert was compared to nazi minister for propaganda joseph goebbels for his ability to appeal to young , disillusioned people in europe while providing an alternative ideology
he spent several years as a major player in the berlin hip hop scene under the name ' deso dogg ' before embracing radical islam
he has been known to oversee the group 's sophisticated media operation and is reportedly using british fighters in an attempt to attract even more of their countrymen to the war - torn region
it is understood he leads a unit of german - speaking isis terrorists operating under the name ' the german brigade of millatu ibrahim ' .
