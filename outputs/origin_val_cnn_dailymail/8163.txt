the jobseeker , who has 59 previous convictions , was jailed for 42 weeks at preston crown court ' if thwarted as you were , or perceived you were , you react in this wholly unacceptable way

' those officers really were not to know just exactly how an unpredictable man was actually going to behave
' was he suddenly going to make a run at them or not ? ' a spokesman for the dwp ( dwp ) said : ' if you are claiming jobseekers allowance the rules are that you have got to be available for work and actively looking for work
' if you do n't do that you could be sanctioned
whether his case is exceptional or not it is almost impossible to say
