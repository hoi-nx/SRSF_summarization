we hope he makes a speedy recovery

she 's about five foot four and she 's skinny
she 's not been in touch but she 's told my workmate she 's mortified and sorry
' mr mackay claims he was lifted up by bouncers , taken out through the fire escape and left on a bench
' i was screaming , i was asking for someone to get me some help
i did n't want to get up
i wanted a paramedic to come and help me
' i remember her still standing there when i was shouting
i did hear her saying ' i heard it snap '
that 's the last i remember - i was just in so much pain
' eventually the bouncers put their arms around me and lifted me up
they just put me on a bench outside the fire exit and left me there
' bar owner mr lawson added : ' we lifted him to a safer part but he declined when we asked him if he wanted us to call an ambulance
his friends just took him
mr mackay says the injury was made worse when he was picked up rather than being left for an ambulance dirty dancing , which starred patrick swayze and jennifer grey , became a huge hit after its release in 1987
