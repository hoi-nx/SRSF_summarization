it was a case that held the nation spellbound almost 40 years ago , puzzling policemen , psychics and even occult experts
now , a three - part drama series will recreate the strange goings - on at a london council house where a family were terrified by a demonic spirit
janet hodgson , who was 11 at the time , was convinced she was possessed by a former resident of the house in green street , enfield , a grumpy old man called bill wilkins who had died there many years before
a three - part drama on sky called the enfield haunting will recreate the strange goings on at a house spall , who plays investigator maurice grossel , comforts cox , who plays janet hodgson , the 11 - year - old girl who was convinced she was possessed by a former resident of the house the council house ( on the right side of this semi-detached ) in green street , enfield , was said to be haunted speaking through her , an eerie voice - which can still be heard on audio tapes today - said : ' just before i died , i went blind and then i had a hemorrhage and i fell asleep and i died in the chair in the corner downstairs
' the case of the enfield also involved levitation , furniture being moved through the air , and flying objects swirling towards witnesses
there were cold breezes , physical assaults , graffiti , water appearing on the floor , and even claims of matches spontaneously bursting into flame
the events - which began in august 1977 - unfolded for more than a year behind the door of the ordinary - looking semi-detached council house
the family became so scared they slept in the same room , with the light on
most of the activity centred on 11 - year - old janet hodgson
she went into violent trances , which were awful to behold
on one occasion , the iron fireplace in her bedroom was ripped from the wall by unseen forces
family members also claim to have seen her levitating - floating across the room
she said : ' i felt used by a force that nobody understands
i really do n't like to think about it too much
i 'm not sure the poltergeist was truly ' evil '
it was almost as if it wanted to be part of our family
' it did n't want to hurt us
it had died there and wanted to be at rest
the only way it could communicate was through me and my sister
' it was an extraordinary case
it 's one of the most recognised cases of paranormal activity in the world
but , for me , it was quite daunting
' i think it really left its mark , the activities , the newspaper attention , the different people in and out of the house
it was n't a normal childhood
' most of the activity centred on 11 - year - old janet hodgson , who was apparently seen floating across the room the disturbing events which included moving furniture unfolded for more than a year behind the door of the ordinary - looking semi-detached council house on a suburban street some of the events were captured on camera , and the images are disturbing
one shows janet hodgson apparently being thrown across the room in the sky drama series called the enfield haunting , janet hodgson is played by cox , 13 , the youngest recipient of the laurence olivier award for her portrayed of matilda wormwood in matilda the musical
in one scene cox shudders at the top of the stairs after being terrified by the spirit
spall , who played the role of winston churchill in king 's speech and peter taylor in the damned united , plays investigator maurice grossel , while juliet stevenson plays his wife betty
spall said : ' i am very pleased to be taking part in the enfield haunting
it is a brilliant script which is full of emotional texture and develops beautifully into a human story
' the house is currently occupied by another family , who do not wish to be identified
the mother says simply : ' i 've got children , they do n't know about it
i do n't want to scare them
' the ghostly story of the infamous case will be recreated by the all - star cast to be screened this spring on sky cynics cast doubts on the events saying it was a hoax
two spr experts caught the children bending spoons themselves , and questioned why no one was allowed in the same room as janet hodgson when she was using her gruff voice , apparently that of bill wilkins
at the time it provoked a national debate and 37 years later , the spooky tale will become the subject of debate once more .
