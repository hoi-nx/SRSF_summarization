surgeon marco moraci , pictured with his wife , who has been suspended by the general medical council a foreign plastic surgeon who left a pensioner scarred for life has been suspended after it emerged there have been 60 complaints about his work
the general medical council has barred marco moraci , who is one of a number of ' fly in fly out ' surgeons who jet into the uk from europe to operate in private hospitals and then return home
marco moraci , who lives in naples with his tv star wife , is understood to have quit working in the uk last year after he failed to compensate richman for a bungled facelift in 2010
mrs richman , 67 , from kenilworth in warwickshire , has been left with scars after suffering from necrosis , a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of skin cells - and was left with open flesh wounds
she was awarded Â£ 43,000 in compensation by a court in birmingham but is unlikely to receive the cash as the surgeon 's insurance company say he did not report the bungle to them
the harley medical group , which organised the Â£ 8,000 surgery , went into administration but is not legally responsible for the surgeons it uses
last month , the general medical council stepped in after it became clear that there may be other victims of marco moraci , after as many as 60 patients are understood to be complaining about their care
he has also been stopped from working as a doctor for 12 months while it is decided if he will face a disciplinary hearing
marco moraci has also worked for the hospital group , who say that his rights to treat patients at their hospitals had been withdrawn
now mrs richman is calling for the government to take action over ' fly in fly out ' foreign doctors who fly into the uk and undertake procedures before returning home
she said : ' he never talked about necrosis at all
he talked about the normal risks but at no point at all did he mention necrosis
i just remember him saying that he would make me happy
' when they took the drains out of my face it hurt so much , i screamed and it started to go purple
it went from a large purple bruise to a huge black scab that had the feel and look of leather
richman who developed necrosis after undergoing a facelift performed by marco moraci , an italian surgeon , who has been suspended by the general medical council mrs richman was awarded Â£ 43,000 in compensation after the botched facelift but has yet to receive any of the money ' surgeons should not be limited to their country but the government should make sure there is a level of accountability through qualifications and insurances
' clinics should also be responsible for the actions of the surgeons they use
' clinical negligence lawyer jeanette whyman , of law firm wright hassall , is now pursuing the case
mrs richman , pictured with her lawyer jeanette whyman , is now calling for ' fly in fly out ' surgeons to be regulated she told the sunday people : ' clinics normally ask the surgeon themselves to be insured
if something goes wrong a patient can not sue the clinic , they have to pursue the surgeon , which is extremely difficult if they are based abroad
' it is really easy money for surgeons as the procedures are more expensive here and they do nât have to pay for the clinics
' but if things go wrong very often it falls back on the nhs to put things right , which begs the question why there is not more regulation
' dr marco moraci refused to comment on the allegations against him when contacted at his naples home .
