a former soldier who claimed to have fought off a vietnamese gang , like karate super-hero bruce lee , has failed to win his claim for post-traumatic stress disorder after a judge ruled that his tales were ' totally incredulous '
the aat were told of the night olsen had been at a bar in hong kong , when he became involved in a fight with a gang of 12 armed with weapons in the 1970s
the queenslander said he was able to take on each of the ' crazed lunatics ... screaming and yelling ' at him as they came with batons that had spiked two - inch balls attached to the ends
he detailed how he was able to escape with an injury to his elbow
mr olsen argued that such events left him with post-traumatic stress disorder and took the matter to the aat for an appeal after it was initially rejected
olsen , a former soldier , who claimed to have fought off a dozen attackers like karate super-hero bruce lee ( pictured ) has failed to win his claim for post-traumatic stress disorder , after a judge ruled that his tales were ' totally incredulous ' ' in relation to the hong kong bar incident , the account mr olsen gave conjured up images of a scene out of a jackie chan or bruce lee ( pictured ) movie , mr olsen playing the role of the super hero , ' tribunal member denovan said on march 4 tribunal member denovan was not reasonably satisfied and consequently knocked back with mr olsen 's claims on march 4
' in relation to the hong kong bar incident , the account mr olsen gave conjured up images of a scene out of a jackie chan or bruce lee movie , mr olsen playing the role of the super hero , ' dr denovan said
' it is totally incredulous
' a number of psychiatrists gave evidence , as dr denovan concluded dr ng 's to be the most reliable
dr ng questioned the legitimacy of the accounts of events provided by mr olsen , saying that the former soldier talks quite boastfully about punching and assaulting people while claiming to have been in fear in vietnamese
dr ng further opined that there is a high chance that mr olsen has an antisocial personality disorder , saying he ' fails to conform to social norms at times , and has gross impulsivity and marked irritability and aggressiveness '
the psychiatrist then stated that ' people with antisocial personality disorder tend to deceive and distort accounts '
dr denovan said there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in mr olsen 's claims , which the digger acknowledged and attributed his earlier accounts of the incidents to his illness
but dr denovan handed down the decision that mr olsen was ' an unreliable witness '
' i have concluded that mr olsen has a sincere belief that his psychiatric illness / s are due to his experiences in vietnamese , however he is an unreliable witness , and he was not exposed to the events the diagnosis of ptsd relies upon , ' dr denovan said
' i therefore find that on balance , mr olsen suffers from generalised anxiety disorder , antisocial personality disorder , and alcohol misuse
