players and managers want to win so much - players will try every trick in the book to try and get over the line and win football matches , ' he told reporters
' sometimes it does n't look nice but we 've all been guilty of it throughout our careers by not always abiding by the rules

chelsea had a very good effort , but it was n't to be for them
' i do n't think he ( jose mourinho ) will be interested in whether it will tarnish his legacy

every single player out there has respect for him as a manager , he 's going to win many more titles and will probably go down as one of the best managers of all time
' i 'm in no position to criticise him or have a go at him
he does it his way and i respect that

ourselves , liverpool not qualifying for the knockout stages , so not so much for chelsea but for our league
you want to see the teams do well and at this moment we 're coming up a bit short , ' he added .
