five muslim women stand tall in a boxing ring , slowly winding strapping around their hands
a spotlight is trained on them and the audience draws close , hanging on their every word
" how can we be truthful if we have to hide out of shame , feel humiliated for feeling , for saying , doing , thinking as we please ? how can that be freedom , how can that be truth ? " performed at southbank centre 's wow -- women of the world festival -- common wealth theatre 's " no guts , no heart , no glory , " tells the true story of muslim female boxers from bradford in the north of sport england , and how they are using the sport to transcend religious and gender barriers
the critically acclaimed show -- in which the women stamp , dance , shout , swear , punch , and even crowd surf -- was partly inspired by ambreen sadiq , a former uk national champion , and one of uk 's first muslim female boxers
her journey to success was n't easy -- as a victim of bullying at the age of 13 she found respite in boxing after being introduced to it by her father and brother
" i got bullied quite a lot growing up , my dad 's pakistani and my mum 's portuguese , " sadiq told cnn
" i got stick from both sides , from white and black people
i felt like i was n't accepted
i used to move schools so many times just to feel accepted
" people would stay stuff about how i looked ... everyone said that 's a boy 's sport , what are you doing that for ? you 're going to look like a man , like a transsexual
" i was bullied from such a young age , i felt like it was never going to stop
boxing helped me to control that anger
" it was a transformative experience for sadiq -- she went from being quiet , having few friends and getting into fights to plucking up courage to start conversations , and thereby build self confidence
" instead of punching someone in the face i 'd punch the bag , " she added
" if anyone came up to me and said anything i could just walk away from it -- whereas before i 'd just straight punch them in the face or something
so it 's helped me a lot with discipline
" it 's sometimes hard to imagine sadiq as a boxer -- her movements are calm and assured , and a kind smile is never far from her lips
" boxing has made me the person i am today , and i 'm so proud of the person i am , " said the 20 - year - old trailblazer , who is now looked up to by girls from all kinds of communities wanting to follow in her footsteps
" i 've had a lot of girls -- not just asian girls -- coming up to me and asking , how do you stop people saying it 's a boy 's sport ? how can you convince your parents to let you box ? " while boxing for many is just a sport -- albeit a violent one -- when it comes to women and muslim participating it can feel more like a cause , with sadiq often finding herself explaining her motivation to girls
" what 's the difference if a boy boxes or if a girl boxes ? when we 're in that ring we look like boxers -- we do n't look like a girl or a boy
" you come into that gym , you come into that show , you come into that ring thinking i 'm a boxer , not that i 'm a girl or i 'm a boy
" the role of nicola adams -- the first ever female boxer to win an olympic gold medal -- has also been key in the fight for acceptance
sadiq tells the story of how several years ago her coach alwyn belcher , who also worked with adams , originally refused to train women -- that is , until he turned up to coach the gb team ( believing they 'd be men ) only to find an enthusiastic bunch of women ready to work
" that 's the day he met nicola adams , " recalls sadiq with a laugh
" he said from that day he thought girls were better boxers -- because they like to listen
" since adams ' success at the olympic games , females boxing once a week increased by 79 % according to a 2013 sport england study , but even the production of " no guts , no heart , no glory " highlighted the barriers women potentially face
cast member and aspiring medical student freyaa ali said there was a girl who had wanted to participate in the show , but was ultimately prevented from doing so by her relatives
" it was n't even the boxing and it was n't even the speech , it was the dancing we do in the ring
i 'm incredibly lucky to be able to do this , and i was just so sad for her
you know there are certain women out there who ca n't do what we 're doing right now
" " i think that 's what makes me even more passionate about doing this -- we want to give them a voice and give them a reason , so they know they can have confidence to do stuff like this
" if women do feel restricted by their religion or gender , freyaa ali urged them to take things step by step
" go for it , just go for it
i think maybe talk to your parents first , and just tell them mum , dad , this is what i want to do , i want to box , i want to dance , i want to act , or whatever she wants to do
" tell them , you know what ? its ok what i 'm doing , i 'm not going to be going out of my boundaries and doing bad things , i 'm going to stick to my limits and stick to my religion , it 's not harming anyone
" my parents would say , if you 're happy , we 're happy
i think anyone 's parents would say that would n't they ? " the first step is trying it and opening that door
once you can open it an inch you can open it a mile
