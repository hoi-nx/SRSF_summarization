a british internet troll has got more than he bargained for after he was slapped with Â£ 100,000 in libel damages and costs after abusing a us lawyer on google
page , 20 , from telford , reaped a legal whirlwind when he posted a wounding review on colorado - based timothy bussey 's google maps profile
the anonymous post described the us lawyer as ' a scumbag ' and accused him paying for his firm 's positive reviews on the web
punishment for troll : jason ' jay ' page , 20 , from telford , has been hit with Â£ 100,000 in libel damages and costs after abusing us lawyer timothy bussey on google mr timothy bussey was left fuming by the anonymous post , which seemed to be from a dissatisfied client and stated to the world that ' he loses 80 % of his cases '
the post remained live on the web for about a year and mr timothy bussey and his firm , the bussey law firm , suffered severe damage to their reputations
mr timothy bussey was not willing to let the matter rest and , at huge expense , employed a californian law firm to subpoena google 's records to find out who was responsible
that led him to the door of mr page , aged in his 20s , who was living with his parents in sutton hill , telford , and ended up on the receiving end of a full - scale high court libel case
timothy bussey 's law practice in colorado springs : jason page was ordered to pay damages after leaving abuse on the lawyer 's google maps profile he insisted that he bore no responsibility for the post and that his google account must have been hacked by someone else
he said that a hacker might have been seeking revenge for something he had done as a ' moderator ' of the www.reddit.com website
however , judge sir david eady said hacking into mr page 's account would have been challenging , with the perpetrator needing to bypass passwords and sophisticated security
there was no indication that anyone held a grudge against him and the judge described the hacking explanation as ' extremely improbable '
the ' overwhelming probability ' was that that mr page had either authored the post himself or authorised it
mr page was ordered by the court to pay Â£ 50,000 damages , along with mr timothy bussey 's legal costs , of which he must pay Â£ 50,000 on account the judge added : ' why mr page should himself choose to attack mr timothy bussey and his firm is unclear , but the most likely explanation would appear to be a purely financial one '
taking into account the ' grapevine effect ' on the internet , the judge had no doubt that the post had caused serious damage to mr timothy bussey and his firm 's good name
he ordered mr page to pay Â£ 50,000 damages , along with mr timothy bussey 's legal costs
he must pay Â£ 50,000 of those on account , pending final assessment of the costs bill
mr timothy bussey 's solicitor , coggan , said later : ' this is a great result for our clients
' their reputations have at last been vindicated following this calculated attack through the medium of an online review site ' he said that mr page 's post may well have been ' solicited ' by others and mr timothy bussey would continue his legal fight on both sides of the atlantic to find out who may have been responsible
mr richmond - coggan added : ' we hope that this decision sends a message that fake negative reviews have a real impact on real people and those who post them can and will be held accountable
