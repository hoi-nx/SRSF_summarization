' i spoke to president andrea agnelli , directors pavel nedved , beppe marotta and fabio paratici , so they all agree
the club does nât need the money
' at this moment the situation at juventus is ideal for pogba
we would only leave if a situation emerged that was favourable for all concerned
' he is wanted by seven clubs and that is certain , because they all told me so
the ones that can afford him are real madrid , barcelona , psg , bayern munich , man united , man city and chelsea
' if i just whistled , i âd sell pogba tomorrow to psg or city in a heartbeat
but pogba did not tell me to find him another club
' what are his chances of staying ? as of today it âs 99 per cent
juventus agree with our approach , which is that they will only sell if pogba asks to leave and there âs a suitable offer
of course , it could become one per cent , it depends on the market
