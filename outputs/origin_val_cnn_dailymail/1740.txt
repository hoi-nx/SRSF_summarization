' weight loss scams are described by the australian competition and consumer commission 's scam watch as those that ' promise weight loss for little or no effort '
' the scam may involve an unusual or restrictive diet , " revolutionary " exercise or fat - busting devices , or products such as pills , patches , or creams , ' the website said
' often , attractive people or celebrities are used to sell the products
these may be people with a different body shape and metabolism to you and who use the product in conjunction with an exercise regime and strict diet
' at best fad diets and products might result in a temporary weight loss in the short term and can be dangerous if followed over a longer period
