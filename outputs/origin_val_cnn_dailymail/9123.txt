when robin rinaldi revealed the intimate details of her 5:2 marriage she drew gasps from married couples and staunch monogamists
for the author of the wild oats project described how , for a year , she would spend weekdays sleeping with strangers and weekends with her husband of 17 years , scott
at the time , the dramatic move was a bid to save their relationship after scott had a vasectomy , but now he 's spoken out to say that he never wanted to see other people
' it was n't something i wanted to do , ' the brewer and wine - maker told the times
' i did n't like the idea of opening up our marriage
but if i did n't do it , i felt we were heading for divorce , so i thought why not take the chance and maybe we can come out the other side ? ' his premonition was correct a ultimately the decision led to the end of their marriage and robin rinaldi getting together with one of her lovers
scott says that while he understood his wife 's desire to experience sexual relationships with other people - he himself had enjoyed a promiscuous youth - he had always felt it might spell trouble for their marriage
and it seems the question of whether or not to have children had always been an issue for the couple with scott being firmly against the idea
irretrievable : after robin rinaldi 's year of uninhibited encounters , she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with mansfield , and the two now have different partners however , he defends himself in the new interview , revealing that he had always been honest with robin rinaldi about his desires and intentions
' is it cruel to not change your mind about something you believe in ? ' he said of fatherhood , ' i do n't think robin rinaldi ever thought i was being cruel
at any point she could have left me and found somebody else to have a child with or i could have left her and found somebody who was n't going to bother me about it
' during the course of the year - long experiment he revealed that he dated a handful of women , however , he only slept with one of them
account : robin rinaldi describes every step of the ' project ' in intimate detail in her newly - released book , the wild oats project they had a six month relationship before he eventually called it off
and scott says it was flattering to get attention from other women
he said : ' i enjoyed the feeling of being attracted to other women and getting good feedback
i had a couple of women who said to me : ' i ca n't believe your wife would risk losing you , you 're such an awesome guy , ' so when you hear that , you know , it makes you feel pretty good
' today he 's in a long term relationship with his girlfriend renee alexander , who he lives with and the former couple consider themselves at peace
in robin rinaldi 's book she declares , ' i refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers
' but during her year of promiscuity in 2008 , she made up for lost time , sleeping with ten men and two women
appearing on itv 's this morning yesterday , robin rinaldi opened up about her unorthodox decision , which she says was triggered by her husband 's vasectomy
' i would say before the year i was in a somewhat inhibited but satisfied , normal loving relationship
' but when i got into my early 40s my husband got a vasectomy and i knew the discussion of having a baby was over , which kick - started this experience
' ' i looked forward to my death bed and thought
" what will i have ? " i wo nât have children and grandchildren
will i at least have lived fully ? " ' ' if i could nât have one i wanted the other , ' she explained
' like a lot of women at that age i was hitting my confidence and sexual peak and suddenly realised very dramatically that i was nât going to have children
it was the perfect storm
' i have had lots of people telling me i should have travelled the world , tried painting classes or cooking â but i already know how to cook ! ' ' wild oats ' : robin rinaldi , 50 , negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years , which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship she also said having ' very little sexual variety ' in her youth was a motivating factor , as the fact that she was living in san francisco , which she described as ' a very liberal city '
' i was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation , ' she said
' so i thought ok while we do that i need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same
' under the terms of her new deal , robin rinaldi took out an apartment , where she lived from monday to friday and would bed her conquests
but over the weekend she would go back to mansfield , and the two would live as a married couple , without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart
' the ground rules were safe sex , not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances , ' she explained
' but at the end of the year , we each broke two rules
' to find willing participants in her project robin rinaldi decided not to pick up men at bars , but to be more strategic in her search
' i was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had i picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand , ' she explains
so i felt like going about it in a more clear - headed , conscious way
' robin rinaldi posted an online ad , entitled good girl seeks experience
in the post , she wrote : ' i 'm a 44 - year - old professional , educated , attractive woman in an open marriage , seeking single men age 35 - 50 to help me explore my sexuality
' ' i said i wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks
i explained that if it led to sex then great , but that i could nât get seriously involved or see them more than a few times
' the next day , robin rinaldi had 23 offers
so would she advise it ? â not if you want to stay married , ' she told this morning hosts philip schofield and amanda holden
' read my book instead and have an armchair adventure
' ' i was well aware it would be very risky â but i did nât think we had that much to lose
' this 5:2 idea of weekends together and weekdays apart was to put a bit of distance between us to see each other in a new light and add some sparkle
' that happened at first , ' she said , but admitted their sexual exploits ended up pushing them apart
' it was hard to put it all back in the box , ' she explained
robino said having ' very little sexual variety ' in her youth was a motivating factor , as the fact that she was living in san francisco , which she described as ' a very liberal city ' appearing on itv 's this morning robin rinaldi , now 50 , opened up about her unorthodox lifestyle robin rinaldi , who made the life - changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008 , has written a book about her exploits called the wild oats project

recounting her exploits , robin rinaldi described her first encounter with a 40 - year - old lawyer , whom she bedded in her apartment on the second date : ' we stumbled to the bed , where he turned me onto my hands and knees and took me from behind
' we had intercourse twice and , after he left , i felt satiated
' she later moved on to much younger men , and described texting her husband goodnight from a las vegas hotel room moments after a 23 - year - old paramour left the room
two of her 12 encounters were with women , one of which was a threesome
describing another encounter , she writes explicitly about taking a new - found pleasure in fellatio

attempts to rekindle their marriage after the year failed - and robin rinaldi began sleeping with one of the men from the past year , whom she refers to by a pseudonym
she wrote : ' the turning point was hearing from alden
he sent me an e-mail , out of the blue , several months after the project had come to an end
' before long , we were having sex again
being with him was exquisite
after reconnecting with alden and falling deeply in love with him , there was no going back
' scott was even happy with his ex-wife writing the book , detailing every aspect of their sex lives and her exploits with other men
speaking to the daily beast about how he responded to the book , she said : ' his response was , " you have to write it
if you write it well , it wo nât really be about us , it will be about lots of marriages
" ' robin rinaldi has found love again with one of the lovers she met on her year of sexual freedom
