a man accused of murdering a string of women and dumping their bodies may have killed up to 180 people - escaping detection because the police force turned a blind eye to his crimes because his victims were mainly drug addicts and prostitutes , a documentary claims
lonnie franklin jr - dubbed the lonnie franklin jr because he allegedly had a break between committing multiple murders - is due to go on trial later this year accused of sexually assaulting , murdering and then dumping the bodies of 10 women across la over two decades
but a new documentary by uk filmmaker broomfield suggests franklin was able to go on killing for so long , and possibly target dozens more victims , because of a police ' blindness ' to his victims - which he likes to a ' genocide happening and nobody was talking about it
' mr broomfield claims had the police properly investigated the murders and disappearances of mostly black , female prostitutes and drug addicts lives could have been saved
he said : ' people did n't know someone was hunting for them
bodies of the women were found dumped in alleyways wrapped in carpets or stuffed into rubbish bins
however a police search of his home found pictures and videos of 180 women who could all be possible victims
it is feared some may have been dumped in landfill because of franklin 's job as a bin man
mr broomfield said during the time when the crimes were committed , little attention was paid to the disappearance of around 200 women by the police or the media
' i thought it was just incredible in the middle of la which is one of the wealthiest cities in the world , within 15 minutes of the hollywood sign over 200 women had disappeared in a 25 year period , ' he said
he told the sun : ' it was almost like a genocide happening and nobody was talking about it
' in his documentary tales of the lonnie franklin jr , mr broomfield claimed police did n't warn people there was a killer lurking in the neighbourhood or do anything to alert people living in nearby hollywood because the victims were often seen as more of a ' nuisance
' he said franklin , a father - of - two , was able to go on killing so long because he targeted vulnerable black women , many of whom had become crack and cocaine addicts in the 1980s
the suspected victims of the lonnie franklin jr : enietra washington ( left ) survived an attempted murder and was found in 1988 , alicia alexander ( centre ) was found dead in an alley in september 1988 , henrietta wright ( right ) died in august 1986 in an alleyway valerie mccorvey ( left ) was found dead in 2003 , lachrica jefferson ( centre ) in january 1988 and bernita sparks ( right ) was found dead and dumped in an alleyway in april 1987 mary lowe ( left ) was found in november 1987 - just a few months before barbara ware ( right ) was found princess berthomieux ( left ) was discovered in an alley in march 2002 , and debra jackson ( right ) in 1995 mr broomfield added : ' they were just seen as disposable people
' the police had this term , nhi , which meant no human involved , which they used to call in murders of prostitutes by gang members
they did nât take it seriously , they did nât seek evidence
they would often not even use the proper name of the prostitute , just call it in as a â jane doe
â ' they just did n't take it seriously
most of the women were prostitutes and drug addicts and i do n't think it helped that the people were black
' mr broomfield said it could not have been an ' accident ' that 200 people disappeared or were murdered in the same small area in a 25 year period
he said had the murders been taking place in somewhere like the wealthy district of beverley hills then the area would have been closed down , police presence increased and press coverage of the incident
a search of franklin 's mint green la home found up to 180 pictures of women , many of whom are missing giving one comparison , he said the disappearance of dozens of women was treated very differently from a case in 1988 where a gang had shot students in westwood - causing the whole city to be shut down
the documentary maker said he thinks some of the murders could have been avoided had police taken the disappearances and killings more seriously
he added : ' i definitely think women 's lives could have been saved
' if police had told the public in 1987 when they knew there was a serial killer who had already killed five victims , if they had told the community then i think things could have been very different and a lot of lives saved
franklin was arrested in 2010 after dna evidence was found which appeared to connect the victims stills from the documentary show franklin after he was arrested in july 2010 for the 10 murders mr broomfield , pictured right interviewing a friend of franklin 's , said the documentary took a year and a half pam brooks was interviewed by broomfield , giving an insight into life in la ' people did n't know someone was hunting for them
' mr broomfield said had people been aware there was a danger they would have been more cautious about accepting lifts from people , because some of the victims were not prostitutes or drug addicts but simply those who were waiting for buses late at night
mr broomfield , who spoke to relatives and friends of franklin to produce the documentary , claims when his son christopher told him officers were almost ' grateful ' that the alleged lonnie franklin jr had rid the streets of some of the ' problem ' people they had been dealing with on an almost daily basis
he added that in the one - and - a - half years it took to make the documentary , franklin was described as a ' loving father ' and almost a robin hood figure , who would fix people 's cars and get cheap washing machines if they needed them
earlier this month a mother - of - two , known only by the name ' mo ' , revealed she may have been one of franklin 's intended victims as it emerged that her photo was one of the collection found in his home
broomfield ( left ) claims in the documentary that alleged killer franklin ( right ) continued with his killing spree for so long because police turned a blind eye to his victims , who were largely black drug addicts ' mo ' claimed she had been forced to pose for a naked picture for franklin , her then next door neighbour , after the pair went for a drive in his van in 2006
she claimed that franklin had showed her other pictures of women , some of which were in strange poses who she thought could have been dead , and then asked her to pose naked
she claims she agreed to the picture after she noticed a gun and knife in his van
the photo appeared in a collection of images found by the police when franklin was arrested in 2010
mo told abc7 she believed she could have been killed by franklin , now 62
the alleged killer earned the nickname the lonnie franklin jr after he allegedly committed murders between 1985 and 1988 , taking a 13 year break before he is believed to have resumed in crime spree in 2002
mo said she was stunned when she saw her photo on a documentary about her former neighbor franklin , dubbed the lonnie franklin jr , is to go on trial for 10 murders and one attempted murder in june police arrested franklin in july 2010 after his dna was connected to more than a dozen crime scenes
they had linked the crimes , but did not have a suspect until a crime lab computer traced the sample to one of franklin 's family members
police were able to get samples by using an officer to pose as a busboy at a pizza restaurant , and extract dna from dishes and cutlery used by franklin
+ he will go on trial in june , accused of 10 murders and one attempted murder
mr broomfield said franklin had been popular in the area , according to locals
but they claimed he was often obsessed with crack addicts - becoming popular with women in the 1980s during the crack epidemic which swept la
tales of the lonnie franklin jr will air in the uk on sky atlantic on monday 30 at 9pm , and will be shown in the us after that date on hbo .
