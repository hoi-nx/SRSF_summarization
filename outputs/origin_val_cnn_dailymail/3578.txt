an asteroid so large it has the potential to cause widespread devastation is on its way towards earth
but despite being called a â pha â ( pha ) by nasa , experts are telling people not to be worried
the huge rock , called 2014 asteroid 2014 yb35 , will sail past the planet tomorrow morning at a distance so large it it is 11.7 times further than the distance between earth and the moon
it was discovered by the catalina sky survey at the university of arizona
the asteroid is estimated to be 1,640ft - wider ( 500 metres ) which would be large enough to cause devastation - but it will not hit earth and while this event will occur without incident , the experts added it is a reminder of how many dangerous space rocks there are in our planet âs vicinity
the asteroid is estimated to be about 1,640ft ( 500 metres ) wide which , if it hit earth , would be large enough to cause widespread devastation - although there is no chance of this happening
however , it is estimated that there are about 25,000 near - earth objects ( neos ) larger than 460ft ( 140 metres ) , bodies that come close to earth but do n't necessarily hit our planet
and there are also an estimated 1,000 neos larger than 3,280ft ( one kilometre ) , highlighting the need to keep track of these space rocks
on average , earth is hit by a football pitch - sized rock every 5,000 years , and a civilisation - ending asteroid every one million years , according to nasa 's neos
last year , the privately - funded b612 foundation discovered that earth is up to 10 times more likely to be hit than previously thought
while the majority of the impacts occur either high up in the atmosphere , or in unpopulated areas including the atlantic and pacific oceans , the danger was still ever - present
the findings were based on information released from the nuclear-test-ban treaty organisation
this operates a network of sensors that monitor earth around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations
but what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions , but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale
between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on earth ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons - all caused by asteroid impacts
relative to earth , asteroid 2014 asteroid 2014 yb35 is travelling at 23,000 mph ( 37,000 km / h ) , and its closest approach tomorrow will be 2,779,956 miles ( 4,473,907km )
it was first discovered by the catalina sky survey at the university of arizona in december 2014 , and will make an even closer , but still safe , approach in 2033 - 2,069,166 miles ( 3,330,000km )
nasa lists 2014 asteroid 2014 yb35 as a â pha â ( pha ) but , as yet , there is no chance of an impact scheduled for any point in future
â this â potential â to make close earth approaches does not mean a pha will impact the earth , â said nasa
â it only means there is a possibility for such a threat
' by monitoring these phas and updating their orbits as new observations become available , we can better predict the close - approach statistics and thus their earth - impact threat
â but speaking to the express , dr bill napier , professor of astronomy at the university of buckinghamshire , warned there was a â very real risk â of an object hitting earth at some point in the future
â with something like asteroid 2014 yb35 , we are looking at a scale of global destruction , something that would pose a risk to the continuation of the planet , â he said
â these events are however very rare , it is the smaller yet still very damaging impacts which are a very real threat
â shown is the path of asteroid 2014 asteroid 2014 yb35 tomorrow
a ; though it looks like it will come extremely close to earth , it will actually pass very safely at a distance of 0.03 au
a single au - au - is the distance from earth to the sun credit : nasa last year experts warned that we must do more to track asteroids , as one could cause widespread damage to the planet
most notably , in february 2013 , hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of chelyabinsk in russia - the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century in the past year , a host of famous science names have joined forces to warn the world of the threat posed to earth by asteroids
in december , more than 100 leading scientists and astronauts from dr brian may to chris hadfield signed a declaration asking for increased action to tackle objects that could end life on earth
the experts called for a 100-fold increase in the detection and monitoring of so - called near earth objects ( neos )
it is estimated that of the million or so asteroids that could cause major damage on earth , we are aware of only about 10,000 - or one per cent
this means that at any moment an asteroid could enter the atmosphere and cause widespread destruction , without any prior knowledge
the possibility of this scenario has been repeatedly hinted at recently by meteorites and fireballs spotted in the sky
yesterday nasa released details of its asteroid redirect mission ( illustrated ) , which will see astronauts study an asteroid in space next decade
the mission is estimated to cost about Â£ 840 million ( $ 1.25 billion ) , not including launch costs , and is targeted for liftoff in december 2020 most notably , in february 2013 hundreds of people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of chelyabinsk in russia , the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century
and in 1908 , a comet exploded over the upper atmosphere in the sparse region of tunguska , siberia , devastating an area about the size of a major metropolitan region â 800 square miles ( 2,000 square km )
â the more we learn about asteroid impacts , the clearer it becomes that the human race has been living on borrowed time , â dr brian may said in a statement in december
â we are currently aware of less than one per cent of objects comparable to the one that impacted at tunguska , and nobody knows when the next big one will hit
â it takes just one
