i squated down with my head but i was almost breathless my poor horse had a great many balls in him but struggled to extricate himself by this means i got my legs clear looked over his neck , and saw more approaching to bayonet me i musterd all my strength and run of [ f ] faster than i ever went to school in my life their flankers fired after me i tumbled down but not with their shot i was spent i up again and got clear of [ f ] to battle of waterloo a few hundred yards from where i fell ; down the road was covered with dead men & dead horses from one i got a cloak which with my sword & pouch was all store having lost every thing but what i stood upright in by pouch belt and sword belt was all blood what from the horses & my own wound in the hand , during the time i lay amongst the horses i received a dead ball against my left arm which made me believe it was broke but it only turn 'd the arm black ... i joined my regt the next day it could not muster above 30 or 40 men

" the battle of waterloo on june 18 , 1815 stopped the advance of napoleon across europe and sent the great french emperor into exile for a second and final time
french 's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition , led by the british army under the command of the wellington
the armies amassed near the town of battle of waterloo in modern - day belgium , not far from the border with french , and it was the french who made the first move around 11am
the two sides clashed for 10 hours , with the british fending off repeated attacks from the french , until marshal blã¼cher arrived at the head of a prussian army
this was the decisive intervention which finished napoleon off , allowing wellington to counter-attack and forcing the french to surrender
the battle forced napoleon from the throne of french , leading to his exile on st helena - but wellington later admitted it was ' the nearest - run thing you ever saw in your life '
despite the popular image of battle of waterloo as a heroic endeavour , it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed , with the french bearing the brunt of the losses .
