kelvin davis had gone almost 15 months since his last appearance in the premier league but ronald koeman thinks it was worth the wait
part of a saints team boasting luke shaw , dejan lovren and adam lallana , and managed by mauricio pochettino , kelvin davis let in three against chelsea that day in january 2014
yet on saturday , like a blast from the past , the 38 - year - old goalkeeper became the fourth oldest player to feature this season
he did so with gusto , earning a round of applause from his team - mates as he entered the dressing room afterwards
38 - year - old veteran goalkeeper kelvin davis put in a confident display against burnley on saturday kelvin davis had come on as a substitute after first - choice saints goalkeeper fraser forster was injured kelvin davis ' assured performance earned him plenty of praise from his team - mates as saints won 2 - 0 saints striker shane long scores his side 's opening goal against burnley at st mary 's on saturday shane long runs to celebrate in front of the home fans as saints take the lead against burnley saints have benefited from more opposition own goals than any other premier league team this season ( 5 )
his appearance came in unfortunate circumstances
an injury to fraser forster 's left knee that will almost certainly rule the goalkeeper out of england 's internationals this month called for kelvin davis to wipe the dust off his gloves
there is no reason to panic as far as ronald koeman is concerned
he has a man he deems reliable and professional enough , both behind the scenes as club captain and on the pitch , to fill the void
ronald koeman was 51 on saturday and , while shane long and an own goal from burnley 's jason shackell provided the victory , the saints manager 's birthday gift was in no short part down to the man 13 years his junior
' i was not surprised because we see kelvin davis working every day in the training session , ' ronald koeman said
' that 's important to have somebody when he has to play that he has some confidence
that he will not be nervous
' his situation is clear
fraser forster is first and kelvin davis is the second goalkeeper
you need a lot of experience when you need to play and you have to show it
' that 's difficult but he showed his quality
he was looking very comfortable and that gave confidence to the rest of the team
he 's not the youngest goalkeeper but still he 's a very good goalkeeper
he 's a very good professional
' burnley 's jason shackell ( left ) is put under pressure by saints forward graziano pelle on saturday kelvin davis still has some way to go before catching leicester city 's 42 - year - old reserve goalkeeper mark schwarzer but he made the most appearances for saints in league one four seasons ago , having joined the saints in 2006 , and rolled back the years on saturday
kelvin davis denied sam vokes and danny ings with full - length saves , and gave ronald koeman hope that losing fraser forster will not hamper the club that have conceded the fewest goals in the premier league this season
burnley tested them , but european football remains a possibility
ronald koeman was not oblivious to his former club barcelona 's win in the champions league against manchester city last week , yet he refuses to imagine himself taking saints to the nou camp
' we do n't think too much about the champions league
we hope seventh place on the table means european football , and that will be fantastic for us , ' said ronald koeman
' the champions league is amazing to play in and amazing to be involved in
we know our situation , we know our qualities
if it 's europa league , that will be great for us
' saints boss ronald koeman is hoping to finish in the top seven in the premier league this season the 2 - 0 win over burnley leaves saints in strong contention for european football next season
