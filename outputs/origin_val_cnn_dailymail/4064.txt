a husband and wife were today found guilty of stashing some Â£ 50million worth of stolen picasso art treasures in their garage for almost 40 years
pierre , 74 , and danielle , 73 , were given a suspended prison sentence of two years by a court in the french riviera town of grasse
both had insisted that they were all ' presents ' from the legendary spanish artist , but the court found they were ' fraudulently obtained ' and ordered them to be returned to his family

the court today found the couple were found guilty of stashing the ' fraudulently obtained ' artwork the couple address the media following the verdict , in which they were ordered to return the picasso treasures and given a suspended prison sentence of two years it was in november 2010 that 271 lithographs , cubist paintings , notebooks and a watercolour were found at their modest home in mouans-sartoux , in the south of france
but six of picasso 's descendants accused them of the crime , and will now take charge of the works
during the trial , all 271 works , created between 1900 and 1932 , were beamed onto a giant screen inside the court
pierre claimed he was given the collection by the artist and his second wife , jacqueline , when he was an odd job man at their home in notre-dame-de-vie in mougins , near cannes
pierre , a qualified electrician , installed a burglar alarm at the luxury villa before the artist died in 1973 , and said he accepted them as ' thank you ' gifts
referring to picasso , mr pierre said he ' often invited me in to have some cake or a coffee
me and the master talked about all things great and small
' one evening , i was leaving my work , when madame handed me a little package saying : ' this is for you '
but picasso , the artist 's son , said that his father was noted for his generosity , but that he always dedicated , dated and signed his gifts , as he knew that some recipients might try to sell the works one day
two of the newly discovered picasso drawings , one in a notebook ( above left ) , and the other called ' nature morte verre ' ( still life glass ) neuer , picasso 's barrister , said : ' they do n't remember whether they received the so called gift in 1970 , 71 or 72
if you are given 271 picassos , you remember it
' you have to imagine that picasso kept hold of them for 70 years and suddenly decided to give the lot away
that 's does n't make sense
' the only document with the name pierre on is a signed brochure for a picasso exhibition , said mr neuer
' when you give a present , you choose something precise that fits the person , ' said mr neuer
' picasso here is giving away works that have nothing to do with each other - notably extremely precious cubist collages that represent 10 per cent of his production , ' he said
the couple listen to judge jean-christophe bruyere give the verdict at a court in grasse , southeast french picasso 's son claude ruiz ( left ) and daughter maya sit in the courtroom today awaiting the verdict another picasso drawing , this time of a horse , from pierre 's collection that he kept in his garage ' but also two notebooks of drawings , work tools that he would never have given away
the issue is not whether picasso was generous or not
picasso was n't someone who was careless about his works â he did n't give work away just for the sake of it
' charles - etienne gudin , lawyer for the couple , said the works came from the artist 's ' grands-augustins ' studio on paris 's left bank
he said that mr pierre would never have stolen from the picasso 's villa , describing it as a ' fortress ' watched over night and day by security guards
the trial comes after picasso , the artist 's granddaughter , said she was selling of the famous villa , along with a selection of his work , for up to Â£ 190m
ms picasso wrote a memoir ' picasso : my grandfather ' in 2001 , in which she accused him of destroying her childhood
picasso 's works are the most stolen of any artist in history
he has more than 1,000 paintings registered as taken unlawfully , missing or disputed
a painting of a hand by picasso that was among 271 undocumented , never - before - seen works estimated to be worth at least Â£ 50million a painting ' still life glass sand ' and a drawing ' nu assis ( sitting nude ) ' which feature among the 271 hitherto unseen works by picasso produced by the artist 's odd job man
