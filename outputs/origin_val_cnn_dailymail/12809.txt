moscow ever since putin came to power , there have been killings of politicians , of human rights activists , of journalists
boris nemtsov , one of russians 's most prominent opposition figures , is only the latest victim
the key thing all these crimes have in common is that none of them get properly resolved
of course , the kremlin will issue condemnation and condolences , as it has done over the assassination of boris nemtsov
but the killers and the people who ordered the killings do n't usually end up facing justice -- and if you are an opposition politician in russians , or a human rights activist , or a journalist , you will know this
if the dangers were n't clear enough , the circumstances of the most recent killing are a stark reminder
it was late friday night
boris nemtsov and his girlfriend anna duritskaya , a ukrainian model , had eaten dinner at plush restaurant on red square
afterwards , despite the chilly weather , they decided to walk back to his apartment , perhaps to take in the stunning views
the kremlin looks spectacular at night
it was on this short journey , in the heart of moscow , that the gunman struck , leaving boris nemtsov dead within sight of the red kremlin walls -- walls which , by the way , bristle with security cameras
in the days since , thousands have made pilgrimage to the place where the outspoken putin critic was shot to pay their respects , leaving a mountain of flowers and personal messages
an opposition rally on sunday , which boris nemtsov was meant to lead , was canceled and replaced with a mourning march past the crime scene
it was the biggest pro-opposition rally in the russians capital for years
but few who took part could have missed the symbolism , the real message the killers -- whoever they are -- sent by gunning down such a prominent kremlin critic in the shadow of its towering walls
it 's this : if you oppose the kremlin , if you criticize its power , if you stand for greater democracy and reform , as boris nemtsov did , this could happen to you too
it 's hard to predict what impact this message will have
" yet another terrible page has been turned in the history we all share , " wrote mikhail khodorkovsky , the once - jailed oligarch - turned kremlin critic now in exile
" what the next page holds is up to each and every one of us , " he said , commenting on the death of boris nemtsov
the statement was issued under the banner " we are not afraid "
but many russians i 've spoken to since the killing are , in fact , very afraid
and while the hope among opposition activists is that boris nemtsov 's killing may at least invigorate their ranks , one very real possibility is that it will do the exact opposite : further silence an already very quiet minority opposed to the rule of putin .
