an armed robbery of an 18 - wheeler truck transporting bars of gold from florida to massachusetts was most likely an inside job , according to police
the $ 4.8 million gold heist by three armed robbers unfolded after one of the two armed guards said that he felt sick and prompted the driver to pull over
but wilson county sheriff calvin woodard jr. said wednesday that different stories have emerged about the trip from bridgewater , massachusetts on interstate 95
however , in an earlier description the guards , employed by miami - based company , transvalue said a mechanical issue had caused the driver to stop
the guards said that after the vehicle stopped they were approached by three armed men driving a white van who ordered them to lie on the ground
they then tied their hands behind their backs and marched them into nearby woods before taking 275lbs of gold
woodward told reporters that these differing accounts have led to further investigations
' there is suspicion at this time that this could be an inside job due to the circumstances of the robbery , ' a wilson county sheriff 's office detective wrote in a search warrant obtained by abc
' the fact that the truck was robbed immediately upon it pulling over at an unannounced stop is suspicious in and of itself , ' the document added
