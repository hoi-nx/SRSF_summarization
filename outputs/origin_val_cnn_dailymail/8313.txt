from a sawn - off shotgun to a catapult and crossbow , these are the previously unseen weapons of the infamous gangsters ronnie and reggie
the remarkable collection , which also includes memorabilia belonging to the pair including reading glasses , a comb and a pen - set , has been revealed in full for the first time
it is owned by jones - who runs a museum in a converted jail in the forest of dean , gloucestershire â and gives a fascinating insight into the lives of the east end mobsters
mr jones , 53 , was left all of the items by reggie after he struck up a friendship with him when visiting him in prison
' the items have been photographed comprehensively for the first time by renowned photographer peter dazeley , ahead of the release of a film about the reggie which will star actor tom hardy and is due to be released later this year
mr peter dazeley , from london , said : ' the brothers were among the last prisoners to be held in the tower of london in 1952 , for failing to report for national service
' they were involved in armed robberies , arson , protection rackets , assaults and the murders of george cornell in the blind beggar pub in whitechapel and jack ' the hat ' mcvitie
' they were arrested on may 9 , 1968 , and convicted of the murders at the old bailey in 1969 , by the efforts of a squad of detectives led by detective superintendent leonard ' nipper ' read of the yard
' about 60 plain - clothed policemen kept a 24 - hour watch on the jury throughout the trial , following them home from court and even into public houses
' the brothers were sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 30 years for the murders , the longest sentences ever passed at the old bailey
' their memorabilia is from the private collection of jones , of the littledean , and shows objects from their life of crime and their time at her majesty 's pleasure
' ronnie and reggie ( pictured ) were practically born into a life of crime and grew up in bethnal green , east london
the mobsters quickly certified themselves as the most ' notorious ' brothers in the east end gangland the private collection has been photographed in full for the first time

' pictured : ronnie 's pen - set experts said the collection of weaponry and personal items shows the two different sides of the reggie
pictured : ronnie 's draughts set is one of the items which has been photographed by londoner peter dazeley a hair comb belonging to one of the brothers , who have both since died , is also part of the private collection mr peter dazeley said the memorabilia showed the different sides to the reggie , who have now both died
he said : ' the low level of weaponry is extraordinary by today 's standards
there 's a pellet gun , crossbow and what looks like a child 's catapult
' some of the items are somewhat more serious like reggie 's bayonet and knife , but then there is also his artist 's paint set
' these really are the personal effects of the twins
amongst ronnie 's objects there is his cigarette case , comb and draught set as well as a sawn - off shotgun
' and then again showing another side there 's his pen and his infamous glasses
' also in a letter from their mother to a friend discussing her sons , she mentions that they ' are the most understanding and kindest of people one could meet and they have never hurt anyone only their own kind
' the twins were practically born into a life of crime and grew up in bethnal green , east london
during adulthood , the pair quickly certified themselves as the most ' notorious ' brothers in the east end gangland
ronnie was eventually certified insane and lived the remainder of his life in broadmoor hospital , where he died on march 17 , 1995 , of a heart attack at the age of 61
reggie was freed on compassionate grounds with inoperable cancer on august 26 , 2000 , when he was almost 67 , and died in his sleep on october 1 , 2000
reggie 's paint set ( left ) and a cosh beloging to ronnie ( right ) have also been revealed in the photograph project ronnie 's cosh - a thick , heavy bar used as a weapon - is part of the remarkable weaponry in the collection the east end mobsters were known as the most ' notorious ' gangsters in london

pictured : ronnie 's cigarette case mr jones , curator of littledean museum in the forest of dean , said he was given the items by reggie and his family
he told mailonline : ' i used to visit reggie in prison before he died and i âve had them for a number of years
they were gifted to me after a visit to see him at maidstone prison
' i became friendly with him and he basically donated quite a number of items for display at what we call the " crime through time " collection at littledean
' mr jones said the pair became friendly after reggie contacted him with a view to donating some of his items
he said : ' he contacted me with a view to introducing himself and a number of other notorious gangland figures who have since donated a number of items for display at the museum
' i visited him several times in prison in the 1990s
he was very , very quiet , a gentleman
' he was able to provide me with a lot of other contacts who have been able to donate to the prison including charles bronson , charlie , freddie foreman and many notorious villains
' mr jones said the items will go on display for the first time when the museum reopens for the season on march 28
he added : ' these items will all be on display along with many other personal artifacts from the reggie and their many acquaintances , both from the criminal underworld and friends from their celebrity circles
' it âs the biggest private collection of reggie memorabilia on display to the public
' he added that the museum is a ' very controversial and politically incorrect museum ' and said it 's ' not everyone âs cup of tea '
the reggie were almost born into a life of crime
their father , charlie senior , was hardly the ideal role model
at the outbreak of the second world war he was called up to join the army , but deserted
frequently away from home and up to no good , the twins probably saw more of the police , who kept visiting their house at 178 vallance road in bethnal green , than they did their father
it was up to their mother , violet , to keep the family together , which was a struggle
from left to right : reggie , charlie and reggie outside their home in bethnal green , east london for a while , her three sons stayed out of trouble , and spent much of their spare time in the boxing ring , where the twins would win many a competition
however , by their late teens , ronnie and reggie were also fighting on the streets , and they soon started their own gang
when they turned 18 in 1951 , they decided that military service was not for them
they spent most of their national service in the guardroom
matters came to a head when they were arrested for assaulting a policemen , and were imprisoned in shepton mallet , somerset
upon their return to the east end , it was clear they would never settle into regular lives
their first business venture was a club called the regal , off the mile end road , which looked like a dive from the outside but which the reggie turned into a glamorous , fashionable nightspot
ronnie and reggie pictured in the 1960s in their sharp suits , they did their best to maintain , publicly at least , a veneer of respectability , but they were involved in just about every form of criminality imaginable , from straightforward theft to gang violence and - ultimately - murder
of the two siblings , ronnie was considered the more dangerous
he was imprisoned in 1957 for gbh
while locked up , he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia , which partly explained his violent tendencies
unusually for that time , ronnie was also publicly bisexual , which reggie found difficult to accept
despite reggie also being jailed in 1959 , the reggie ' ' business ' activities went from strength to strength , and by the sixties they were hobnobbing with stars such as barbara windsor , and eminent politicians such as lord boothby , with whom ronnie is likely to have had an affair
ronnie remained unmarried , and reggie 's marriage to frances in 1965 only lasted for eight months
it is thought that she committed suicide , although according to one account , frances was murdered by ronnie , for reasons that are unclear
in the middle of 1968 , the twins â older brother charlie were arrested for murder
ronnie had shot a rival gang member called george cornell in the face when he was drinking in a pub , and reggie , normally the ' gentle ' one , had repeatedly stabbed gang member jack ' the hat ' mcvitie in the face and neck for not following orders
both men were given life sentences , with a recommendation that they should serve at least 30 years
charlie was sent down for ten years , for being an accessory to the murder of mcvitie
ronnie died in prison in 1995 aged 61 and reggie died in 2000 aged 66
