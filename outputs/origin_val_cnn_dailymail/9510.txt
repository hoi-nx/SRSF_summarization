ronaldo has gone almost a year without scoring a free - kick in la liga despite being real madrid âs designated taker , and supporters are now asking if the ball should nât be taken off the portuguese and given to gareth bale
the 30 - year - old last hit the back of the net from a set - piece in the spanish league on march 26 last year against sevilla
his last goal from a free - kick in any competition came in the champions league last april against bayern munich
he has now failed to score a single goal with any of his last 51 free - kicks
ronaldo has gone almost a year without scoring a free - kick in la liga ronaldo deploys his trademark technique as he attempts a free - kick against villarreal last sunday ronaldo and team - mate gareth bale ( left ) line up a free - kick against getafe in january in any straw poll of best set - piece deliverers ronaldo would be top of many people âs lists but the statistics tell a completely different story , and while his figures are poor gareth bale âs are far more impressive
ronaldo has sent 21 of his efforts straight into the wall and placed 14 high or wide of the target ; while keepers or posts and crossbars have done for the rest
gareth bale has only scored once this season but it is real madrid âs only goal scored from a free - kick
and although gareth bale insisted recently on spanish radio that he tends to take the kicks that favour a left - footer and ronaldo those that favour a right foot , more often than not it is the portuguese who takes precedence
when gareth bale scored from a free - kick against espanyol in january the strike - rates of europe âs set - piece specialists were published by spanish football statistician mister chip and they made tough reading for ronaldo
ronaldo 's last goal from a free - kick came in last season 's champions league against ac milan in april gareth bale fires a free - kick over the atletico madrid wall during a la liga clash at the bernabeu midfielder toni kroos could also take over free - kick duties for real madrid from ronaldo gareth bale scores a free - kick every 9.5 attempts while ronaldo 's ratio is one every 15.6 attempts
gareth bale also came out ahead of andrea pirlo who scores one every 10.5 attempts and leo messi who scores every 14 times he takes a free - kick
real madrid have various options from a dead ball with toni kroos and isco both ready to step in
they also have james rodriguez and sergio ramos on their way back from injury to put more pressure on ronaldo , and with martin odegaard being tipped to play some part in real madrid âs champions league second leg with schalke on tuesday there is even a 16 - year - old pretender to the crown .
