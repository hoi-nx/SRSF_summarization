chris smalling insists manchester united are capable of overtaking bitter rivals manchester city and finishing second in the league
manchester united put on their best display of the season on sunday as they swept aside tottenham in a near - effortless 3 - 0 victory at old trafford
the impressive performance raised hopes and expectation levels at the club and chris smalling thinks manchester united are well - equipped to sustain that kind of performance level for the rest of the season
chris smalling , pictured tussling with tottenham 's harry kane , believes manchester united can finish second rooney scores manchester united 's third goal in their comfortable 3 - 0 win against tottenham on sunday manchester united are two points behind manchester city , who lost to burnley on saturday , and just one point adrift of third - placed arsenal
and chris smalling is convinced finishing second above manchester city is not just a pipe dream
' yes , i think we could , especially after manchester city 's result on saturday , ' the manchester united defender said
' it is all very close
' i think it 's very open all the way up to second place and we will be aiming for that , especially when we are playing those teams coming up
' we want champions league football back here
fourth is the minimum but when it 's there , second is a realistic target and if we keep on performing like that i do n't see why we ca n't give it a good push
' manchester united face liverpool , aston villa , manchester city and chelsea over the next four weeks and then host arsenal on the penultimate weekend
many viewed the difficult run - in as a reason why manchester united could fail to qualify for the champions league , but chris smalling views the situation in exactly the opposite way
