ex-fashion police writers have revealed that many industry insiders believed the demise of the popular e ! series was inevitable after the death of the show 's former host joan , because its current stars ca n't unapologetically get away with the comedian 's no holds barred brand of humor
while many blame the show 's recent hiatus - and the abrupt departures of kathy griffin and kelly osbourne - on the scandal that erupted after giuliana rancic joked that zendaya 's dreadlocks at the oscars made her look like she smelled of ' patchouli oil ' and ' weed ' , others say fashion police was always destined to fail without the legendary comedian
' joan is n't there to make it all work , ' todd masterson , a former fashion police writer told cosmopolitan.com during a phone conversation
' she had decades of saying the most offensive things under her belt
now the pressure was on everyone else to make provocative jokes

tony tripoli , former head writer of fashion police , also came to giuliana rancic 's defense
' giuliana rancic was probably exhausted after spending 12 hours on the red carpet and getting very little sleep , ' he said
' i do n't think she meant to sound racist or cause anyone harm
' the 40 - year - old red carpet interviewer inevitably apologized for the ill - advised and racially loaded joke - which is something both writers insist joan would never have done
â that was her act , â mr todd masterson said of joan
' i think she knew an apology was a floodgate
