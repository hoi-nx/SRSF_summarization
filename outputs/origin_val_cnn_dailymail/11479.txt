suspicious fires twice destroyed financial records of reverend al sharpton suspicious fires twice destroyed the financial records of reverend al sharpton , a report has claimed
the civil rights activist was running for office at the time of the fires , which were six years apart and in separate buildings in new york
it has been reported that al sharpton subsequently failed to comply with tax and campaign filing requirements
according to the nro , the first fire happened in 1997 as al sharpton was running for mayor while the second happened while he was running for president in 2003
the fires destroyed â critical financial records â , the report said
the first blaze , on april 10 , 1997 - five days before tax day - started in a hair and nail salon below al sharpton âs headquarters at west 125th street in new york and investigators treated it as an arson / explosion case
at the time , the al sharpton âs spokesman said the campaign had lost its â entire manhattan operation â while the mayor at the time , rudy giuliani , said the investigation centred on the salon rather than al sharpton âs campaign the nro reports that al sharpton said he was unable to file certain financial documents and blamed the fire for the destruction of the records
on january 23 , 2003 , a fire caused extensive damage in the offices of his non-profit organisation national action network on madison avenue
it happened a day after al sharpton submitted documents to create a presidential exploratory committee , the website reports
investigators initially treated the blaze as suspicious but later put it down to â nfa ( not fully ascertained ) â heat from electrical equipment â
but nro reports that â significant oddities â surrounded the fire and the investigation
the civil rights activist ( pictured ) was running for office at the time of the fires , which were six years apart and in separate buildings in new york it quotes supervising fire marshal , kelty , who attended the scene , as saying that he found it â unusual â when he was unexpectedly relieved from investigating the blaze
when mr kelty was told that the report into the fire was only six pages long with 38 pictures from the scene , he said that such a document would generally be â much more exhaustive â given al sharpton âs high profile
the website also quotes sources about one of al sharpton âs former employees livingston
it says mr livingston , who immigrated to the us from guyana , was first on the scene as the fire took hold
the report says livingston claimed he was in a reception room when the fire broke out but that a major fire had developed by the time fire crews arrived
civil rights activist al sharpton is pictured in april last year with us president barack obama mr kelty is quoted as saying that this was â odd â and â not normal fire behaviour â
mr livingston is said to have had al sharpton âs lawyer with him when he was speaking to authorities
the report says that the maintenance man , who died in 2014 , had , at some point , been living in the us illegally
in an interview with the nro , al sharpton confirmed that mr livingston had done some â side work â with him , but dismissed allegations he was paying him â under the table â
when asked whether the fires were a case of bad luck , nro quotes al sharpton as saying : â i would say that you could speak to people that would certainly , whoever they are , could have their views
