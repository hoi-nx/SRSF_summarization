childcare centres around australia are sending children home with poo - filled underwear in plastic bags to the shock of parents who have labelled the practice disgusting
nationwide guidelines prevent childcare centres from rinsing or washing clothing , so if a child has an accident , their pants the underwear must be bagged and labelled and left in a communal bucket for parents to take home at the end of the day
leah spender , 34 , said that she was presented with her son ethan 's underwear after being informed that the staff were not allowed to touch faecal matter
when your child is learning to " potty train " the childcare providers ask that you bring in a spare pair of undies and shorts ... but that was all i was told , ' ms leah spender told daily mail australia
' the first time i was given my " goody bag " the day care mum said " oh ! before i forget ! ethan has a present for you
. " she walked to the toilet area and fished out a a grey plastic shopping bag , which was tied in a knot at the top and handed it to me
i could see the words " ethan w " written on the bag and a date , ' she said
ms leah spender said that she was shocked that centres would send home a ' full piece of poo '
' dirty underwear is one thing , but wrapping the entire thing up , for you to then put in your handbag , walk down the street to your car
. and drive the whole way home with a full piece in the bag
. that 's a bit far , ' she said
cristal jamieson , from brisbane , took to facebook to express her frustration over the practice , after she had repeatedly asked her daughter 's childcare centre to throw out the soiled underwear rather than send it home
the final straw came when she opened a three - day old bag with her daughter 's name on it
ms cristal jamieson posted on media personality em rusciano 's official facebook page , asking for advice on how to handle the situation
' today , i got greeted with a plastic bag with an entire turd wrapped in princess pink undies with ' ellie ' written on , ' she wrote
' yes my daughter is named ellie but surely this is n't her complete turd packaged from 3 days prior after sitting in communal ' turd ' bucket for 3 days ! ! ! surely ... can i please ask , what would have em rusciano done ? please â¦
' em rusciano brought attention of her 100,000 followers to the issue , and said she ' would have lost my mind
' ' [ i would have ] taken the unfortunate doggy bag , found that person 's car and placed the poo in a spot they would never find and just let the smell haunt them until they had to set their car on fire
' outraged parents were quick to comment , with many adding that their childcare centre had a similar practice of sending home packaged poo
' i have had such a turd greet me , but the day care centre in question were kind enough to distribute each individual turd in their little plastic bags into the respective child 's backpack
revolting , & thrown straight in the bin - because what else can you do with that kind of s * * t ? ' posted one parent

while some on the post who claimed to be childcare workers expressed disgust at the practice , others pointed to national guidelines which enforced the activity
recommendations from the nhmrc âs ' staying healthy : preventing infectious diseases in early childhood education and care services ' guidelines released in 2012 , childcare centres are advised to ' place any soiled clothes in a plastic bag or alternative , so parents can take their child âs clothes home '
while the guidelines are not legislated , some childcare centres around australia choose to accept the recommendations , and enforce the practice of sending home soiled underwear as part of the centre 's blanket policy

' as the regulations do not prescribe what practices are considered adequate , service providers make their own decisions about what health and hygiene practices are used at the service , informed by relevant guidelines and best practice , ' the spokesperson said
after communicating with her child care centre , ms cristal jamieson said that she has made a formal complaint with the queensland department of child services , and said she is horrified that the practice is so widespread
' this is political correctness gone mad , policies need to be changed , ' she told daily mail australia
while the nhmrc 's guidelines are not legislated , some childcare centres around australia choose to accept the recommendations ' the centre said it was against their guidelines to do much more than package it up
i asked for them to throw the underwear out but staff changes mean that not everyone knows and that my daughter 's poo keeps being sent home
' ms cristal jamieson said that she was worried that the hot bathroom where the soiled bags are kept would negatively impact on the toilet training of the children
' this is a very critical time , developmentally , for young children , and the environment it meant to be pleasant
the room is disgusting , it smells , and this is not creating an efficient , rewarding experience
' ms cristal jamieson would like to see a blanket rule that if the centres can not remove the poo , they throw out the underwear , and said that the practice is humiliating for children
' it 's like a child is n't deserving of the same respect that adults get
imagine having to take your bag home with poo inside it , it 's degrading , ' she said
' i ca n't believe this actually happens , this is not a third world country
