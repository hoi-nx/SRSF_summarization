churchill planned to tempt americans into joining world war two by offering the country a priceless copy of the magna carta
the british cabinet believed the gesture would sway americans public opinion in favour of joining the fighting in europe , and even set a date for the handover before the deal fell through
never - before - seen letters reveal the wartime government discussed how americans are desperate for ' tangible evidence of their europe background ' , meaning the gift would be of particular value
letters written in 1941 reveal churchill planned to gift the americans a copy of the magna carta to persuade them to join world war two , noting that americans desire ' tangible evidence of their europe background ' the magna carta , which was issued by king john in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects , is also seen as a precursor to the american constitution
in 1941 , when the letters were written , a copy of the document was stranded in americans following the outbreak of the war while it was on display at the new york world 's fair in 1939
the americans government had already signed a deal sending vast amounts of aid money over to their struggling allies in europe , but were still reticent about engaging in the fighting themselves
according to the letters , which go on display at the british library from this friday , the americans saw the british as ' cold - blooded ' , ' calculating ' people who failed ' to say it with flowers ' the historic document ( pictured ) , which signed over righta king john 's people , is viewed as a precursor to the americans constitution , and so was viewed as a generous gift in an attempt to win them over , the british cabinet , supported by churchill , planned to gift them the copy of the magna carta , which belonged to lincoln cathedral
the letters , reported in the independent , say : ' a friendly act , graciously performed , evokes a tremendous response ; when an americans has his emotions stirred , his generosity is unbounded
' he will give the shirt off his back for friendship
' officials even scheduled june 15 of that year as the day for the document to be handed over , but the deal fell through for unspecified reasons
magna carta : law , liberty , legacy is on display at the british library from friday until september 1
