they were both liberal party prime ministers who rode in on large majorities , but no one would say fraser and abbott saw eye - to - eye at the end
in his final months , the late former prime minister had no qualms about telling the world just what he thought about the nation 's current leader
mr fraser this year posted a series of angry messages to his twitter account where he was scathing of mr abbott 's administration
in one message , critical of the government 's treatment of human rights commission president gillian triggs , mr fraser said the prime minister was ' behaving like a dictator '
he added : ' get rid ( of ) abbott '
the former liberal party shifted considerably to the left during his time in power target : mr fraser was no fan of mr abbott 's administration , regularly flaying him in tweets this year in a statement on friday afternoon , mr abbott was generous in his remarks about the 22nd prime minister , praising his work in establishing australian institutions such as the federal police
' abbott dangerous to harmony , peace , a destroyer of wisdom ' : mr fraser was very critical of mr abbott , posting links to foreign news outlets and adding his own criticsms ' no idea of what a nation should be ' : mr fraser was never afraid to stand up for what he believed at various other points , he said the government ' has no idea of what a nation should be ' and that mr abbott was ' dangerous to harmony , peace , a destroyer of wisdom '
in february , he remarked that mr abbott was steering his party ' backwards ' and appeared particularly upset with the prime minister 's latest thoughts about islam
he posted a link to an al jazeera article titled ' abbott 's unambiguous anti-muslim bigotry ' and added that someone had said to him it was ' reminiscent of 1930s germany ' , the period before hitler rose to power
in a statement on friday afternoon , mr abbott was respectful in his remarks about the 22nd prime minister , praising his work in establishing australian institutions such as the federal police
he said today was particularly sad day for those who had followed mr fraser 's efforts to stop a ' bad government ' in 1975
mr fraser 's politics shifted after he left parliament , with him resigning from the liberal party in 2010
fraser , pictured here at the white house as prime minister in 1980 , left australian bitterly divided after catapulting to office off the back of a constitutional crisis prime minister fraser was deeply unpopular with many of the left wing - particularly after the 1975 dismissal of gough whitlam mr abbott said he had sought mr fraser 's wisdom in long conversations as recently as last year - but the two disagreed on several issues
' i had quite a number of long talks with him since then , most recently late last year , ' mr abbott told reporters
' i did n't always agree with all of his positions
in fact , i often disagreed with his positions
' but i always appreciated his insights and the wisdom born of long experience
' in an interview with the australian in 2013 , mr fraser said he had ' never had any cross words with abbott '
but there was a catch
' i suppose i 've said some fairly harsh things about some of his attitudes on turning the boats back
