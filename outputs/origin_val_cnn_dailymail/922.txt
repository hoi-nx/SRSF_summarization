a father of a 12 - year - old girl who he married off in an islamic ceremony told his daughter that australian laws forbidding her from marrying were ' stupid '
the father , who can not be named legally , is on trial at sydney 's court charged with procuring a child for unlawful sexual activity and with being an accessory before the fact of sexual intercourse with a child
the girl told a sydney court her father said australian law was ' stupid ' and girls her age should be allowed to get married and have sexual intercourse
she said days after her wedding , her father began to panic that her husband might be jailed
' he was upset because we might be in trouble , ' the girl said
' ( my father ) knows no marriage under the age of 16
' because he says to me the law here is stupid , girls your age should be allowed to get married and have intercourse
' he said we did n't do anything wrong , we were just following religion
' her father said her husband , now 27 , ' should n't be put away ' , and that they were ' just following religion '
the girl , now 14 , said in her father 's religion , marriage was allowed once the girl got her period and having sex before marriage was punishable by stoning or death in islamic countries
' ( premarital sex ) is actually one of the worst things you can do , ' she said
a 27 - year - old man ( pictured ) has been sentenced to at least seven and a half years behind bars for marrying and sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl
now her father is on trial for agreeing to the arrangement because he discovered that his daughter was ' menstruating and interested in boys ' a court heard the court also heard the girl and her husband had sex ' once or twice ' a day after they were married
they also spent five nights staying at her father 's house
the girl also detailed the motivation for the marriage being organised , which was her reaching puberty
in the video interview shown to the court , she said she understood puberty to be ' blood ... when i got my period '
she also said her father told her not to take birth control pills , and that her father reminded her not to let her husband wear a condom
' do n't use pills or condoms - do n't let him use anything , ' she said
' he always said that - i think the first time was just after we got married
' the court also heard her ' husband ' approached her father about the marriage after he had been refused by leaders at her usual mosque
' they said no because of my age and because i was australian , ' she said
' after he went to sheiks , after a while he came back and asked my father
' her comments come after her mother said she had pleaded with the father to stop the wedding
the woman , who legally can not be named , told the court in sydney she strongly opposed the marriage
she said her former husband - with whom she had split before the incident - called her on what she believed to be the night of her daughter 's wedding
' he said ( my daughter ) is going to get married ; they wanted to bring the man to meet me , ' the mother told the court
' i said no. i did not want anything to do with ( my daughter ) getting married
' the woman said she then spoke to her daughter and told her not to get married and the girl said she would n't
' he wanted her to be married or he would n't have married her , ' she said
' i did n't agree with it , i had nothing to do with it
' the woman 's former partner , a 63 - year - old man , allegedly married his teen daughter off to a 26 - year - old man so she did not commit the sin of extramarital sex
the father allegedly gave his daughter 's mobile phone number to the 26 - year - old man who wanted to marry her and then hosted an islamic ceremony at his home in the hunter region
the court heard the mother received a second call from her former partner that night , during which he used his ' angry voice '
the woman , who legally can not be named , told the court in sydney , she strongly disagreed with the marriage to a 26 - year - old man ( pictured ) ' he said she was going to get married no matter what , that next time i saw her she would be married , ' the woman said
' i just did n't agree with them getting married
' i know it was him on the other end of the phone ; i know his voice because i had to put up with it for 20 years
' the woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory , but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter 's marriage were correct
' i do n't have any trouble remembering the conversations , ' she said
' they did not have my consent
i was not at the wedding
i did not allow it
' ( he 's ) a liar ; he is not going to admit to anything
' what he said is what he said - i did n't add anything or forget anything
' she said she found out they couple had been married under sharia law when the department of community services got involved after the girl 's husband tried to enrol her in a sydney high school
the woman said she suffers from a learning disability that sometimes impacts her memory , but said her recollection of the events leading up to her daughter 's marriage were correct the mother also told the court she briefly converted to islamic during their relationship , the religion of her husband , because she ' was interested in learning about god , and that was the only one he would let me learn about '
she also lashed out at the father 's barrister after it was suggested her memory issues caused by her learning difficulty may have led to her remembering a conversation that never took place
' who 's going to forget that , ' the mother said
' i 'm not happy about my daughter being married in the first place so do n't have a go at me
' when judge deborah sweeney attempted to calm her and said the barrister was just doing his job asking questions , the woman asked if the barrister was a muslim
' because if he 's muslim then you got to do what the man says , because the woman is always a liar
' crown prosecutor Â­ herbert earlier told the court the father hosted the couple at his home , where they allegedly had sex on a specially set up mattress
the father 's trial comes after the husband , now 27 , was jailed for seven and a half years earlier this month for persistent sexual abuse against the young girl
' by her getting married he was stopping the sin of extramarital sex , ' ms herbert said
' his actions brought about or caused the unlawful sexual activity
' on the wedding day , he allegedly instructed the girl that neither she nor her partner were allowed to use contraception
on the first weekend after the wedding , the court heard the father hosted the couple at his home where he allegedly arranged a marital bed
the 27 - year - old lebanese student and the 12 - year - old australian girl spent their wedding night at a motel in the hunter region of nsw where they had sex several times the following morning , he asked his daughter if she needed to shower before prayers , in line with islamic practice after sexual intercourse , the court was told the father allegedly consented to the wedding , in january 2014 , after discovering his daughter had begun menstruating and becoming interested in boys
judge deborah sweeney said on friday the 27 - year - old lebanese man , who can not be named , had persisted in pursuing his australian victim despite her initial reluctance
the girl was pregnant when her 27 - year - old lebanese husband was charged with ongoing child sex abuse
