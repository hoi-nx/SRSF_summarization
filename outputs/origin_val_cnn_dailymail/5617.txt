hamilton appreciates fans may get bored of grand prix this season if he and mercedes are again totally dominant
ahead of this weekend 's season - opening grand prix in australian there is a feeling mercedes will start the campaign as they finished 2014 - as the superior team

assessing the situation , hamilton said : ' a year of dominance is a great thing for a team as a whole , but as a racing driver i 'm sure the fans will want to see close competition
' asked if it would be bad for the sport should he win the title by august and whether the fans would get bored , hamilton replied : ' personally , i would get bored , but i can only speak for myself
hamilton and mercedes team - mate rosberg pose in front of the world 's media ahead of the first race last term mercedes set a new record for number of wins in a year with 16 , with hamilton claiming 11 hamilton speaks to the media next to st kilda beach in melbourne on wednesday ' if i was a fan watching and the championship was won by then it would n't look so good , would it ? ' but then it 's almost impossible to win it by then , and if you look at most of the recent seasons they 've gone down to the last race
' mercedes , however , were eye - catching over the three pre-season tests as they not only racked up the most laps , but also the quickest , and not even on the best type of rubber available
' it 's a work in progress , but of course it feels great , ' said 30 - year - old hamilton , who starts the season favourite to win a third title
' you know it 's great to see all the work that 's been put in by the team , and throughout testing it felt really good
mercedes drivers rosberg and hamilton will go head - to - head again for the title ' testing is not always the greatest when you 're in cooler conditions like in jerez and barcelona , but generally it was pretty awesome
' with the second title to his name and a car beneath him that is again going to be the one to beat , you would expect hamilton to be relaxed heading into the new season , but far from it
hamilton appreciates , as at the start of the any campaign , the hard work is only just beginning all over again
' i definitely do n't feel i have less pressure , ' said hamilton
rosberg won the opening race in australian last season after hamilton suffered an engine problem ' the pressure is the same it is every year , but honestly , i did n't arrive at the tests or here thinking , ' okay , i 'm world champion '
' i 'm thinking , ' jesus , i 've got to do everything again , and i 've got to actually do it better than i did before '
' i know everyone else will have taken a step as well , so how do i do that ? it 's not easy to better a season like last year
' in terms of performance it was the best year i think i 've ever had , but it does n't mean i ca n't beat it so that 's what i 'm trying to do
