this is the jaw - dropping moment a group of daredevils walk the tight roped hundreds of metres above the ground between colossal cliffs
on march 6 , local and international members of the highlining community ascended mount victoria in the blue mountains , 80 km west of sydney , for a weekend of death - defying walks at heights between 60 to 100 metres in the air
the past time involves fixing a one - inch thick rope between two mountains and walking in between them , sometimes with no safety equipment whatsoever
while most people are confident walking on a rope low to the ground , the mental hurdle of doing so from a heart - stopping height coupled with the environmental variables such as sudden gusts of wind makes it vastly more challenging

â it âs actually very peaceful and soothing when you feel the wind on your face and feel yourself in free space
in a way it âs like the opposite of thrillseeking
â sarantos said the gathering , which was organised on social media , drew in over 70 experienced and novice highliners from across australia and the world
â it went off without a hitch
there were guys from all across australia , and even some from france and canada

but despite walking above what most would see as horrifying heights , sarantos said it is an ' extremely safe sport
' â i wo nât get on a skateboard or even play football because i find those are too dangerous
every safety mechanism in highlining has a backup and you ca nât physically fall on to anything off the line
â highlining is an extreme form of slackroping which sees participants walk between two anchor points set up with enormous elevation from the ground or water , sometimes with no safety equipment whatsoever despite walking above what most would see as horrifying heights , sarantos said it is an ' extremely safe sport ' the meet - up saw seven highlines used ranging from 8 metres 95 metres in length , anchored at heights ranging from 60 metres to 100 metres in the air tim desmond hangs from a highline after falling off
sarantos said there have never been any deaths resulting from highlining he claims he has never witnessed a significant injury and there have never any deaths in the sport
sarantos said he has been highlining for about four years , and while it âs easy to pick the sport up , it becomes increasingly difficult once you progress beyond a novice level
â once you reach ropes 60 metres in length or more , it gets incredibly difficult , â he said
safety is paramount with numerous safety harnesses and procedures used to maintain a well measured and safe environment the crowd of 70 that gathered for the event shared a similar passion for adventure and the outdoors
