a shoulder injury to james tomkins means kouyate is likely to find himself at the heart of hammers 's defence at arsenal on saturday - and the senegal international has a plan
the 25 - year - old midfielder has been used to plug a hole in the centre of allardyce 's defence already this season and kouyate wants to use the performance of his former club anderlecht as inspiration for leaving the emirates with a positive result
james tomkins , who has recently penned a new long - term deal at upton park , dislocated a shoulder in training on thursday and joins fellow defender winston reid on the injury list - with forwards carroll , cole and enner valencia also likely to miss out and alex song nursing a slight knee injury
hammers midfielder kouyate ( right ) is looking forward to facing arsenal at the emirates stadium james tomkins is one of three defenders who are unavailable for saturday 's premier league clash add to that carl jenkinson 's ineligibility against his parent club , and allardyce will be selecting from a much - depleted pool for a fourth successive premier league london derby
but kouyate was in the crowd as his previous side anderlecht recovered from a 3 - 0 half - time deficit to take a champions league point home from north london and he wants to follow in the footsteps of the belgian outfit
' i have never played at the emirates before , but i know i will play my game and try to enjoy it
i want to help the team and battle for the points , ' he told whufc.com ' arsenal is a very big team , but hammers need the points
it 's a very good game and london derby , which i like
i 'll go to arsenal to do battle
' i went to the emirates to support anderlecht in the champions league earlier this season and they did very well and drew three - all
kouyate went to the emirates to watch his former club anderlect secure a dramatic 3 - 3 draw in november the gunners were stunned as the belgian side came from 3 - 0 down to grab a point in the champions league ' i was very happy because anderlecht is my second family
arsenal went 3 - 0 up and i was thinking " what is this game ? " but in the second half anderlecht came with a new mentality
' it went to 3 - 1 , then 3 - 2 and then 3 - 3 - it was unbelievable ! ' i am very happy for anderlecht , but now hammers go to arsenal and it would be fantastic if we could do the same
we want to get a draw or even a win
' the hammers confirmed on friday morning that james tomkins required hospital treatment as he became the latest player ruled out of allardyce 's squad
' hammers can confirm that james tomkins has suffered a dislocated shoulder
the 25 - year - old was taken for hospital treatment and will continue to be assessed by the club 's medical staff , ' they wrote over two tweets
kouyate , pictured with chelsea 's cesc fabregas , says hammers are aiming for a ' a draw or even a win ' kouyate enjoyed a short stint at the heart of hammers 's defence alongside james tomkins due to injuries earlier in the year - scoring against manchester united and quickly adapting to the role
it is likely he will return to that position for the trip to arsenal , with the highly - rated but inexperienced reece oxford another option
in attack , cole and carroll are missing with respective hamstring and knee problems , whilst valencia is a doubt having suffered a deep cut to his toe after standing on a broken teacup
the number of key first - team players in the treatment room will no doubt be a worry to allardyce who has seen his side win just one of their last 11 premier league fixtures .
