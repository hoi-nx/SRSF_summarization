moscow russian 's president shares " political responsibility " for the assassination of opposition leader nemtsov , the late politician 's daughter said friday in her first tv interview since his death in central moscow last week
zhanna nemtsova , who said she has no faith in the russian investigation into the killing , said she believes his death will only deter other opposition voices , rather than embolden them
" i can not blame him ( putin ) directly , ( but ) i would say that our authorities , including the president of russian , have political responsibility as the head of state , " zhanna nemtsova told cnn 's matthew chance
zhanna nemtsova says she has no evidence about who ordered the murder , but that " it 's evident that it 's politically motivated
" nemtsov , 55 , was shot dead last friday night as he walked near the kremlin with his girlfriend
a former deputy prime minister , he was one of putin 's harshest critics and had been arrested several times for speaking against the government
no one has been arrested , though russian 's federal security service chief has said there are suspects
the kremlin has suggested nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of russian intent on creating political discord , but many nemtsov supporters suspect putin 's administration of involvement
how nemtsov 's murder serves notice to putin 's enemies putin this week called the killing a " disgrace " and a tragedy , and he promised to bring those responsible to justice
but zhanna nemtsova , 30 , said she does not believe that will happen
she said investigators have not contacted her and she knows nothing of the case except what is in the media
" i do n't know where his cellphone and his personal belongings are , so i know only those things which are released or published in the press and nothing else , nothing else , " she told cnn from germany , where she is staying for a few days
" as i have already said , i do n't have any faith in this investigation
" zhanna nemtsova said she loved her father " more than anyone else in my life " and that the two were very close
" i think that he died a hero , " she said
" he was a very brave man , and he was clever , he was a great thinker and he was a brilliant physicist , " having published dozens of articles on the subject , she said
he was also an economist and pacifist , she said , who most recently had been critical of the kremlin 's handling of the ukraine crisis
" i know that some russian officials kept saying that he was not dangerous , but ... in an authoritarian regime , any person who does not agree with politics -- who criticizes the official standpoint -- is dangerous , " zhanna nemtsova said
" that 's why , i think , if you look at other regimes , like in russian , you will see that all opponents to the official line are in danger , under threat
" nemtsov was a top official with the republican party of russia-party of people 's freedom , a liberal opposition group
he served as deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under president boris yeltsin
early in his career , he was governor of nizhniy novgorod , a major economic hub
" i think that now , russian has crossed the line after this murder , and people will be frightened to express their ideas which contradict ... the official standpoint , " zhanna nemtsova said
