reseachers believe that people with a history of gout have their risk of developing alzheimer 's cut by a quarter people with a history of gout have their risk of developing alzheimer 's disease reduced by a quarter , a new study has found
the painful joint condition , known as the disease of kings due to henry viii famously suffering from it , appears to have a protective effect on the brain , researchers have said
they believe this is possibly thanks to the excess uric acid that is built up during a gout attack
the study was carried out in the u.s. by the massachusetts general hospital and boston university medical centre , but analysed people in the uk by looking at thin ( thin ) , an electronic database from gp 's surgeries around the country
they looked at 3.7million people aged 40 and over but excluded anyone already diagnosed with gout or dementia
analysis was carried out of alzheimer 's disease amongst adults with gout compared with up to five without it
overall , the researchers identified 309 new cases of alzheimer 's disease among 59,224 patients with gout
and in their comparison group over a five - year follow - up period , they found 1,942 cases of alzheimer 's among 238,805 patients
they concluded this shows there was a 24 per cent lower risk of alzheimer 's among people with a history of gout , after taking into account age , sex , body mass index , socio - economic status , lifestyle factors , prior heart conditions and use of heart drugs
the report concluded : ' our findings provide the first population - based evidence for the potential protective effect of gout on the risk of alzheimer 's disease and support the purported neuroprotective role of uric acid
' if confirmed by future studies , a therapeutic investigation that has been employed to prevent progression of parkinson âs disease may be warranted for this relatively common and devastating condition
