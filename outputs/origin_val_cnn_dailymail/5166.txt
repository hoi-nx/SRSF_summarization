the real - life paddington bear who suffered such appalling treatment in a circus that she lost her claws , teeth and fur is closer to finding a new home , thanks to the generosity of mail readers
after the plight of cholita was highlighted by this newspaper last week , readers donated an extraordinary Â£ 30,000 to animal defenders international , which found the bear in a terrible condition during a raid in peru earlier this month
the elderly bear lost most of the thick black hair that covered her body as the result of the stress she endured at the circus , where she was kept in a 5ft by 5ft box , and her teeth were broken and her claws removed to prevent her from defending herself
the two drivers and the truck , equipped with a new cage , hay and blankets , will alone cost Â£ 2,700 , and the bear will also need help from veterinary staff and a support team , who will fly to piura in advance
when the organisation has cleared the red tape needed to allow cholita to leave the country , they will fly her and 33 lions they have rescued from other circuses in south america to the wild animal sanctuary in colorado in the united states , where she can live out her days in peace
because she is a spectacled bear , the same endangered species as paddington in the children âs books by michael bond , there are stringent conditions to be met before the authorities permit her to cross state boundaries
the organisation , which campaigns against the exploitation of wild animals , will have to delay cholita âs flight by several weeks to ensure she is allowed aboard , at a further cost of thousands of pounds a day , so it is still appealing for funds
its president , jan creamer , said : â we have been overwhelmed by the response from mail on sunday readers to help cholita
we now need one last push so that she can begin her journey to freedom
please give generously and help us save cholita and give her the life she deserves
