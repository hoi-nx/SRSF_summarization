for once , the focus of north london did not fall on arsenal on sunday
after the week they 've had , arsene wenger was happy to shun the limelight this time
ask gunners fans prior to kick - off if they 'd rather three points or a spurs defeat in the capital one cup final and you 'd have been greeted with differing opinions
as it happened , they all got their wish
their arch - rivals lost to chelsea at wembley and arsenal got their win â by the same scoreline , â courtesy of goals from giroud and tomas rosicky , to move four points behind second - placed manchester city
giroud points to the sky after scoring the opener against toffees at the emirates on sunday giroud had a less than enjoyable time in his side 's champions league defeat against monaco on wednesday the frenchman striker congratulates team - mate tomas rosicky after he doubled the gunners ' lead on sunday but much like their demoralising champions league loss to monaco on wednesday night , this did n't make for comfortable viewing
the 2 - 0 score does n't tell the full story
this was unconvincing from arsenal ; the emirates a bag of nerves until tomas rosicky 's last - minute goal
nevertheless , while their participation in this year 's champions league is under huge threat , their qualification for next year 's competition remains on course
despite their lack of fluency , arsene wenger would have been pleased with the response shown by his wounded players following the midweek loss
giroud , barracked by his own supporters on wednesday , did not hide ; likewise coquelin , who played on after breaking his nose
this was n't the arsenal we 're accustomed to , but after the monaco monstrosity that did n't concern arsene wenger
' i think what was really important was the mentally united response , ' he said
tomas rosicky had been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he doubled arsenal 's lead at the emirates arsenal boss arsene wenger said he was proud of his side 's response to the loss against monaco ' i am very proud of the response we have shown
our defensive concentration was at a much higher level than on wednesday
' we know with the ball we can do better but overall what was important for us was to respond with a win
not everyone can produce that after such a disappointment and it was vital for us to win
' arsene wenger 's comments , particularly regarding his side 's defensive stability , will have resonated with mertesacker
the frenchman rang the changes following wednesday 's loss
vice-captain mertesacker and danny welbeck were axed and replaced by gabriel and oxlade-chamberlain
for gabriel , in particular , this was a huge opportunity
per mertesacker ( right ) was demoted to the bench following arsenal 's champions league loss to monaco giroud shows his strength in an impressive display to hold the challenge from toffees defender jagielka mertesacker 's role in the starting xi has been called into huge question this season following a string of below - par displays , including against monaco
on reflection , it was n't the most convincing of performances from the 24 - year - old on his first premier league start since arriving for Â£ 13.5million from villareal in january
a clean sheet is a clean sheet , though
mertesacker knows that more than most
gabriel very nearly gifted the visitors an early lead , failing to deal with a long - ball to allow lukaku a free run at ospina
thankfully for the brazilian , his fellow south american bailed him out with some fine goalkeeping
a goal would not have flattered toffees , who started brightly
arsenal , though , were lethargic
giroud , unmarked from six yards , headed wide in the 28th minute after escaping the attentions of jagielka inside the penalty area
it was the last thing the striker needed after his wasteful display on wednesday
but this time supporters did n't get on his back , responding to the miss by chanting his name
arsenal 's gabriel ( right ) did not have the most convincing performance but managed to keep a clean sheet coquelin was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team - mate before being hit in the face this certainly had the desired effect , as the frenchman international nipped in front of john stones to flick home ozil 's corner in the 39th minute
gareth barry tried , spectacularly , to put toffees level but his acrobatic bicycle kick flew over
kevin mirallas then saw a penalty appeal rejected by andre marriner , after claiming oxlade-chamberlain had handled
much like the first half , roberto martinez 's side made a positive start after the break â luke garbutt 's dead - ball delivery causing arsenal 's defence problems
lennon , given his spurs connections , was afforded a horrendous welcome when introduced in the 62nd minute
there would have been greater boos three minutes later had ospina not tipped over lukaku 's first - time shot from a barkley cross
it was even more uncomfortable for coquelin ( below ) , who was left with a broken nose following an accidental collision with giroud
luke garbutt attempts to drive down the win but his progress is stalled by arsenal defender hector bellerin lennon missed a glorious chance to ram arsenal supporters ' insults down their throats , firing straight at ospina after great work from seamus coleman
the stadium was a bag of nerves by this point
ozil should have eased the tension in the 80th minute after being sent clean through on goal by oxlade-chamberlain but the german 's shot was blocked by jagielka , before substitute tomas rosicky struck in the final minute to ensure arsene wenger could finally relax .
