the pilots of the delta plane that skidded off a runway at laguardia 13 last week during a snowstorm have told investigators that automatic systems designed to slow down the plane were not working properly
they said the plane 's automatic brakes were set to ' max , ' but they did not sense any deceleration as the aircraft veered toward flushing bay , according to the national transportation safety board
the flight crew also said the runway appeared ' all white ' - covered in snow - when they broke out of the overcast sky and glimpsed it just moments before landing
the captain also reported he was unable to prevent the airplane from drifting to the left
investigators said the plane was flying on autopilot until it was 230 feet off the ground , indicating a fairly routine landing until the very end
delta flight 1086 from atlanta was carrying 127 passengers , including two lap children , plus five crew members , when it slid off the runway thursday and skidded about 2,000 feet along a normally grassy area alongside the runway that was covered in snow
close call : the flight crew also said the runway appeared ' all white ' - covered in snow - when they broke out of the overcast sky and glimpsed it just moments before landing
the nose of the plane ended up over the water for the last 940 of those feet , the plane 's left wing was cutting through and destroying the airport 's chain - link perimeter fence , investigators said
the aircraft came to rest with its nose leaning perilously on a berm that separates the runway from icy flushing bay
the plane suffered damage to the left wing , including a punctured fuel tank that caused a leak
the belly of the aircraft from the nose to the first passenger door and the nose itself also were damaged , investigators said
since delta took ownership of the md - 88 plane on dec. 30 , 1987 , it had taken off and landed 54,865 times , investigators said
spread out over the past 28 years , that means the plane flew an average of 5.5 flights a day
the md-88 was a workhorse of u.s. domestic airlines for the past three decades , favored on short , frequent routes
this particular one had logged more than 71,000 hours - or nearly 3,000 full days - in the air
investigators are also examining an identical md - 88 plane that landed at laguardia 13 minutes before the botched landing as a baseline for evaluating the data from flight 1086

the flight from atlanta was carrying 127 passengers at the time
