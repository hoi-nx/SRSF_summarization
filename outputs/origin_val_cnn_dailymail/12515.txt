there 's a $ 30,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of a bank robbery trio known as the black hat bandits , suspected in a two - month string of robberies across maryland and virginia , the latest coming monday
they 've earned their name for the black hats they wear during their heists , and the feds say they 're becoming increasingly dangerous
" in an escalation of violence , the black hat bandits have become more brazen at each robbery having threatened bank customers and tellers , most recently holding a gun to a customer 's head , and jumping teller counters in attempts to gain access to bank vaults , " according to an fbi wanted poster
an fbi statement last month provided more details : " during each robbery the black hat bandits have been described as carrying handguns and wearing winter coats , sunglasses , black hats ( either a winter knit cap or wide brimmed hat ) and facial disguises such as ski masks or a fake beard
" the bandits pulled off their most recent robbery monday during lunch hour at a wells fargo bank in falls church , virginia
it marked the crew 's eighth bank robbery this year
" we now confirm that this is a three - person crew : two who take over the bank and one who waits in the car , " an fbi spokesperson told cnn affiliate wjla
no one was injured in the holdup , which unfolded after two black - clad men -- one african-american , one white -- entered the bank with firearms , robbed the bank and fled in a vehicle waiting outside , police told the station
hours after the robbery , investigators were at the scene gathering evidence , which included a footprint in the snow , wjla reported
it was the second falls church bank robbery in recent weeks , but the february 21 robbery of an apple federal credit union two blocks from monday 's crime scene was the work of a lone gunman , not the black hat bandits , authorities told wjla
the robbers who committed monday 's robbery are described as in their 40s and between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall , according to the fbi
other banks which the black hat bandits are suspected of robbing include a bank of america in mclean , virginia , on january 2 ; a bb&t in fairfax , virginia , on january 16 ; a bank of america in vienna , virginia , on january 20 ; an essex bank in arnold , maryland , on january 30 ; and a suntrust bank in waldorf , maryland , on february 5
in one of their more audacious undertakings , the robbers hit two banks on february 18
first , they hit a bb&t in vienna , virginia , before traveling to a wells fargo bank in sterling , virginia , 40 minutes later
" one of the suspects put his gun to a customer 's head while demanding everyone to ' get down , ' and demanded money from a victim teller
in both robberies the subjects fled the banks with an undisclosed amount of money , " the fbi said in a statement
the fbi is asking anyone with information on the bank robberies in virginia to call 202 - 278 - 2000
those with information on the maryland heists should call 410 - 265 - 8080
