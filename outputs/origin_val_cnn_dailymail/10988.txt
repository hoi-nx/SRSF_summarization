they have eluded explorers , hunters and scientists who have been searching the himalaya mountains for the mysterious yeti for over a century
now it seems we are no closer to knowing what creature lies behind the mysterious sightings and footprints that have led to the legend of the yeti
a key piece of evidence that suggested many of the sightings were due to an unknown type of bear living in the himalaya has now been ruled out
this footprint taken by british explorer eric shipton in 1954 is regarded as one of the best pieces of evidence for the existence of a yeti and new research on hair samples shows that the mystery is far from being solved biologists used dna analysis to examine claims that hair samples attributed to yetis appeared to belong to a scientifically undiscovered species of bear
instead they have found that the dna in the hair samples has degraded making it impossible to attribute them to any species of bear
the first accounts of yeti emerged before the 19th century from buddhists who believed that the creature inhabited the himalaya
they depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound
the term yeti was developed in 1921 following a book by lieutenant - colonel charles howard-bury called mount everest the reconnaissance
popular interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the yeti
they reported seeing strange markings in the snow
the daily mail led a trip called the the snowman expedition in 1954 to everest
during the trip mountaineering leader john jackson photographed ancient paintings of yetis and large footprints in the snow
a number of hair samples were also found that were believed to have come from a yeti scalp
british mountaineer don whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when scaling annapurna in 1970
he said that while searching for a campsite he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a yeti 's call
that night , he saw a dark shape moving near his camp
the researchers conclude , however , that from the colour and shape of the hair samples , they were likely to have come from common himalaya brown bears rather than an unknown species of bear
this means that the identity of the species behind yeti sightings is still a mystery
dr gutiã©rrez , an evolutionary biologist at the smithsonian institution , said one of the hair samples had apparently come from a bear that had been shot by hunters
he said : ' we have concluded that there is no reason to believe that the two samples came from anything other than brown bear
' what strikes us as odd is that an â experienced hunter â , who was very familiar with the brown bear , could mistake the animal that he had shot for anything other than a bear of some sort and , specifically , for a â yeti â
' corroboration and documentation of , as well as other information concerning , the anecdote of this bear being shot by the hunter and the subsequent history of the hair that was saved would be most welcome
' in 2014 professor sykes , a geneticist at the university of oxford , found that dna extracted two samples of ' yeti ' hair from the himalaya were a 100 per cent match with a 40,000 year old fossil polar bear but not to modern species of polar bear
however , subsequent analysis by researchers from the university of copenhagen found that the hair was not from a polar bear
professor sykes and his colleagues maintained , however , that the hair samples must be from an otherwise unknown species of bear living in the himalaya
although no dna match was found the researchers say it is likely yeti hair samples came from a brown bear an artists reconstruction of what a yeti may look like based on reports and descriptions from past sightings now dr gutiã©rrez and dr pine , a zoologist at the university of kansas , have found that the dna from the samples can not be assigned to any species of bear
writing in the journal zookeys , they said : ' the molecular data obtained and analyzed by sykes are not informative enough to suggest the possibility that a taxonomically unrecognized type of bear exists in the himalaya

2014 : a video of a ' hairy figure ' is captured stumbling through a forest in russia ' we emphasize that no evidence has ever been presented to suggest that an unknown bear species occurs in the himalaya as part of their study , dr gutiã©rrez and dr pine examined how gene sequences can reveal the relationships between the six present - day species of bears
they found one sequence from an asian black bear from japan indicated that it was not closely related to the mainland members of that species
professor sykes insisted that the findings from the new study did not invalidate his own findings
he said : ' what mattered most to our project was that these two hairs were definitely not from unknown primates
' the explanation by gutierez and pine might be right , or it might not be
' the only way forward , as i have repeatedly said , is to find a living bear that matches the 12s rna and and study fresh material from it
' which involves getting off your butt , not an activity i usually associate with desk - bound molecular taxonomists
' last year , in what was the first serious scientific study of the abominable snowman for 50 years , professor sykes from the university of oxford analysed 30 samples of hair
the hairs had supposedly been shed by yetis , or their bigfoot cousins , and were part of museum and private collections from around the world
twenty eight of the hairs were genetic matches to known animals from bears to racoons , horses and cows
but two did not fit the mould
their dna matched that recovered from a 40,000 - year - old polar bear fossil
one hair was reddish brown and found in a yeti nest in a bamboo forest in bhutan , ten years ago
the second was golden brown and taken from a yeti in ladakh on the tibet - india border 40 years ago
but new research suggests professor sykes 's findings were in fact down to an error in analysing the data
researchers ross barnett , from the university of copenhagen , and ceiridwen edwards from the university of oxford looked at the same hair samples that led professor sykes to make his bold claim
they proposed that the previously unexplained samples come from the himalaya bear - a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the himalaya , in remote , mountainous areas of pakistan , nepal , tibet , bhutan and india
the latest research , however , concludes that it is difficult to attribute the dna to any species of bear .
