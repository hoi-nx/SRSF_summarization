a ten - year - old girl with a rare but intractable form of epilepsy is leading the crusade to have marijuana extract oil approved for medicinal use in her home state of idaho as a form of treatment for her deadly seizures
alexis , from boise , has dravet syndrome , an incurable genetic disease that causes severe and multiple seizures , which often leave parents guessing if the terror of watching their child seize up will pass or turn fatal
after her family learned that oil extracted from marijuana had helped other children with her condition , they wanted to see if it would help her too , but idaho âs stringent marijuana laws do not allow for medicinal use

' the family began lobbying lawmakers to decriminalize the oil almost two years ago
now , they 've got some legislative backers and an upcoming hearing , as idaho joins a larger movement to loosen laws to allow the use of marijuana extract oil
twelve states have legalized the oil while still banning medical marijuana
virginia legalized the oil february 26
in utah , lawmakers have given initial approval to let those with chronic and debilitating diseases consume edible marijuana products , while still banning smoking
marijuana extract oil first received attention when a colorado family fought and won for access for their daughter who also had dravet syndrome
it is similar to hemp oil , which is legal in idaho and can be bought in grocery stores
with no known cure for dravet syndrome , children are often prescribed a cocktail of medications to counter the seizures
however , the heavy drugs often come with side - effects that can permanently damage a child 's developing liver , kidneys and other organs
proponents of cannabidiol oil , a non-psychotropic extract of marijuana , argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children
over time , mrs alexis hopes that the oil would also reduce the number of medications her daughter relies on
' like any parent , you never give up hope that you can get complete seizure control , ' she said
' children die from dravet by any one of the seizures
alexis could have a seizure that may not stop , we never really know

proponents of the oil for medicinal use argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children making a change : governor terry mcauliffe ( center ) holds haley smith , 14 , from white stone , virginia on his lap after signing the bills that allow the possession of marijuana oils to help treat patients with epilepsy alexis began having seizures when she was two months old
but even in 2003 , her mom says a lack of awareness of the disease led to many doctors not automatically suspecting it could be a rare , genetic disorder
it was n't until alexis lost all speech and potty control when she was two that doctors determined she had dravet syndrome , mrs alexis said
since then , alexis ' parents have put her on a variety of diets and medications to help reduce the seizures , but the disease is tricky to manage
dravet syndrome often causes a variety of different kinds of seizures but medications typically target one particular type
alexis ' seizures usually occur at night , which means one of her parents regularly sleep with her and monitor her sleep patterns
during the day , alexis requires constant supervision
while most 10 - year - olds freely run and jump around , alexis walks - albeit sometimes unstably and with help going up and down stairs
mrs alexis said working with idaho 's republican - controlled legislature has been easier than anticipated
lawmakers who resisted the idea at first blush have warmed up to the idea , she explained
this year , the bill is endorsed by curt mckenzie senator curt mckenzie and representative tom loertscher
both are chairs of the legislature 's state affairs committees , panels that often get tossed controversial legislation and have a high bar for clearance
the measure unanimously passed the senate committee during its introduction hearing , which means it now goes on to a full hearing in front of the committee
yet the bill must survive a statehouse that approved a resolution in 2013 vowing never to legalize marijuana for any purpose .
