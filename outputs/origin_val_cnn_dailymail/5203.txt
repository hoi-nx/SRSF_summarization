prince andrew âs chances of appearing in a us court over â sex slave â allegations receded last night , after authorities mounted a legal challenge against the woman who claims she slept with him
prosecutors have asked a judge in florida to reject roberts âs plea to join a seven - year legal battle being waged by two other women
they are suing the us government over the lenient treatment of convicted paedophile epstein , jailed for 18 months in 2008

the chances of the prince having to appear in court over her allegation she was forced to sleep with him look to be receding the women , identified as â jane does 1 and 2 â , claim their rights as victims were breached when they were not consulted over a controversial deal signed by prosecutors with billionaire epstein , which granted him and others immunity from prosecution over dozens of cases of underage sexual abuse
in return , epstein , 62 , a former friend of the andrew , pledged to pay compensation to his victims
in the new filing at palm beach county court , prosecutors say roberts was happy to receive an out - of - court settlement from epstein , knowing the non-prosecution agreement had been signed
if the us authorities win the case , andrew will be spared having to give evidence or make a witness statement
it will also mean roberts , 32 will no longer be able to repeat any of her claims without fear of being sued
legal experts said prosecutors had a strong case and believe it is likely a judge will side with them
us lawyer charles hayes said : â the government just have to prove roberts was aware of the [ immunity ] agreement and a judge will favour them
epstein allegedly kept roberts as a ' sex slave ' ' there has to be a very good reason to allow another party to join a long - running legal action and i do nât see one here
â the andrew was named in papers filed by roberts earlier this year
she identified him as one of the men she was forced to sleep with while being kept as a â sex slave â by epstein
she also claimed that maxwell , daughter of the late newspaper tycoon robert maxwell , and epstein âs girlfriend , recruited her into the financier âs employment as a â masseuse â
roberts said she was â loaned â to epstein âs wealthy friends after being groomed over a number of years by him
roberts claimed she had sex with andrew on three separate occasions , including taking part in an orgy on epstein âs private caribbean island
andrew has strenuously denied any sexual relationship with roberts , who was 17 when they met
ms maxwell has also denied any wrongdoing
