this was the year we âd be wearing shoes that tied their own laces â or so the back to the future films predicted in the eighties
while this may seem as fanciful now as it did then , 2015 does looks set to be the year of so - called â wearable technology â , clothing and accessories that could transform not only our wardrobes , but our health , too
until now , wearable technology has largely taken the form of wristband trackers â such as the fitbit ( launched in 2008 ) , 2011 âs jawbone and the much - hyped apple watch , due to go on sale on april 24
but now , manufacturers are developing everyday items of clothing and shoes that can monitor our vital signs , and even treat serious conditions
the latest innovations include a bra that could deliver life - saving breast cancer medication and socks that warn if you âre at risk of injury
hi - tech : a bra contains technology which allows tiny â nano â particles of a substance - for instance , a drug - to be embedded into a material even big brands are moving into the market â this year , the u.s. designer ralph lauren will launch a sports top that monitors heart rate , muscle movement and calories burnt
â so far , wearable technology in the context of well - being has been mainly about monitoring personal data , â says caroline till , course leader in material futures at central st martins , university of the arts london
â the question now is what do you do with the data once you have it ? is the information of value ? â this is where the latest technology comes in , with the focus on giving you feedback from the information collated
so in theory , â wearables â , as they âre known , will not only take your blood pressure reading , they âll tell you if it âs dangerously high
â the holy grail of wearable technology is something that âs integrated seamlessly into something you wear or use already , so you do nât notice it âs there , â says caroline till
this is now closer to being a reality because circuitry can be made small and light enough to be embedded in clothing
another material technology , known as micro-encapsulation , allows tiny â nano â particles of a substance â for instance , a drug â to be embedded into a material so it is gradually absorbed through the skin when worn
here , we look at the latest â wearables â â some of which are already available , with others still being developed â that could transform our health
the omsignal top has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing bra that delivers cancer drugs the foxleaf bra contains micro-encapsulated â bubbles â of the drug tamoxifen in soft , plastic inserts in the cups
the idea is that the body âs heat and moisture rub off the bubbles â coating and the tamoxifen , which blocks oestrogen to slow the growth of cancer cells , can be gradually absorbed through the skin throughout the day
the bra was developed by masters , a masters student at central st martins , london
it aims to provide a possible solution for thousands of women who find the side - effects of tamoxifen intolerable
delivering the drug locally means less has to be processed by the liver , potentially reducing side - effects such as hot flushes , cramps and nausea
there are now plans to run clinical trials to work out at what rate the drug would be absorbed
da costa âs next project is to see whether similar technology could be used to deliver dementia drug galantamine via bedding or nightwear
vest to help you burn off calories nasa scientist dr hayes has invented the cold shoulder vest , which he says boosts your body âs ability to burn calories
the vest , which can be kept in the freezer , has pockets for ice packs around the back and shoulders
the idea is that by wearing the vest your body has to burn more calories to stay warm â as much as an extra 500 calories a day , says dr hayes
from around Â£ 90 ( $ 139.99 ) from cold - shoulder.com sun savvy : the netatmo june bracelet has a sensor that measures uv light t-shirt to monitor your heart omsignal , the company working with ralph lauren to create a tech sports shirt , has a top already on sale that has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing
the sensors can also monitor the electrical activity of the heart
fibres feed this information to a â black box â â about the size of a credit card â attached to the shirt
the box sends the information to your mobile , with alerts from your phone telling you to breathe more , slow down or speed up
the heart and breathing rate data is also used to estimate how many calories you âre burning â thought to be much more accurate than standard fitness tracking wristbands which make calculations based on how much you âre moving
at the moment the garment has only been designed for men
a version for women is in development
around Â£ 160 from omsignal.com dress that gets mums-to-be moving it âs a wrap - dress , but not as you know it â maternity dresses designed by blake uretsky , a fashion student at cornell university in the u.s. , contain conductive silver fibres under the bust to monitor a pregnant woman âs heart rate , breathing , blood pressure and temperature , along with a device worn on the belt that can then communicate with a smartphone
the dress can then alert a mother - to - be if her readings suggest she might be over doing it â or not being active enough
some research has suggested that women who are more active during pregnancy have fewer complications during both gestation and labour
the lumo lift brooch aims to improve your posture bracelet to tell you to top up sun cream unlike conventional wristband trackers , the netatmo june is designed to look like a piece of jewellery , with a multifaceted gem on a leather double - wrap strap
but the â gem â is a sensor that measures uv light â the harmful invisible rays that cause sunburn and skin damage
the sensor transmits information on your sun exposure to an iphone and , if it detects you âre reaching a harmful level , it will send you an alert
you can also tell it what factor sun cream â if any â you âre wearing , and it will remind you to re-apply it or recommend that you use a higher factor
Â£ 79 , netatmo.com brooch to banish back pain the lumo lift posture coach is a sensor about the size of two 50p pieces that aims to improve your posture
it âs worn just under your collar bone
there are decorative versions that can be pinned on your clothes like a brooch or tie pin or others that can be clipped out of sight around a bra strap or vest
you set the sensor when you start wearing it so it knows what your â good â posture should be
to do this , you press a button on the device while you âre standing tall , with your shoulders back and relaxed , feet hip distance apart and weight evenly distributed , bottom and stomach pulled in
you can then programme it to vibrate every time it detects you âre slouching
maintaining good posture can be a key step in preventing back pain , according to the british chiropractic association
correct posture keeps your joints aligned , helping to avoid straining your muscles
lumo lift , Â£ 79.95 from store.apple.com / uk lechal trainers have touch technology in the insole that give you directions running socks that can prevent injury sensoria âs smart running socks monitor the way your feet strike the ground , warning you if you are at risk of injury and also how to correct your stride
â flaws in your gait are a common cause of injury , â says physiotherapist sammy margo
the sensoria socks detect how your foot lands , and conductive fibres then relay this information to a small clip - on device on the ankle
this sends information to your phone , which can issue real - time audio warnings and advice if needs be
from around Â£ 130 ( $ 199 ) , sensoriafitness.com shoes that stop you getting lost lechal trainers have touch technology in the insole that not only counts your steps and estimates calories burnt , it also gives you directions so you can stick to a route
the shoes are based on â haptics â â touch technology that gives you physical feedback from an electronic device , like a games console controller that vibrates if you crash a car in the game you âre playing
once you âve programmed your route into a mobile phone app , the shoes vibrate on either the left or the right to tell you how to reach your destination
available to pre-order from around Â£ 100 , lechal.com and finally , the blouse that hugs you as seen on the catwalk at new york fashion week last autumn , the hug shirt , invented by london cutecircuit , uses haptic technology to mimic the sensation of a cuddle
the shirt contains sensors and tiny motors to generate warmth and pressure that feel like a hug
the idea , the inventors say , is to allow friends to â send â each other hugs even when they âre miles apart .
