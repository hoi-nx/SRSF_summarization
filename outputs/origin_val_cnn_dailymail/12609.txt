if the 20th century was the century of the skyscraper , then the 21st century is shaping up as the century of the " plyscaper
" despite its historical reputation for great city fires -- london in 1666 , the great chicago fire of 1871 and san francisco in 1906 -- wood is making a comeback as a construction material
next year in vienna , construction will begin on a 275 - foot building made almost entirely of wood , while stockholm may build a 34 - story wooden apartment by 2023
others are in the pipeline from canada to australia to europe
with faster construction times and a softer environmental impact , could the building material of the past be the future of construction ? vancouver - based architect green says the momentum is gaining as new engineered woods allow for greater strength and heights in buildings
his firm mga recently completed a 29.5m ( 97 feet ) wooden building , the wood innovation and design center in prince george , northern british columbia
but he said news of taller wooden structures is sprouting up all the time
" there seems to be a new announcement every two or three weeks , " green said
" we 've got one in vancouver for 18 stories and in vienna there 's one for more than 20 stories
" we 've done research in high earthquake zones that show 30 stories is feasible ; we certainly think we can go to 40 and higher
" he said new developments in engineered woods -- small wood components that are glued together to make large panels for building -- are a game - changer for construction
mass timber panels , in particular , cross-laminated timber ( known in the industry simply as clt ) are becoming established as a quicker , greener and eventually cheaper alternative to concrete and steel
one great bonus of the material is the speed of construction ; panels can be made to measure in the factory complete with openings , windows and doors
while the main advantages of working in wood are manifold -- it 's flexible , robust and easily worked -- green says wood may be the only material to address the growing problems of urbanization
" wood has not been an urban material so we looked at how it could be a contributor to urban environments , " he said
" there are a whole host of advantages
" steel and concrete have huge carbon footprints
concrete accounts for about 6 - 8 % of man 's greenhouse gas emissions , whereas wood stores carbon dioxide and gives us a vehicle to create carbon - neutral buildings
" the energy used to harvest wood , he said , is much less than the enormous amount required to produce concrete and steel
" there is no other building material that is grown by the sun , " he said
" we 've calculated that the north american forests grow enough wood for a 20 - story wood building every 8 - 10 minutes
" ultimately , building in wood , green argues , creates an economic incentive to plant more forests
" the climate story is really happening at both ends of the argument -- by using more wood we encourage countries around the world to plant more trees
" about 20 % of man 's carbon footprint comes from deforestation , this creates an important incentive for reforestation , " he said
in terms of carbon footprint , a 20 - story plyscraper put against its counterpart in concrete and steel is the equivalent of taking 900 cars off the road for a year , mga estimates
but the established nature of concrete and steel means that clt will not replace urban building materials overnight
concerns over fire and inherent problems with its acoustic qualities ( apartments need additional acoustic measures to keep noise from traveling ) have meant that the construction establishment has been slow to come to the party
in vienna , for example , the austrian fire services are working with architects to test their plans
" the main factor is that everyone wants to build higher and higher buildings
an 84 - meter - high building in europe is not usual and there are a lot of necessities that have to be realized , " fire service spokesman christian wegner told the guardian newspaper
" a few of us were upset because it was crazy to present an idea like this that has not been discussed with everyone yet
" they have to carry out special tests on the correct combination of concrete and wood
we also want to develop a more fail - safe sprinkler system
i expect they will pass the tests but if they develop the building as they say they will , it will be a serious project
" green counters that clt is as fire resistant as other new - builds made by traditional means and likens its ability to burn to trying to set a redwood on fire with a lit match , with any charring creating an insulation layer that protects the wood underneath
even so , the industry remains largely skeptical of a process that -- while having obvious advantages in terms of speed -- is still on par with steel and concrete construction in terms of cost
" it will become cheaper but it 's too new to be significantly less expensive , " green said , adding that the difficulty lies in competing with a well - honed and century - old system of designing , building and budgeting for concrete and steel
" the culture of building and the culture of developing buildings is very conservative , " he said
" the hardest part of my job is not the engineering and the design or the innovation , it 's really about changing the public 's perception of what 's possible
" ultimately , buildings of the future are likely to be a mixture of wooden components and concrete and steel ; combining the stability of concrete with the flexibility and speed of wood
leading timber specialist at the engineering group arup , lawrence , said that shear walls -- the core of tall buildings which provide stability against the lateral force of the wind or seismic activity -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel
however , the real savings from wood come when all the cost elements of making a tall building are taken into account
" clients are missing a trick with wood , " he said , adding that dollar - for - dollar as a pure construction material wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete
" what you need to do if you want an economic wood solution is to think about all the aspects from outset
" you will save on the program because it 's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially , if you 're making an office building , you can leave a lot of the wood exposed , saving on the cost and time of installing finishes
" apart from having a sustainable solution , lawrence says , clients will gain a building that looks good too
" if you leave the wood exposed , you can have a really nice environment inside the building , " he says
" there are studies that show that people are happier inside wood structures
