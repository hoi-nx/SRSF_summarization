spanish neuroscientists claim low alcohol red wine produces more brain activity in â taste processioning â areas , then stronger tipples
a stock image is shown you might imagine that stronger wine would pack more of a punch in the flavour department
but spanish neuroscientists claim that red wine with a low alcohol content produces more brain activity in â taste processioning â areas , then stronger tipples
while the low alcohol bottles may not contain more flavour per se , people pay more attention to â fruity bouquets â and â woody notes â so the wine appears to be tastier
neuroscientists led by frost , of the basque centre of cognition , brain and language in donostia-san sebastian , spanish , wrote in their study , published in the journal plos one : â over the last few decades , wine makers have been producing wines with a higher alcohol content , assuming that they are more appreciated by consumers
â to test this hypothesis , we used functional magnetic imaging to compare reactions of human subjects to different types of wine , focusing on brain regions critical for flavour processing and food reward
â they noted that 30 years ago , it was typical for red wines to contain around 12 per cent alcohol , while now quality tipples can be 15 per cent
this is because wine makers â seem to â¦ assume that strong wines are , on the average , more appreciated by wine consumers , â dr frost said , adding that they seem more intense , which is considered desirable by some foodies
to reveal that stronger wines are nât necessarily better , his team measured the brain activity of 21 volunteers in a fmri scanner
during the scan , the volunteers had the enviable task of sipping samples of different red wines where one was low alcohol and another stronger , but they tasted similar
the researchers measured the brain activity of 21 volunteers in a fmri scanner while they sipped red wine
they found : contrary to expectation , significantly greater activation was found for low - alcohol than for high - alcohol content wines in brain regions that are sensitive to taste intensity , including the insula as well as the cerebellum
an image from the study showing brain activity triggered by wine is shown â contrary to expectation , significantly greater activation was found for low - alcohol than for high - alcohol content wines in brain regions that are sensitive to taste intensity , including the insula as well as the cerebellum ' , the researchers wrote
in fact , there was no part of the brain that responded more strongly to the more alcoholic wine , meaning that strong wines â induce weaker activation relative to the low - alcohol content ones â
this may be because people paid more attention to the flavours of the less potent wine , even though they are not more flavourful themselves , discover magazine reported
the experts hypothesised : â the low - alcohol content wines induced a greater attentional orienting and exploration of the sensory attributes of wines relatively to high - alcohol content wines
â wine critics have previously said that new world , or high alcohol wines , often lack the finesse of less potent options , because the alcohol overpowers some of the more subtle aromas and flavours
â the findings raise intriguing possibilities for objectively testing hypotheses regarding methods of producing a highly complex product such as wine , â the researchers wrote

sutter home , korbel , franzia and trader joe 's charles shaw white zifandel , also known as ' two-buck chuck , ' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe
twenty - eight southern california wineries were listed in the complaint , which is asking for a halt in production of the wines in question
a new lawsuit claims dozens of cheap and popular california wine , including franzia and trader joe 's charles shaw white zifandel , are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic the lawsuit was filed by four individual southern california wine consumers who , according to their attorney kabateck , had 1,306 wines tested at a denver - based laboratory and then confirmed results with two additional laboratories
kabateck said 83 wines , almost all of which sell for below $ 10 a bottle , contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water
the environmental protection agency standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard
' this is a very serious public health concern , ' kabateck said
' we would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately
' ' if not voluntarily , we would ask the court to do it
