twitter is reportedly looking at ways to make money by selling people 's tweets to companies
these so - called ' data miners ' would use content to personalise services
twitter âs data strategy chief chris moody ( pictured ) said the data could also be used by police to gauge the mood of a football crowd , for example many websites and services already sell data to third - parties in this way , but mr chris moody wants to expand its potential
he gave one example of a grandparent travelling on a plane to see their newborn grandson
the airline would know of their impending trip from their tweets and when they arrive they would greet the user by name
twitter 's boss recently admitted the social network ' sucks ' at dealing with trolls and now the site is making good on its promise to clamp down on these abusive accounts
reports claim the site will start banning users who violate its rules by tracking email addresses and phone numbers
it also recently added new tools to make it easier for users to report abuse and send these reports to law enforcement
a gift - wrapped rattle would then be on the user 's seat
' you bring your data to us and we will ensure that your customers , if they exist on twitter - we can provide advertisements to them , ' explained the 48 - year - old
' twitter gives this fascinating ability to understand people in context like we âve never been able to do before
' he stressed that this would be done anonymously and no private information is shared
plus , unless tweets are protected , they can be searched for and viewed easily already
as a result there are firms that have developed their own mining software to extract information from tweets
many websites already sell data to third - parties in this way but mr chris moody wants to expand its potential
