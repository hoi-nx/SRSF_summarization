the first video of emwazi - identified last week as isis executioner jihadi john - has emerged the first footage of isis executioner jihadi john as a shy teenage schoolboy has emerged
the video shows emwazi , identified last week as the islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in syria , being chosen by a classmate to join in with a game of lunchtime football
the previously - unseen footage was filmed 11 years ago at qunitin kynaston academy , the secondary school in st john 's wood , north london , where emwazi was educated
the friendly kickabout is the first moving image to have been obtained of emwazi before he became the isis 's depraved executioner - in - chief
in the film , obtained by channel 4 news , the ' football mad ' teenager , thought to be around 15 at the time , is the second person to be chosen for the team
one of his fellow pupils can be clearly heard shouting ' football mad ' emwazi ' , beckoning over the future jihadi
but he also appears to be painfully shy , instantly raising his arm to cover his face when he knew the camera was focusing on him
channel 4 news said emwazi had been identified in the video by two different people that he knew at the time
the footage , filmed in may 2004 , was broadcast this evening , after it emerged that the executioner had dumped two schoolboys on the m1 at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother
according to a former friend of his brother omar , emwazi and two bearded associates abducted two gang members in 2008 , while he was living on the notorious mozart estate in west london
after viewing the footage , diane foley , the mother of american journalist james foley , told jon snow it was ' frightening ' that a ' promising young person who had many gifts ' could use his talents for ' such evil '
she said : ' it 's very frightening he would end up filled with such hate
that 's very disturbing to me that young people would be attracted to such hate ? ' she added that the fact jihadi john had been identified did not help to bring her closure
she said : ' if it had not been that young man , then i 'm afraid it would have been someone else
i think it 's tragic for that young man and his family - it 's just so sad and we must do more to protect our young people from the lies that have instilled so much hate and brutality
' since being identified , emwazi has emerged as a fun - loving young boy , who adored the simpsons , playstation games and eating chips
he was also said to have wanted to become a premier league star , scoring goals for manchester united by the age of 30
the entries showed no sign he would go on to become the world 's most wanted man , who is believed to have beheaded a string of hostages in the name of islam
but , a decade later , emwazi had shunned british life and was a ' known wolf ' to mi5 , having already taken the path towards becoming isis ' most notorious murderer
in a chilling twist , in a school yearbook from when he was 10 , emwazi lists his favourite computer game as shooting game ' duke nukem : time to kill ' and his favourite book as ' how to kill a monster ' from the popular children 's goosebumps series
he also lists his favourite band as pop group s club 7 , and when asked what he wants to be when he is 30 , writes : ' i will be in a football team and scoring a goal
' emwazi also listed his favourite colour as blue , his favourite animal as a monkey , his favourite cartoon as the simpsons and chips as his favourite food
earlier this week , it emerged emwazi was bullied as a schoolboy at the school in which the film was made
emwazi , pictured as a schoolboy , was said to have wanted to become a premier league star , scoring goals for manchester united by the age of 30 the terrorist has been on the radar of mi5 since may 2009 , when it is thought he tried to reach somalia to join islamist terror group al shabaab former headteacher jo shuter told radio 4 's today programme : ' he had adolescent issues
particularly at that age , for the boys , it is a time when the hormones start raging , and he had some issues with being bullied which we dealt with
' by the time he got into the sixth - form he was , to all intents and purposes , a hard - working aspirational young man who went on to the university that he wanted to go to
' after arriving in british when he was six years old , the extremist appeared to embrace british life , playing football in the affluent streets of london while supporting manchester united
he had moved to british in 1993 , settling in the north - west london suburbs of maida vale and queens park
neighbours recalled a polite , quietly spoken boy who was studious at his church of england school , where he was the only muslim pupil in his class
he went to mosque with his family , who spoke arabic to each other , but wore western clothing and became popular with his british classmates at st mary magdalene church of england primary school in maida vale , london
the footage was filmed at quintin kynaston academy school in st john 's wood , north london , where emwazi attended secondary school and was said to have been bullied he was also described as ' calm and decent ' and ' the best employee we ever had ' by an it firm for whom he worked in kuwait
but , at some point during his lifetime , emwazi was radicalised and was soon on the radar of mi5
it emerged today that the home office could face fresh questions over border controls after it is thought that emwazi used a well - worn route to leave the british
the 26 - year - old a university graduate from queen 's park , london , was able to flee to syria despite being on an mi5 watchlist and being monitored by scotland yard 's counter-terrorism command
he had been watched by the services since may 2009 , when it is thought he tried to reach somalia to join islamist terror group al shabaab
emwazi flew to tanzania with friends apparently on a safari - but was arrested by police upon landing in dar es salaam and sent back to british
en route he stopped in amsterdam , where he claimed to have been accused by an mi5 officer of trying to reach somalia , home of the militant group al shabaab
emwazi claimed to have been harassed and intimidated by security services - and even complained to the independent police complaints commission
he alleged an agent from mi5 knew ' everything about me ; where i lived , what i did , and the people i hanged around with ' and claimed the organisation attempted to ' turn ' him to work for them

â [ gang members ] threw a brick at my head and broke my arm
omar was punched in the face a few times and beaten up
â the next day emwazi turned up with two religious guys with beards
