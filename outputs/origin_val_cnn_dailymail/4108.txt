women who suffered horrific acid attacks in pakistan - often for doing nothing more than spurning a man 's advances - have found themselves shunned by society and struggling to find work as result of their facial disfigurement
now a surgeon from a britain clinic hopes he can help them improve their appearance and rebuild their lives by giving them pioneering hair transplants
surgeon asim shahmalak , 53 , from cheadle , manchester , has spent Â£ 50,000 of his own money performing reconstructive surgery on six women who have been disfigured

shockingly , one six - year - old girl had been doused with acid by her father for refusing to go to school but was still too young for dr asim shahmalak to help
one of the women he was able to treat was kanwal ashar , 24 , who had acid thrown over her by a man who had been stalking her after she had turned down his proposal
she had been working in a beauty salon and the man became obsessed with her
dr asim shahmalak gave her two new eyebrows and a right eyelash with hair transplanted for the back of her head in a series of intricate operations performed over three days
she had struggled to find work since the attack four years ago and she hopes that the surgery will help rebuild her life
she told dr asim shahmalak : ' i can go to a wedding now and show my face now i have got my eyebrows back
you have changed my life

he performed the first eyelash transplant in the britain on a manchester woman back in 2009
as well as carrying out the transplants in karachi , he helped train local doctors and technicians in his techniques so that his work could carry on at local hospitals on his return to britain
last week , the doctor returned to karachi to meet the women and review all the surgery he had performed last year
he said : ' it was wonderful to meet the women again and see how their lives had been improved by the surgery
' i wept when i first heard what had happened to them
their stories were heartbreaking - scarred for life because you want to better yourself and work as an air hostess

' it was incredibly moving to see the smiles on their faces after we performed the surgery
they had given up hope of ever getting help because the government in pakistan can not afford to do anything for them
we were their last hope
' they are not accepted by society because of their disfigurement
they can not get jobs and , in some case , they have been disowned by their families and left to beg on the streets
' they are too frightened of reprisals to tell the police who has attacked them and even if they did , they have no faith that the culprits will be brought to justice
' dr asim shahmalak , a former nhs general surgeon , said that he had investigated the availability of sulphuric acid while he was in karachi and found it could be bought for as little as 15p a bottle near to where he performed surgery on the women
he said : ' it easy to buy with no questions asked
and as long as the authorities turn a blind eye to horrific cases like these , the attacks will continue
' dr asim shahmalak , a father - of - two , worked with the karachi - based charity smile again which had found patients needing surgery
they have identified five new cases who the doctor will return to treat later this year
he said : ' there is so much more work to do
i am just glad that i am able to make a difference to these women 's lives
