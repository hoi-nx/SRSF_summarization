do n't get me wrong , i am not marouane fellaini âs biggest fan , but if manchester united are to win on sunday then he is going to have a big role to play
you would never have believed at the start of the season that he would become manchester united âs go - to man but he has knuckled down , worked hard and is now one of louis van gaal âs most effective players
here âs why ... target man 2,251 - burnley 2,241 - qpr 2,226 - manchester united manchester united have played the third-most long balls this season , so this is not the skilful , free - flowing team of previous years
but with marouane fellaini it is an effective tactic
he has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season â far more than any other manchester united man â and crystal palace âs mile jedinak is the only midfielder to win more headers per game
his power in the air is vital for providing knock - downs for the likes of wayne rooney and juan mata to collect
liverpool must also track his runs into the box because manchester united will try to find him as often as they can
marouane fellaini , pictured during training , has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season marouane fellaini is a powerful player that has become a key part of louis van gaal 's manchester united team this season power play one thing is for sure with marouane fellaini , you know you âre in a game with him
martin skrtel , emre can and mamadou sakho are big , physical players but they will have a battle on their hands
marouane fellaini gives away on average 2.1 free - kicks per game â that âs the fifth - highest rate in the league and shows you what a fighter he is
it âs not pretty , but it unsettles defences
manchester united midfielder marouane fellaini will not be afraid to get physical with liverpool 's players at anfield touch of class marouane fellaini 's game is not all about power
like peter crouch , he âs portrayed as a bit of a lurch when actually his technique is good
just look at that controlled finish with his left foot to open the scoring against tottenham
he might not be the creative genius to win manchester united titles , but he has become a useful weapon for van gaal
marouane fellaini lets rip a shot with his left foot as he makes it 1 - 0 against tottenham at old trafford marouane fellaini has been a useful weapon for van gaal and was on form against tottenham in manchester united 's 3 - 0 win marouane fellaini celebrates his goal for manchester united in this brilliant photograph taken by sportsmail 's ian hodgson forward thinking it was painful viewing last season seeing marouane fellaini play in a deep midfield role
david moyes wanted him as protection for his defence , but marouane fellaini turns like a cruise liner and it was easy for teams to press him
playing further forward , it does nât matter if he loses possession as there is no immediate danger and he can provide an attacking threat of his own
marouane fellaini has been allowed to play further forward for manchester united under van gaal , unlike under david moyes elbow room marouane fellaini is a real nuisance player
he âs like a daddy longlegs â all arms and legs as he wrestles and grapples to get himself into position
he gets his elbows up high , which makes him very difficult to mark , and it âs hard to get players around him
it âs that physicality that would make me tempted to start steven gerrard on sunday
not for sentimental reasons , but because he would offer a vital shield against marouane fellaini âs threat
head and shoulders : marouane fellaini is van gaal âs key player marouane fellaini has become van gaal 's key player and he will likely be a nuisance for liverpool on sunday
