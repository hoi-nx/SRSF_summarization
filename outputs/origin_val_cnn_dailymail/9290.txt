former texas gov. perry compared legal america immigrants to cardboard boxes on saturday , bringing some in a des moines , iowa audience to shake their head sin disbelief
. he said at the ag summit , a testing ground for potential presidential candidates , that the america should be able to track holders of work visas the way shipping companies track parcels
' i 'm telling you , ' perry said , ' if ups can track a box all around the world and know exactly where it is 24/7 , we can give people a card and allow them in here , and say that when you hit your visa limit from the time to be in this country , we 're going to know where you are
' ' we 're going to let you know that your time 's up
' ' you 're outta here ' : former texas gov. perry said the america government should track foreign guest workers like ups tracks packages and deport them when their permits expire perry spoke at the 2015 ag summit , a testing ground for presidential hopefuls , in des moines , iowa scan it : ups keeps track of millions of packages around the world every day , far more than the hundreds of thousands of h1-b immigrants in the country legally at any given time while some applauded , others grimaced
most speakers during the morning session had harsh words for president obama 's recent immigration executive actions , which promise to guarantee 5 million or more illegal immigrants that they wo n't be deported through the end of his white house term

he hinted that a perry administration in washington would focus on ' bringing people into this country that we need , whether it 's high - tech workers , or people in agriculture , hospitality or construction
' and , he added , the government would have to be ' able to identify these people â keep up with them
' perry did n't say what kind of technology he advocated for keeping track of legal immigrants

' other categories include ' specialty occupations ' such as fashion modeling and healthcare work

perry also hammered the obama administration for appointing ron klain as his ebola czar â ' a political spokesperson for al gore ! ' and he complained that america 's longest border with mexico , in his home state of texas , has been left largely undefended during the obama years
' i 've got some experience with this , ' he said
