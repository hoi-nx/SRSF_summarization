playtime : a couple of thick - skinned surfers in alaska were caught on camera as they went head to head with the local pros ; sea lions dressed for the weather : the two unidentified men were spotted of the rocky coast of shrine of st. therese in juneau as they paddled alongside the large creatures in near freezing conditions catch me if you can : in one shot a surfer leads the way as the seals trail behind him and in another the animals inquisitively watch as the humans pass them by picture pro : the unusual scene was captured by 55 - year - old danish photographer , birger baastrup career high : the cameraman says in alaska he sees a lot of wildlife , but spotting the sea lions was ' extra special ' but it was only when he âd zoomed in on his camera that he noticed the unlikely panel of spectators bobbing in the water
incredibly , the sea lions seemed to enjoy the show so much that they stayed nearly two hours but decided to keep their distance
recalling the incident birger baastrup said : ' when i got there the surfers and sea lions were already there
' the sea lions repeatedly stuck their heads or large part of their body out of the water to watch these surfers and what they were doing
' i have observed surfers at this location many times before but never with this amount of sea lions and around and i âve never seen them this curious
' i think the surfers were trying to ignore the sea lions but we were also just careful that they did not come too close
' the sea lions did nât interact with the surfers from what i saw , they can get quite territorial so that could potentially not be a good thing
' here in alaska we see a lot of wildlife , which is one of the reasons i love living here , so it âs not a surprise to see sea lions , however , these were extra special
