baby girls from well - off districts can expect to enjoy good health for nearly 20 years longer than those in the poorest towns and suburbs , according to an official analysis
it found that a newborn girl in one of the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas will live 71.3 years before her life is limited by chronic illness or disability
but a girl born in one of the bottom 10 per cent of the most deprived areas can expect only 52.4 years of life in good health
lottery : babies born living in the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas can expect to live up to 20 years longer without disability or chronic illness , than those in poorer areas
baby girls in wealthy areas can expect to live healthy lives the longest the difference means the well - off girl is likely to have a healthy life more than a third longer than that of a girl from a poor district
the figures for boys are highly similar , according to the findings charted by the office of national statistics
they provoked protests from poverty pressure groups , which compared health inequality in britain with health levels in third world countries , and complained that the wealth gap is now dragging down the health of the entire britain population
world health organisation figures on healthy life expectancy appear to show that men and women in rwanda can expect to live healthily to 55 and 56 respectively

poor health : baby boys born in the most deprived areas of britain have the worst prospects having just 52.2 years of healthy living the office of national statistics findings for the britain say that healthy life expectancy is at its worst in the very poorest areas of the country â usually those with high levels of worklessness , benefit dependency and alcohol , tobacco and drug consumption â and that for four fifths of the population the health gap between the best off and the rest is much less marked
the figures were calculated from the ons annual population survey which checks on the lives of 320,000 people a year
for men , it said that boys born in the most deprived suburbs can expect 52.2 years of good health , compared to 70.5 years for those born in the best - off areas
it said that if the figures were adjusted by measures designed to take into account income across the population rather than just in extremely poor or rich districts , the gaps were wider â 19.5 years for women as opposed to 18.9 , and 19.1 years for men as opposed to 18.3
the office of national statistics figures showed that , above the poorest fifth of areas , newborn girls can all expect almost 60 years of healthy life or more , and boys more than 58 years
