a leopard was given a very prickly reception after it tried to make lunch out of a plucky porcupine
the predator was put firmly in its place after the spiky creature refused to back down during a fight in kruger national park , south africa
concern for the porcupine - armed with sharp quills - soon faded as it put on an aggressive show and proved more than a match for the confused leopard
wildlife enthusiast moolman , 41 , caught the bizarre battle while out on the road and armed with her camera
wildlife enthusiast moolman , 41 , caught the bizarre battle while out on the road and armed with her camera looking slightly uncertain , the predator sizes up his opponent for dinner , pacing from side to side as he decides the best course of attack but concern for the porcupine - armed with sharp quills - soon fades as it put on an aggressive show and proved more than a match for the confused leopard the amusing pictures show the sharp skirmish with the spotted cat
she had been driving along the road when she saw the leopard dart across
minutes later the leopard and porcupine tumbled out of the bushes and began to fight
ms moolman said : ' the porcupine was a worthy opponent
it was quite aggressive and shaking its quills , raising them to appear larger
' the leopard was certainly inexperienced
reluctant to give up the fight , the leopard prowls after his plucky opponent , eyeing up his armour for a weak spot but it seems he has been outwitted by the spikey warrior , who scuttles off after delivery a prickly blow to the leopard 's paw the battle over , the leopard lies on the ground and gives up as the porcupine walks away unscathed
ms moolman stayed with the battling creatures for twenty minutes before the leopard gave up and walked off to lick its wound on its front leg the porcupine raises its sharp quills in victory
